40|$|Banks {{will want}} to {{influence}} the bank regulator to favor their interests, and they typically {{have the means to}} do so. It is shown that such "regulatory capture" in banking does not imply ineffectual regulation; a "captured" regulator may impose very tight, costly prudential requirements to reduce negative spillovers of risk-taking by weaker banks. In these circumstances, differences in the regulatory regime across jurisdictions may persist because each adapts its regulations to suit its dominant incumbent institutions.

The authors find a significant and positive relationship between bank soundness (measured with Moody''s financial strength ratings) and {{compliance with}} principles related to information provision 2. Specifically, countries that require banks to regularly and accurately report their financial data to regulators and market participants have sounder banks. This relationship is robust to controlling for broad indexes of institutional quality, macroeconomic variables, sovereign ratings, and reverse causality. Measuring soundness through Z-scores yields similar results. These findings {{emphasize the importance of}} transparency in making supervisory processes effective and strengthening market discipline.

Moreover, it adds to the debate on fair value accounting and its effects on <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> for banks and insurance compan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} a {{tractable}} model which illuminates problems relating to individual bank behaviour, to possible contagious inter-relationships between banks, {{and to the}} appropriate design of <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> and incentives to limit `excessive' risk-taking. Our model is rich enough to include heterogeneous agents, endogenous default, and multiple commodity, and credit and deposit markets. Yet, it is simple enough to be effectively computable and can therefore {{be used as a}} practical framework to analyse financial fragility. Financial fragility in our model emerges naturally as an equilibrium phenomenon. Among other results, a non-trivial quantity theory of money is derived, liquidity and default premia co-determine interest rates, and both regulatory and monetary policies have non-neutral effects. The model also indicates how monetary policy may affect financial fragility, thus highlighting the trade-off between financial stability and economic efficiency. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, The Financial Services Authority (FSA) [...] was {{formerly}} the regulating authority for most {{aspects of the}} EU's Payment Services Directive (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created {{a new class of}} regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements.</b> Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.|$|R
50|$|Within this {{framework}} the previous CRD {{was divided into}} two legislative instruments: a directive governing the access to deposit-taking activities and a regulation establishing the <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> institutions need to respect. While Member States have transposed the directive into national law, the regulation is directly applicable, which means that it creates law that takes immediate effect in all Member States {{in the same way}} as a national instrument, without any further action on the part of the national authorities. This removes the major sources of national divergences. It also makes the regulatory process faster and makes it easier to react to change market conditions. It increases transparency, as one rule as written in the regulation will apply across the single market. A regulation is subject to the same political decision making process as a directive at European level, ensuring full democratic control.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new model of the {{liquidity}} driven banking system focusing on overnight interbank loans. This significant branch of the interbank market is commonly neglected in the banking system modeling and systemic risk analysis. We construct a model where banks are allowed to use both the interbank and the securities markets to manage their liquidity demand and supply as driven by <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> in a volatile environment. The network of interbank loans is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how only the intrasystem cash fluctuations, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, what may be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also analyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on the interbank market resilience. We confirm that central bank's asset purchase programs, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully stabilize bank's liquidity demand. The model can be used to analyze the interbank market impact of macroprudential tools...|$|R
40|$|On 4 July 2012, the Regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories (known as "EMIR") - European Market Infrastructure Regulation) {{was adopted}} and entered into force on 16 August 2012. The Regulation {{requires}} standard derivative contracts {{to be cleared}} through Central Counterparties (CCPs) as well as margins for uncleared trades and establishes stringent organizational, business conduct and <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> for these CCPs. The regulation also ensures that information on all European derivative transactions will be reported to trade repositories and be accessible to supervisory authorities, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to give policy makers and supervisors a clear overview {{of what is going}} on in the markets. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to perform a complex analysis of the impact of EMIR. The first part focuses on empirical research of the regulation. In the second part results of a data analysis from both quantitative and qualitative approach are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{globalisation}} {{process that}} has interested the banking sector in the last decades was significantly fostered by the three founding pillars of the Basel framework: the home country control based on consolidated supervision, risk-sensitive <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements,</b> and the core principles for effective banking supervision. The present paper analyses whether {{the principle of the}} home country control is coherent with the large discretion with which national supervisors have implemented Basel’s prudential regulation. The complexity of global banks, too big to be supervised and resolved, inevitably generates regulatory coordination failures. The increasing mistrust of host countries in the ability and willingness of the home countries authorities to protect their national interests represents a serious threat to the sustainability of bank globalisation. An effective and binding convergence on the mechanisms and processes for managing and resolving the crises of cross-border banks seems destined to remain the unsolved problem of the Basel rules.     JEL Codes: G 28, G 01, G 18, F 33  </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} pre-crisis bank {{characteristics}} explain state support to European banks during {{the global financial}} crisis. We show that, before the crisis, supported and non-supported banks differ in numerous aspects and the differences reflect bank characteristics {{at the core of}} the regulatory agenda. In particular, bank size and the related too-big-to-fail concerns play a dominant role in explaining state support in Europe. Furthermore, our results suggest that income diversification produces a decline in the expected bailout costs for public finance in large banks and an increase of these costs in small and medium banks. The decline observed for large banks is nevertheless lower than the expected additional bailout costs generated by the presence of these banks in the financial system. Our findings highlight the importance of ad hoc <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> and cross-country resolution regimes for large European banks and justify the introduction of regulatory restrictions on income diversification if applied to banks of small and medium size or if they lead to a significant decrease in the size of large bank...|$|R

The policy response cannot come from the European Central Bank but, instead, must consist of regulatory responses capable of dispelling the uncertainty over future <b>prudential</b> capital <b>requirements</b> while also temporarily suspending the rules on state aid cum bail-in that had ignited the crisis...|$|R
40|$|What is the {{position}} of Europe [...] and specifically the European Union (EU) [...] on the world map of global finances in 2017 ? The paper seeks {{to answer this question}} by focusing on three key issues. First, it analyzes Europe’s post- 2008 bank bailouts, its sector-wide rescue packages, and its consequential sovereign-debt crisis. Second, it considers the role of the international credit rating agencies and asks why Europe does not have a large rating agency of its own. Third, it assesses the EU’s major recent regulatory developments related to the financial sector. There is no doubt that Europe is in a sustained economic and political crisis; the question of interest is whether the EU is responding by adopting reforms that will make it economically stronger and more united. The paper concludes that some of the EU’s post- 2008 reforms [...] such as enhanced consumer protection, stress testing and stricter <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> [...] have been in line with international regulatory tendencies, but that slow and expensive decision-making, member states’ failure to compromise on fundamental issues, and misguided rules for bank resolution and supervision have harmed the EU’s global competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Credit {{derivatives}} are {{tools for}} the full or partial transfer of credit risk. The shocks of H 2 2001 have neither seriously affected {{the rapid growth of}} these risk transfer transactions nor the increasing diversification of participants on the credit derivatives market. Nevertheless, banks, as well as insurers and reinsurers, must factor the risks inherent in these products into their day-to-day risk management, and especially into their internal control systems. And while financial institutions’ robust and apposite risk management systems will continue to form the first line of defence against the risks associated with using credit derivatives, the supervisory authorities have erected a second line by introducing specific <b>prudential</b> <b>requirements</b> for these products. This double line of defence against the multiple risks generated by the use of credit derivatives must be further fortified to cope with new developments and risks, even though the market appears to have weathered recent events, including 11 September, Enron’s bankruptcy and the Argentine crisis, relatively well. In any case, these risks are spurring market participants to make credit derivatives more efficient and secure across all financial sectors, at both the domestic and the international level, as part of ongoing efforts to bolster financial stability. ...|$|R
