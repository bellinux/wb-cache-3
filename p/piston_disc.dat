50|$|U60 - 90 Series (1984-1994)The first BU-series (Dyna 200/300/400, 1984-88) used quad round headlights. 1989 onwards models had quad {{rectangular}} headlights and {{one piece}} door glass with new {{interior door trim}} & other minor interior changes. All wide cab models had a centrally mounted roof vent and had 3 windscreen wipers. 3.4-litre 3B, 3.4-litre (direct injected) 13B and 3.7-litre 14B diesel engines with direct injection {{were used in the}} Dyna 200 and Dyna 300, a 5-speed gearbox was standard. The Dyna 300 was equipped with an exhaust brake. Front, ventilated twin <b>piston</b> <b>disc</b> brakes were optional on the first series wide cab Dyna 300. In Portugal, the 3B-engined Dyna 250 (BU84) was assembled locally.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda Ascot, {{designated}} FT500'82, {{was sold}} in 1982 in the colors Monza Red or Black. The tank stripes and the [...] "FT500" [...] decal were gray and silver on the red bike and red and orange on the black bike. The speedometer was limited to 85 mph (135 km/h). The headlight was rectangular and so were the instruments. The engine was a 498 cc SOHC, 4-valve single-cylinder with 8.6:1 compression ratio, and one carburetor. The transmission was a 5-speed (1st=2.462:1 2nd=1.647:1 3rd=1.250:1 4th=1.000:1 5th=0.840:1). Stock gearing is 15/42(3.71:1). The brakes were single <b>piston</b> <b>disc</b> front and rear. The motorcycle had a top speed over 85 mph and achieved an average fuel economy of 48 mpg. The serial numbers began with JH2PC0708CM000019.|$|E

5000|$|The all-new Blazer was {{introduced}} in 1994 as a 1995 model year. This time, it lost the S-10 prefix for simpler identification due to the full-size K5 Blazer being discontinued (the GMT400-based Blazer was rebadged as the Tahoe; the Tahoe package which was the base trim for past S10s was redesignated as the LS. The Blazer was Playboy magazine's Truck of the Year for 1995 and was also the unanimous winner of the Motor Trend 1995 Truck of the Year. Exterior and interior size were increased, bumping {{it up to a}} mid-sized SUV. [...] A drivers air bag came, but a passenger airbag wasn't immediately introduced. This Blazer appealed to more customers because of the less rugged appearance and rounded styling, and many storage spaces- a key feature for families. It was available with the 4.3 L V6 engine only, and most models featured four-wheel drive via an electronic transfer case; 1997 was the last year a manual transfer case for 4 wheel drive (floor shifter for 4 wheel drive) was offered.In 1998, the interior and exterior received some cosmetic changes. The makeover offered a new dashboard with larger buttons and more ergonomically correct driving controls, as well as larger door handles, and head rests for the rear bench. A passenger airbag is now standard. A front grille similar to the Chevrolet C/K pickup line's stacked-headlight system replaced the older single-headlight system, similar to the full size GMT400 trucks. 4 wheel disc brakes became standard equipment, fitted with aluminum dual piston calipers (the front disc brakes were redesigned with the dual piston calipers and 11" [...] diameter brake rotors (steering knuckles now have sealed hub assemblies) while the truck models retained the 1978-era single <b>piston</b> <b>disc</b> brakes originally sourced and shared from GM's G-body lineup). In 1999, new folding mirrors replaced the old folding mirrors. 2000 saw new front bumpers and the trim running along the sides and bumpers was removed. For the 2001 model year, the truck received a new center console.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} fluid buffer with adjustable damping coefficient, it includes: cylinder tank {{which has a}} placing space, the placing space is filled with fluid; piston which is equipped with piston head moving in the placing space and the piston bar extending from the piston head to two ends of the tank body. The piston head is equipped {{with at least one}} fluid channel passing through the piston head and the piston head consists of at least one piston discs. The <b>piston</b> <b>disc</b> includes: the disc plate which is equipped with the via hole forming the fluid channel; the valve which is installed on the disc body and can be moved from the first position opening the via hole to the second position closing the via hole, and vice versa; the driver which controls the movements of valve through the deformation of from memory alloy, thereby opens or closes said fluid channel to adjust the number of damping force.

50|$|There are {{two common}} {{approaches}} to flow measurement, displacement and velocity, each {{making use of}} a variety of technologies. Common displacement designs include oscillating <b>piston</b> and nutating <b>disc</b> meters. Velocity-based designs include single- and multi-jet meters and turbine meters.|$|R
50|$|Disc brakes rely on {{pliability}} of caliper {{seals and}} slight runout to release pads, leading to drag, fuel mileage loss, and disc scoring. Drum brake return springs give more positive action and, adjusted correctly, often have less drag when released. It is however possible to design special seals that retract the <b>piston</b> on a <b>disc</b> brake.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{hydraulic}} cylinders, something {{forces a}} piston {{to move in}} the desired direction. The <b>piston</b> is a <b>disc</b> or cylinder, and the piston rod transfers the force it develops to the object to be moved. [...] Engineers sometimes prefer to use pneumatics because they are quieter, cleaner, and do not require large amounts of space for fluid storage.|$|R
40|$|Every year, clean, readily {{available}} water {{becomes more and}} more scarce. Metering water usage is a way to make users more aware of how much water they use, which in turn will increase the desire to conserve water and to reduce their water bill. When meters are tested in their new condition, it is normally performed under ideal laboratory conditions at constant flow rates. Then when the meters are installed in the field, they often are installed in or experience non-recommended conditions that are quite different from the ideal laboratory setting. This study investigated several non-recommended conditions that can exist in a distribution system. The conditions that were simulated were endurance (the study of accuracy as a function of meter throughput), installation (the study of accuracy as a function of upstream piping and meter mounting effects), and flow profile (the study of accuracy as a result of dynamic real world flow variances over time). The meter types that were tested in this study were displacement <b>piston,</b> nutating <b>disc,</b> multi-jet, single-jet, fluidic oscillator, magnetic, and ultrasonic. When comparing the results between the meter types it was found that some meter types were more susceptible than others to the conditions that were simulated.

40|$|A <b>piston</b> is a <b>disc</b> which reciprocates {{within a}} cylinder. It is either {{moved by the}} fluid or it moves the fluid which enters the cylinder. The main {{function}} of the piston of an IC engine is to receive the impulse from the expanding gas and to transmit the energy to the crankshaft through the connecting rod. The piston must also disperse {{a large amount of}} heat from the combustion chamber to the cylinder walls. Piston is made of cast aluminum because of its high heat transfer rate. One important thing to take care while using it (cast aluminum) is, because it expands appreciably on heating so right amount of clearance needs to be provided or else it will lead the engine to seize.

50|$|Early {{versions}} had conventional suspension, {{consisting of}} hydraulically damped telescoping front forks and dual coil-over shocks at the rear. Later versions had air-assisted forks and featured Honda's Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension. US bikes (except GL500I, GL650I and Turbo) were {{equipped with a}} single front disc brake whereas all other bike possess dual front disc brakes. Besides the 'vanilla' CX500B, models after 1980 sport dual piston calipers replacing the single piston caliper of the earlier models. For the Turbo and Eurosport models the rear drum was replaced with a dual <b>piston</b> caliper and <b>disc.</b> All models feature steel tube frames with a large backbone, with the engine used as a stressed member. The dual shock models use a single tube backbone whereas the later Pro-Link models employed a triple tube backbone.|$|R

Once completed, {{the cars were}} still about 70% stock with the other 30% made up of parts from the VW parts bin, one-off brackets and mounts, and race prepping from outside parties. The cars feature VW's DSG twin shaft, dual clutch automatic transmission and have height adjustable Sachs race suspension. Brakes were controlled by an ATE Racing ABS system and utilize Brembo 4 piston fixed calipers in front and Lucas 1 <b>piston</b> floating caliper <b>disc</b> brakes in the rear.

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} micrographs of {{the teeth}} and sections and dissections {{of the head}} {{have been used to}} describe the functional interrelationships between the dentition and associated cartilages, muscles and ligaments in adults of the southern hemisphere lamprey Geotria australis. These studies, together with manipulation of the <b>piston</b> and oral <b>disc</b> in living specimens, elucidated the probable feeding mechanism in this species. The main cutting action appears to result from a scissoring movement brought about by the rapid interlocking of the three sharp and stout cusps of the transverse lingual lamina with large grooves on the rear face of the supraoral lamina. The movement of excised flesh back through the oral passage to the pharynx would be facilitated by the action of the pair of strongly cuspid longitudinal lingual laminae. The unique oral disc teeth of G. australis are apparently adapted to allow the disc to slide forward over the host and yet restrict any tendency to slip backwards...|$|R
50|$|The ADO16 (Amalgamated Drawing Office {{project number}} 16) was {{designed}} by Alec Issigonis. Following his success with the Mini, Issigonis set out to design a larger and more sophisticated car which incorporated more advanced features and innovations. In common with the Mini, the ADO16 was designed around the BMC A-Series engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels. As well as single <b>piston</b> swinging caliper <b>disc</b> brakes at the front, which were not common on mass-produced cars in the early 1960s, the ADO16 featured a Hydrolastic interconnected fluid suspension system designed by Alex Moulton. The mechanically interconnected Citroen 2CV suspension was assessed in the mid-1950s by Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton (according to an interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), and was an inspiration {{in the design of}} the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyre in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. Pininfarina, the Italian styling studio which had worked with BMC before on the Austin A40 Farina, was commissioned to style the car. ADO16 had comparable interior space to the larger Ford Cortina.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{emissions}} from a four <b>piston</b> opposed calliper <b>disc</b> brake are investigated using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. The brake, as used on a substantial off road vehicle, was mounted on a semi-rigid test rig with mirrors mounted to provide {{a view of the}} disc and sides of the calliper and pads. A self generated braking noise of 2750 Hz was investigated and it may be seen that the pads behave in a similar manner but 180 „a out-of-phase. The disc is seen to exhibit a 4 diameter mode order during noise generation and a series of time related holograms show that this mode rotates around the disc, in the direction of rotation, at a rate related to the noise frequency divided by the disc mode order. The rate is not uniform, more periodic, which gives rise to a variation in disc vibration amplitude. This mode movement is in keeping with other holographic work where a sliding fist type calliper was investigated during noise generation at 10750 Hz. The rate of movement is typical of two waveforms travelling in opposite directions, one significantly stronger than the other. Additional work with the brake includes a noise matrix test using a variety of friction materials and noise fix shims where it is demonstrated that a full face shim proves most effective in reducing nois...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-silicon alloys are notable {{materials}} {{owing to}} their fine thermal conductivity, low expansion coefficient and good corrosion {{that can be}} utilized {{in the fields of}} automotive industry such as cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, brake <b>discs,</b> <b>pistons</b> and valve lifters. Modification of melt treatment in Al-Si cast alloys leads to a change in the morphology of eutectic silicon, resulting in mechanical properties enhancement. This enhancement affects the machinability of Al-Si alloys (i. e. cutting forces, surface roughness, tool wear and chip morphology). Near-eutectic alloys are the most difficult to machine of the various Al-Si alloys because, the silicon phase present is almost ten times harder than the aluminum base alloy, which rapidly increases tool wear, these difficulties have thus created the need for a more in-depth understanding of the effects of microstructure on the machinability of these alloys. Compared with other techniques, melt treatment with addition of inoculation agents known as modifier or refiner elements is more practical method due to low production cost and suitability for general engineering applications. Despite previous studies on microstructure of Al-Si alloys, there is lack of information on the effect of Bi, Sb and Sr additions that extensively address the influence of these elements on machinability characteristics of Al- 11 Si- 2 Cu cast alloy when dry turning. Understanding the machinability of these alloys is imperative when it is necessary to fabricate some industrial products which are produced by casting process. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the machinability characteristics of Al- 11 Si 2 Cu alloy containing bismuth, antimony and strontium when dry turning using coated carbide inserts. The influence of additional elements on mechanical properties was also investigated by conducting hardness, tensile and impact tests. iv Machining of workpieces was completed using a CNC turning machine (ALPHA 1350 S) with an 8. 3 kW power drive. Various cutting speeds of 70, 130 and 250 m/min and various feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/rev were employed. Pure Bi shots, pure Sb and Sr granules at concentrations of 1 wt. ...|$|R
