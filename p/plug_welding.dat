These areas are found by non-destructive examination both after welding and after proof testing. Current techniques for repairing typically small (< 0. 25) defects weaken the weldment, rely heavily on welders' skill, and are costly.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{system of}} tooling, machinery, and control equipment would {{be capable of}} performing any of several friction stir welding (FSW) and friction <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> (FPW) operations. These operations would include the following: Basic FSW; FSW with automated manipulation of the length of the pin tool in real time [the so-called auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability]; Self-reacting FSW (SRFSW); SR-FSW with APT capability and/or real-time adjustment of the distance between the front and back shoulders; and Friction <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> (FPW) [more specifically, friction push plug welding] or friction pull <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> (FPPW) to close out the keyhole of, or to repair, an FSW or SR-FSW weld. Prior FSW and FPW systems have been capable of performing one or two of these operations, but none has thus far been capable of performing all of them. The proposed system would include a common tool that would have APT capability for both basic FSW and SR-FSW. Such a tool was described in Tool for Two Types of Friction Stir Welding (MFS- 31647 - 1), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 30, No. 10 (October 2006), page 70.

40|$|NASA fs Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{recently}} invested {{much time and}} effort into the process development of Friction Pull <b>Plug</b> <b>Welding</b> (FPPW). FPPW, is a welding process similar to Friction Push <b>Plug</b> <b>Welding</b> in that, {{there is a small}} rotating part (plug) being spun and simultaneously pulled (forged) into a larger part. These two processes differ, in that push <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> requires an internal reaction support, while pull <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> reacts to the load externally. FPPW was originally conceived as a post proof repair technique for External Tank. FPPW was easily selected as the primary process used to close out the termination hole on the Constellation Program fs ARES I Upper Stage circumferential Self] Reacting Friction Stir Welds (SR]FSW). The versatility of FPPW allows it to also be used as a repair technique for both SR]FSW and Conventional Friction Stir Welds. To date, all MSFC led development has been concentrated on aluminum alloys (2195, 2219, and 2014). Much work has been done to fully understand and characterize the process fs limitations. A heavy emphasis has been spent on plug design, to match the various weldland thicknesses and alloy combinations.

40|$|Until the {{development}} of retractable pin tool (RPT) technology, friction stir welding (FSW) was limited to constant thickness joining of aluminum materials and the choices of keyhole elimination focused on traditional fusion and <b>plug</b> <b>weld</b> repair techniques. An invention, US Patent Number 5, 893, 507, "Auto-Adjustable Pin Tool for Friction Stir Welding" assigned to NASA, demonstrated an approach to resolve these serious drawbacks. This approach brings forth a technique that allows the crater, or keyhole, to be closed out automatically {{at the end of}} the weld joint without adding any additional equipment or material. Also the probe length can be varied automatically in the weld joint to compensate for material thickness changes, such as, in a tapered joint. This paper reports the effects of pin extension and retraction rates in the weld joint and its correlation to weld quality.

30|$|The {{stiffened}} {{thin plate}} structure, where the thinner plate {{is reinforced by}} a thicker plate called a frame, has been claimed as being a cost-effective way of achieving a high-performance vehicle structure (Gean et al. 1999). This structure is generally welded by resistance spot welding due to its advantages in welding efficiency and suitability for automation (Hou et al. 2007). The parts of the structure in which spot welding cannot be implemented, such as the double sheeting structure, complex structure, and the construction with the profile stiffener, <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> was applied instead of spot welding. Welding schedule of <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> has been offered by American Welding Society (AWS) (2004) and previous study (Tsuruta et al. 1952). According to this recommendation, the weld quality is achieved when the hole diameter of <b>plug</b> <b>welding</b> is 8 [*]+[*]t (in mm), where t is {{the thickness of the}} joined plate (in mm). It is very useful in finding good weld schedules for equal-thickness welding, but confusing in that for unequal-thickness plate welding and generally developed by and practiced within individual manufacturers (Agashe and Zhang 2003). Some of them use the thickness of thinner material, and others use the average of joined material thickness in that empirical formula. There are a lot of scientific papers dealing with static and fatigue behaviors of spot-welded dissimilar metal joints (Alenius et al. 2006; Hasanbasoglu and Kacar 2007; Jamasri et al. 2011; Vural et al. 2006), but only a few studies have been published concerning those of plug welded.

40|$|A pull <b>plug</b> {{friction}} <b>weld,</b> simply defined, comprises {{inserting a}} rotating cone-shaped cylinder into a somewhat cone-shaped {{hole in a}} plate. The rotating plug makes contact {{with the edge of}} the plate and the resulting friction generates heat. The temperature of the plate material eventually reaches a magnitude that will cause the plate material {{at the edge of the}} hole to flow. This can be termed a temperature dependent plastic flow. The rotation of the plug is terminated, additional pressure is applied and the metal at the interface of the two materials cools and welding occurs. This preliminary study addresses only three aspects of a complete analysis that is multi-faceted. The transient temperature distribution for different pull plug configurations has been studied in some detail even though the initial conditions and boundary conditions may still be deemed tentative. The stress distribution within the pull plug caused by the heating pressure was studied along with a preliminary analysis of the thermoelastic stress distribution caused by friction heating.

40|$|Pull <b>plug</b> {{friction}} <b>welding</b> is a {{new process}} being developed to conveniently eliminate defects from welded plate tank structures. The general idea is to drill a hole of precise, optimized dimensions and <b>weld</b> a <b>plug</b> into it, filling the hole perfectly. A conically-shaped plug is rotated at high angular velocity as it is brought {{into contact with the}} plate material in the hole. As the plug is pulled into the hole, friction rapidly raises the temperature to {{the point at which the}} plate material flows plastically. After a brief heating phase, the plug rotation is terminated. The plug is then pulled upon with a forging force, solidly <b>welding</b> the <b>plug</b> into the hole in the plate. Three aspects of this process were addressed in this study. The transient temperature distribution was analyzed based on slightly idealized boundary conditions for different plug geometries. Variations in hole geometry and ram speed were considered, and a program was created to calculate volumes of displaced material and empty space, as well as many other relevant dimensions. The relation between the axially applied forging force and the actual forging pressure between the plate and plug surfaces was determined for various configurations...|$|R
40|$|Axial loads on plugs or {{seals in}} an {{underground}} repository due to gas, water pressures and temperature changes induced subsequent to waste and plug emplacement lead to shear stresses at the plug/rock contact. Therefore, {{the bond between}} the plug and rock is a critical element for the design and effectiveness of plugs in boreholes, shafts or tunnels. This study includes a systematic investigation of the bond strength of cementitious borehole <b>plugs</b> in <b>welded</b> tuff. Analytical and numerical analysis of borehole plug-rock stress transfer mechanics is performed. The interface strength and deformation are studied {{as a function of}} Young`s modulus ratio of plug and rock, plug length and rock cylinder outside-to-inside radius ratio. The tensile stresses in and near an axially loaded plug are analyzed. The frictional interface strength of an axially loaded borehole plug, the effect of axial stress and lateral external stress, and thermal effects are also analyzed. Implications for plug design are discussed. The main conclusion is a strong recommendation to design friction plugs in shafts, drifts, tunnels or boreholes with a minimum length to diameter ratio of four. Such a geometrical design will reduce tensile stresses in the plug and in the host rock to a level which should minimize the risk of long-term deterioration caused by excessive tensile stresses. Push-out tests have been used to determine the bond strength by applying an axial load to cement plugs emplaced in boreholes in welded tuff cylinders. A total of 130 push-out tests have been performed as a function of borehole size, plug length, temperature, and degree of saturation of the host tuff. The use of four different borehole radii enables evaluation of size effects. 119 refs., 42 figs., 20 tabs...|$|R
