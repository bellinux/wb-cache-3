5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs.

Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (<b>phase</b> <b>III).</b> In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing <b>phase</b> <b>III</b> trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded <b>phase</b> <b>III</b> clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} an intervention {{that has been}} used to encourage individuals to remain regularly physically active in exercise-based CR in <b>phases</b> <b>III</b> and IV. The principles of this intervention are also appropriate for allphases of CR. This intervention, called the exercise consultation (EC), is based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change and Relapse Prevention Model (pp. 197 - 205), and uses cognitive and behavioural strategies to increaseand maintain physical activity (Loughlan and Mutrie, 1995, 1997). The strategies used in this EC include: assessing stage of change, decisional balance, overcoming barriers to activity, social support, goal setting, self-monitoring and relapse prevention. It involves a client-centred, one-to-one counselling approach and encourages individuals to develop an activity plan, tailored to their needs, readiness to change and lifestyle. The EC aims to encourage accumulated physical activity accumulating at least 30 minutes ofmoderate intensity activity on five days per week (Pate, et al., 1995, stage one, as discussed in Chapter 4). In addition, this level of physical activity may be easier for cardiac patients to incorporate into their daily routine and to sustainin the long term. Thus, the exercise consultation encourages individuals to integrate moderate intensity activity into their daily lives. In addition, EC can help maintain involvement in structured exercise in <b>phases</b> <b>III</b> and IV (SIGN, 2002) ...|$|R
