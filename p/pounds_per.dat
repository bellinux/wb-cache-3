Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch to 14.7 psi.

5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA {{and perhaps a}} few other places the pressure is measured in <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch (psi), {{and the rest of}} the world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E

Oats remove potash (K2O) at a rate of 0.19 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> bushel per acre, which causes it to use 15–30kg/ha, or 13–27lb/acre. Usually, 50–100kg/ha (45–90lb/ac) of nitrogen in the form of urea or anhydrous ammonia is sufficient, as oats use about one <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> bushel per acre.

5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 <b>Pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> square inch (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E

40|$|Background: Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) in the UK affects similar to 3 million people, with > 100 000 deaths annually. Mortality rates have halved since the 1980 s, but annual NHS {{treatment}} costs for CHD exceed 2 pound billion. Aim: To examine the cost-effectiveness of specific CHD treatments in England and Wales. Methods: The IMPACT CHD model {{was used to}} calculate the number of life-years gained (LYG) from specific cardiological interventions from 2000 to 2010. Cost-effectiveness ratios (costs per LYG) were generated for each specific intervention, stratified by age and sex. The robustness of the results was tested using sensitivity analyses. Results: In 2000, medical and surgical treatments together prevented or postponed approximately 25 888 deaths in CHD patients aged 25 - 84 years, thus generating similar to 194 929 extra life-years between 2000 and 2010 (range 143 131 - 260 167). Aspirin and beta-blockers for secondary prevention following myocardial infarction or revascularisation, for angina and heart failure were highly cost-effective (< 1000 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> LYG). Other secondary prevention therapies, including cardiac rehabilitation, ACE inhibitors and statins, were reasonably cost-effective (1957 pound, 3398 pound and 4246 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> LYG, respectively), as were CABG surgery (3239 - <b>pound</b> 4601 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> LYG) and angioplasty (3845 - <b>pound</b> 5889 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> LYG). Primary angioplasty for myocardial infarction was intermediate (6054 - pound 12 <b>pound</b> 057 <b>per</b> LYG, according to age), and statins in primary prevention were much less cost-effective (27 <b>pound</b> 828 <b>per</b> LYG, reaching 69 <b>pound</b> 373 <b>per</b> LYG in men aged 35 - 44). Results were relatively consistent across a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Discussion: The cost-effectiveness ratios for standard CHD treatments varied by over 100 -fold. Large amounts of NHS funding are being spent on relatively less cost-effective interventions, such as statins for primary prevention, angioplasty and CABG surgery. This merits debate...|$|R

This {{may be due to the}} earlier incorporation of boron in reproductive tissues, especially dormant buds. Grapevine foliage is also more tolerant to boron postharvest in the fall, when 1 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> acre of actual boron can be safely applied.
