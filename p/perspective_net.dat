40|$|Current climate {{mitigation}} {{policies have}} not fully resolved contentious issues regarding {{the inclusion of}} carbon sequestration through changes in forestry and agricultural management practices. Terrestrial carbon sinks could be a low-cost mitigation option that fosters conservation and development, yet issues related to accurately documenting {{the amount of carbon}} sequestered undermine confidence that emission offsets through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions. From an atmospheric <b>perspective,</b> <b>net</b> of CO 2 removals through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions over a given period of time. But carbon will not remain sequestered in biomass or soils indefinitely and investments in sequestration could stifle investments in reducing emissions from other sources. Many international climate agreements cap emissions from some countries or sectors but enable participation of uncapped countries or sectors for forestry and agricultural sequestration. This structure can prompt emission increases in parts of the uncapped entities that weaken the value of emission reductions earned through sequestration. This has been a minor issue under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Reduced emissions through deforestation and degradation is susceptible to the same problems.

40|$|The {{industrial}} network framework is discussed {{from the perspective}} of capital investment theory. To our knowledge {{this is the first time}} that these academic fields are considered together. The theory and method described allow an understanding of the forward projection of firm networks from a specific time, so providing a new way to examine the dynamics of networks. Capital investment decisions are usually irreversible and this creates some assurance concerning the future for parts of the business network. The ‘shadow ’ of a past capital investment decision is projected into the future, providing ‘net momentum’. Conversely, the ‘shadow ’ of the future acts as a form of ‘environmental power ’ that constrains and enables other firms ’ interactions in the present. Together these effects have a strong impact on network logic. Value nets are applied as a formal way of bounding parts of the network so that strategic investment decisions can be formalized. A new definition of net centrality is proposed based on a time <b>perspective.</b> <b>Net</b> time centrality is defined by resource connections between firms, with the connections weighted by the remaining investment period at a specific point in time. The variations in investment time periods across the actors in a value net will need to be coordinated for each firm to achieve reasonable returns. The firm with the largest investment in future resources is likely to have considerable strategic control within the value net and so is likely to most strongly influence the timing of change by the firms in the net.

40|$|Wine grape {{production}} in the semi-arid regions of Australia is successful due to the availability of irrigation water. Whilst water is a natural resource it is also becoming extremely valuable. In the hot and semi-arid regions of Australia, the prospect of water restrictions from drought and intensifying horticultural and domestic competition for water has prompted the grape and wine industry to implement strategic deficit irrigation practices to try and maintain sustainable wine grape production. Sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) differs significantly in its management to partial rootzone drying and regulated deficit irrigation and is a technique that could potentially be easily adopted across the winegrape industry if water allocations were reduced. With SDI, the water deficit is not created by withholding water, but rather, by applying a lesser volume of water at each irrigation event for the entire irrigation season. This study aimed to understand the physiological behaviour of wine grape cultivars to SDI and how this deficit irrigation strategy would influence yield and composition of the grapes and wine. The trials were conducted during 2003 - 2006 on the cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grafted to 140 Ruggeri (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris) rootstock and grown in the Murray-Darling region of Australia. Furthermore, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are the main red winegrape varieties grown in the Murray-Darling region, anectodally they are observed to respond differently to hot, dry conditions when managed under similar irrigation regimes. The vines were drip irrigated providing 100 % of estimated ETc (control) and three graded sustained water deficits (Cabernet Sauvignon 70 %, 52 % and 43 % of the control; Shiraz 65 %, 45 % and 34 % of the control). For each season, the volume of actual water applied (ML/ha) was calculated for each irrigation treatment and varied depending on seasonal and vineyard conditions. To further explore vine responses to water deficit, glasshouse studies on four own-rooted Vitis vinifera L. cultivars, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Grenache and Tempranillo were also conducted. Deficit irrigation management, whilst controlling vegetative growth and manipulating berry composition, may not always produce consistent outcomes among grapevine varieties. This has lead to the observation that deficit irrigation management strategies {{may need to be}} tailored to individual grape cultivars. Consequently, an understanding as to how certain grapevine varieties respond to water deficit, particularly in relation to physiological responses, could assist with linking any impacts that water deficits may have on grape and wine composition. Field-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz exposed to approximately 50 % SDI experienced significant reductions in leaf water potential and stomatal conductance compared to the control. By contrast, xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased significantly for the SDI-treated vines compared to the control that is probably related to root to shoot signals and canopy-derived ABA. Under field situations, Cabernet Sauvignon displayed physiological responses more typical of an isohydric-like (drought avoiding) vine, compared to the anisohydric-like (drought tolerant) responses of Shiraz. These responses may also be supported by the pattern of xylem sap [ABA] production. The differences in canopy development (leaf area index and pruning weights) for Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz may be a reflection of the isohydric-like and anisohydric-like responses of these grape varieties to water deficit, thereby influencing carbohydrate dynamics and long-term viability of vine health under SDI. After three seasons, the SDI treatments significantly reduced yield of the field-grown vines, primarily due to a reduction in berry weight that tended to occur from the beginning of veraison through to harvest. SDI reduced yield (t/ha) by up to 30 % in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, when applied at approximately 50 % of the control irrigation (ML/ha). Irrespective of the yield reductions, water use efficiency was improved between 40 - 50 % for the SDI-treated Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, compared to the control. The lighter berries from SDI-treated vines tended to have increased pH and decreased titratable acid levels than the control. The SDI treatments applied at approximately 50 % of the control increased the concentration of total anthocyanins in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz berries by 22 % and 15 % respectively. As less water was applied there was an increase in total malvidin concentration for both varieties, with less effect on delphinidin, peonidin, petunidin and cyanidin for Cabernet Sauvignon and peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and cyanidin for Shiraz. The increase in total anthocyanin and total phenolic concentrations for the SDI treatments than the control is attributed more to factors such as water deficit, canopy light penetration and/or changes in phenolic synthesis, than to differences in berry size (skin surface area to pulp volume ratio). Differences in grape anthocyanins and phenolics between the irrigation treatments were not the same as those measured in the wine. A decrease in berry weight did not alter the skin weight to berry weight ratios, and were therefore unlikely to be the cause of the altered composition of SDI wines. The increases in wine colour with SDI treatment {{may be the result of}} biochemical changes in the flavonoid pathway as a result of altered grapevine physiology responses to the SDI. Alternatively, the increases in red wine colour could possibly be due to a change in chemical properties of the anthocyanins to copigmented forms that may have influenced extractability efficiency during the winemaking or ageing process. This research showed that an SDI of approximately 50 % less water could be applied over one or two seasons with improvements in water use efficiency (t/ML) and berry composition compared to fully irrigated vines. Furthermore, for Cabernet Sauvignon exposed to 70 % and 52 % SDI there tended to be improvements in the overall wine composition and sensory ranking than the control. However from an economic <b>perspective,</b> <b>net</b> returns were not largely affected by using SDI based on the current grape prices. If water becomes a more highly valued resource and priced accordingly, then a larger increase in net return will result from SDI. Additionally, wineries would need to offer price incentives to produce lower yields that may result from adopting SDI. Overall, if the wine industry was faced with reductions in water allocations of 50 % or more in a particular season, then the adoption of SDI may be a feasible solution to maintaining winegrape production for the short-term. Through understanding the translation of grape composition into wine, these findings should be able to provide additional knowledge to the Australian grape and wine industry as to how SDI can be used to manipulate grape composition for the production of sustainable wine styles.

A steady declining trend can be observed in the EROI ratios of both the coal and the oil and gas industries due to the depletion of shallow-buried coal resources and of conventional oil and gas resources.

The declining EROI ratios in turn mean more and more energy inputs are needed to produce the same amount of energy output. Such a situation will be unsustainable for Chinese society if China cannot find new and abundant energy sources with high EROI values, or find some way to support one and one half billion people at a dignified standard of living by much less energy-intensive means.|$|R

NETs are comprised of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial proteins extruded by neutrophils during NETosis, a cell death pathway reported to be distinct from apoptosis, phagocytosis-induced cell death, and necrosis. Although multiple laboratories have reported NETs using various stimuli in vitro, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have yet to be definitively elucidated, and many questions regarding the formation and putative role or function of NETs in innate host defense remain unanswered.

Also the role of supply {{strategy}} has increased, and it is essential nowadays that companies have supply strategies which define their actions in the supply system. Supply strategy consists of several elements, and the most essential components which every supply strategy should include are discussed in this study. The theoretical basis for the study is in transaction cost economics. Transaction cost economics creates the basis for the most essential supply strategy components. In this study, supplier relationships, which form one main element of supply strategy are discussed from the value <b>net</b> <b>perspective.</b> The case study discusses the elements and the role of supply strategy in the Finnish food industry value net. The case study compares strategic supply, supply management and supply decisions between the case companies. Keywords: Supply strategy, value net, core capabilit...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern {{enlargement}} {{is about}} to be decided by the European Council. As expected, the “end game “ of the negotiations and assessments is heavily biased by a narrow <b>perspective</b> on <b>net</b> transfers, on income compensations to Central European farmers and on the psychological politics of a single “big bang “. None of these three so-called key items of the end game are of much relevance to appreciate the significance of enlargement. Net transfers {{have little to do with}} the costs and benefits of club membership for countries which pay, and can lead to addiction and lethargy rather than extra growth if market integration, macro-economic stability and domestic reforms are not taken serious (as the case of Greece before 1997 has demonstrated). Income compensations for Eastern farmers are crucial for this pressure group, and symbolically of some importance in domestic politics because of the perversity that rich farmers get more, but their absence is likely to serve the public interest in candidate countries far better. And being part of the big bang, as against getting in one or three years later, has assumed a dramatic meaning during this end game, far beyond its true proportions. This hectic European theatre tends to obscure what enlargement is mainly about, now that the stability and values have been secured for the peoples from Central Europe. In a guaranteed setting of peace, freedom and security, enlargement is about greater prosperity...|$|R
40|$|From {{a system}} {{identification}} <b>perspective</b> a neural <b>net</b> is "just another model structure". We review {{some of the}} basic system identification machinery to reveal connections with neural nets. In particular we point to the role of regularization for dealing with model structures with many parameters, and show the links to overtraining in neural nets. Som provisional explanations for the success of neural nets are also offered. A SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION PERSPECTIVE : : : System identification (SI) is the theory and art of building mathematical models of dynamical systems (and signals) based on observed inputs and outputs. As a scientific discipline it dates back to the first attempts to model time-series using AR-techniques. Even though a substantial part of the development of System Identification techniques can be linked to the Control Community, it is basically built on statistical techniques, in particular on linear and non-linear regression methodology.
