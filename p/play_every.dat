5|$|In 1977, British playwright Tom Stoppard {{wrote the}} <b>play</b> <b>Every</b> Good Boy Deserves Favour that criticized the Soviet {{practice}} of treating political dissidence {{as a form}} of mental illness. The play is dedicated to Viktor Fainberg and Vladimir Bukovsky, two Soviet dissidents expelled to the West.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} time I ever swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you <b>play</b> <b>every</b> single day.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings <b>play</b> <b>every</b> few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E

5|$|Ruth {{also noticed}} these {{vacancies}} in the lineup; he was dissatisfied {{in the role}} of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.|$|E
5|$|VfL Wolfsburg {{purchased}} Rodríguez as a 19-year-old on 13 January 2012 for £7.5 {{million with}} the player signing a four-and-a-half-year deal. He quickly asserted {{himself into the}} first-team lineup, making his Bundesliga debut the next day against 1. FC Köln, a 1–0 victory for the Wolves. Rodríguez went on to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> {{game of the season}} from that point on without being substituted, becoming a favorite on the left of the defense for manager Felix Magath.|$|E
5|$|At age seven, Ruth {{was sent}} to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a {{reformatory}} where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era. Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher {{and was a member}} of three World Series championship teams with Boston, he wanted to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{qualified}} for Europe again in 1974–75, {{and managed to}} draw both legs with Dutch side Ajax, only to exit the competition on the away goals rule. However Conroy again struggled with injuries, and was limited to just 16 league appearances. He played most of these games as a centre-forward, as regular striker John Ritchie missed much {{of the season with}} a broken leg and Geoff Hurst was nearing {{the end of his career}} and was unable to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> game. Conroy scored his two career hat-tricks during the campaign, against Halifax Town in the League Cup on 11 September, and then against Carlisle United in a 5–2 league win on 22 March. At the end of the season Stoke had three games to play against mid-table sides and needed to win all three in order to win the league, however they lost at Sheffield United and had goalless draws with Newcastle United and Burnley, leaving the club with another fifth-place finish. Conroy was again limited to just 16 league appearances as he continued to suffer injury problems in the 1975–76 season, and underwent an operation to remove all the remaining cartilage from his knees. The club also suffered a disaster, as a strong gale blew a section of the roof off the Victoria Ground's Butler Street Stand on 2 January, and as the correct insurance was not in place the club were forced to sell key players such as Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Alan Hudson, John Mahoney and Geoff Salmons in order to finance stadium repairs.|$|E
25|$|Under this formula, all {{teams are}} {{guaranteed}} to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> other team in their own conference at least once every three years, and to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> team in the other conference exactly once every four years. The formula also guarantees a similar schedule for every team in a division each season, as all four teams will play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents or each other.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{ice hockey}} team may {{have two or}} three goaltenders on its roster. Most teams {{typically}} have a starting goaltender who plays the majority of the regular season games and all of the playoffs, with the backup goaltender only stepping in if the starter is pulled or injured, or in cases where the schedule is too heavy for one goalie to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> game.|$|E

On 8 November, he scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Liverpool. On 24 January 2015, Cahill scored the opener against Bradford City in an FA Cup match, {{but in the end}} Chelsea crashed out of the tournament after a 4–2 defeat, which ended their hopes of winning a quadruple this season.|$|E

25|$|In {{professional}} ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills {{an important}} team role. Although the back-up will spend most games {{sitting on the}} bench, the back-up {{must be prepared to}} <b>play</b> <b>every</b> game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender {{in the event of an}} injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the season.|$|E
25|$|Known {{briefly in}} the 1990s as the Sydney Bulldogs, {{as a result of}} the Super League war the club competed in that {{competition}} in 1997 before changing their name to the geographically indistinct Bulldogs and continuing to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> season of the re-unified NRL, winning their most recent premiership in 2004. In 2012 the Bulldogs won the minor premiership, but lost to the Melbourne Storm 14–4 in the Grand Final. In 2014 they were in the Grand Finals against Rabbitohs but lost 30-6.|$|E

The team also participates in major tournaments every four years, such as the Summer Olympics, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and the Pan American Games. The national sevens team is organized by USA Rugby, and the team has been led by Head Coach Mike Friday since 2014.|$|E

In October 2009, Hagen signed a new contract with Odd till the end of the 2012-season.

25|$|The playoffs {{began on}} January 7.

This also {{marked the first time}} that a Sixth-seeded team, who by the nature of their seeding would <b>play</b> <b>every</b> game on the road, would advance to and win the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Texans {{joined in}} 2002, after Houston was left without the NFL {{for five years}} {{following}} the Oilers' move to Nashville, Tennessee, where they eventually became the Tennessee Titans. The Texans' establishment made feasible the realignment of both conferences into four divisions of four teams each, which allows every team to <b>play</b> <b>every</b> other team at least twice over an 8-year span (once at home, once on the road). Houston was once again placed in the AFC. To {{make room for the}} Texans, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to return to the NFC.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of interleague play in 1997, the Indians have developed two rivalries with National League (NL) teams, the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, both members of the National League Central. Until 2002, the Indians only played teams from the NL Central in interleague play. The format was changed in 2002 to have the divisions rotate. Since 2003, the Indians and Reds are designated rivals, meaning they <b>play</b> <b>every</b> season regardless of what division is scheduled to play the AL Central that year. The Pirates are not designated rivals so games between the two teams are less frequent.|$|E
