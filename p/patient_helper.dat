40|$|Peripheral-blood T cell subsets and {{functions}} were studied in 14 patients with malignancies treated with high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by autologous bone-marrow transplantation (BMT). 8 CMV-positive patients (6 with latent infections and 2 with a primary infection) showed an inversion of the OKT 4 /OKT 8 ratio {{caused by an}} increase in OKT 8 + T cells and a decrease in OKT 4 + T cells. This was accompanied by a pronounced increase in the percentage of HLA-DR+ T cells, and functionally by increased suppressor T cell activity and decreased helper T cell activity and T cell proliferation. These alterations in T cell subsets {{and functions}} were not observed in 6 patients who were kept CMV-negative by a deliberate transfusion policy. In the 6 <b>patients</b> <b>helper</b> T cell activity and T cell proliferation capacity recovered well after day 30. Differences between the two groups were most striking 60 days after BMT.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCritical {{impairment}} of {{adaptive immune response}} has been observed in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with reduced expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg) and enhanced effector T-cell responsiveness, both associated with poorer outcomes. ObjectivesThis study investigated the mechanisms underlying T-cell dysregulation in ACS. MethodsWe evaluated both early and downstream T-cell receptor activation pathways after ex vivo stimulation with anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 crosslink in CD 4 + T cells from 20 patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), 20 with stable angina (SA), and 20 controls. We reassessed 10 NSTEMI and 10 SA patients after 1 year. ResultsPhospho-flow analysis revealed reduced phosphorylation of the zeta-chain–associated protein kinase of 70  kDa at the inhibitory residue tyrosine 292, enhancing T-cell activation, in NSTEMI helper T cells versus SA and controls (each, p < 0. 001), resulting from increased expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type, 22 (PTPN 22) (p < 0. 001 for both comparisons), persisting at follow-up. We also observed reduced phosphorylation (p <  0. 001 versus controls) {{and lower levels of}} binding to interleukins 2 and 10 core promoter regions of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) in NSTEMI (p < 0. 05 vs. controls), which recovered at 1 year. Finally, in NSTEMI <b>patients,</b> <b>helper</b> T cells had a reduced ability in T-cell receptor–induced Treg generation (p = 0. 002 vs. SA; p = 0. 001 vs. controls), partially recovered at 1 year. Restoring CREB activity and silencing PTPN 22 enhanced NSTEMI patients’ ability to generate Treg. ConclusionsThe persistent overexpression of PTPN 22 and the transient reduction of CREB activity, associated with impaired Treg differentiation, might play a role in ACS...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} regulatory {{mechanisms of}} the human T cell response to soluble egg antigen (SEA) of Schistosoma japonicum in vitro. SEA is a crude antigen mixture containing numerous epitopes. We obtained SEA-induced T cell lines from five patients with chronic schistosomiasis japonica, and tested their proliferative response to molecular weight fractions of SEA. Although all T cell lines showed strong responses to crude SEA, there was a heterogeneity in fraction-driven responsiveness. All but one T cell line tested {{failed to respond to}} SEA fraction I (mol. wt greater than 18 kD). One patient who was typed as HLA-DQw 1 /w 4, did not show proliferation of CD 4 + T cells to fraction I; however, a fraction I-driven helper T cell response was observed when we added HU- 11 monoclonal antibody specific for HLA-DQw 1 /w 4. This indicated that the <b>patient</b> had <b>helper</b> T cells to the fraction even though their response was suppressed. Because HLA-DQ had an effect on functional expression of suppressor T cells, it was suggested that there was epitope-specific regulation of the T cell response to SEA, and HLA-DQ-controlled immune suppression might be involved in the regulatory system in human chronic schistosome infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} activity of B and T lymphocytes {{from the blood}} of eight patients, who had successfully been treated with allogeneic bone marrow for severe aplastic anaemia or acute leukaemia, was studied in pokeweed mitogen (PWM) driven polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis. Activity of B cells was measured as IgM and IgG synthesis by a standard number (40 X 10 (3] of patient lymphocytes in {{the presence or absence}} of healthy donor T cells. In addition, the frequency of PWM reactive B cells, giving rise to IgM and/or IgG producing daughter cells, was estimated by limiting dilution analysis. With this method, it was found that only a small percentage (1 - 3 %) of peripheral blood B cells from healthy individuals is reactive to PWM. In the patients, both parameters for B cell reactivity were decreased during the first 40 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. As parameters for T cell activity, help and suppression on the Ig production by healthy donor lymphocytes were tested. In most <b>patients,</b> T <b>helper</b> cell activity was strongly decreased, whereas some patients had excessive T suppressor cell activity. The observed functional activities were only partially correlated with the marker profile of the T cell populations, as detected by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies.

40|$|AbstractData {{from most}} {{dialysis}} registries suggest that advanced age {{is associated with}} poor outcome in dialysis patients. However, it may simply {{be the result of}} higher prevalence of coexisting medical conditions in this group of patients. We performed a retrospective study to examine this hypothesis. We identified 44 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients of age over 65 (the geriatric group) and 127 patients of age between 50 to 64 (the control group). Their nutritional status, duration of hospitalization, peritonitis rate, 2 -year patient and technique survival were compared. Patients of geriatric group had higher prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and requirement of helper for dialysis procedure than the control group. Geriatric group had lower normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) (0. 81 ± 0. 16 vs 0. 91 ± 0. 18 g/kg/day, p < 0. 005) and percentage of lean body mass (%LBM) (54. 7 ± 10. 1 vs 61. 3 ± 10. 2, p < 0. 005). They had marginally lower 2 -year patient survival (72. 6 % vs 82. 8 %, p = 0. 08) and technique survival (68. 8 % vs 79. 4 %, p = 0. 15). Hospitalization and peritonitis rate did not differ between groups. Furthermore, requirement of helper for dialysis procedure was the major confounding factor. <b>Patients</b> who need <b>helper</b> had significantly lower 2 -year actual survival (58. 0 % vs 86. 0 %, p < 0. 02) and technique survival (54. 1 % vs 82. 6 %, p < 0. 01). They stayed in hospital longer (median 13. 1 versus 4. 4 days/year, p < 0. 01). Multivariate analysis showed that requirement of helper and diabetic status, but not age, were independent factors affecting patient and technique survival; requirement of helper, diabetic status, and duration on dialysis were independent factors predicting hospitalization. We conclude that age is not an important factor determining morbidity and mortality of CAPD <b>patient.</b> Requirement of <b>helper</b> for dialysis procedure, which probably represents a poor overall functional status, is a more important factor predicting outcome.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of total hip replacement in 49 people aged 55 - 84 with osteoarthrosis {{of the hip}} were evaluated. The main benefit was relief of symptoms, 40 patients being pain free after operation. Range of hip movement and mobility improved moderately in most patients. After operation most patients were better able to perform certain activities of daily life, though only six were completely independent, the rest requiring aids or help from others. Nevertheless, 18 of the patients' main helpers estimated that they had more time free of tasks previously performed for the patient. There was a small reduction in the need for community medical resources such as home visits from general practitioners or district nurses. Thirteen patients were still taking antiarthritic drugs. Older patients needed to spend longer in hospital after operation because of complications.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{importance}} of the costimulatory molecules CD 28 and CTLA- 4 in the pathologic mechanism of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been demonstrated by genetic associations and the successful clinical application of CTLA- 4 Ig {{for the treatment of}} RA. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of the CTLA- 4 /CD 28 axis in the local application of CTLA- 4 Ig in the synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients. METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines in ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorted CTLA- 4 + and CTLA- 4 - T helper cells from the peripheral blood and SF of RA <b>patients.</b> T <b>helper</b> cells were also analyzed for cytokine expression in vitro after the blockade of CTLA- 4 by anti-CTLA- 4 Fab fragments or of B 7 (CD 80 /CD 86) molecules by CTLA- 4 Ig. RESULTS: CTLA- 4 + T helper cells were unambiguously present in the SF of all RA patients examined, and they expressed increased amounts of interferon-γ (IFNγ), interleukin- 17 (IL- 17), and IL- 10 as compared to CTLA- 4 - T helper cells. The selective blockade of CTLA- 4 in T helper cells from the SF in vitro led to increased levels of IFNγ, IL- 2, and IL- 17. The concomitant blockade of CD 28 and CTLA- 4 in T helper cells from RA SF by CTLA- 4 Ig in vitro resulted in reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IL- 2 and increased levels of the antiinflammatory cytokines IL- 10 and transforming growth factor β. CONCLUSION: Our ex vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that the CTLA- 4 /CD 28 axis constitutes a drug target for not only the systemic, but potentially also the local, application of the costimulation blocking agent CTLA- 4 Ig for the treatment of RA...|$|R

Furthermore, Th 17 numbers are increased in some chronic inflammatory conditions. To investigate the expression of interleukin (IL) - 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 21, IL- 22 and IL- 23 and of retinoic orphan receptor RORC 2, a marker of Th 17 cells, in bronchial biopsies from patients with stable COPD of different severity compared with age-matched control subjects. The expression of IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 21, IL- 22, IL- 23 and RORC 2 was measured in the bronchial mucosa using immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The number of IL- 22 (+) and IL- 23 (+) immunoreactive cells is increased in the bronchial epithelium of stable COPD compared with control groups. In addition, the number of IL- 17 A(+) and IL- 22 (+) immunoreactive cells is increased in the bronchial submucosa of stable COPD compared with control non-smokers. In all smokers, with and without disease, and in patients with COPD alone, the number of IL- 22 (+) cells correlated significantly with the number of both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells in the bronchial mucosa. RORC 2 mRNA expression in the bronchial mucosa was not significantly different between smokers with normal lung function and COPD. Further, we report that endothelial cells express high levels of IL- 17 A and IL- 22. Increased expression of the Th 17 -related cytokines IL- 17 A, IL- 22 and IL- 23 in COPD patients may reflect their involvement, and that of specific IL- 17 -producing cells, in driving the chronic inflammation seen in COPD...|$|R

The control groups were given methimazole or levothyroxine only while the treatment groups were given Corbrin Capsule (2. 0 [*]g[*]tid) besides the same conventional prescriptions as control groups. Thyroid hormones, thyroid antibodies, and T lymphocyte subsets were quantified at baseline and 24 weeks posttreatment. Results. Significant drop of serum anti-TPO-Ab levels was observed in both GD-Tx and HT-Tx groups. Before treatment, GD <b>patients</b> had higher <b>helper</b> T cells compared to cytotoxic T cells, while HT patients suffered from a nearly inverted proportion of helper T/cytotoxic T cells.

Recent literature has emphasized the role of host defence and immune deficiency in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, {{but there have been}} few studies of immune function in adult bronchiectasis. A comprehensive screen of immune function was conducted in 103 adult patients with bronchiectasis, encompassing full blood examinations, immunoglobulins and IgG isotypes, complement levels, lymphocyte subsets and neutrophil function. Full blood examinations were normal in this cohort, as were complement levels. Statistical analysis confirmed that a significant number of subjects had low levels of IgG 3 (13 patients), B cell lymphocytes (six <b>patients)</b> and T <b>helper</b> cell lymphocytes (seven patients) when compared with controls (P< 0 · 05). The most common abnormality was found with testing of the neutrophil oxidative burst. All subjects had a normal neutrophil phagocytic function but 33 of the subjects had an oxidative burst that was below the normal range (P< 0001). Almost half the group (45 subjects) had abnormally low levels of one of these four parameters. The findings of low B cells, Th cells and oxidative burst in bronchiectasis are novel.

40|$|A {{domiciliary}} physiotherapy {{service in}} general practice {{has been compared}} with an out-patient service and demographic practice data. The general practitioners in the practice had complete control over referral to the domiciliary service. The study provides indirect evidence {{of the need for}} domiciliary physiotherapy to cater for patients, particularly the elderly, who would suffer discomfort if referred to an outpatient service. Approximately 13 per cent of the patients treated at home were potentially diverted from an outpatient referral. In domi-ciliary physiotherapy the education of the <b>patient</b> or a <b>helper</b> did take place in the majority of visits. Domiciliary physiotherapy had fewer visits per referral than the alternative mode and various explanations of this finding were canvassed. The net cost to the NHS of a domiciliary referral depends on the cost-savings achieved. It was confirmed that the cost of a domiciliary referral would be lower the greater the (positive) difference in the number of visits per outpatient referral over the domiciliary referral, the greater the proportion of patients potentially diverted from an outpatient referral and the greater the proportion of potentially diverted patients saved an ambulance journey. It was found that the net cost of a domiciliary referral lay between £ 8 and £ 12 (1975 / 76 prices). It was suggested that general practitioners are well-placed to exercise effective control over the net cost to the NHS of a domiciliary service...|$|R

To better understand the relationship between these epidemiological and immunological findings, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in the DENV infected mononuclear cells of adults with type 2 DM (T 2 DM group, n= 33) and normal adults (control group, n= 29). We found in the T 2 DM group significantly higher IL- 4 level on the first (P= 0. 049) and the third (P= 0. 022) postinfection days, while higher IL- 10 (P= 0. 042) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (P= 0. 009) were detected on the third postinfection day. No significant difference in DENV viral load between the cultured mononuclear cells from both groups was found on the first and third post-infection days. These data immunologically suggest that patients with T 2 DM are at higher risk for development of DHF/severe dengue and strengthen the previously epidemiologically identified role of DM being a predictive risk factor for progressing into DHF/severe dengue in DENV-affected patients...|$|R

O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 µg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated <b>patients,</b> the T <b>helper</b> type 2 (Th 2) cytokine interleukin (IL) - 5 and T regulatory IL- 10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th 1 -type interferon (IFN) -γ at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p. i. t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL- 5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL- 10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p. i. t., O. volvulus-specific IgG 1 and IgG 4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th 1 and Th 2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity...|$|R

To improve {{understanding of the role}} of T cells and cytokines in BD, the current study analysed the localization and extent of expression of T cell subsets, cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors in oral ulcers from BD patients and for comparison in oral ulcers from patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), as well as in healthy oral mucosa. METHODS: Biopsies from oral ulcers of 25 BD patients and 19 RAS patients and oral mucosa from six healthy volunteers were immunoperoxidase stained. RESULTS: Both CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive T cells were present in the oral ulcers of BD and RAS <b>patients.</b> The T <b>helper</b> (Th) 1 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 12, interferon (IFN) -gamma, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and the Th 1 -associated chemokine receptors CCR 5 and CXCR 3 were increased in both patient groups as compared to normal controls, indicating the involvement of a Th 1 immune response in the immunopathology of both BD and RAS. However, the Th 2 cytokine IL- 4 was only observed in oral ulcers of BD patients but not in RAS patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as Th 1 -associated chemokine receptors, in the oral ulcers of BD patients, as well as RAS patients, at a protein level. However, the expression of the Th 2 cytokine IL- 4 within the oral lesions of only BD patients is suggestive of a more complex antigenic stimuli in BD patients compared with RAS patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: STAT 1 {{mutations}} cause chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), while STAT 3 mutations cause hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES). CMC and HIES <b>patients</b> have T <b>helper</b> (Th) 17 defects {{suffering from}} mucosal Candida infections, but only patients with HIES show an allergic phenotype with eczema, eosinophilia and high IgE levels. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether differential Th 2 and Th 9 responses {{may explain the}} clinical differences. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CMC (n = 4), patients with HIES (n = 4), patients with atopic dermatitis (n = 4) and healthy volunteers (n = 13) were stimulated with Candida and Staphylococcus aureus, with and without IL- 4. The cytokines IL- 5, IL- 13, IL- 9, IL- 17 and TGFbeta and regulatory T cells were measured in cell culture supernatants by ELISA or flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CMC showed a significantly impaired production of the Th 2 cytokines IL- 5 and IL- 13, especially {{in the presence of}} IL- 4. Moreover, IL- 9 production was significantly lower in patients with CMC compared to healthy controls. In contrast, patients with HIES and patients with AD showed normal IL- 5 and IL- 13 production, while IL- 9 production was significantly lower in patients with HIES compared to healthy controls. Although TGFbeta was involved in the IL- 4 -induced IL- 9 production, TGFbeta levels and the frequency of regulatory T cells did not differ between patients with HIES and controls. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an IL- 9 + IL- 17 + CD 4 + subset in healthy controls after stimulation with Candida which was less present in patients with HIES. CONCLUSION: Patients with CMC have a general Th defect including Th 2 and Th 9, while patients with HIES have normal Th 2 cytokines. These differences are in line with their clinical presentation. Surprisingly, the allergic cytokine IL- 9 was deficient in both HIES and CMC, suggesting a Th- 17 -derived origin...|$|R
