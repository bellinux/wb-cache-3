40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of plasmapheresis on clinical and haematological recovery time of whole blood or <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> goats. For this, 20 clinically healthy adult goats were divided into two groups of ten animals each: control group (not-treated whole blood donor animals), and experimental group (donor animals which were treated with plasmapheresis). Goats were selected and evaluated through physical examination (vital functions) and complementary tests (complete blood counts, total proteins, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and plasma free haemoglobin) were carried out at the following moments: immediately before and after blood donation, 12, 24, 72, 120, 240, 360, 480, and 720 hours after the procedures. Results were analysed comparing animals in and between both groups (at differents moments of the study). The clinical observations made during the period of 30 days after donation of 20 % of total blood volume, with or without plasmapheresis in the animals of studied groups, were not influenced by these procedures. The results revealed significant variation of eritrogram components, showing the experimental group to have better recovery rates according to time. Based on the results obtained in the present study, plasmapheresis technique application in goats showed to be efficient as a resource to optimize recovery time of blood cell values of <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> animals, and did not cause hemolisis during its procedure...|$|E

40|$|HIV {{infection}} {{cannot be}} detected immediately after exposure because plasma viral loads {{are too small}} initially. The duration of this phase of infection (the “eclipse period”) is difficult to estimate because precise dates of exposure are rarely known. Therefore, the reliability of clinical HIV testing {{during the first few}} weeks of infection is unknown, creating anxiety among HIV-exposed individuals and their physicians. We address this by fitting stochastic models of early HIV infection to detailed viral load records for 78 plasma donors, taken during the period of exposure and infection. We first show that the classic stochastic birth-death model does not satisfactorily describe early infection. We therefore apply a different stochastic model that includes infected cells and virions separately. Since every <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> in our data eventually becomes infected, we must condition the model to reflect this bias, before fitting to the data. Applying our best estimates of unknown parameter values, we estimate the mean eclipse period to be 8 – 10 days. We further estimate the reliability of a negative test t days after potential exposure...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the clinico-epideiological feature of severe malaria in an area of markedly unstable and seasonal transmission. Also the interest was directed to characterize the immune response against merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens and to assess their impact on the development of different manifestation of severe malaria. The study was carried out in Gedarif area, Eastern Sudan during 2 successive malaria transmission seasons over the period 2000 - 2002. This is the first report about severe malaria in the Sudan and it is important for filling the paucity in the knowledge about the epidemiology of severe malaria. The incidence of severe malaria was 4. 4 %, and the mortality rate among the severe malaria (SM) patients was 6. 4 %, which accounts for 0. 3 % of all cases of malaria. Only four types of complications were recognized during the study period, the commonest was the severe malarial anemia (SMA) followed by convulsions (CAM), cerebral malaria (CM) and hypotension (HTN). Severe malaria was recognized in all age groups. The mean age for SM peaked at the age 2 - 4, while uncomplicated malaria peaked at 5 - 19 years. The 4 types of severe malaria significantly differ from each other in clinically important clinicoepidemiological indices, age, hemoglobin, blood glucose, parasite count and mortality rate. The antibody response directed against merozoite surface proteins (MSP 119, MSP 2 A and MSP 2 B) revealed that, the three tested merozoite surface antigens were immunogenic. The MSP antibody response was age dependent in this setting. The antibody response against MSP 119 was more significantly associated with protection from severe malaria but not uncomplicated malaria. More importantly, neither the prevalence nor the levels of MSP antibodies was associated with protection from fatal cerebral malaria. The study of the immune response against variant surface antigens (VSA) showed that the parasites obtained from patients with severe malaria, namely SMA and CM, displayed predominantly recognized VSA antigens compared to parasites obtained from patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM). On the other hand plasma from CM patients showed high or normal antibody response compared to the UM, while patients with SMA were found to have poor antibody response to VSA antigens expressed by parasites obtained from patients with different clinical grades of malaria. In addition it was found that, the plasma/parasite interaction is influenced by the intensity of malaria transmission in the place of the <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> (Sudan or Tanzania) rather than the place of parasite donor. On the contrary, the VSA antibody response was more affected by the age of parasite donor than the age of <b>plasma</b> <b>donor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} immune responses activated {{in acute}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 infection (AHI) exert a critical influence on subsequent virus spread or containment. During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, b-defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV- 1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5 – 7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alpha– 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma level...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims:  Commercial plasma {{donation}} {{was introduced}} in China in the 1970 s. Cases of non‐A, non‐B hepatitis (hepatitis C) continued to occur, with multiple outbreaks among <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> in Guan county, Hebei province between 1972 and 1990. The outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in these paid <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> from six villages of Guan county were followed up for 12 – 19  years. Methods:  A total of 402 <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> with HCV infection were enrolled since anti‐HCV‐positive in 1991 or 1998. Follow up was maintained until death {{or the end of}} the observation period. No antiviral treatment was applied during the period of infection. Results:  Follow up was lost in 23 cases. After a 12 – 19 ‐year follow up, 31 donors died, with the cause of death directly related to liver disease in 15 cases, and an overall mortality of 8. 18 % (31 / 379). The incidence of liver cirrhosis was 10. 03 %, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 2. 90 %. The rate of viral spontaneous clearing was 20. 32 % (77 / 379), and 13. 69 % (23 / 168) in males and 25. 59 % (54 / 211) in females. In May 2010, detections were performed in 348 cases. Abnormality of liver function was related to HCV viremia. Sex and alcohol intake impacted the outcome of HCV infection. There was no correlation between the viral spontaneous clearance with age of infection and genotype. Conclusions:  This area has a high rate of chronicity in HCV infection due to plasma donation. Twenty‐five years after virus infection, liver cirrhosis or HCC developed in one‐tenth of patients, with an overall mortality of 8. 18 %...|$|R
