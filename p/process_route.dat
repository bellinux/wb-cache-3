As the indicator of analyzing the vulnerability of weighted network node, the brittleness risk entropy can predict the easily failed subsystem in the entire network.

While Kanban systems maintain tighter control of system WIP through the individual cards at each workstation, CONWIP systems are easier to implement and adjust, since only one set of system cards is used to manage system WIP. CONWIP uses cards to control the number of WIPs. For example, no part is allowed to enter the system without a card (authority). After a finished part is completed at the last workstation, a card is transferred to the first workstation and a new part is pushed into the sequential <b>process</b> <b>route.</b> In their paper, Spearman et al.

To dissolve the aromatic polymer Twaron used a co-solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and an ionic component (calcium chloride CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups. The invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at AKZO Research Laboratory in Arnhem by a team consisting of Leo Vollbracht, Teun Veerman (assistant of Leo Vollbracht) and Wim Engelhard (trainee, who actually discovered NMP as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer as long as possible in solution; he also discovered that high speed mixing of PPD and TDC was necessary to obtain a sufficiently long polymer chains).

40|$|Chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main design decisions that needs to be taken during the preliminary stages of chemical plant design and development. A chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> is considered as the raw materials and the sequence of reaction steps that converts them in to desired products. Previously, the most important factor considered in selecting the chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> was plant economics. However, now other issues such as safety, environment and occupational health have also become important considerations. Therefore, at early stages of chemical process plant design and development it is necessary to apply methodologies to identify and assess environmental, occupational health and safety hazards involved in the process routes. This work proposes a methodology for assessing chemical process routes to manufacture a chemical based on inherent environmental, occupational health and safety hazards. The method developed in this work can be used during early design stages of a chemical process plant. The <b>process</b> <b>route</b> {{selection is}} done based on impacts due to emissions from the ongoing operational conditions of the plant. It considers the potential toxicological impacts on the environment, potential impacts on the occupational health due to fugitive emissions and the potential chemical and process safety impacts within the plant. As the outcome of the methodology, an integrated index called “Inherent Chemical <b>Process</b> <b>Route</b> Index” (ICPRI) is proposed which can be used for the selection of the ‘best’ chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> for a chemical process plant, based on inherent environmental hazard, occupational health and safety (IEHS). The lower the ICPRI the more inherently environmentally friendly, inherently occupational healthier and inherently safer the route is. The methodology developed in this work can also rank alternative chemical process routes based on inherent environmental hazard or occupational health hazard and or safety hazard separately. The method was applied on four possible process routes to produce acetone. The propene oxidation route showed the lowest ICPRI value indicating potentially the ‘best’ chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> for acetone manufacturing process based on the IEHS assessment.

40|$|Decision-making for {{sustainable}} design requires {{the evaluation of}} different options considering all sustainability dimensions simultaneously: economic, environmental and social. Each dimension has a specific relative importance, which depends on the process that is being assessed. The determination of the relative importance {{is not a simple}} task, principally, during early design stages when detailed information about the process is scarce, and when core decisions affecting the entire design are made. An example of this kind of decisions during early design stages is the selection of the chemical <b>process</b> <b>route,</b> which, once defined, provides the guidelines for the process design. The present study proposes a multi-criteria analysis based methodology to evaluate different chemical <b>process</b> <b>route</b> options under sustainability criteria and to guide the selection among them. The methodology uses normalized indicators to assess each sustainability dimension, and a multi-criteria analysis method (MCDA) to calculate the weights and influences between dimensions.
