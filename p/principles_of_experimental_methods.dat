In this role, Cunliffe developed important <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>methods</b> that {{are taught to}} this day. In the most famous example, Cunliffe redesigned the instructions for quality control workers who were tasked to either accept or reject handmade beer barrels. Before Cunliffe's redesign, workers accepted barrels by rolling them downhill and rejected barrels by pushing them uphill, the more difficult task; thus, workers were biased to accept barrels {{even if they were}} flawed. Cunliffe redesigned the quality control work station so that it was equally easy to reject or accept a barrel, eliminating the prior bias and saving Guinness money in the process.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> <b>method</b> in biological sciences have been progressively applied in biomedical and clinical research.

This journal opens in this issue a section containing critical analysis of articles published in the medical literature deserving the attention of its readers. However, as several other medical journals have stressed, we recommend that the conclusions of these analysis should not be used as a substitute for clinical judgment and they do not represent an official position of our journal.

Each group of students will conduct an experiment at sector 3 -ID of the Advanced Photon Source, the nation's premier synchrotron radiation facility. We provide one support staff per group, i. e., Drs. Michael Hu, Sarvjit Shastri, Wolfgang Sturhahn, and Tom Toellner will help their group to perform the experiment and interpret the data. After data collection (1 - 2 h per group), the remaining time will be spent with evaluation and interpretation. In addition to your own data, we provide similar sets of data. Computer hardware (iMac running as X-terminals) and software for data manipulation will be provided. It is important that you understand the basic <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> <b>method.</b> Therefore we strongly recommend that you read the next section and the attached article Phonon Density of States Measured by Inelastic Nuclear Resonant Scattering.

40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis have been placed under three headings: some properties of silver-iodide complexes, centres found in silver halides, and a discussion of confined electron centres including the F-centre in alkali halides. The introduction includes a discussion of some properties of the solid state and the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> <b>methods</b> used - details of which are given in chapter two. Studies on the silver-iodide complexes are reported in section 3. 1. In dilute solutions of silver and alkali iodides in organic solvents, absorption bands occur at c. 230 mu and C. 310 mu, and are attributable to the species AgI 2 and Ag[.;I.;" respectively. Thediffuse reflectance of the solid complexes are also reported. Further, preliminary electron spin resonance studies of the gamma irradiated solid complexes are reported. In section 3. 2, it is demonstrated that the centres in irradiated silver halides which {{give rise to a}} conduction electron spin resonance cannot be silver particles. Gamma irradiation at low temperatures does not seem to give rise to simple paramagnetic colour centres as in the alkali halides. Gyanine dyed silver halides, illuminated at low temperature, show a single electron spin resonance, with a g-value slightly dependent on the halide. The results of Stasiw on chalcogen doped silver halides are discussed and some experimental studies are reported. In section 3. 3, magnetic resonance data on the F-centre (from the literature) is analysed to show the dependence of the density of the unpaired electron in orbitals of near neighbour cations on various parameters of the alkali halide. In particular this density is seen to decrease linearly with increasing halide (cavity) radius and increase with the covalent radius of the alkali metal. The importance of cavity size is stressed and implications for any theory of the P-centre are discussed. Some measurements of the absorption of iodide doped crystals are presented...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reported}} in this paper aims to structure a cultural-historical understanding on how early childhood children experience science and how they develop scientific thinking as they interact with the social, cultural and material world. Moving beyond the cognitive dimensions of learning by interrelating {{different aspects of the}} process of children’s scientific thinking development constitutes a research prior- ity for the study. From a wide range of collected data, in the present article one qualitative empirical case study is presented. The detailed single example that is analyzed refers to a kindergarten female student, aged 5. 2 years old, from an urban area of Greece. A developmental research methodology as specified from the requirements of cultural-historical theory framework is used. Following four <b>of</b> the main <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> genetic <b>method,</b> this study creates a fecund ground for a cultural-historical exploration and interpretation of the very processes of the child’s development. The collection of the data was achieved through expanded, open-type conversations conducted at three concrete phases between the case study child, two of her peers and the educator. Drawing upon the system of theoretical concepts of cultural- historical theory the analysis is mainly based on the concept of perezhivanie as analytical tool as well as the concept of the developmental trajectories. The concept of the conceptualization of a precursor model as a theoretical tool that derives from the field of Science Education is also used. The analysis gives insights into how a certain social situation between children and educators in kindergarten settings becomes the unique social situation of a child’s development. Using as a base the dialectic perspective that Vygotsky posed in the analysis of human psyche, the study in this paper offers a creative insight in order to elaborate on a broad and dynamic understanding of the child’s development instead of an individualistic and static in- terpretation on her cognitive evolution. This cultural-historical reading is essential in capturing the child’s thinking in all its complexity as well as the uniqueness of the child. Summarizing the above, in this paper, new directions are laid for a more fruitful and dynamic support of young children’s learning and development in science through cultural- based educational practices and settings in kindergarten...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>methods</b> aimed at the {{investigation}} of structural transformations.
