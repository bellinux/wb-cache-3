40|$|An {{in vitro}} culture {{protocol}} was developed that increased the germination percentage and decreased the lag time to germination for Ilex dumosa R. <b>pyrenes</b> {{as a tool}} for replacing the laborious task of embryo rescue technique. This method involves transversely cutting surface-sterilized <b>pyrenes</b> with a scalpel blade, then placing the micropylar one-third end with the rudimentary embryo (0. 25 mm long) on solidified (agar 0. 65 %) quarter-strength salts and vitamins of Murashige and Skoog, 1962 medium with 3 % sucrose, and incubating in a growth room at 27 ± 2 8 C with a 14 -h photoperiod (116 mmolm? 2 s? 1). Most of the cut <b>pyrenes</b> (greater than 50 %) germinated within the first month after inoculation and achieved maximum germination (70 %) in 2 months compared with whole <b>pyrenes,</b> which began to germinate 3 months after sowing and required more than 8 months for maximum germination (37 %). Moreover, the germination percentage of cut <b>pyrenes</b> was significantly higher than the germination of isolated embryos (34 %). Thus, the cut <b>pyrenes</b> culture is a simpler and more effective technique than embryo rescue. Easily, on average, a trained operator is able to culture ~ 1000 cut <b>pyrenes</b> per day instead of ~ 100 isolated embryos. Fil: Dolce, Natalia Raquel.

40|$|ABSTRACT The goal of {{the present}} study is to assess the {{physiological}} potential of Byrsonima crassifoliaseeds and analyze the procedures of the germination and tetrazolium tests, as well as the conservation of such seeds by testing different combinations of packaging and environment. The experiment used <b>pyrenes</b> of the clone Açu, collected from mother plants in the germplasm collection of muruci plants of Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, in Belém, Brazil. Different temperatures were tested in the germination test (25, 30, 35 and 20 - 30 ºC). The best methodology and assessment dates were determined for the test, and the seedlings of the species were characterized. Viability was assessed with the tetrazolium test, with combinations of hydration methods (by immersion and between paper towels), staining periods (3 and 4 h) and concentrations of tetrazolium solution (0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 0 %). Storage of muruci <b>pyrenes</b> was evaluated at three, six and twelve months, in polyethylene and Kraft paper bags, under dry chamber and refrigerator conditions.
