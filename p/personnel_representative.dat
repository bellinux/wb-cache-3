Forty-nine of 83 employees (59. 0 per cent) rated unsatisfactory in job performance at the initial referral were performing satisfactorily at follow-up.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study on secretarial work in England, France and Germany, which aimed to discover whether secretarial work can justly be described as a female `ghetto' occupation. Questionnaires were issued to secretaries working in matched management consultancy and publishing firms in the three countries; 185 questionnaires were received and 61 interviews were carried out with bosses, secretaries and <b>personnel</b> <b>representatives.</b> It was found that promotion out of secretarial work is extremely rare, which corroborates the `ghetto' thesis. However, secretarial job content, especially in France and Germany, was found to be wide-ranging and varied, which runs counter to that thesis. Overall, conflicting evidence was found across the three countries, which suggests that women's work is not necessarily constructed in the same way in different countries, and points to the role played by national institutions in shaping patterns and experiences of women's employment. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a gender {{analysis of the}} IT managerial career progression process. The research includes case studies conducted within the IT division of four companies and survey results of IT managers {{carried out in the}} U K. The case studies include the collection of documentary evidence, observation and a total of fifty interviews conducted with IT managers and <b>Personnel</b> <b>representatives.</b> The case companies comprise the financial services, utility, retail and IT manufacturing sectors. This study builds on and extends existing knowledge within three areas of literature - women in management, gender and IT and career progression. Despite arguments within and between these fields of literature this study demonstrates how, due to gaps and weaknesses within each of the areas, it is necessary for them to be brought together under a single theoretical framework. Additionally, on an organisational level, by seeking out and analysing both formal and informal factors that influence the career progression of IT managers, aspects of this process that may inhibit women's IT managerial career progression are identified. This study concludes that there are aspects of both the IT management role and the associated career progression process that may be identified as gendered. Such aspects influence the career choices made by IT managers, leading to some identifiable differences i n the approaches men and women adopt in progressing their careers. In addition, it is suggested that the gendered aspects have greater negative influence on the career progression opportunities and potential of women than men IT managers...|$|R

40|$|Nigeria {{has serious}} {{environmental}} degradation resulting from pollution {{related to the}} oil and gas industry. The Department of Petroleum Resources reports that there were over 4, 200 oil spill incidences in Nigeria over the last 50 years, ranging from minor spills to over half a million barrels in one single incident; yet there are no coherent policies on the environment to deal with the on-going pollution problems. Significant improvements can be achieved by good Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and strict adherence to regulations. The history, strengths and weaknesses of EIA application and implementation in the oil industry are reviewed and assessed. The main research method was the use of a bespoke questionnaire sent to 705 recipients of whom 560 responded, and who were identified as a representative cross-section of stakeholders; including oil industry personnel, academics, government organisations <b>personnel,</b> <b>representatives</b> from local communities affected by the pollution, and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The questionnaire survey was used to determine the views of the stakeholders on the role of EIA in Nigeria‟s oil and gas industry; it also investigated the levels of the respondents‟ involvement, experience and participation in EIA. The data from the questionnaire was analysed using statistical methods, which elucidated the nature of the perceived conflict between the oil companies and government organisations, against academics and stake-holder communities. The results clearly demonstrated the ingrained views and perceptions {{on each side of the}} dispute. In addition the results highlighted the constraints and challenges faced by various stakeholders in conducting EIA in Nigeria, and emphasized the need for changes in the way EIAs were conducted in the oil industry. The research identified components of particular concern within the Nigerian EIA structure, process and implementation; and raised questions about the adoption or external Agency or industry imposition of 1 st World designed EIAs in Nigeria...|$|R
