Some of the main questions that Huffaker set out in his experiment were, “Is the <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relation</b> adequately described by the Gause theory of overexploitation?”, “What may be the effects of changes in the physical conditions upon the degree of stability or permanence of the predator-prey relation?” and “What is the order of influence on stability of population density of such parameters as shelter (from physical adversity of environment), food, disease, and natural enemies of other kinds?” [...] In short, these questions seek to understand the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the population system.|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{relation}} between various structural patterns found in real-world networks {{and stability of}} underlying systems is crucial to understand importance and evolutionary origin of such patterns. We evolve multiplex networks, comprising of anti-symmetric couplings in one layer, depicting <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relation,</b> and symmetric couplings in the other, depicting mutualistic (or competitive) relation, based on stability maximization through the largest eigenvalue. We find that the correlated multiplexity emerges as evolution progresses. The evolved values of the correlated multiplexity exhibit a dependence on the inter-link coupling strength. Furthermore, the inter-layer coupling strength governs the evolution of disassortativity property in the individual layers. We provide analytical understanding to these findings by considering star like networks in both the layers. The model and tools used here are useful for understanding the principles governing the stability as well as importance of such patterns in the underlying networks of real-world systems.

In order to better understand the role of how allochthonous resources are transferred as quarry from one predator-prey system to another, we propose a predator-prey-quarry-resource-scavenger (PPQRS) model, which is an extension of an existing model for quarry-resource-scavenger (a predator-prey-subsidy (PPS) model). Instead of taking the allochthonous resource input rate as a constant, as has been done in previous theoretical work, we explicitly incorporated the underlying <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relation</b> responsible for the input of quarry. The most profound diggerences between PPS and PPQRS system are found when the predator-prey system has limit cycles, resulting in a periodic rather than constant influx of quarry (the allochthonous resource) into the scavenger-resource interactions. This suggest that the way in which allochthonous resources are input into a predator-prey system can have a strong influence over the population dynamics. In order to understand the role of seasonality, we incorporated non-autonomous terms, and show that these terms can either stabilize or destabilize the dynamics, depending on the parameter regime. We also considered the influence of spatial motion (via diffusion) by constructing a continuum PDE model over space. We determine when such spatial dynamics essentially give the same information as the ODE system, versus other cases where there are strong spatial differences (such as spatial pattern formation) in the populations. In situations where increasing the carrying capacity in the ODE model drives the amplitude of the oscillations up, we found that a large carrying capacity in the PDE model results in a very small variation in average population size, showing that spatial diffusion is stabilizing for the PPQRS model...|$|E

40|$|The searching {{behaviour}} {{of individual}} predators of four phytoseiid species (Phytoseiulus persimilis, Amblyseius p o tentillae, Amblyseius bibens, Metaseiulus occidentalis) is investigated {{in relation to}} the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), which infests greenhouse roses. Especially the role of spider- mite webbing in the <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relation</b> is studied. Webbing interferes with searching, decreasing the rate of encounter per unit prey density. Low walking speeds and activity in webbing ensure that the predator is rarely disturbed after contact with other mites. Webbing also positively influences searching, as spider mites aggregate within the webbed area: prey density, defined here as the number of prey per square centimetre of webbed leaf area, is high, as is the rate of encounter with prey. The ability to capture a prey after tarsal contact depends on the food content of the gut, the prey-stage and, in two specific cases, the webbing; the success ratio of P. persimilis increased on a webbed substrate, that of A. potentillae decreased. Models to simulate rate of predation {{on the basis of the}} dynamics of the motivational state and the state dependent rate of successful encounter are proposed. The food content of the gut is chosen as an indicator of the motivational state. A stochastic queueing model simulates predation as accurately as a Monte Carlo model or a compound simulation model. The queueing model is preferred because of its economic use of computer time and the relatively few variables used. The model was validated in predation experiments. Systems analysis showed that the effect of temperature on the rate of predation is largely determined by its relation with the relative rate of food conversion into egg biomass and not by behavioural changes related to temperature. Also, it was shown that webbing has an important influence on the predation rate. A new model for the analysis of prey-stage preference is proposed. Predators invade the webbed leaf area after contact with the silk strands, irrespective of the presence of prey. The residence time in the prey colony is determined by prey density. Simulation of experimentally defined walking behaviour shows that predators remain in profitable prey patches by turning at the edge of the webbed leaf area. However, when predator density increases, the tendency to leave the prey colony also increases, even at high prey densities. Only A. potentillae avoided the webbed leaf area, preferring the thickest parts of the leaf ribs or other protected places on the plant. A survey of references on life history data is presented; emphasis is given to the role of food, temperature and relative humidity. Experiments by the author show that oviposition history of predatory females is a major factor in determining the actual rate of food conversion into egg biomass; and that the egg stage of the predators is very vulnerable to relative humidities below 70 %, though the evapotranspiration of the plant and the hygroscopic properties of the webbing buffer this to some extent. As the juvenile mortality of the phytoseiids increases above 30 °C, and that of the two-spotted spider mites above 35 °C, spider-mite control at temperatures above 30 °C is not effective. The four phytoseiid species are ranked on their capacities for numerical increase and predation: P. persimilis, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and A. potentillae. On capacity to survive on alternative foods they are ranked: A. potentillae, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and P. persimilis. Some trials with alternative food supply did not improve survival rates established for prevailing greenhouse conditions. The rate of increase of the webbed area per individual spider mite is quantified by experiment. This knowledge will enable continuous monitoring of the prey density during simulations of the predator-prey interactions on the population level. ...|$|E

The distribution and relative abundance of harbour porpoises and white-beaked dolphins from the Dutch coastal waters has changed significantly over the past decades. This thesis describes the past and present feeding ecology of these two species in Dutch coastal waters and investigates whether changes in abundance and relative distribution of porpoises reflect changes in their foodbase. For porpoises, three techniques for dietary analyses were combined, including stomach contents-, stable isotope- and fatty acid analysis, providing the most detailed description of their diet in time and space, elucidating differences between their short- and longer term diet. Stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were carried out in bone and muscle samples collected from porpoises stranded along the Dutch coast. Muscle δ 15 N values revealed that neonatal enrichment occurred and that larger porpoises, in particular males, seem to feed on lower trophic level species, compared to smaller individuals. Also bone δ 15 N values show that larger animals had fed on lower trophic levels in distant times. Seasonal variation in bone δ 15 N and δ 13 C values revealed two distinct groups of porpoises along the Dutch coast, a winter group (mainly males) that migrated from neighbouring regions and a Dutch subpopulation in summer (Chapter 2). To assess the contribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet, stable isotope analysis in both porpoise muscle and prey were carried out. With the use of a mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, SIAR), we revealed that 70 - 83 % of the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of poor cod, mackerel, greater sandeel lesser sandeel, sprat and gobies. This highlights a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents, where 90. 5 % of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod and sprat. Porpoises thus also feed offshore on pelagic, schooling species, while they feed closer to shore on more benthic and demersal species shortly before they strand. This could be due to the distribution of prey species as well as differences in behaviour of porpoises and their prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters (Chapter 3). The use of Quantitative Fatty Acid Analysis (QFASA) showed that the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of gobies, mackerel, smelt, herring and dragonet, pointing towards profound differences between the diet as estimated by QFASA and as deduced from stomach contents. This study revealed that the longer term diet of porpoises in Dutch coastal waters consists both of coastal species (e. g. gobies, smelt and dragonet) and also pelagic, schooling species (e. g. mackerel and herring). The results also brought to dawn possible methodological problems in using QFASA for porpoise diet estimation, emphasizing the importance of applying different dietary analysis techniques when studying marine mammal diets and the need for controlled feeding experiments in order to improve the interpretation of dietary analysis results (Chapter 5). Besides new insights in the feeding ecology of porpoises, stable isotope analysis also elicited a non-food related conservation ecology issue. Distinct δ 13 C values in muscle of porpoises stranded in the Eastern Scheldt revealed that these porpoises foraged there for a longer period. This distinct δ 13 C signature of animals from the Eastern Scheldt was not observed in bone tissue, which suggests a relatively recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises within the Eastern Scheldt. The high number of strandings within the Eastern Scheldt revealed a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch coastal zone, indicating that along with other changes in the physical environment, the building of the storm surge barrier may {{play an important role in}} determining the residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt, and that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it. This is an example of the impact on marine species due to protection structures that emerge and respectively increase worldwide in response to the effects of global warming and climate change. It highlights that even semi-open structures, which are meant to ameliorate habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, may still affect the abundance and distribution of migratory marine mammal species (Chapter 4). The analysis of stomach contents of white-beaked dolphins showed that their diet was dominated by Gadidae. All other prey species combined contributed little to the diet by weight. The two most important prey species based in weight were whiting and cod. In numbers, gobies were most common, but these contributed little to the diet by weight. The overall diet showed a lasting predominance of whiting and cod, without clear changes over time (35 years) or differences between sexes or size-classes of dolphins and revealed that white-beaked dolphins in the south-eastern North Sea are specialist feeders, with a strong preference for whiting and cod (Chapter 6). Stomach contents of juvenile white-beaked dolphins in our study revealed that at the age of about 1. 5 years old, they had started feeding on solid food by taking a variety of small fish and invertebrate prey, mostly shrimp and squid. Immatures in our study, estimated to be 2 - 4 years old, still take small prey, including small gadoids, but also take larger gadoids. Calves apparently gradually learn to eat big fish by taking prey that is much smaller than those normally taken by their mothers. This study illustrates novel techniques for diet estimation to reconstruct sizes of shrimp and whiting from tail flaps and eye lenses, respectively (Chapter 7). Most dietary studies on porpoises and white-beaked dolphins are deduced from stomach contents. This thesis has demonstrated that using indirect methods for studying the feeding ecology of marine mammals is a valuable addition to the more direct approach using stomach contents. It supports the need for multi-method approaches because by using only one technique, key prey species in the <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relation</b> may be missed or underestimated. Future ecological and fishery impact assessment studies and management decisions for the conservation of porpoises and white-beaked dolphins should acknowledge a difference between their long- and short-term diet. Large improvement in the interpretation of the results from diet analyses can be established either by controlled feeding experiments with animals in captivity or by studies that help to understand the common principals in dietary analyses (e. g. digestion rates, turnover rates of tissues, tissue-dependent isotopic fractionation between predator and prey and lipid metabolism within the animal) and variation of these between species...|$|E

This species, which has limited diel vertical migration, depends on its fast-start escape response to evade predators. It has myelinated neu-ronal axons, which contribute to its rapid and powerful escape response. The thermal environment that C. finmar-chicus inhabits ranges from below 0 °C to 16 °C. Previous {{studies have shown that}} respiration, growth, and reproduc-tive rates are strongly dependent on temperature, with Q 10 2. 5. A comparable dependence of the escape re-sponse could place the animal at higher risk for cold-compensated predators.

We found that in contrast to other biological processes, all aspects of the escape response showed a low dependence on temperature, with Q 10 values below 2. This low temperature dependence was consistent for escape parameters that involved neural as well as muscle components of the behavioral response.

Net offspring is increasing in prey biomass intake, declining {{in the loss}} of own biomass to predators and Allee’s Law applies. The organism’s constraint reflects its perception of how scarce its own biomass and the biomass of its prey is. In the short-run periods prices (scarcity indicators) coordinate and determine all biomass transactions and net offspring which directly translates into population growth functions. We are able to explicitly determine these growth functions for a simple food web when specific parametric net offspring functions are chosen in the micro-level ecosystem model. For the case of a single species our model is shown to yield the well-known Verhulst-Pearl logistic growth function. With two species in predator-prey relationship, we derive differential equations whose dynamics are completely characterized and turn out to be similar to the predator-prey model with Michaelis-Menten type functional response.

This study examined the interactions between a model amoeboid predator, Acanthamoeba castellanii, and diverse strains of V. cholerae to better understand the adaptations of these bacteria to eukaryotic grazing pressure over 48 hours. Our analysis showed that V. cholerae TP (non-pathogenic GFP variant) and AR 4100 (pathogenic GFP variant) increased growth (TP growth difference: 4. 29 -fold, AR 4100 growth difference: 4. 67 - fold) when co-cultured with A. castellanii in comparison to E. coli co-culture, while SIO (non- pathogenic GFP variant) had no growth difference (SIO growth difference: - 1. 05 -fold).

The development of the saber-toothed condition appears to represent a shift in function and killing behavior, rather than one in <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations.</b> Many hypotheses exist concerning saber-tooth killing methods, some of which include attacking soft tissue such as the belly and throat, where biting deep was essential to generate killing blows.

A new point-to-point bite model is introduced in the article by Andersson et al., showing that for saber-tooth cats, the depth of the killing bite decreases dramatically with increasing prey size. The extended gape of saber-toothed cats results in a considerable increase in bite depth when biting into prey with a radius of less than 10 cm.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of population dynamics, we start from the logistic equation describing the evolution of one species with limited food supply. A split device allows us to consider the population as two sub-populations x and y evolving analogously. The dynamical system has a one-parameter family of equilibria which is structurally unstable. Then small perturbations of the system (describing functional or ethological differentiations between the sub-species) lead in general to a new system involving a fast and a slow dynamics with {{a finite number of}} equilibria. In simple situations where the differentiation is clearly either an advantage or an inconvenience for one of the subspecies, the stable equilibrium amounts to extinction of the disadvantaged subspecies (elementary Darwinism). Oppositely more complex differentiations (involving both advantages and inconveniences) often lead to stable equilibria with well-defined non zero proportions of the sub-populations (preservation of the biodiversity). Other examples are concerned with symbiosis-like differentiations, leading to preservation, whereas the opposite case (mutual nuisances) has an unstable equilibrium and lead to extinction of one or the other subspecies according to the initial conditions. The case of a scission into three subspecies is more rich in consequences. In certain cases, <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations</b> lead to auto-organization phenomena with stable diversity-preserving diversity. Cases of instability are also possible, leading to orbits tending towards a poly-cycle. This implies some kind of pseudo-extinction: this amounts to "pseudo-periodic-like" orbits with "pseudo-periods" larger and larger, tending to infinity; each pseudo-period contains parts where one of the sub-populations practically vanish.

Alternating "mixing" and "stable" states of the epilimnion related to seasonal and internal waves variability are probably determinant for the short-term variability in abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii. In the framework of this study, remote sensing has shown a potentially interesting application for fisheries research at Lake Tanganyika. We observed a close correspondence between phytoplankton blooms at the time of trade winds changes and increased catches of S. tanganicae in the south. The anti-correlated abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii probably mainly reflects the underlying fluctuating limnological environment. Fisheries studies need to integrate limnological and planktonic monitoring to better understand large and complex ecosystems such as Lake Tanganyika...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{interactions}} between zooplankton and microbial food webs {{are vital to}} the ecosystem ecology of shallow lakes. However, {{little is known about}} how horizontal changes in environmental conditions may influence microbial and metazoan communities in shallow lakes. The specific goals of the study were i) to describe environmental variables responsible for the distribution of bacteria, flagellates, ciliates and crustaceans in an adjacent canal, ecotone and reservoir (littoral-pelagic zone) in two different types of lakes (Ceratophyllum -dominated and Potamogeton -dominated lakes); ii) to determine whether the contact zone waters differ in hydrochemical and biological terms from the waters of the canal and the open water zone; iii) and to evaluate the influence of particular macro-habitats (canal, canal/reservoir, littoral and pelagic zone) on the {{interactions between}} components of the planktonic food web. We studied four shallow, eutrophic lakes in Polesie Lubelskie (eastern Poland). The highest diversity and abundance of microorganisms and crustaceans were observed in the canal-reservoir contact zone, while the lowest values were noted in the pelagic zone. Hence, the contact zone in the investigated lakes could fulfil the function of an ecotone, distinguished by a significant increase in biodiversity, abundance, and species specificity of micro- and macroorganisms. Weak relations between food web components were found in the Ceratophyllum -dominated lakes, where environmental variables explained the bulk of the total variance in plankton abundance, whereas in the Potamogeton -dominated lakes, where environmental variables had a minor role in the total variance in plankton abundance, strong <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations</b> were noted. Spatial structure of habitats proved to be another important factor for relationships between food web components, as our study indicated that habitat complexity can reduce negative correlations between food web components. Our study contributes to knowledge of the functioning of eutrophic lakes in the current era of increasing eutrophication caused by climate change and human activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{standard}} platitude {{about the}} function of causal knowledge or theories {{is that they are}} valuable because they support prediction, explanation, and control. Knowledge of <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations</b> enables us to predict future animal populations, as well as design policies or interventions that help influence those populations. If we understand the underlying biochemical mechanisms of some disease, then we can predict who is at risk for it, explain why it produces particular symptoms, and develop interventions to try to reduce its prevalence or the symptom severity. Of course, there are many situations in which one has, for practical reasons, only some of these desiderata; for example, control might be infeasible for technical or ethical reasons. But these remain, for many researchers, the ideal for why causal knowledge is a valuable end of scientific inquiry, including biological inquiry. There are, however, certain types of systems—in particular, chaotic systems—in which it appears that these ends are unattainable, and these systems appear to be widespread in the biological domain, broadly construed (e. g., Benincà et al., 2008; Cushing, Costantino, Dennis, Desharnais, 2 ̆ 6 Henson, 2003; Guastello, Koopmans, 2 ̆ 6 Pincus, 2009; Hastings 2 ̆ 6 Powell, 1991; Skarda 2 ̆ 6 Freeman, 1987; Tsuda, 2001). In this paper, we will show why it is natural to think that causal models of chaotic systems cannot satisfy any of the three functions. But we will also show why this natural thought is wrong: we can have usable causal knowledge about even chaotic systems. Moreover, the ways in which we can have such knowledge lead us naturally to rethink a standard understanding of how causal learning and modeling proceed. In particular, just as we often must find the appropriate variables for a causal system, we also must determine the proper level or granularity of description for the dynamics of that system...|$|R
40|$|Sabre-like canines {{clearly have}} the {{potential}} to inflict grievous wounds leading to massive blood loss and rapid death. Hypotheses concerning sabretooth killing modes include attack to soft parts such as the belly or throat, where biting deep is essential to generate strikes reaching major blood vessels. Sabretoothed carnivorans are widely interpreted as hunters of larger and more powerful prey than that of their present-day nonsabretoothed relatives. However, the precise functional advantage of the sabretooth bite, particularly in relation to prey size, is unknown. Here, we present a new point-to-point bite model and show that, for sabretooths, depth of the killing bite decreases dramatically with increasing prey size. The extended gape of sabretooths only results in considerable increase in bite depth when biting into prey with a radius of less than ~ 10 cm. For sabretooths, this size-reversed functional advantage suggests predation on species within a similar size range to those attacked by present-day carnivorans, rather than “megaherbivores” as previously believed. The development of the sabretooth condition appears to represent a shift in function and killing behaviour, rather than one in <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations.</b> Furthermore, our results demonstrate how sabretoothed carnivorans are likely to have evolved along a functionally continuous trajectory: beginning as an extension of a jaw-powered killing bite, as adopted by present-day pantherine cats, followed by neck-powered biting and thereafter shifting to neck-powered shear-biting. We anticipate this new insight to be a starting point for detailed study of the evolution of pathways that encompass extreme specialisation, for example, understanding how neck-powered biting shifts into shear-biting and its significance for predator-prey interactions. We also expect that our model for point-to-point biting and bite depth estimations will yield new insights into the behaviours of a broad range of extinct predators including therocephalians (gorgonopsian + cynodont, sabretoothed mammal-like reptiles), sauropterygians (marine reptiles) and theropod dinosaurs...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of fishery {{resources in the}} North At-lantic is today based on catch statistics and data from acoustic surveys and trawl surveys. The data is typically analysed with area integrated, single species statistical calculation-tool models such as Virtual Population Analysis (VPA, Pope 1972) and prognoses are also be-ing made with such models. These models {{can be used to}} find the historic abundance at age of a fish cohort given the observed harvest on the cohort and an assumed natural mortality rate. The current size of the cohort is then established by supplementing the VPA with land-ings and survey data. Multispecies VPA models that take into account <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations</b> established through stomach sampling data have been developed (Gislason & Helgason 1985). Lately, more complex models have been attempted which allow more biological and envi-ronmental features to be implemented than in the VPA (Bogstad & al. 1997; Stefansson & Palsson 1998; Frøysa & al. 2002). These latter types of models can include predation and migration of several target species, and represent influences from temperature on growth and maturation. Although these models aim at representing biological processes, there are no mechanistic formula-tions of the species interactions, and the spatial resolu-tion is rather coarse relative to process variability. In a report from a working group appointed by the Research Council of Norway (Anonymous 1998), the current methods for fishery resource assessment are dis-cussed and several bottlenecks for improved stock size estimates are identified. In particular the importance of quantifying and if possible reducing the uncertainties in the input data is emphasised. The report concludes that in a short-term perspective, the quickest improvements may come from smaller modifications and implementa-tions of existing technology. In the longer-term perspec-tive, it points at new technological prospects, open moni-toring systems and ecosystem models for improved es-timates of growth and abundance of fish stocks. A possible way to approach fisheries assessment is through improved spatial representation of the biologi-cal processes. Hence the initiative to arrange the “Work-shop on marine spatial modelling”.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{influence}} of natural enemies and plant apparency {{in determining the}} abundance of the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae L. and the imported cabbageworm Pieris rapae L. was examined on collards grown in a collard monoculture and in a collard-alfalfa biculture. This design {{was used to examine}} the factors affecting collardherbivore abundance from a three-trophic-level perspective. Colonization rates of B. brassicae, the aphid parasite Diaeretiella rapae M'Intosh and the syrphid Sphaerophoria sulphuripes Thom. onto collards were higher in the monoculture, while P. rapae females laid more eggs on collards grown in the biculture. The abundance and diversity of foliar predators was'greater in the biculture, while the ground predator fauna did not vary as a whole relative to the habitat modification. Predators most commonly observed on the collard plants were the harvestman Phalangium opilio L., the orb-weaver Tetragnatha laboriosa Hentz and the dwarf spider Erigone dentosa O. P. Cambridge in the biculture and Coccinella trifasciata L. and E. dentosa in the monoculture. Serological analysis and natural enemy exclusion experiments indicated that D. rapae and S. sulphuripes were associated with significant mortality of B. brassicae in the monoculture while P. opilio was associated with significant mortality of both P. rapae and B. brassicae in the bicultOre. These results argue for including plant properties as parameters in models of herbivore-natural enemy relations: A. Plant apparency may influence the relation between herbivores and their natural enemies if both use the same cues for host location. B. Changes in plant apparency over time may have substantial effects on local population dynamics of herbivores and natural enemies. C. When herbivores respond differentially to plant apparency, relative abundance of herbivores on the host plant will change; this may cause switching of generalist predators from one herbivore to another, depending on the location of the host plant. D. Since plant apparency may often be inversely related to plant species diversity, decreases in plant apparency may be correlated with increased establishment of generalist predators that respond to plant species diversity. A three-trophic-level approach to theories on plant defense and <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations</b> would add to our understanding of patterns of herbivore abundance in nature and would offer a theoretical framework for the design of multiple cropping systems...|$|R
40|$|Knowing the {{structure}} of the food web within a community is of specific importance for the understanding of the dynamics of a community, which can lead to better predictions on how the system will react on (environmental) changes. For each combination of two species related to each other as predator and prey, the total impact of the predator species on the prey species can be calculated. This 'species impact' can be quantified by multiplying the effect individual predators have on the (entire) prey population — i. e. the 'per capita interaction strength'- with the density of the predator population. The most common approach of studying interaction strength between species in a community has been an experimental one. Recently, an observational approach has been developed, as an experimental approach can not be applied for all <b>predator-prey</b> <b>relations.</b> The observational approach has originally been developed to study interaction strengths between shorebirds and their prey. In this study the feasibility of the observational approach to study the effect of a marine predator - the starfish Pisaster ochraceus - has on various prey species of an intertidal rocky shore community is tested. Results show that Pisaster feeds selectively upon mussels even though other prey species are available. Acorn barnacles are avoided when possible or eaten in relation to their abundance. At the two sites tested Pisaster has a stronger per capita effect upon the mussel population than on the acorn barnacle population; other prey species remained more or less unaffected by the predation activity of the starfish. The predator has a stronger per capita effect upon the mussel population than on the barnacle population. In comparison with a previous study on the same species, the 'per capita effect' and 'species impact' were surprisingly low. Even though the starfish {{has proven to be a}} 'keystone species', the effect of the starfish on the prey population found ii this study was only comparable with that of a weak predator. The feasibility of the observational approach is discussed and it is indicated for which parameters more experiments are required before the observational approach can be used for this starfish. ...|$|R
