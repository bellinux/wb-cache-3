5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> the people of London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E

25|$|In {{reproductive}} rights, feminists {{sought the}} right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. Feminists hoped to use the first birth control <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to abortion was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{original}} {{plans for the}} enclosure of the marsh included {{the construction of a}} canal, it was not built, but there remained an intent to develop a quay on Braunton <b>Pill,</b> <b>to</b> replace the quay at Wrafton. To this end, three plots of land were bought in the 1840s, but no further progress was made, until the Bassett Estate was sold to Mr William Williams in 1852. Williams proposed a grand plan to straighten Braunton Pill, and to enclose further fringes of land, together with the area known as Horsey Island, a barren sandbank the enclosing of which Vancouver had suggested was doomed to failure in his original report of 1808. The work was to be financed by Williams, and the Marsh Inspectors, who had taken over responsibility for the marsh once {{the original}} enclosure had been completed, gave their approval.|$|E
25|$|Humbert {{retrieves}} Dolores {{from camp}} and tells her Charlotte has been hospitalized. He then takes {{her to a}} high-end hotel. Humbert wants {{to have sex with}} her and, to make her more compliant, he gives her a sleeping pill. As he waits for the <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> take effect he wanders through the hotel and meets an anonymous man who, in fact, is famous playwright Clare Quilty, a friend of the now-deceased Charlotte. Quilty talks to him ambiguously about Dolores. Humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room. There, he finds that the sedative was too mild after seeing Dolores drifting in and out of sleep. He dares not touch her that night, but in the morning Humbert is surprised when she initiates sex with him. While driving the next day, Humbert finally reveals to Dolores that her mother is dead after Dolores insists on calling her from a pay phone.|$|E
25|$|Before 1808, {{the area}} around Braunton, Velator, Wrafton and South Burrow was an {{extensive}} salt marsh. In that year, the Board of Agriculture sent Charles Vancouver to investigate the marsh, and his report recommended {{that it should be}} enclosed and reclaimed. This met with local approval, and James Green was appointed as engineer for the drainage scheme. Green commissioned John Pascoe to produce a survey and map (held by the Devon Record Office), which outlined two schemes. The first involved an embankment from the mouth of Braunton <b>Pill</b> <b>to</b> Bench Hill, with a canal from the Pill via Wrafton and the edge of Velator Marsh to some lime kilns near what is now Velator Quay. There were concerns about the cost of the project, and objections to parts of the first scheme from the Bassett Estate, and so it was the second scheme that formed the basis for the Act of Parliament obtained on 25 May 1811, for the Inclosing, Draining, and Embanking Lands in Braunton, in the County of Devon.|$|E

[...] Additionally, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR. [...] Additionally, in response to the threat of unwelcome LBOs, certain companies adopted a number of techniques, such as the poison <b>pill,</b> <b>to</b> protect them against hostile takeovers by effectively self-destructing the company if it were to be taken over (these practices are increasingly discredited).|$|E
500|$|The Allied naval commanders were {{disappointed}} {{by the failure of}} the 26 submarines directed against the Completion Force to inflict any damage on the ships. Fife concluded that this was due to the Completion Force's high speed, the poor weather conditions {{at the time of the}} operation and the Japanese ships being fitted with equipment that enabled them to detect submarines' radar signals. In a letter to Lockwood, he wrote that the failure of the submarines under his command [...] "was a bitter <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> take and I make no alibi". [...] Lockwood attributed the decision to deploy his submarines too far to the west on faulty intelligence, and told Fife that [...] "our dope certainly went sour at the last moment.

500|$|Brown {{voted for}} a state measure on patients' rights that, among other provisions, {{requires}} emergency rooms to provide {{what is known as}} the morning-after <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> rape victims to prevent an unwanted pregnancy from developing. [...] In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication, Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious Objector amendment which would have exempted these workers, as well as religious hospitals, from being required to provide this medication. [...] However, Brown's amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication, either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication, or, in the case of religious hospitals, to provide transportation to another facility, and in a timely manner. [...] The amendment did not pass. Brown remains in favor of allowing religious hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraception on moral or religious grounds, as he stated in the January 5, 2010 candidate debate.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in The Times in October 1969, John Russell Taylor praised {{the concept of}} the film as [...] "quite ingenious" [...] but suggested that the title and pre-release marketing had revealed too much of the plot for the film to sustain the interest of its audience. Commenting in New York magazine in November, Judith Crist introduced DoppelgÃ¤nger as [...] "a science-fiction film that comes up with a fascinating premise three-quarters of the way along and does nothing with it." [...] She praised the production as being [...] "nicely gadget-ridden" [...] and raising questions on the conflict between politics and science, but criticised the editing. Variety magazine cited a confusing plot, and related the crash of the Dove module to the coherence of the scriptwriting in its declaration that, [...] "Astronauts take a <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> induce a three-week sleep during their flight.

500|$|One {{week before}} the January special election, a {{controversy}} arose over a Coakley approved television ad. [...] The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights. [...] This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care (the morning-after <b>pill)</b> <b>to</b> rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care. Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, [...] "Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims," [...] over the ad's graphic which had the words, [...] "Deny care to rape victims." [...] Brown's daughter Ayla called the Coakley ad [...] "completely inaccurate and misleading", and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim.

[...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> swallow.

500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man".

[...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E

[...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas.

He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, whoâ€”according to himâ€”expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E

Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience.

500|$|There was no {{immediate}} pressure to extend the canal to Giant's Grave, as access to Neath for coastal vessels of up to [...] had been improved in 1791 by {{the construction of the}} Neath Navigable Cut.

Thomas Dadford again surveyed the route, but Edward Price from Gofilon acted as engineer. This part of the canal was financed by Lord Vernon, although he was also paid Â£600 for his Penrhiwtyn canal, which became part of the main line. The extension was completed on 29 July 1799, and terminated at a basin close to Giant's Grave Pill. Flood gates on the canal enabled water to be released into the <b>pill</b> <b>to</b> scour it of silt. The total cost of the project was about Â£40,000, which included 19 locks and a number of access tramways. Between 1815 and 1842, additional docks and wharfs were built at Giant's Grave, extending the canal slightly, and the canal was extended to Briton Ferry by the construction in 1832 of the Jersey Canal, which was about [...] long, and was built without an Act of Parliament by the Earl of Jersey.
