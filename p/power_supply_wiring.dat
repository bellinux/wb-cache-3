50|$|The {{most common}} {{interface}} uses the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>wiring</b> to the device. The circuit {{is a small}} surface mounted capacitor between an AC mains wire or a DC power wire and a single digital pin of a small microcontroller that switches a high-power transistor briefly on, then off. The pulses are normally generated by having software toggle a digital I/O pin on the microcontroller. They are received through another capacitor, by a microcontroller with a pin configured as an interrupt, or as a hardware timer's gate.|$|E
5000|$|One {{common cause}} is {{feedback}} through the plate power supply circuit. [...] The power supply provides DC current to each tube's plate circuit, so the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>wiring</b> (power busses) {{can be an}} inadvertent feedback path between stages. The increasing impedance of the filter capacitors at low frequencies can mean that low frequency swings in the current drawn by output stages can cause voltage swings in the power supply voltage which feed back to earlier stages, making the system a subaudio oscillator. This is caused by inadequate power supply filtering or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{measurement}} of capacitance variation, of an on-chip power distribution network (PDN) due to the change of internal states of a CMOS logic circuit, is studied. A state-dependent PDN-capacitance model that explains measurement results will be also proposed.

40|$|Manufacturers {{increase}} {{the use of}} electrical and electronic components {{in all kinds of}} products to provide new functions, improve performance and reduce the operational and development costs. The counterpart is the introduction of new constraints such as the electromagnetic vulnerability where the equipment functioning can be disturbed by electromagnetic effect. The perturbation can happen in various conditions: (1) Inside an electrical harness between <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> and command wire; (2) Between electrical harnesses; (3) Or because of external sources (electrical equipment, engines, Wi-Fi etc.) or natural ones like lightening. This concerns machine design, robotic assembly lines, devices for commercial buildings and public facilities, embedded systems (aircraft, trains, boats, tramways, drones), and in general, all automatic devices and electrical systems. To reduce the time to market, manufacturers need tools able to: (1) Detect bad electromagnetic effects as soon as possible: before prototyping, during the design phase; (2) Avoid cable shielding when it is not necessary: lighter equipment, less manufacture operations (welding). An electromagnetic simulator, integrated into an electrical CAD software suite, used during the design phase, on a simple PC connected to HPC, would allow the manufacturers to adapt the design to electromagnetic constraints before building the first prototype. As of today, they generally identify the problems during testing phase, if not on the customer site during the installation with all consequences behind that...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{systems in}} {{vehicles}} {{are used for}} advanced infotainment systems, control and automation systems, and safety critical systems. Due to increased importance of electronics in the modernization of vehicles, the size of cable harness is continuously increasing. Besides the DC wires a new cable needs to be wired for the addition of each feature in automotive environment. In addition to increased cost, the increased weight due to cabling also increases fuel consumption. 	Powerline communication (PLC) exploits AC or DC powerlines without need of additional wires. Successful PLC implementation for in-vehicle environment will ease the cable burden. Using DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>wires</b> as the transmission medium will enhance the vehicular efficiency. For vehicular PLC implementation, the major issue to be addressed is {{that the effects of}} interference in the vehicular environment in general, and electric cars in particular, are strong enough to seriously impair the communication link performance. Besides interference, the frequency selectivity of the transmission channel also plays a critical role. Therefore, particularly robust modulation and signal processing techniques need to be developed for this scenario. To overcome these issues, a robust multicarrier modulation scheme is proposed in this thesis for automotive environments. The main components of this scheme include Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with low-order modulation and repetition coding. Furthermore, the Polynomial Cancellation Coding (PCC) method is adopted for suppressing the side-lobes in OFDM processing and effectively suppressing narrowband interferences...|$|R

50|$|A second {{advantage}} of differential TTL, when correctly terminated, {{is that the}} differential pair of wires forms a current loop. The driver sources a current from the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> into one <b>wire.</b> This current passes along the wire to the receiver, through the termination resistor and back up the other wire, then back through the driver and down to ground. No net current is exchanged between the driver and receiver, which means {{that none of the}} signal current has to return through the ground connection (if there is one) between the two ends. This arrangement prevents the signal from injecting currents into the ground connection, which might upset other circuits attached to it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Smart stress-memory patch {{is a novel}} sensing {{method in}} {{structural}} health monitoring for evaluating fatigue damage. The patch can estimate the number of cycles and stress amplitude using fatigue crack growth properties in Paris region of thin metal sheets. In this study, near-threshold fatigue crack growth behavior in thin pure copper sheet was investigated under strain-controlled testing to improve the measuring range and accuracy. Using a function describing the initiation {{as well as the}} stable growth of fatigue cracks, the relationship between stress intensity factor range and crack growth rate was successfully fitted to one equation regardless of strain amplitude. Based on these experimental results, a new equation for estimating fatigue cycles and stress amplitude from fatigue crack length of two specimens was derived. This equation overcame the limitation that the patch requires two or more materials with different fatigue characteristics. The new equation needs only one material for simultaneous estimation of fatigue cycles and stress amplitude, and the measuring range can be controlled by geometry of specimen. Since this patch needs neither <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> nor <b>wiring,</b> it provides a great potential for long-term structural health monitoring with easy maintenance and low cost...|$|R
