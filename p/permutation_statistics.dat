40|$|We study q-analogues of k-Fibonacci {{numbers that}} arise from {{weighted}} tilings of an n× 1 board with tiles of length at most k. The weights on our tilings arise naturally out of distributions of <b>permutations</b> <b>statistics</b> and set partitions statistics. We use these q-analogues to produce q-analogues of identities involving k-Fibonacci numbers. This is {{a natural extension of}} results of the first author and Sagan on set partitions and the first author and Mathisen on permutations. In this paper we give general q-analogues of k-Fibonacci identities for arbitrary weights that depend only on lengths and locations of tiles. We then determine weights for specific permutation or set partition statistics and use these specific weights and the general identities to produce specific identities.

50|$|The {{statistics}} of random permutations, {{such as the}} cycle structure of a random permutation are of fundamental importance {{in the analysis of}} algorithms, especially of sorting algorithms, which operate on random permutations. Suppose, for example, that we are using quickselect (a cousin of quicksort) to select a random element of a random permutation. Quickselect will perform a partial sort on the array, as it partitions the array according to the pivot. Hence a permutation will be less disordered after quickselect has been performed. The amount of disorder that remains may be analysed with generating functions. These generating functions depend in a fundamental way on the generating functions of random <b>permutation</b> <b>statistics.</b> Hence it is of vital importance to compute these generating functions.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the question of}} computing the distribution of a <b>permutation</b> <b>statistics</b> over restricted permutations via enumeration schemes. The restricted permutations are those avoiding sets of vincular patterns (which include both classical and consecutive patterns), and the statistics are described {{in the number of}} copies of certain vincular patterns such as the descent statistic and major index. An enumeration scheme is a polynomial-time algorithm (specifically, a system of recurrence relations) to compute the number of permutations avoiding a given set of vincular patterns. Enumeration schemes' most notable feature is that they may be discovered and proven via only finite computation. We prove that when a finite enumeration scheme exists to compute the number of permutations avoiding a given set of vincular patterns, the scheme can also compute the distribution of certain <b>permutation</b> <b>statistics</b> with very little extra computation.

Moreover, since <b>permutation</b> test <b>statistics</b> do not require to be standardized, we do not assume that data are homoscedastic in the alternative.

The approach of building a central warehousing to integrate big data from all sources then becomes infeasible because of so large number of sources and continuous updates happening.

In this paper, we address the Time-Cost Minimization Problem for online query scheduling, and tackle the challenges of source <b>permutation</b> and <b>statistics</b> estimation to minimize the time cost of retrieving answers for the real-time receiving query.
