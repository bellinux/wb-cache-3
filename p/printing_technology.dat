5|$|In 1999, he {{launched}} Injet, an advertising and digital printing company that quickly grew in prominence with its expansion of billboard advertising throughout the capital. The business {{was the first}} to make digital <b>printing</b> <b>technology</b> available on the island. Local magazine Echo Australe, which named then-mayor of Antananarivo Marc Ravalomanana their Entrepreneur of the Year in 1999, bestowed the same honor on Rajoelina in 2000. Following Rajoelina's marriage in 2000, his wife's wealthy parents invested in Injet and allowed Rajoelina in 2001 to acquire Domapub, a competing Antananarivo-based billboard advertising business that they owned. The couple worked together to manage the family businesses, with Rajoelina responsible for Injet and his wife handling the affairs of Domapub. A competition organized by French bank BNI Crédit Lyonnais awarded first prize for best young entrepreneur in Madagascar to Rajoelina in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Social {{life during}} the Song was vibrant. Citizens {{gathered}} to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread {{of literature and}} knowledge was enhanced by {{the rapid expansion of}} woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable-type <b>printing.</b> <b>Technology,</b> science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished {{over the course of the}} Song. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although the institution of the civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the exams became a leading factor in the shift from a military-aristocratic elite to a bureaucratic elite.|$|E
40|$|Printing {{sensors and}} {{electronics}} over flexible substrates {{is an area}} of significant interest due to low-cost fabrication and possibility of obtaining multifunctional electronics over large areas. Over the years, a number of <b>printing</b> <b>technologies</b> have been developed to pattern a wide range of electronic materials on diverse substrates. As further expansion of <b>printed</b> <b>technologies</b> is expected in future for sensors and electronics, it is opportune to review the common features, complementarities and the challenges associated with various <b>printing</b> <b>technologies.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive review of various <b>printing</b> <b>technologies,</b> commonly used substrates and electronic materials. Various solution/dry printing and contact/non-contact <b>printing</b> <b>technologies</b> have been assessed on the basis of technological, materials and process related developments in the field. Critical challenges in various printing techniques and potential research directions have been highlighted. Possibilities of merging various printing methodologies have been explored to extend the lab developed standalone systems to high-speed roll-to-roll (R 2 R) production lines for system level integration...|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} movable type was not {{new in the}} 15th century; movable type {{printing}} had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, and was later used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type <b>printing</b> <b>technology</b> was developed in 1234. In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, {{the idea of creating}} a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prüfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy. However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 19th century the Authorized Version has {{remained}} almost completely unchanged – and since, due to advances in <b>printing</b> <b>technology,</b> it {{could now be}} produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible – {{both in terms of}} specific vocabulary, and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.|$|E
25|$|During {{the several}} decades {{that led up}} to the {{production}} of the Washington-Franklin issues the <b>printing</b> <b>technology</b> of U.S. Postage stamps was in many respects still in its development stages. As a consequence the U.S. Post Office would often receive complaints from the general public about its postage stamps. In 1869 the Post Office faced its first nationwide complaints when it issued a set of ten stamps that broke from the tradition of honoring and depicting statesmen (selected Presidents and Franklin) on the faces of all U.S. Postage stamps. Withering criticism also cited the small size and inconvenient shapes of the 1869 stamps and faulted their adhesive gum as inadequate. Consequently, this issue was short lived and pulled from post offices across the nation. As the years passed other complaints ranged from criticism about stamp subject and design, difficulty with perforations and even objections to the often unpleasant taste of the gum on the backs of stamps. Many of the criticisms also came from postal clerks who complained about the insufficiently varied choice of colors used on the issues, which sometimes resulted in the same or similar color appearing on several different denominations, making it visually difficult to sort mail quickly. Shortly {{after the turn of the}} 19th–20th century the problem of improving stamps and production prompted debates in Congress and the Senate, debates into which President Theodore Roosevelt sometimes injected himself. For example, Roosevelt argued that in observance of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, Lincoln should be included in the new definitive 1908 issue then being planned. Lincoln, however, was omitted: instead he would be honored with his own anniversary commemorative stamp in 1909. Many of the innovations employed in the production of the Washington-Franklin Issues were the result of this ongoing effort to improve on the production of U.S. Postage.|$|E

The limitation of this topology is that performance (particularly insertion loss) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths. The minimum width of gaps, like the minimum width of tracks, is limited by the resolution of the <b>printing</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
