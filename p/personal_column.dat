She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, [...] "I am pretty outspoken and have my own view on every subject. So {{it will be a}} good platform for me to air my views." [...] Her first column, [...] "The changing face of Bollywood", published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site's ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, [...] "Odds stacked against Indian women", Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, [...] "Incidences like these take away a woman's dignity, her space and her freedom...why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?" [...] The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, [...] "The darkness that all actors fear", was a more <b>personal</b> <b>column</b> and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled [...] "Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand", described her two near-death experiences in late 2004.|$|E

He has also appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1943, Orwell was {{appointed}} literary editor at Tribune, where his assistant was {{his old friend}} Jon Kimche. Orwell was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews and on 3 December 1943 started his regular <b>personal</b> <b>column,</b> [...] "As I Please", usually addressing three or four subjects in each. He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including Partisan Review, Horizon, and the New York Nation and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also {{a close friend of}} people on the right such as Powell, Astor and Malcolm Muggeridge. By April 1944 Animal Farm was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including T. S. Eliot at Faber and Faber) until Jonathan Cape agreed to take it.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Dan King {{conducted}} the etiquette department {{in a way}} worthy of the Family Guide itself. He is especially entitled to commendation because he laboured under the disadvantage of having to furnish most of the questions {{as well as the}} answers. Miss Felicity King has edited our helpful household department very ably, and Miss Cecily King's fashion notes were always up to date. The <b>personal</b> <b>column</b> was well looked after by Miss Sara Stanley and the story page has been a marked success under the able management of Mr. Peter Craig, to whose original story in this issue, [...] "The Battle of the Partridge Eggs," [...] we would call especial attention. The Exciting Adventure series has also been very popular.|$|E

6000|$|It was a {{favourite}} {{theory with}} Peter Ruff that the morning papers received very insufficient consideration {{from the majority}} of the British public. A glance at the headlines {{and a few of the}} spiciest paragraphs, a vague look at the leading article, and the sheets were thrown away to make room for more interesting literature. It was not so with Peter Ruff. Novels he very seldom read--he did not, in fact, appreciate the necessity for their existence. The whole epitome of modern life was, he argued, to be found among the columns of the daily press. The police news, perhaps, was his favourite study, but he did not neglect the advertisements. It followed, therefore, as a matter of course, that the appeal of [...] "M" [...] in the <b>personal</b> <b>column</b> of the Daily Mail was read by him on the morning of its appearance--read not once only nor twice--it was a paragraph which had its own peculiar interest for him.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Cooke {{made his}} {{permanent}} quarters at the Lake House, and soon {{became one of}} the best-known characters about town. He seemed to enjoy his popularity, and I am convinced that he would have been popular in spite of his now-famous quarrel with the railroad. His easy command of profanity, his generous use of money, his predilection for sporting characters, of whom he was king; his ready geniality and good-fellowship alike with the clerk of the Lake House or the Mayor, not to mention his own undeniable personality, all combined to make him a favorite. He had his own especial table in the dining-room, called all the waiters by their first names, and they fought for the privilege of attending him. He likewise called the barkeepers by their first names, and had his own particular corner of the bar, where none dared intrude, and where he could almost invariably be found when not in my office. From this corner he dealt out cigars to the deserving, held stake moneys, decided all bets, and refereed all differences. His name appeared in the <b>personal</b> <b>column</b> of one of the local papers on the average of twice a week, or in lieu thereof one of his choicest stories in the [...] "Notes about Town" [...] column.|$|E

According to The Daily Telegraph, she became so familiar with the styles of individual enemy operators that she could determine that two of them had a girlfriend called Rosa and this insight allowed her to develop a successful technique.|$|R
