25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} kind of diamagnetism one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field.

500|$|In a <b>perfect</b> <b>conductor</b> (...) , {{there would}} be no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the {{magnetic}} field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The perfect lens {{property}} of a dispersive and lossy lefthanded metamaterial disk is exploited to superimpose {{a source of}} electromagnetic radiation onto its mirror image, formed {{as a result of}} reflection from a <b>perfect</b> electric <b>conductor</b> or a <b>perfect</b> magnetic <b>conductor.</b> The superposition of a vertical wire-dipole antenna with its <b>perfect</b> electric <b>conductor</b> image results in an increase of the radiation resistance of the antenna compared with that of an antenna emitting in free space. On the other hand, if the same antenna is coupled to a <b>perfect</b> magnetic <b>conductor</b> image, it is shown that the result is the formation of a nonradiating configuration. The finite-difference time-domain analysis is performed, and this allows a detailed characterization of the systems. It is shown that the nonradiating system allows relatively large amounts of electromagnetic energy to be stored in the left-handed metamaterial disk and that is indicative of strong electromagnetic fields inside the material. This property is employed in a second-harmonic generation process and the potential of a nonradiating configuration as an efficient nonlinear device is demonstrated. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals...|$|R
50|$|An ideal shield {{would be}} a <b>perfect</b> <b>conductor</b> with no holes, gaps, or bumps {{connected}} to a perfect ground. However, a smooth solid highly conductive shield would be heavy, inflexible, and expensive. Such coax is used for straight line feeds to commercial radio broadcast towers. More economical cables must make compromises between shield efficacy, flexibility, and cost, such as the corrugated surface of flexible hardline, flexible braid, or foil shields. Since shields cannot be perfect conductors, current flowing {{on the inside of}} the shield produces an electromagnetic field on the outer surface of the shield.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>perfect</b> <b>conductor</b> with no {{resistance}} (a superconductor), surface eddy currents exactly cancel the field inside the conductor, so no magnetic field penetrates the conductor. Since no {{energy is lost}} in resistance, eddy currents created when a magnet is brought near the conductor persist even after the magnet is stationary, and can exactly balance the force of gravity, allowing magnetic levitation. Superconductors also exhibit a separate inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon called the Meissner effect in which any magnetic field lines present in the material when it becomes superconducting are expelled, thus the magnetic field in a superconductor is always zero.|$|E
