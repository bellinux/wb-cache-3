40|$|Introduction Functional food {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the prevention, management and treatment of chronic diseases. One of the most interesting techniques of functional food production is extrusion-cooking. Functional foods may include such items as <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals,</b> breads and beverages that are fortified with vitamins, some nutraceuticals and herbs. Due to its pharmacological activity, chamomile flowers are the most popular components added to functional food. Objective. Quantitative analysis of polyphenolic antioxidants, as well as comparison of various methods for the extraction of phenolic compounds from corn <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals,</b> <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals</b> with an addition of chamomile (3, 5, 10 and 20 %) and from Chamomillae anthodium. Material and Methods Two modern extraction methods – ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) at 40 o C and 60 o C, as well as accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) at 100 o C and 120 o C were used for the isolation of polyphenols from functional food. Analysis of flavonoids and phenolic acids was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results and Conclusions For most of the analyzed compounds, the highest yields were obtained by ultrasound assisted extraction. The highest temperature during the ultrasonification process (60 o C) increased the efficiency of extraction, without degradation of polyphenols. UAE easily arrives at extraction equilibrium and therefore permits shorter periods of time, reducing the energy input. Furthermore, UAE meets the requirements of ‘Green Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} of the effects of bed volumes and moisture contents on the textural properties of puff cereals. ^ The first study, two commercial <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals</b> were compressed both individually and in cells of different diameters and heights. Their force-displacement curves were jagged, irregular and irreproducible. The jaggedness of those curves were expressed in terms of their apparent fractal dimension determined from the Richardson plot and the box counting (Kolmogorov dimension) and in term of the mean magnitude of their Fourier power spectrum of their normalized residuals. Three dimensional plots of jaggedness measures versus cell diameter and height produced approximately planar relationship and could be described by the non linear models. Their extrapolation to the individual particle characteristic dimension gave jaggedness values in agreement with those determined experimentally on the individually particle. These results indicated that at least in a certain cereal products, it is possible to assess the brittleness of individual particles from their bulk compressibility pattern. Moreover, this procedure could also be used to estimate the particle stiffness expressed in terms of the fitted force at preselected displacement level (e. g. 15 % or 25 %) or in terms of the slope of peak force-displacement curve. ^ The second study was moisture content effects on the textural properties of three <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals</b> having various moisture contents. The jaggedness of the force displacement relationship of these cereals was determined in terms of the apparent fractal dimension and the mean magnitude of the power spectrum of their normalized residuals. The plots of these jaggedness measures versus moisture contents yielded a characteristic sigmoid shape very similar to the plots of corresponding sensory crispness or crunchiness versus moisture contents relationships. This close similarity illustrates that the jaggedness measures of the force displacement relationship is manifestation of the same failure events that produce the crispness and crunchiness sensation. In all three products, moisture toughening were detected instrumentally but only in two products, moisture toughening was a clearly corresponding increase in the sensory hardness scores. This indicates that at least in certain cereal products moisture toughening can be perceived simultaneously with brittleness loss. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Puffed</b> <b>cereals</b> are {{processed}} grain formulations commonly used as ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast foods and are appreciated mainly for their lightness and crispiness. Puffing process involves the release or {{expansion of gas}} within a product either to create an internal structure or to expand or rupture an existing structure. In this study, oven-puffing is performed using high-temperature, short-time (HTST) treatment with heated sand. Three varieties of parboiled milled rice namely Sukara, IR- 64 and Ziri, commonly used for making puffed rice, are studied and their physicochemical characteristics observed. The degree of expansion of the rice kernels {{is found to be}} affected by parameters which are connected with the compositional characteristics and processing of the grain. The optimum puffing conditions were found to be 15 s, 250 ˚C and 11 % (wet basis) for puffing time, sand temperature and final moisture content for all the three varieties respectively. Apart from physicochemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy images of transverse section of the kernels, under various conditions of puffing, are studied for their ultrastructural differences using image processing algorithms. Using these algorithms, the cellular structure of the grain is characterized to calculate the average area and the number density of pores as an indicator of the puffing quality. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} {{exists on}} Salmonella inactivation during extrusion processing, yet many outbreaks associated with low water activity foods since 2006 {{were linked to}} extruded foods. The aim {{of this research was}} to study Salmonella inactivation during extrusion of a model cereal product. Oat flour was inoculated with Salmonella enterica serovar Agona, an outbreak strain isolated from <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals,</b> and processed using a single-screw extruder at a feed rate of 75 kg/h and a screw speed of 500 rpm. Extrudate samples were collected from the barrel outlet in sterile bags and immediately cooled in an ice–water bath. Populations were determined using standard plate count methods or a modified most probable number when populations were low. Reductions in population were determined and analyzed using a general linear model. The regression model obtained for the response surface tested was Log (NR/NO) = 20. 50 + 0. 82 T − 141. 16 aw – 0. 0039 T 2 + 87. 91 aw 2 (R 2 = 0. 69). The model showed significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) linear and quadratic effects of aw and temperature and enabled an assessment of critical control parameters. Reductions of 0. 67 ± 0. 14 to 7. 34 ± 0. 02 log CFU/g were observed over ranges of aw (0. 72 to 0. 96) and temperature (65 to 100 °C) tested. Processing conditions above 82 °C and 0. 89 aw achieved on average greater than a 5 -log reduction of Salmonella. Results indicate that extrusion is an effective means for reducing Salmonella as most processes commonly employed to produce cereals and other low water activity foods exceed these parameters. Thus, contamination of an extruded food product would most likely occur postprocessing as a result of environmental contamination or through the addition of coatings and flavorings...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the main}} cause of death in the world. Several factors such as lifestyle can alter incidence of these diseases. Cardiovascular diseases originate from childhood; therefore, early prevention must begin from childhood and adolescence {{in order to be able}} to modify risk factors. The aim of this study was to identify modifiable (tobacco smoke exposure, physical inactivity, hypertension, obesity, incorrect dietary habits and high blood pressure) and non-modifiable (family history) cardiovascular risk factors in Hamedani adolescents. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive- analytic Cross- Sectional study, including 1000 students selected by stratified cluster sampling, from 8 high schools in Hamden, Iran. The subjects’ height, weight and blood pressure were measured and their body mass index (BMI) was calculated.   A questionnaire was used to obtain information on life style. Results: On the whole, 23 % of the participants had a family history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The data also showed that 10. 7 % of the participants had a BMI more than 25 kg/m&sup 2;, 59 % had no physical activity, more than 50 % had a high intake of salt,  and 67 % were exposed to passive tobacco smoke. The average length of time spent daily on watching T. V. or playing video games was 6 hours. Proportions of the subjects consuming saturated oils, high-fat dairy products, ready-to-eat foods, and junk foods (potato chips and <b>puffed</b> <b>cereals)</b> were 50. 8 %, 33. 1 %, 48. 6 %, and 75. 4 %, respectively.

Finally, 3. 4 % of the adolescents were smokers themselves and 25 % of them said that their friends smoked, while 67. 7 % were exposed to cigarette smoke from their smoker-relatives. Conclusion: Most of the Hamedani adolescents are at risk of cardiovascular diseases risk factors. Primary intervention programs should be designed and implemented aiming at promoting the health and nutritional awareness and, ultimately, practice, of the general population with particular emphasis on adolescents...|$|E

40|$|The {{differences}} between conventionally processed and extruded puffed rice were examined, {{with a view}} to determining the reasons for their different storage behaviour in confectionery. Differences between the two forms of puffed rice have been identified, both in their performance and their properties. Under certain viewing conditions, the starch granules in conventionally processed and extruded rice appear to be different. The starch granules in conventionally puffed Rice remain intact, but with no crystalline structure (i. e. no Maltese crosses are visible, though starch ghosts are abundant.) Cell walls of conventionally processed rice appear to be a layer of these gelatinised intact granules. The ghostlike granules have not undergone notable swelling, remaining slightly greater than 10 μm in diameter, similar to the size of unprocessed granules. In contrast, the starch granules in extruded puffed rice are rarely visible, in either their birefringent Maltese cross form, or as gelatinised but intact ghosts. By altering the extrusion conditions, the microscopic appearance of the product and its behaviour in water or water vapour becomes similar to that of conventionally processed rice. The extrusion parameters required for this similarity to conventionally processed rice fall within a window that is relatively narrow when compared to the ranges of variables available. Under more severe processing conditions the granules lose their integrity because shear and heat disrupt them. Under less severe conditions, the granules form clusters that do not gelatinise. The conditions at which this product is made cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from samples made under other conditions. However, at these extrusion parameters, the extrudate does not expand. It is necessary to expand the extrudate separately from the extrusion process. A novel method for the analysis of multi-peak force responses from compression of low moisture <b>puffed</b> <b>cereal</b> products was developed. This enabled crisp and crackly to be distinguished instrumentally. The results correlated well with sensory evaluation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Puffed</b> <b>cereal</b> grains {{are common}} food {{ingredients}} and rice cakes are increasingly popular. Relatively {{little has been}} published regarding the optimal conditions for the processing of the cakes, the mechanism of puffing or the adhesion of rice grains during processing. Accordingly the objectives of this study have been to examine the quality of rice cakes, the effect of processing variables and to investigate the mechanism of puffing and adhesion involved. A series of trials were run in which rice cakes were made with different levels of tempering moisture (16, 18 and 20 %), heating temperature (248, 258 and 268 °C), processing time (2, 4 and 6 sec) and the cycle time (5. 8, 6. 0 and 7. 0 seconds). In addition, selected types of rice (brown and white, waxy, low and high protein samples) have been evaluated along with the incorporation of either oil or sugar in the formulation. The physical properties of the resultant rice cakes were measured and {{it was found that}} the volume increased with increasing heating temperature and cooking time for brown rice samples at each of the tempering moisture levels evaluated. Similar results were found for white rice and when either oil or sugar was added to the formulation, whereas for cakes made with waxy rice, volume did not change. Textural attributes of the products were measured by a compressive analysis and data expressed in terms of stiffness. Relatively little variation was observed in this parameter except for cakes made with oil where the stiffness values were relatively low. Shorter cycle times during production were found to increase the volume and stiffness characteristics of the cakes. The scanning electron microscope was used to produce images showing the internal microstructure of rice cakes and from these cells size measurements were made. For all treatments the cell size distribution was relatively heterogeneous regardless of the processing variables applied or the type of rice. Differences were noted in the appearance of images depending on the way in which the samples were fractured indicating that different mechanisms applied for strong and weak cakes: in the former the crack develops through the grains, whereas in weak cakes the crack appears to form between the grains. There are two main factors contributing to the overall adhesion of the cake and hence product stiffness: the mechanical strength of adhesion between the surfaces of adjacent puffed rice grains and that of individual grains. The break strength of the cake is determined by whichever of these two is the weaker. In conclusion, the physical characteristics of rice cakes do not alter significantly with different processing variables. Higher processing temperatures appear to accelerate puffing. The present study contributes to an enhanced understanding of the effects of processing and compositional variables on the mechanisms of puffing and adhesion. Further research is recommended to extend our knowledge of the potential of other ingredients that might enhance the adhesion of rice cakes while allowing optimal puffing to occur...|$|R
