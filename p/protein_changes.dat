40|$|ABSTRACT Accurate {{prediction}} of <b>protein</b> stability <b>changes</b> resulting from single amino acid mutations {{is important for}} understanding protein structures and designing new proteins. We use support vector machines to predict <b>protein</b> stability <b>changes</b> for single amino acid mutations leveraging both sequence and structural information. We evaluate our approach using cross-validation methods on a large dataset of single amino acid mutations. When only {{the sign of the}} stability changes is considered, the predictive method achieves 84 % accuracy—a significant improvement over previously published results. Moreover, the experimental results show that the prediction accuracy obtained using sequence alone is close to the accuracy obtained using tertiary structure information. Because our method can accurately predict <b>protein</b> stability <b>changes</b> using primary sequence information only, it is applicable to many situations where the tertiary structure is unknown, overcoming a major limitation of previous methods which require tertiary information.

40|$|ABSTRACT Developmental {{changes in}} the plasma {{membrane}} proteins of Dictyostelium discoideum have been studied using metabolic labeling with []SS]methionine and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Pulse labeling for 1 h at the early interphase, late interphase, aggregation, and tip formation stages of development showed that the profile of newly synthesized plasma membrane <b>proteins</b> <b>changed</b> dramatically over this interval. Only 14 % of the polypeptide species were synthesized at all four stages at detectable levels; 86 % of the species changed over this developmental interval according to the criterion that they were synthesized at some {{but not all of}} the four stages tested. Long-term labeling during vegetative growth followed by initiation of development showed that the "steady-state " levels of the plasma membrane <b>proteins</b> <b>changed</b> very little over the same period. The only changes were in minor species (33 % overall change). Similar analyses of whole cell proteins showed 27 and 20 % change, respectively. Cell surface radioiodination revealed 52 external proteins in the plasma membrane. Comparison with the uniform methionine labeling results showed that these proteins were, with one notable exception, minor membrane components. In these external <b>proteins,</b> also, developmental <b>changes</b> were limited and were observed in the less abundant species...|$|R

40|$|International audienceProtein {{adsorption}} {{on solid}} surfaces {{is a widespread}} phenomenon of large biological and biotechnological significance. Conformational changes are likely to accompany protein adsorption, but are difficult to evidence directly. Nevertheless they have important consequences, since the partial unfolding of protein domains can expose hitherto hidden amino acids. This remodeling of the protein surface can trigger the activation of molecular complexes such as the blood coagulation cascade or the innate immune complement system. In the case of extracellular matrix, it can also change the way cells interact with the material surfaces and result in modified cell behavior. In this review, we present direct and indirect evidences that {{support the view that}} some <b>proteins</b> <b>change</b> their conformation upon adsorption. We also show that both physical and chemical methods are needed to study the extent and kinetics of <b>protein</b> conformational <b>changes.</b> In particular, AFM techniques and cryo-electron microscopy provide useful and complementary information. We then review the chemical and topological features of both proteins and material surfaces in relation with protein adsorption. Mutating key amino acids in <b>proteins</b> <b>changes</b> their stability and this is related to material-induced conformational changes, as shown for instance with insulin. In addition, combinatorial methods should provide valuable information about peptide or antibody adsorption on well-defined material surfaces.

Researchers report a 17% increase in specific muscle tension after a period of resistance training, despite a decrease in the presence of MyHC, myosin heavy-chain.

5000|$|Not all {{missense}} mutations lead to appreciable <b>protein</b> <b>changes.</b> An {{amino acid}} may {{be replaced by}} an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which case, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral, [...] "quiet", [...] "silent" [...] or conservative mutation.

When an amino acid may be encoded {{by more than one}} codon (so-called [...] "degenerate coding") a mutation in a codon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a silent mutation (a type of synonymous substitution, which is not always silent) and not a missense mutation.|$|E

The gene is overexpressed in cancers like lymphoma, leukemia, medulloblastoma and melanoma associated with chromosomal rearrangements. The CDK6 protein contains a catalytic core composed of a serine/threonine domain. This protein also contains an ATP-binding pocket, inhibitory and activating phosphorylation sites, a PSTAIRE-like cyclin-binding domain and an activating T-loop motif.

50|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} FRET efficiency is {{to measure the}} variation in acceptor emission intensity.

For monitoring <b>protein</b> conformational <b>changes,</b> the target <b>protein</b> is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci.

50|$|When binding to the {{signaling}} molecule, the receptor <b>protein</b> <b>changes</b> in {{some way}} and starts the process of transduction. A specific cellular response {{is the result of}} the newly converted signal. Usually, transduction requires a series of changes in a sequence of different molecules (called a signal transduction pathway) but sometimes can occur in a single step. The molecules that compose these pathways are known as relay molecules. The multistep process of the transduction stage is often composed of the activation of proteins by addition or removal of phosphate groups or even the release of other small molecules or ions that can act as messengers. The amplifying of a signal is one of the benefits to this multiple step sequence. Other benefits include more opportunities for regulation than simpler systems do and the fine- tuning of the response, in both unicellular and multicellular organism.|$|E
