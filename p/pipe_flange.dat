It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections with}} smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection.

The design and manufacture of a “pipe-flange connections” by use of composite materials is within the current technology. However, {{a number of major}} material challenges are questionable. This study will examine the structural design for <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections made of composite through experimentation and test results are compared with Finite Element Study.

The tests have been used to verify the numerical investigation of finite element analysis. The analysis section consists of the elasticity theory, finite element study and microstructure of the composite fibres that were used to develop a model to predict the collapse loads of the pipe-flange interface. The distribution of contact stresses which governs the sealing performance of pipe-flange interface is analysed as a contact problem, using theory of elasticity. The effects of the maximum stress caused in bolts are also analysed with the aid of Finite Element Analysis. For verification, experiments are carried out. These results from the model, the analytical results, were then compared to the experimental loads results and they are satisfactorily consistent...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.

Using the FE code ABAQUS, 3 -dimensional non-linear heat transfer analysis is carried out to simulate {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process. ANSI Class # 300 flange is used with a 6 mm thick, 200 mm long and 100 mm nominal diameter pipe. Joint type is a single ‘V-groove’ butt joint with a 1. 2 mm root opening.

Temperature dependent thermal properties as well as phase change effects have also been accounted. Apart from comprehensive discussion on the thermal history, in-depth analysis of the axial temperature profile at four different sections {{on both sides of the}} weld joint is presented. The simulated results showed that the temperature distribution around the implemented heat source model is steady when the weld torch moves around the circumferential joint.

Turbine jet engine operates at an open cycle called a jet propulsion cycle. A small-scale turbine jet engine comprises of the same element as the gas-turbine engine but in a smaller scale. Both engines differ in utilization and purpose of its production. Turbine jet engines were constructed mainly for air transportation while the small-scale turbine jet engines are developed for a wider purpose, ranging for research activity to hobbyist enthusiastic. Hence, this thesis encompasses the design, fabrication, and testing a small-scale turbine jet engine. The engine was derived from an automobile turbocharger, which provided the turbine and compressor component. A combustion chamber was design and fabricated. Engine support system comprised of ignition, lubrication and fuel delivery system were installed at the engine. The engine assembly was mounted in a test setup. Thermocouples were installed at three different stations on the engine flow path to measure the temperature. Fuel regulators were utilized to measure the fuel flow. The engine was started using a specific procedure until it self-sustained. During testing, the engine was only able to self-sustain approximated for 10 seconds at kg/s fuel mass flow rate. Troubleshooting and analysis regarding {{the failure of the}} engine was done. Analysis shows that there are four possible factors involves, namely, the uses of LPG fuel, large pressure drop at the exit of combustion chamber, low pressure pump and leaking at the turbocharger. Four recommendations were made for further studies, which are, utilize a brand-new turbocharger for the engine, use a pure propane gas as a source of fuel, avoid uses of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> at the combustion chamber and utilize a higher pressure pump for lubrication system.

40|$|ABSTRACT : Pipe and flange joints are {{commonly}} used in petrochemical, nuclear and process industries. Commonly, welding is used to make these joints which produces residual stresses and distortions. These stresses have {{detrimental effects on the}} structural integrity and service performance of the welded pipe joints. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the residual stresses and distortions during Gas Metal Arc Welding of pipe of schedule 40, nominal diameter 200 mm with different ANSI flanges of class numbers 150, 300, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500. Welding parameters including: voltage, current and heat as inputs were selected based on the literature available. The behaviour of the flanges of different classes is also discussed. In addition, the finite element methodology presented, in this paper, can be helpful for developing welding procedures for a range of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> welded joint sizes in order to control the residual stresses and deformations. This will lead to optimised performance during bolt up and operating conditions. ABSTRAK: Paip dan sambungan flan biasanya digunakan dalam industri petrokimia, nuklear dan proses.

40|$|Use of bolted {{flanged pipe}} joints {{is very common}} in petrochemical, nuclear and process industry. Welding of pipe to flange results in {{residual}} stress built up and distortions which provide negative effects on the structural integrity and sealing capability of the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> joint. The effects include stress corrosion cracking, brittle fracture, reduced fatigue and creep strengths, poor sealing performance and reduced buckling strength etc. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the extent and distribution of residual stress built up and distortions in the welded pipe-flange joints. The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in circumferential joint in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results. Chapter- 6, describes the effect of welding (Current and speed) and geometrical (pipe diameter and thickness) parameters on residual stress profile. In Chapter- 7, an analytical study regarding mitigation of residual stresses using mechanical stress relieving is presented and the effects of internal pressure, external pressure and axial pull on the residual stresses are determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed. In this chapter a numerical procedure for modeling of tack welds is suggested. In addition, the effect of tack weld locations on welding deformations and residual stresses are investigated and appropriate position for the tack welds is suggested. The effect of root gap is also analyzed and presented. Chapter- 9, consists of experimental and numerical studies describing the effects of external constraints during welding on the flange face distortions and over all residual stress profile.

40|$|Corrective Action Site (CAS) 02 - 37 - 02, Gas Sampling Assembly, is {{associated}} with nuclear test MULLET. MULLET was an underground safety test conducted on October 17, 1963. The experiment also involved prompt sampling of particulate material from the detonation, similar to CAS 09 - 99 - 06, Gas Sampling Assembly, which {{is associated}} with PLAYER/YORK. The sampling system at MULLET {{was similar to that}} of PLAYER/YORK and was used to convey gas from the MULLET emplacement hole (U 2 ag) to a sampling assembly. Beyond the sampling assembly, the system had a &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction with one branch running to a filter unit and the other running to a scrubber unit. The total system length was approximately 250 feet and is depicted on the attached drawing. According to the available background information, retrieval of the sample material from the MULLET event caused significant alpha (plutonium) contamination, limited to an area near ground zero (GZ). Test support Radiological Control Technicians did not detect contamination outside the immediate GZ area. In addition, vehicles, equipment, and workers that were contaminated were decontaminated on site. Soil contamination was addressed through the application of oil, and the site was decommissioned after the test. Any equipment that could be successfully decontaminated and had a future use was removed from the site. The contaminated equipment and temporary buildings erected to support the test were buried on site, most likely in the area under the dirt berm. The exact location of the buried equipment and temporary buildings is unknown. No information was found describing the disposition of the filter and scrubber, but they are not known to be at the site. The COMMODORE test was conducted at U 2 am on May 20, 1967, and formed the crater next to CAS 02 - 37 - 02. The COMMODORE test area had been surveyed prior to the test, and alpha contamination was not identified. Furthermore, alpha contamination was not identified during the COMMODORE re-entry survey, and routine surveys around the crater lip did not identify alpha contamination. Background information includes several radiological surveys conducted after these two tests. The MULLET area has been surveyed frequently. The early surveys indicate the area as both contaminated and containing buried radioactive material. A survey conducted in 1970 found the radiological/chemical piping partially intact, including the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction, and shows two runs of intact piping running past the U 2 am crater lip. The survey focused on the piping system itself and detected alpha contamination from 4 counts per minute (cpm) to 900, 000 cpm. The highest value was at a <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> between a dirt pile and a dirt berm within the current site fence line. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. A 1972 survey was essentially a repeat of the 1970 survey; however, it does not show the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction nor does it show piping extending past the U 2 am crater lip. It also shows a new fence line separating the radiological/chemical piping from the U 2 am crater area with all piping within the fence. Alpha contamination was detected on pipe flanges during the survey, but alpha contamination was not detected on the dirt pile or the dirt berm. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. Additional surveys were conducted in 1986, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996. One of the surveys focused on determining the extent of soil contamination around GZ. An alpha contamination plume extending approximately 200 feet south of GZ was detected in a swath approximately 100 feet wide. The maximum measurement was 15, 000 cpm alpha. All surveys show the piping within the fence line. Recent surveys (2007 and 2008) were performed around the current fence line by the demarcation group. No removable contamination was identified during these surveys. In late 2008, a visual inspection of the site was conducted by the National Security Technologies, LLC, Environmental Restoration group. All piping is within the fence line.
