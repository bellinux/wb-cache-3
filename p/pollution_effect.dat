Advertisers offer bids for how much {{they are willing to}} pay when someone enters a search query, sees the search results, and then clicks on one of their ads. Search engines typically order the advertisements for a query by a combination of the bids and expected clickthrough rates for each advertisement. In this paper, we extend a model of Yahoo‟s and Google‟s advertising auctions to include an effect where repeatedly showing less relevant ads has a persistent impact on all advertising on the search engine, an impact we designate as the <b>pollution</b> <b>effect.</b> In Monte-Carlo simulations using distributions fitted to Yahoo data, we show that a modest <b>pollution</b> <b>effect</b> is sufficient to dramatically change the advertising rank order that yields the optimal advertising revenue for a search engine. In addition, if a <b>pollution</b> <b>effect</b> exists, it is possible to maximize revenue while also increasing advertiser, and publisher utility.

It is common knowledge that heavy-metal pollution prevails within near-shore ocean sediments, and it might therefore be thought that either positive or conclusive negative evidence for lead pollution in the open oceans should also be readily found in pelagic sediments. But {{this is not the}} case: the processes that yield the <b>pollution</b> <b>effects</b> easily observable in coastal sediments also limit these effects from extending into the open oceans. Furthermore, mass-sedimentation rates in deep waters far from shore are so slight that there are serious difficulties in studying the very thin, uppermost, decades-old sediment layers involved, although <b>pollution</b> <b>effects</b> are enhanced by these small sedimentation rates.

In the presence of externalities, decentralization of an optimal path needs some specific taxes in addition to lump-sum transfers. The introduction of a market for pollution permits, concerning only the polluting sector, neutralizes the external environmental effects. We show that there is a unique management of permits such that the equilibrium coincides with the optimal path: all permits should be auctioned i. e. no free permits to firms. This conclusion is in contradiction with the usual practice of grandfathering. Optimal growth, environment, market of permits. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{regularity}} of {{the solution}} of elliptic partial differential equa- tions in a polygonal domain with re-entrant corners is, in general, reduced compared to the one on a smooth convex domain. This results in a best approximation property for standard norms which depend on the re-entrant corner but does not increase with the polynomial degree. Standard Galerkin approximations are moreover affected by a global <b>pollution</b> <b>effect.</b> Even in the far field no optimal error reduction can be observed. Here, we generalize the energy-correction method for higher order finite elements. It {{is based on a}} parameter-dependent local modification of the stiffness matrix.

40|$|We {{consider}} a controllability technique for the numerical {{solution of the}} Helmholtz equation. The original time-harmonic equation is represented as an exact controllability problem for the time-dependent wave equation. This problem is then formulated as a least-squares optimization problem, which is solved by the conjugate gradient method. Such an approach was first suggested and developed in the 1990 s by French researchers and we introduce some improvements to its practical realization. We use higher-order spectral elements for spatial discretization, which leads to high accuracy and lumped mass matrices. Higher-order approximation reduces the <b>pollution</b> <b>effect</b> associated with finite element approximation of time-harmonic wave equations, and mass lumping makes explicit time-stepping schemes for the wave equation very efficient. We also derive {{a new way to}} compute the gradient of the least-squares functional and use algebraic multigrid method for preconditioning the conjugate gradient algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the significant improvements in efficiency due to the higher-order spectral elements. For a given accuracy, spectral element method requires fewer computational operations than conventional finite element method. In addition, by using higher-order polynomial basis the influence of the <b>pollution</b> <b>effect</b> is reduced...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{generalized}} additive model (GAM) has become a standard tool for epidemiologic analysis exploring the effect of air pollution on population health. Recently, {{the use of the}} GAM has been extended from time-series data to spatial data. Still more recently, {{it has been suggested that}} the use of GAMs to analyze time-series data results in air pollution risk estimates being biased upward and that concurvity in the time-series data results in standard error estimates being biased downward. We show that concurvity in spatial data can lead to underestimation of the standard error of the estimated air <b>pollution</b> <b>effect,</b> even when using an asymptotically unbiased standard error estimator. We also show that both the magnitude and direction of the bias in the air <b>pollution</b> <b>effect</b> depend, at least in part, on the nature of the concurvity. We argue that including a nonparametric function of location in a GAM for spatial epidemiologic data can be expected to result in concurvity. As a result, we recommend caution in using the GAM to analyze this type of data.
