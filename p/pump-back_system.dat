The final cleanup plan for the site, projected to cost approximately $193 million, was issued in a Record of Decision on 29 September 2006, which called for a cap over the area of pits back-filled with waste during mining, consolidation and containment of the remaining waste within the two remnant open pits, removal of water entering the pits, and operation of a treatment system to treat contaminated water from the pits and seeps. In 2007, ground water tests had commenced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Mount Morgan Mine is a {{historic}} mine site located in Central Queensland, Australia. Between 1882 and 1981, a total of 7. 6 million ounces of gold and 360, 000 tonnes of copper were extracted using underground and later open cut mining methods. The mine closed in 1990 after the re-treatment of 28 Mt of tailings, which were placed into the open cut. Acid rock drainage (ARD) resulting from the exposure of sulphide-bearing waste at surface has heavily impacted the site and portions of the adjacent Dee River. The groundwater draining the mine site has low pH (2. 5 - 3. 5) and highly elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulphate, aluminium, iron, copper, zinc and various trace metals (Cd, Cr, Co and Ni). A groundwater flow model was developed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the seepage interception and <b>pump-back</b> <b>system</b> (SIS) currently in place. The calibrated groundwater flow model indicates that the backfilled (and flooded) Open Cut/Sandstone Gully (OCSG) represents the largest single source of ARD seepage (8. 0 L/s) on the site with tailings impoundments representing important secondary sources of seepage. An estimated 80 % of all seepage is collected by the seepage interception system (SIS). The remaining 20 % (or ~ 3 L/s) of ARD impacted seepage by-passes the SIS and enters the Dee River and underlying aquifer. A simplified load balance model was subsequently developed for the site to estimate the contaminant loads generated by the different mine waste units and by-passing the SIS. The flooded OCSG represents the largest single source of contaminant load. However, most of the seepage and associated load from this source is intercepted by the SIS. The results from the load balance model indicate that between 11 % and 25 % of the contaminants of concern (SO 4, Al, Cu, Fe Zn) by-pass the seepage interception system and report to the Dee River aquifer system. The model identified mine waste lying within the Shepherd’s catchment as the largest contributor to this by-pass load. The results of this load balance analysis will be used to assist in developing a closure and reclamation plan for the Mount Morgan mine site...|$|E
40|$|When mining {{activities}} {{in some parts}} of the Witwatersrand were discontinued in 2000, the defunct workings started to flood. In September 2002 the mine water started to decant from the West Rand Mine Basin (WRB) next to the Tweelopie East Stream. Treated water is currently used in the mine's metallurgical plants and 15 Ml per day of treated water is disposed firstly into the Cooke Attenuation Dam and then discharged into the Wonderfonteinspruit. The aim of this study was to find and provide remediation measures as a result of acid mine drainage and other impacting factors on the water quality and volume in the Wonderfonteinspruit. Conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were highest at the point where the tailings dam leached into the Wonderfonteinspruit. Sulphate was very high as was expected due to acid mine drainage. The best way to treat the high sulphate levels is with sulphate-reducing bacteria. To avoid the fatal flaw of many other constructed wetlands, a continuous carbon source is provided to the bacteria in the form of activated sewage from the Flip Human sewage treatment plant. Iron and other heavy metals are being precipitated through oxidation reactions to form oxides and hydroxides from the aerobic cell in the wetland. The wetlands are also known for their ability to reduce nitrate and microbial values with great success. In the remediation, four elements that currently do not comply with the SABS criteria for class 0 water, were chosen for improvement: conductivity, dissolved solids, sulphate and iron. Conductivity falls within class 1 and has a maximum of 178 mS/m @ 25 ºC that should be reduced to under 70 mS/m. Total dissolved solids have a value of 1585 mg/l, which is much higher than the prescribed 450 ml/l, making it class 2 water. The last two problematic elements are both considered as class 2 water: sulphate peaks at 592 mg/l where the preferred value is 200 mg/l, and iron should be 0. 01 mg/l, not the staggering 0. 3 mg/l. iv Alternative mitigation methods were identified and analysed for the impacts of the five major contaminators and ultimately the solution comes down to constructed wetlands. This is not a straightforward solution, however, and a specific design to accommodate all the different pollutants and water quality ranges was proposed. The other mitigation methods include a cut-off trench and <b>pump-back</b> <b>system</b> for the tailings dam, as well as the implementation of a monitoring programme. The sewage works should be optimised and better managed. Both the settlement and agricultural sector need to be educated on their representative impacts on the environment and government assistance should be available.
