40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of lying in prone <b>position</b> on a specially designed stretcher on the maternal-fetal hemodynamic parameters and comfort of pregnant women. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial with 33 pregnant women divided into 2 groups: pregnant group sequence 1 and pregnant group sequence 2. The order of <b>positions</b> used in sequence 1 was Fowler’s <b>position,</b> prone <b>position,</b> supine <b>position,</b> left lateral, Fowler’s <b>position</b> 2, supine <b>position</b> 2, prone <b>position</b> 2 and left lateral 2. The order of <b>positions</b> used in sequence 2 was Fowler’s <b>position,</b> prone <b>position,</b> left lateral, supine <b>position,</b> Fowler’s <b>position</b> 2, left lateral 2, prone <b>position</b> 2 and supine <b>position</b> 2. Each woman remained in each <b>position</b> for 6 minutes. For the statistical analyses, we used Wilcoxon’s test for 2 paired samples when comparing the prone <b>position</b> with the other <b>positions.</b> The variables are presented in graphs showing the means and 95 % confidence intervals. Trial Registration: Clinical Trial No. ISRCTN 41359519 RESULTS: All the parameters were within the standards of normality. There were no differences between <b>positions</b> in terms of maternal heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation and fetal heart rate. However, there were significant decreases in respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure in prone <b>position</b> 2 compared with left lateral 2. There {{was an increase in}} oxygen saturation in prone <b>position</b> compared with Fowler’s <b>position</b> and supine <b>position</b> 2 in both sequences. All the women reported feeling comfortable in the prone <b>position.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The prone <b>position</b> was considered safe and comfortable and could be advantageous for improving oxygen saturation and reducing the systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate...|$|R

40|$|Location-based {{services}} in general require {{information about the}} <b>position</b> of certain objects. For instance, for a navigation service the <b>position</b> of the user needs to be known. This <b>position</b> is usually provided by a <b>positioning</b> system. However, it is typical for all <b>positioning</b> systems {{that they are not}} perfect. This means that the <b>positions</b> they produce inherit <b>position</b> errors. Nowadays, usually only the <b>position</b> estimate is shown to the user even though a quality measure for the <b>position</b> error is provided by most <b>positioning</b> systems. To increase the user’s trust in location-based services and the usefulness of these services, the user should be informed about the uncertainty of <b>position</b> estimates as well. Thus, in this paper we investigate different visualization methods for the <b>position</b> and the <b>position</b> error. We carried out a user study to obtain information about the usefulness of the different methods. For this, we developed a questionnaire that contains nine different <b>position</b> and <b>position</b> error visualization methods. Furthermore, the questionnaire covers four typical application scenarios to be able to investigate whether users prefer different visualization methods for different applications. The results indicate that users are indeed interested in the <b>position</b> error they have to face. Further, they prefer a simple in-map representation of the <b>position</b> and the <b>position</b> error. These results are constant over different applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Position-based routing {{protocols}} make routing {{decisions based on}} the geographical <b>position</b> of the destination of a packet. Such protocols scale well since they do not require nodes to maintain explicit routes. Instead each node must know only its own <b>position,</b> the <b>position</b> of its neighbors, and the <b>position</b> of the destination. Thus, {{a critical component of}} position-based {{routing protocols}} is the <b>position</b> service that allows nodes to obtain the <b>position</b> of a destination node. In this paper we analyze the security vulnerabilities of positionbased routing protocols and virtual home region (VHR) -based distributed <b>position</b> service systems. We propose methods to protect the <b>position</b> information from both external and internal attackers. We then discuss and propose several mitigation mechanisms against <b>position</b> abuse by internal attackers that exploit the <b>position</b> service to trace their targets. Finally, we propose a <b>position</b> verification mechanism that allows the <b>position</b> service to verify that the <b>positions</b> reported by nodes are correct. I...|$|R
