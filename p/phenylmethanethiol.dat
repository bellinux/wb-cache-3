Minor volatile components identified in this secretion are <b>phenylmethanethiol,</b> S-phenylmethyl thioacetate, S- 2 -phenylethyl thioacetate, bis[(E) - 2 -butenyl] disulfide, (E) - 2 -butenyl 3 -methylbutyl disulfide, bis(3 -methylbutyl) disulfide, and S- 2 -quinolinemethyl thioacetate. This secretion {{is similar to that}} of the striped skunk, Mephitis mephitis, differing only in that it contains four compounds not reported from the striped skunk: <b>phenylmethanethiol,</b> S-phenylmethyl thioacetate, 2 -phenylethanethiol, and S- 2 -phenylethyl thioacetate. Key Words—Mephitidae, Mephitis macroura, hooded skunk, anal sac secretion, (E) - 2 -butene- 1 -thiol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol, S-(E) - 2 -butenyl thioacetate...|$|E
40|$|A {{suitably}} substituted pyrimidine 1 {{was converted}} {{to a number of}} title compounds. Nucleophilic substitution involving the chlorine atoms in 1 by treatment with <b>phenylmethanethiol</b> yielded 2 or 3, depending on the reaction temperature. Treatment of 3 with an amine afforded 6 -​phenylmethanesulfanyl-​N 4 -​substituted-​ 2 -​phenyl-​pyrimidine-​ 4, 5 -​diamines 4 -​ 7. These pyrimidines were converted into 2 -​phenylpurines 8 -​ 11 and 2 -​phenyl-​ 8 -​azapurines 12 -​ 14, by treatment with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of hydrochloric acid (or acetic anhydride), or with potassium nitrite and acetic acid respectively. The thioether function on C(6) was then converted into a sulfonyl group by oxidation with m-​chloroperoxybenzoic acid affording purines 15 -​ 18 and their 8 -​azaanalogs 19 -​ 21; these compounds, as crude products, were treated with an amine to yield the corresponding adenines 22 -​ 25 or 8 -​azaadenines 26 -​ 31. All reactions were performed under conditions compatible with the possible use of a thiomethyl resin in place of <b>phenylmethanethiol</b> to bind the pyrimidine ring of 1 to a solid phase...|$|E
40|$|S,S’-(2, 6 -Diaminopyridine- 3, 5 -diyl) dibenzenecarbothioate {{was formed}} by {{condensing}} 2, 6 -diamino- 3, 5 -dithiopyridine and benzoyl chloride {{in the presence of}} pyridine. Also S-benzyl benzenecarbothioate was prepared by the condensation of benzoyl chloride and <b>phenylmethanethiol</b> in the presence of pyridine. The complexes of these compounds were prepared using copper(II) and manganese(II) chloride salts. The thiolates were characterized {{on the basis of their}} electronic, infrared and NMR spectra whereas the complexes were characterized via electronic and infrared studies. The IR spectral studies indicate that the ligands coordinated through the carbonyl oxygen, the sulphur atom and also with the amino group in DBCT. Antimicrobial studies on the ligands and their complexes showed varying degrees of inhibition on the growth of the following microorganisms; Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) and Candida albicans (ATCC 2091). The compounds showed no activity against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922...|$|E
