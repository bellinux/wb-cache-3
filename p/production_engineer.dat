25|$|The {{exterior}} of the FJ concept remained largely unchanged when the final production model debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. However, chief <b>production</b> <b>engineer</b> Akio Nishimura had to significantly alter the amenities offered in Chergosky's interior concept to keep {{the price of the}} production FJ Cruiser reasonable. Unique interior touches like the gear shifter that doubled as a shovel handle, removable interior lights which doubled as flashlights, and flat-folding front seats were removed, though several concept items remained as factory options.|$|E

2500|$|The {{product was}} code named the VIC-40 as the {{successor}} to the popular VIC-20. The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura, Shiraz Shivji, Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished {{in time for the}} show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both Thanksgiving and Christmas weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the user interface shell and was available immediately on startup at the READY prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, as recalled by <b>Production</b> <b>Engineer</b> David A. Ziembicki: [...] "All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'" [...] The answer was vertical integration; due to Commodore's ownership of MOS Technology's semiconductor fabrication facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of [...]|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941 it {{was decided}} that DH Canada would build Mosquitos at Downsview, Ontario. This was to {{continue}} even if Germany invaded Great Britain. Packard Merlin engines produced under licence were bench-tested by August and the first two aircraft were built in September. [...] Production was to increase to fifty per month by early 1942. Initially, the Canadian production was for bomber variants; later, fighters, fighter-bombers and training aircraft were also made. DH Chief <b>Production</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Harry Povey, was sent first, then W. D. Hunter followed on an extended stay to liaise with materials and parts suppliers. As was the case with initial UK production, Tego-bonded plywood and birch veneer was obtained from firms in Wisconsin, principally Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing, Marshfield. Enemy action delayed the shipping of jigs and moulds and {{it was decided}} to build these locally. [...] During 1942, production improved to over 80 machines per month, as sub-contractors and suppliers became established. [...] A mechanised production line based in part on car building methods started in 1944. When flight testing could no longer keep up, this was moved to the Central Aircraft Company airfield, London, Ontario, where the approved Mosquitos left for commissioning and subsequent ferry transfer to Europe.|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas {{production}} involve potential danger to human lives, environment and economy. Everyday decisions and actions {{can lead to}} catastrophes. <b>Production</b> <b>engineers</b> are {{a group of people}} responsible for getting oil and gas from the subsurface reservoir to a processing plant. In order to do this in an efficient and safe manner the engineers require a set of skills that we argue they cannot get from education alone. In order to become proper <b>production</b> <b>engineers,</b> they have to become members of a community of practice. A knowledgeable <b>production</b> <b>engineers</b> must acquire a contextual understanding of the world of oil and {{gas production}}. However, this world changes from oil field to oil field. Hence, it is important that new engineers are initiated into the existing practices of the organization. Our primary question is, how are new members introduced to the community practices in order to become a knowledgeable engineer? We contribute by characterizing strategies and mechanisms for helping newcomers become knowledgeable members of a community...|$|R
