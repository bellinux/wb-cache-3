25|$|One minute {{into the}} fourth quarter, Septien kicked a 22-yard field goal that {{cut the deficit}} to 21-20. Then Walls {{recovered}} a fumble from running back Walt Easley at midfield to set up White's 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Cosbie, giving Dallas a 27–21 advantage. Things got even better for Dallas when Walls recorded his second interception from Montana on the next drive at the Cowboys 27. Dallas managed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> first downs, but was forced to punt, and White's kick gave San Francisco the ball at their own 11 with 4:54 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Sydney FC's title defence {{did not go}} smoothly. The club lost {{key players}} from its championship-winning side {{including}} Steve Corica (retired), Karol Kisel (return to Europe), Simon Colosimo, John Aloisi, and Clint Bolton (all Melbourne Heart). The club however picked up the services of former Socceroo Nick Carle from his stint in England with Crystal Palace. This wasn't enough to steer the team in the right direction. The club was winless for the first ten rounds of the competition. Sydney FC managed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> points {{over the next few}} rounds but another five game losing streak ensured they would not qualify for the finals competition, finishing ninth. The third season under Lavicka began with the major signing of Blackburn Rovers player Brett Emerton to a three year deal. The signing was significant in that Emerton became the first player to directly exchange the FA Premier League for the A-League by terminating his Rovers contract one year early. The season however, only provided minimal success as the club scraped through to the finals series with a 3–2 win over Newcastle Jets in the final round of the regular season. Before {{the end of the season}} the club announced that head coach Lavicka's contract would not be renewed for the following season.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{the actress}} had three releases, {{the first of}} which was Abbas-Mustan's action thriller Race, a story about two stepbrothers-turned-rivals who are in {{contention}} for their father's insurance money. Kaif played Saif Ali Khan's secretary, who is his stepbrother's (Akshaye Khanna) lover. Nikhat Kazmi was appreciative of the film, praising its [...] "super cool look [...] testosterone-high action sequences" [...] but found Kaif [...] "too pale" [...] in her role. After Race, Kaif rejoined Akshay Kumar in Anees Bazmee's action comedy Singh Is Kinng. The film earned [...] worldwide, making it Kaif's sixth consecutive box-office success. However, she received mixed reviews for her performance. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN reviewed: [...] "Katrina Kaif is an eyesore... her acting so weak you want to urge her to watch everyone from Madhubala to Madhuri so she might <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tricks".|$|E

2500|$|Strengthening the {{affiliate}} {{station group}} {{was a third}} matter of importance to the network. [...] While the network had 116 stations in January 1942 and 155 stations as of June 1943, this still meant that it could only offer to advertisers coverage of approximately 76% of the radio homes in the United States. [...] In this sense, the moves by the FCC to loosen {{the provisions of the}} contracts binding affiliated stations to networks helped the Blue. [...] This allowed the Blue Network to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> additional stations in 1944, including (ironically) a few from Mutual This was one of its priorities, as in general the Blue Network had inherited smaller and less powerful stations than the group of stations that had made up its former twin sister network.|$|E
2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also tried to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words of the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. That was {{a good part of}} my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small musical box along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm portrait lens and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic slides into prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E
