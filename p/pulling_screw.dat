40|$|Simulation of monomeric {{material}} transport in reactive extrusion {{revealed that}} two different situations {{can be distinguished}} in the partially filled zone of a twin-screw extruder. Material is transported {{from the bottom of}} the barrel to the top of the screw by drag or material remains on the bottom of the channel because of gravity. Which process takes place can be predicted when the ratio between the Froude number (gravitation forces) and the Reynolds number (viscous forces) is known. From experiments in a perspex model of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, using glycerol and silicone oil as model fluids, it could be observed which situation can be expected at different filling degrees, screw speeds, throughputs, and viscosities. In the case of a constant filling degree, material moves up with the screw flight at a certain value of Fr/Re. At higher Fr/Re ratios, a larger filling degree is needed for the screws to drag material up with the screw flights. When the filling degree reaches one-half, material moves up with both the pushing and the <b>pulling</b> <b>screw</b> flight. On the basis of these observations, a model is proposed to determine the backflow in the partially filled zone of a corotating, selfwiping, twin-screw extruder, dependent on viscosity and screw speed. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{stress field}} {{developed}} in the human lumbar vertebral bone due {{to the presence of}} transpedicular fixation screws is studied in an attempt to quantify the force required to <b>pull</b> the <b>screw</b> out of the bone. The study is focused on the pure pull-out phenomenon, namely the case in which the external loads act parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw. The parameters considered are the penetration ratio, i. e. the ratio of the screw length divided by the distance from the posterior pedicle entrance site to the anterior vertebral cortex, and the filling ratio, i. e. the ratio of the major diameter of the screw divided by the transverse diameter of the pedicle. The study is carried out numerically with the aid of the finite element method. The analysis takes into account both the variation of the mechanical properties of the bone in terms of the distance from its surface as well as the geometrical details of a typical transpedicular screw.

40|$|Screws {{are widely}} used for the {{internal}} fixation of fractures, either alone or with plates. Constant improvement in design and in operative techniques has led to increased holding power, which now exceeds the shear strength of bone. In fact, if one tries to pull out a freshly inserted screw, the bone threads do not strip but the <b>screw</b> <b>pulls</b> out a small cone-shaped button of compact bone (Bechtol 1971). If one considers only the result of such an immediate test, the question of bone formation around the screws {{would seem to be}} of no interest, as a further increase in holding power would have no practical importance. In cases of accidental stripping of screws, however, bone healing certainly is a matter of considerable importance, as shown by Bechtol (1959). In fact, he found that during the first four weeks after insertion of a screw the holding power exceeded the initial stripping torque, though it should be carefully noted that these screws, once in place, were not subjected to any mechanical forces. Though the enormous holding power of screws in compact bone generally persists during the course offracture healing, clinical experience shows that a plate and its screws are sometimes avulsed from bone. In such cases no bone can be detected around the screws. Moreover...|$|R
40|$|Key words: {{fracture}} {{of the neck}} of the femur, fixation with screws, canulated screw, duplex screw In our country the most prevalent procedure to treat displaced fractured neck of the femur is the method of double canulated femoral neck screw developed by Professor Jenő Manninger and coworkers. The aim while elaborating this method was to synthesize displaced fractured neck of the femur and to ensure the highest possible stability with the minimal operative strain. An essential condition of successful recovery is the enhancement of the stability of the fixation of fractures. However, at old age the layer of spongiosa becomes so porous that the threads of screws used for the treatment of the {{fracture of}} {{the neck of the}} femur virtually fulfil their fixing function only in the subchondral region – less and less in the inner layer of the spongiosa. But, in the subchondral region, the outer layer of 4 to 5 mm remains relatively dense. To increase stability, we modified the traditionally – shaped canulated screws, used for the neck of the femur to date, and developed duplex-threaded screws for the neck of the femur. One of the basic criteria {{of the success of the}} operation is the positioning of the screws related to anatomical landmarks and to each other. We examined both traditional and duplex screws with altered thread profile in several conditions applying finite element calculations. Normal pull-out force was applied in order to compare the results in case of both traditional and duplex screws. It showed that the duplex screw increase the pull-out force by 65 % compared to the traditional screws. In case of 5 ° positioning error we found that the power needed for <b>pulling</b> the <b>screw</b> out was decreased by at least 10 - 17 %, depending on the direction of the positioning error but it was less (6 - 9 %) in case of duplex screws. The loading capacity of the models with spongiosa bone matter differs from that of the subchondral bone layer models by at least 12 - 20 % depending, on the shape of the screw and the material law. ...|$|R

Complications {{of these techniques}} include cutout or {{back out of the}} screws and plates, avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion, nail migration, rotator cuff impairment and impingement syndromes. Insufficient anchorage from conventional implants may lead to early loosening and failure, especially in osteoporotic bones. In general, nonoperative treatment of displaced three and four-part fractures of the proximal humerus leads to poor outcome due to intraarticular nature of injury and inherent instability of the fragments. Comminuted fractures of the proximal humerus are at risk of fixation failure, screw loosening and fracture displacement. Open reduction and internal fixation with conventional plate and screws has been associated with unacceptably high incidence of <b>screw</b> <b>pull</b> out.

30|$|This biomechanical study {{demonstrates}} that a plate placed medially {{is a more}} stable construct for this specific fracture simulation, namely medial comminution with the lateral cortex in contact to share load. These are conclusions drawn from an in vitro study, which emulates a clinical scenario. Anatomical reduction without undue biological disruption in metaphyseal comminuted fractures is rarely possible, leaving mechanical stability to be paramount. This {{has been shown to}} influence bony union positively [15]. Lateral plating alone supports the medial column indirectly and allows for a greater stress concentration on that side. Failure of fixation, through plate breakage, <b>screw</b> <b>pull</b> out and varus collapse, is a potential complication [16] and are more likely with lateral than medial plates. The biomechanical reasons are several. Firstly, there are reduced bending moments when using medial plates on the femur as the mechanical axis, which by definition runs from hip centre of rotation to ankle and falls slightly medial at the knee. This bending moment (load × moment arm) gives rise to the deformation; the moment arm of the load is the distance from the line of action of the load (mechanical axis) to the neutral axis of the bone and plate. The plate in turn draws the neutral axis from the centre of the femur towards the plate. Lateral plating increases the moment arm and hence increases the moment and deformation force. Conversely, with the medial plate the moment arm is smaller, and thus, deformation and plate strains would be lower. The total construct strain as recorded is much lower on the medial-sided plate, and there is no yielding. Thus, the lateral plate is more likely to undergo plastic deformation, resulting in earlier failure of the bone–plate construct. The different strain patterns recorded along different points on the plates also differed; higher strains, and thus less stability, were recorded across the wedge in the lateral plate construct.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Medial open wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} is {{a well-established}} procedure {{for the treatment}} of unicompartmental osteoarthritis and symptomatic varus malalignment. We hypothesized that different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for the various wedge sizes in a finite element (FE) analysis. METHODS Four types of fixation were compared: 1) first and 2) second generation Puddu plates, and 3) TomoFix plate with and 4) without bone graft. Cortical and cancellous bone was modelled and five different opening wedge sizes were studied for each model. Outcome measures included: 1) stresses in bone, 2) relative displacement of the proximal and distal tibial fragments, 3) stresses in the plates, 4) stresses on the upper and lower screw surfaces in the screw channels. RESULTS The highest load for all fixation types occurred in the plate axis. For {{the vast majority of the}} wedge sizes and fixation types the shear stress (von Mises stress) was dominating in the bone independent of fixation type. The relative displacements of the tibial fragments were low (in μm range). With an increasing wedge size this displacement tended to increase for both Puddu plates and the TomoFix plate with bone graft. For the TomoFix plate without bone graft a rather opposite trend was observed. For all fixation types the occurring stresses at the screw-bone contact areas <b>pulled</b> at the <b>screws</b> and exceeded the allowable threshold of 1. 2 MPa for at least one screw surface. Of the six screw surfaces that were studied, the TomoFix plate with bone graft showed a stress excess of one out of twelve and without bone graft, five out of twelve. With the Puddu plates, an excess stress occurred in the majority of screw surfaces. CONCLUSIONS The different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for different opening wedge sizes. Based on the computational simulations, none of the studied osteosynthesis fixation types warranted an intransigent full weight bearing per se. The highest fixation stability was observed for the TomoFix plates and the lowest for the first generation Puddu plate. These findings were revealed in theoretical models and need to be validated in controlled clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Biomechanical {{studies have}} shown C 2 pedicle screw {{to be the most}} robust in insertional torque and pullout strength. However, C 2 pedicle screw {{placement}} is still technically challenging. Smaller C 2 pedicles or medial localization of the vertebral artery may preclude safe C 2 pedicle screw placement in some patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the pullout strength of spinous process screws with pedicle screws in the C 2. Materials and Methods: Eight fresh human cadaveric cervical spine specimens (C 2) were harvested and subsequently frozen to - 20 °C. After being thawed to room temperature, each specimen was debrided of remaining soft tissue and labeled. A customs jig as used to clamp each specimen for screw insertion firmly. Screws were inserted into the vertebral body pairs on each side using one of two methods. The pedicle screws were inserted in usual manner as in previous biomechanical studies. The starting point for spinous process screw insertion was located at the junction of the lamina and the spinous process and the direction of the screw was about 0 ° caudally in the sagittal plane and about 0 ° medially in the axial plane. Each vertebrae was held in a customs jig, which was attached to material testing machine (Material Testing System Inc., Changchun, China). A coupling device that fit around the head of the screw was used to <b>pull</b> out each <b>screw</b> at a loading rate of 2 mm/min. The uniaxial load to failure was recorded in Newton′st dependent test (for paired samples) was used to test for significance. Results: The mean load to failure was 387 N for the special protection scheme and 465 N for the protection scheme without significant difference (t = − 0. 862, P = 0. 403). In all but three instances (38 %), the spinous process pullout values exceeded the values for the pedicle screws. The working distances for the spinous process screws was little shorter than pedicle screws in each C 2 specimen.

The blood loss at surgery averaged 778  ±  285  ml in the traditional group and 585  ±  188  ml in the SMA group (P <  0. 05). Operative time averaged 284  ±  53  min in the SMA group and 324  ±  41  min in the traditional group (P <  0. 05). In the SMA group, the preoperative major curve was 92. 6 ° ±  13. 7 ° with a flexibility of 25. 5  ±  7. 3 % was corrected to 29. 4 ° ±  5. 7 ° demonstrating a 68. 4 % immediate postoperative correction.

40|$|Purpose: The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} the understanding of biomaterial surface modifications and local delivery of osteoporosis drugs for bone integration. We therefore (i) characterised and investigated model surface coatings for controlled drug delivery in a rat tibia screw model (ii) elucidated the effect of surface treatment for activation of complement system in vitro. Materials and methods: Bisphosphonate was immobilised directly to implant surfaces by two methods. In the first method, bisphosphonate was bound via a crosslinked fibrinogen layer to titanium surfaces. In the second method, stainless steel screws were first dip coated in a TiO 2 solgel, and thereafter incubated in simulated body fluid (SBF). The so prepared thin calcium phosphate layer on titania bound then bisphosphonate directly with high affinity. The drug release kinetics was determined in vitro by 14 C marked alendronate that was quantified with scintillation techniques. The screws were inserted in the metaphysis of rat tibia and the mechanical fixation monitored by screw pullout measurements after 2 or 4 weeks of implantation. In order to compare two different osteoporosis drugs, bisphosphonate and strontium ranelate, stainless steel and PMMA screws were inserted in the tibial metaphysis of rat for 4 and 8 weeks. Bisphosphonate was then delivered subcutaneously and strontium ranelate orally during the whole implantation period. The mechanical fixation was analysed by pullout force measurements, and bone architecture studied by micro-computed tomography (μCT). The immune complement activation on sol-gel- and smooth titanium surfaces was analysed in human blood plasma before and after annealing of titanium at 100 - 500 ºC or upon UVO-treatment for up to 96 hours. Results: Bisphosphonate coated screws enhanced the <b>screw</b> <b>pull</b> out force after 2 weeks of implantation by more than 30 % (fibrinogen coating) and by 93 % after 4 weeks (sol-gel derived TiO 2 coating). Systemically administered bisphosphonate enhanced the mechanical screw fixation after 4 weeks by more than 96 % and after 8 weeks by more than 55 % as compared to strontium ranelate treated animals (p = 0. 00). Strontium ranelate treatment did not show significant improvement of screw pullout force after 4 and 8 weeks, compared to control. The immune complement surface deposition from blood plasma vanished irreversibly after Ti heat treatment at 250 - 300 ºC during 30 minutes or after UVO exposure for 24 hours or longer. Tentatively, changes in surface water/hydroxyl binding upon heat- and UVO treatments were observed by XPS and infrared spectroscopy. Conclusions: The results show that fixation at short implantation time (weeks) of orthopaedic implant can be enhanced by immobilised bisphosphonate on stainless steel or titanium implants. Systemic delivery of strontium ranelate showed no significant effect on implant fixation in rat tibia, and we hypothesise therefore that strontium ranelate will not become a power tool to increase the early implant fixation, but may be beneficial at longer times. Heat annealing or UVO-treatment of titanium surfaces change the surface hydroxylation, leading to decreased immune complement deposition from blood plasma...|$|R
40|$|A non-randomised {{retrospective}} study {{to compare the}} results of surgical correction of scoliosis in Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using three different instrumentation systems—Sublaminar instrumentation system (Group A), a hybrid of sublaminar and pedicle screw systems (Group B) and pedicle screw system alone (Group C). Between 1993 and 2003, 43 patients with DMD underwent posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. Group A (n =  19) had sublaminar instrumentation system, Group B (n =  13) had a hybrid construct and Group C (n =  11) was treated with pedicle system. The mean blood loss in Group A was 4. 1  l, 3. 2  l in Group B and 2. 5  l in Group C. Average operating times in Group A, B and C were 300, 274 and 234  min, respectively. Mean pre-operative, post-operative and final Cobb angle in Group A was 50. 05  ±  15. 46 °, 15. 68  ±  11. 23 ° and 21. 57  ±  11. 63 °, Group B was 17. 76  ±  8. 50 °, 3. 61  ±  2. 53 ° and 6. 69  ±  4. 19 ° and Group C was 25. 81  ±  9. 94 °, 5. 45  ±  3. 88 °, 8. 90  ±  5. 82 °, respectively. Flexibility index or the potential correction calculated from bending radiographs were 60  ±  6. 33, 70  ±  4. 65 and 67  ±  6. 79 % for Group A, Group B and Group C respectively. The percentage correction achieved was 72. 5  ±  14. 5 % in Group A, 82  ±  6 % in Group B and 82  ±  8 % in Group C. The difference between percentage correction achieved and the flexibility index was 12. 45  ±  8. 22, 12. 05  ±  1. 3 and 15. 00  ±  1. 21 % in Group A, B and C, respectively The percentage loss of correction in Cobb angles at final follow-up in Group A, B and C was 12. 5  ±  3. 5, 16. 5  ±  1. and 12. 5  ±  2. 5 %, respectively. Complications seen in Group A were three cases of wound infection and two cases of implant failure; Group B had a single case of implant failure and Group C had one patient with wound infection and one case with a partial <b>screw</b> <b>pull</b> out. Early surgery and smaller curve corrections {{appears to be the}} current trend in the management of scoliosis in DMD. This has been possible due to early curve detection and surgery thus having the advantage of less post-operative respiratory complications and stay in paediatric intensive care. Also, early surgery avoids development of pelvic deformity and extension of instrumentation to the pelvis thereby reducing blood loss. This trend reflects the advent of newer and safer instrumentation systems, advanced techniques in anaesthesia and cord monitoring. Sublaminar instrumentation system group had increased operating times and blood loss compared to both the hybrid and pedicle screw instrumentation systems due to increased bleeding from epidural vessels and pelvic instrumentation. Overall, the three instrumentation constructs appear to provide and maintain an optimal degree of correction at medium to long term follow up but the advantages of lesser blood loss and surgical time without the need for pelvic fixation seem to swing the verdict in favour of the pedicle screw system...|$|R
