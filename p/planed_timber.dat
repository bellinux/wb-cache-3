50|$|Rehoboth Church is a vernacular structure, {{designed}} {{using the}} log framing construction techniques utilized by early {{settlers in the}} western reaches of the Virginia Colony. The interior {{of the church is}} dominated by the raised pulpit, fashioned from <b>planed</b> <b>timber</b> which allows maximum visibility to both the nave and the galleries. Three sides of the church are lined with galleries which offer additional seating (used as a slave gallery during the antebellum period). A steep fixed ladder in the southwest corner of the nave provides access to the galleries, which are supported by two massive log pillars and small braces set in the side and rear walls of the church. The logs are shaped to a diamond at their ends. Aside from the pulpit, the only furnishings in the church are the pews, crudely constructed from half-sawn logs, and wooden lamp stands. The altar from the church, believed to have been used by Bishop Asbury, is preserved as well.|$|E

40|$|When {{sawn timber}} is planed, the timber is {{to some extent}} {{flattened}} by the feeding rollers and other pressure elements inside the planer, with the plank middle affected {{to a greater degree}} than the top and butt end. As a result, any twist present in rough timber influences the planing process in the proximity of the latter two areas. This is manifested primarily as reduced rectangularity in the affected zones of the <b>planed</b> <b>timber,</b> but also as an increased risk of planer misses. One way to avoid these unwanted features in the end product is to plane an excess length of timber, then cross-cutting to the required final length after planing. This study found low rectangularity to be a larger problem than planer misses, with the top end most affected. The study also indicates that simple models could be used to predict the size of the zone affected by twisting near the ends of <b>planed</b> <b>timber,</b> and thus also the length that must be removed in order to produce an acceptable cross-sectional shape throughout the length of <b>planed</b> <b>timber.</b> Godkänd; 2013; 20131024 (annaxe...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Planing and moulding operations carried out within the woodworking industry make an extensive use of rotary machining. Cuttermarks are produced on the timber surface, which are generally accepted as unavoidable. More noticeable surface defects may be produced by such factors as cutterhead imbalance, and until recently most research has concentrated on removing these defects. When a high quality finish is required, a further machining operation, such as sanding, is often required to remove cuttermarks. What is required is a modified machining process, which combines a surface closer to the ideal fixed knife finish, while retaining the flexibility, practicality and cost effectiveness of rotary machining. It has been theorized that the surface finish of planed and moulded timber products may be improved by introducing vertical cutterhead pulses. This thesis concerns the progress made towards the modification of the rotary machining process to improve surface form for <b>planed</b> <b>timber</b> components. Thus simulation of the rotary machining process is described, allowing {{an evaluation of the}} surface form quality produced by the modified machining process, and allowing a comparison to be made between the effectiveness of new machining process and conventional rotary machining. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed machining method, a small-scale planer with an actuation system using piezoelectric actuators to control the spindle movement was designed. An electrical model of the piezoelectric actuators was combined with a finite element model of the spindle to create an overall model used for simulation. The modelling technique used represents significant progress in the field of mechatronic system modelling, and a useful tool for designing active spindle systems...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rotary planing {{is one of the}} most valuable machining operations in the timber processing industry. It has been established that cutting tool inaccuracy and forced vibration during the machining process are the primary causes of surface quality degradation. The main aim of this thesis is to design a control architecture that is suitable for adaptive operation of a wood planing machining in order to improve the quality of its surface finish. In order to achieve the stated goal, thorough understanding of the effects of machine deficiencies on surface finish quality is required. Therefore, a generic simulation model for synthesising the surface profiles produced by wood planing process is first developed. The model is used to simulate the combined effects of machining parameters, vibration and cutting tool inaccuracy on the resultant surface profiles. It has been postulated that online monitoring of surface finish quality can be used to provide feedback information for a secondary control loop for the machining process, which will lead to the production of consistently high quality surface finishes. There is an existing vision-based wood surface profile measurement technique, but the application of the technique has been limited to static wood samples. This thesis extends the application of the technique to moving wood samples. It is shown experimentally that the method is suitable for in-process surface profile measurements. The current industrial wood planing machines do not have the capability of measuring and adjusting process parameters in real-time. Therefore, knowledge of the causes of surface finish degradation would enable the operators to optimise the mechanical structure of the machines offline. For this reason, two novel approaches for characterising defects on <b>planed</b> <b>timber</b> surfaces have been created in this thesis using synthetic data. The output of this work is a software tool that can assist machine operators in inferring the causes of defects based on the waviness components of the workpiece surface finish. The main achievement in this research is the design of a new active wood planing technique that combines real-time cutter path optimisation (cutting tool inaccuracy compensation) with vibration disturbance rejection. The technique is based on real-time vertical displacements of the machine spindle. Simulation and experimental results obtained from a smart wood planing machine show significant improvements in the dynamic performance of the machine and the produced surface finish quality. Potential areas for future research include application of the defects characterisation techniques to real data and full integration of the dynamic surface profile measurements with the smart wood planing machine...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cross-laminated}} timber (CLT) is a prefabricated solid {{engineered wood}} product made {{of at least three}} orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber or structural composite lumber that are laminated by gluing of longitudinal and transverse layers with structural adhesives to form a solid rectangular-shaped, straight, and <b>plane</b> <b>timber</b> intended for roof, floor, or wall applications. While this {{engineered wood product}} has been used in Europe for over 15 years, the production of CLT and design of CLT structural systems have just begun in North America. For the acceptance of new construction materials or systems in North America, such as CLT, a consensus-based product standard is essential to the designers and regulatory bodies. This paper describes and documents the background information and some key issues that were considered during the development of the ANSI/APA PRG 320 Standard for Performance-Rated Cross Laminated Timber.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the optimization of metal-plate-connected <b>plane</b> <b>timber</b> trusses with {{special emphasis on}} joint flexibility. The optimization was performed by the non-linear programming approach. Since various truss design parameters such as type of truss configuration, span/depth ratio, number and type of diagonal and vertical members and type of joint connections simultaneously affect each other, it is proposed {{that all of these}} parameters should be considered simultaneously in a single mathematical model. An optimization model for cost optimization of timber trusses was thus developed. The economic objective function for minimizing the structure 2 ̆ 7 s self-manufacturing costs was defined, subjected to the design, stress and deflection (in) equality constraints. The finite element equations were as the equality constraints defined for the calculation of the internal forces and the deflections of the structure. The stiffness matrix of the structure was composed by considering fictitiously decreased cross-section areas of all the flexibly connected elements. Constraints for the dimensioning of the timber members were determined in accordance with Eurocode 5 in order to satisfy the requirements of both the ultimate and the serviceability limit states. The cross-section dimensions and the number of fasteners were defined as independent optimization variables. A numerical example demonstrates the applicability of the optimization approach presented as well as the influence of the fasteners 2 ̆ 7 flexibility on the optimal self-manufacturing costs...|$|R

40|$|Cross {{laminated}} timber (CLT) is a versatile engineered timber {{product that is}} increasingly well-known and of global interest in several applications such as full size <b>plane</b> or linear <b>timber</b> elements. The {{aim of this study}} involves investigating the performance of CLT beams loaded in-plane by considering bending and shear stress analysis with a special emphasis on the in-plane shear behavior including the complex internal structure of CLT. Numerical analysis based on 3 D-FE models was used and compared with two existing analytical approaches, namely representative volume sub element (method I) and composite beam theory (method II). The separate verification of bending and shear stresses including tree different shear failure modes was performed, and a good agreement was obtained. The main difference between the results relates to shear failure mode in the crossing areas between the orthogonally bonded lamellas in which the distribution of shear stresses τzx over the crossing areas per height of the CLT beam is not in accordance with the analytical assumptions. The presented analyses constitute the first attempt to contribute to the on-going review process of Eurocode 5 with respect to CLT beams loaded-in plane.
