5|$|Peggy married Eric Mitchell {{because she}} was {{pregnant}} with Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric, a keen boxer, worked for gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Johnny would taunt Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric {{fell in love with a}} woman called Maureen and planned to elope with her, but changed his mind, unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>robbery</b> and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but changed his mind, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother Archie (Larry Lamb) because he was there for her when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 - her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook and Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.|$|E

Companies that now offer money orders include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{weapon that}} has figured {{prominently}} in the investigation is the so-called Mockfjärd gun. This weapon, a revolver of the type Smith & Wesson Model 28 ("Highway Patrolman") with [...]357 Magnum caliber, was first purchased legally by a civilian in the northern Swedish city of Luleå. The gun, along with 91 metal-piercing bullets, was stolen in a burglary in Haparanda in 1983 and {{is believed to have}} been used in the robbery of a post office in Mockfjärd, Dalarna that same year. A lead isotope analysis of a bullet fired during the robbery confirmed it to have the same isotopic composition as the bullets retrieved from the assassination crime scene, verifying that the bullets were manufactured at the same time.

50|$|A week later, West Midlands Police {{contacted}} West Mercia. On {{the same}} night of the failed ransom drop, a car had been left near a Freightliner railway terminal in Dudley, where security guard Gerald Smith {{had been shot in}} the back six times, and was now in hospital recovering. In the car were: a cassette tape with Lesley Whittle's voice on it, asking her relatives to co-operate with the kidnapper; her slippers; a roll of plastic tape; all of which linked Neilson to the kidnapping. Ballistics evidence and finger prints on the cartridges also linked the same man to the Freightliner shooting, the previous <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>robberies</b> and hence the Black Panther murders.|$|R
50|$|The Blairs, {{like many}} other {{nationalist}} Democrats, but unusually for politicians from the border states, had abandoned the Democratic Party {{in the wake of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act and had been among the founding leaders of the new Republican Party. After Blair switched political parties, President Buchanan removed Blair from his position of United States Solicitor in 1858. In 1860, Blair took an active part in the presidential campaign on behalf of Abraham Lincoln. After his election, Lincoln appointed Blair to his cabinet as Postmaster-General in 1861. Lincoln expected Blair, who advocated taking a firm stance with the southern states, to help balance more conciliatory members of his cabinet. While Postmaster-General, Blair instituted a uniform rate of postage and free delivery in cities. Blair also began the sale of money orders by <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> in order to reduce the mailing of currency, reducing <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>robberies.</b> He also called for the First International Postal Conference, which was held in Paris in 1863 and began the process that led to the Universal Postal Union.|$|R
2500|$|The Provisional IRA {{has carried}} out {{numerous}} bank and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>robberies</b> across Ireland throughout its existence. An RUC estimate from 1982–83, puts the amount stolen in such raids by the Provisional IRA at around £700,000 (sterling). Also in the 1980s, the Provisional IRA {{were involved in}} the kidnapping and ransom of businessmen Gaelen Weston, Ben Dunne and Don Tidey. Activities such as these were linked to the IRA's fund-raising. Gardaí estimate that the Provisional IRA got up to £1.5 million from these activities. Activities include smuggling, sale of stolen items and contraband including cigarettes, red diesel, extortion, protection rackets, and money laundering. Most recently, the Provisional IRA have been blamed for carrying out the Northern Bank Robbery in December 2004, although no proof was ever forwarded and this crime remains unsolved. The IMC note that in their view the Provisional IRA has not had any [...] "organisational involvement in robbery or other such organised crime".|$|R

2500|$|A {{member of}} the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) on the Shankill Road, Hanna was {{described}} by journalist Joe Tiernan as having been a [...] "brilliant strategist and an able leader". Hanna's place on the Brigade Staff was remarkable in itself because since {{the formation of the}} modern UVF by Gusty Spence, almost all of the UVF Brigade Staff members have been from the Shankill Road or the neighbouring Woodvale area to the west. Hanna, a native of Lurgan, {{was one of the few}} exceptions. [...] A Garda Síochána document dating from 1974 to 1975 revealed that the Republic's police knew Hanna was the Officer Commanding (OC) of the Mid-Ulster Brigade's Lurgan unit. Tiernan alleged that Hanna personally recruited and trained young men from the Lurgan and Portadown areas who were [...] "prepared to defend Ulster at any cost". Directed by Hanna, the brigade became the most lethal loyalist paramilitary group operating in mid-Ulster. He then began carrying out bank and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>robberies,</b> and intimidated local businessmen into paying protection money to the Mid-Ulster UVF.|$|R
5000|$|Hanna, {{who held}} the rank of brigadier, {{appointed}} himself the brigade's commander, and personally recruited and trained young men from the Portadown and Lurgan areas who were [...] "prepared to defend Ulster at any cost". These included Robin [...] "the Jackal" [...] Jackson, Harris Boyle, Wesley Somerville, David Alexander Mulholland, and William Fulton, among others. When a new member was sworn into the UVF, he was brought before a table, which was flanked by two masked men and presided over by another; on the table rested the Ulster banner and a gun. Under Hanna's leadership the Mid-Ulster Brigade became the deadliest loyalist paramilitary group outside Belfast. According to journalist Joe Tiernan, at least 100 Catholics {{and a number of}} Protestants lost their lives at the hands of this brigade. Tiernan also suggested that Hanna carried out bank and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>robberies</b> and intimidated local businessmen into paying protection money to the Mid-Ulster UVF. [...] Hanna was eventually expelled from the UDR on account of his UVF activity. The Mid-Ulster UVF had always operated as a semi-autonomous, self-contained group maintaining its distance from the Belfast leadership, even if Hanna did have a seat on the Brigade Staff. Journalist Brendan O'Brien stated that the UVF had derived its greatest strength as well as the organisation's most ruthless members from its Mid-Ulster Brigade. Author Don Mullan described the brigade {{as one of the most}} ruthless battalions operating in the 1970s. A 2011 RTÉ documentary Bombings called it an [...] "efficient sectarian killing machine". It covered a wide area of operations, drawing membership from Portadown, southern County Londonderry, Dungannon, Armagh, Lurgan, Cookstown, and rural settlements near these towns, although it had little or no membership in County Fermanagh, where loyalist paramilitaries never joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army as the defenders of choice in the eyes of local unionists to the degree they did elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Uncle Albert, {{who knew}} Robdal vaguely during the war, {{finishes}} the tale {{later in the}} episode by stating that shortly after stealing the gold, and whilst still {{on the run from}} the Police, Robdal and an explosives expert known as [...] "Jelly" [...] Kelly, robbed a <b>Post</b> <b>Office.</b> During the <b>robbery,</b> Robdal inadvertently sat on a detonator, killing them both. Del mentions that he heard that Robdal had an affair with a married woman who lived on the estate and wonders why he left everything to Del and Rodney's mother. He also mentions a rumour that Robdal had an illegitimate child by that woman who would approximately be Rodney's age now. The throwaway remark begins to worry Rodney about the possibility that he may very well be that child, though Albert dismisses it as a rumour.|$|R

However, Bruton received widespread praise in the Republic for condemning the Royal Ulster Constabulary for yielding to loyalist threats at Drumcree by allowing members of the Orange Order to parade through a nationalist district. He stated that the RUC had been neither impartial nor consistent in applying the law. His outrage and criticism led to a tense atmosphere between London and Dublin. By the time of the 1997 general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 general election.|$|E

Before long Dodds had turned C Company into one of the UDA's most active murder units, ordering the killing of, amongst others, Francisco Notarantonio in October 1987. Dodds had chosen his name from a security forces list supplied to him by infiltrated Intelligence agent Brian Nelson. The killing of Terrence McDaid on 10 May 1988 was ordered by Dodds in similar circumstances, although in this case the wrong man was killed. Nelson had given Dodds the address and photograph. The address was incorrect, however and the actual target was McDaid's older brother Declan, the two brothers looking very much alike.
