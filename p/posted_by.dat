5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the seniors, and Marta Karolyi, the U.S. national team coordinator, has said that if Liukin had been eligible, she would have been named to the Olympic team.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} were <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the Weather Bureau for {{the entire}} Alabama coast, and portions of the Mississippi coast from Biloxi eastward prior to the storm.

5|$|In the Blazers' 47 {{years of}} {{existence}} (through 2017), they have {{qualified for the}} NBA playoffs 33 times, including a streak of 21 straight playoff appearances from 1983 through 2003. The team has one NBA title, in 1977, and appeared in the NBA Finals two other times, in 1990 and 1992. The best record <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the team was 63–19, in 1991; the worst record was 18–64, in the team's second season in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Senna had {{qualified}} on pole position, having not set a {{lap time}} following Ratzenberger's death. He was joined {{on the front}} row by Schumacher and Berger qualified in 3rd. Damon Hill was able to improve on his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E

5|$|On December 18, 2006, a video {{which showed}} BackupHDDVD {{being used to}} decrypt and copy the film Full Metal Jacket to a hard drive was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. Two days after the video was uploaded, the initial version of the utility along with its source code and documentation was uploaded to a file hosting service. A link to the file was then <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the utility's creator on the forums of Doom9, a website devoted to DVD backup. The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained. The author elaborated in another forum post, claiming that keys could be obtained by exploiting the necessity {{for them to be}} held in memory to allow playback in player software.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook {{the sound of the}} fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza. A picture of the clapperboard used by the production shows that they consider the special as the twelfth episode of season 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute in}} 1885 {{concerned}} Game 2, which was forfeited by St. Louis when they pulled their team {{off the field}} protesting an umpiring decision. The managers, Cap Anson and Charles Comiskey, initially agreed to disregard the game. When St. Louis won the final game and an apparent 3–2 Series championship, Chicago White Stockings owner Albert Spalding overruled his manager and declared that he wanted the forfeit counted. The result of a tied Series was that neither team got the prize money that had been <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the owners before the Series (and was returned to them after they both agreed it was a tie).|$|E

5|$|Neither of {{the early}} designations— Highway 25 and Route 1 - was marked (signs <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name), but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199, a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City. Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I-5, which {{bypassed}} Grants Pass, in 1959, and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I-5. A proposed branch on M Street to I-5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25, but this {{was moved to the}} E and F Streets one-way pair in 1961. (I-5 here was built in the early 1960s, but US 99 remained on the old alignment.) On the California side of the state line, US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped, making Route 199 the legislative number. Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964, the shorter US 199, which crossed a state line, remained. US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass, and US 199 now ends at I-5. The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I-5 was built {{at the same time as}} I-5, and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway.|$|E
