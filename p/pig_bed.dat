40|$|The {{provision}} of straw in animal production systems is widely {{presumed to be}} beneficial {{for the welfare of}} the animals. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the scientific basis of this assumption for pigs and cattle. As there are important disadvantages (cost, labour, hygiene and incompatibility with manure drainage systems) associated with the use of straw, studies investigating whether there are suitable alternatives to straw that fulfil the same welfare functions are also reviewed. It is concluded that straw has many positive effects on the welfare of <b>pigs.</b> <b>Bedding</b> improves the physical comfort of the floor, and—unless temperatures are high—straw enables pigs to somewhat control their microclimate thereby increasing thermal comfort. Straw also functions as an important stimulus and outlet for exploration, foraging, rooting and chewing behaviours. Pigs that are feed restricted or housed in barren environments, in particular, can be strongly motivated to express these behaviours and the inability to do so may result in behavioural problems or anomalies. In addition, it has been demonstrated that preparturient sows are highly motivated to obtain nesting material and that straw can have a beneficial effect on maternal behaviour after farrowing. Although there may be superior alternatives for each of these functions of straw separately, it remains unlikely that thes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Hoop {{structures}} are large simple, tent-like shelters {{that can be}} used for pigs. The pigs are kept inside the hoop structure and large bales, e. g. straw or cornstalks, are used for bedding. A typical hoop structure (10 m x 30 m) holds about 200 market <b>pigs.</b> <b>Bedding</b> is added every 2 - 6 weeks as needed until the pigs are marketed at which time clean out occurs. Three demonstrational trials were conducted in Iowa. The pigs were fed from 26 to 117 kg. Pig performance in hoops was acceptable (ADG=. 83 kg/d, FE= 3. 42 kg feed/kg gain) with 9 % poorer feed efficiency in winter. Growth rate was equal to or slightly more than typical for pigs in conventional confinement. Pig mortality was less than 3 %. Average bedding use was 100 kg per pig in winter and 55 kg per pig in summer. The hoop manure can be composted readily. The bedding pack was variable with some areas actively composting on site in the hoop, generating temperatures up to 62 °C. An economic analysis showed similar total costs of production with the hoops having lower fixed costs and higher variable costs than in conventional confinement. The higher variable costs are due to bedding and extra feed and labor. Hoop structures offer a feasible alternative production system for sustainable swine production in Iowa and surrounding areas...|$|R

40|$|Copyright 2008 Australian Society of AgronomyAn {{important}} {{proportion of}} crop production in South Australia {{is carried out}} on neutral-alkaline soils comprising infertile siliceous sands overlaying sodic subsoils. Crop growth {{is limited by the}} infertile nature of the non-wetting, rapidly draining upper soil horizons and also by the lower soil horizons which are generally dense sandy clays, often sodic and with poor physical structure. A replicated experiment was established at Stansbury, SA in 2004 to compare production under best district practice management with that from several ‘once off’ soil amelioration treatments; surface applied organic matter (composted <b>pig</b> <b>bedding</b> litter), three subsoil treatments involving deep ripping to 0. 4 m and addition of an ameliorant (either liquid nutrients, gypsum or organic matter as lupin grain), and a treatment that combined the surface and all the subsoil treatments together. Treatments were designed to improve soil chemical and physical properties and enhance root and crop growth. Of the treatments tested, deep ripping (0. 4 m) and associated placement of nutrients in fluid form provided the most consistent crop responses, with the response being greater where the clay was closer to the surface. Some crop responses to the once off subsoil amelioration were still evident after 4 crops. Differences in crop water use (evapotranspiration) were not apparent from gravimetric measurements at sowing and harvest suggesting that other soil chemical and physical properties may be responsible for the yield responses, or there may have been undetected differences in the partitioning of water use between evaporation and transpiration within seasons. Among the crops studied, wheat was the most responsive to amelioration treatments and canola slightly less so, whereas lupin was generally unresponsive to soil amelioration strategies at this site.

The trials were conducted during summer 2010 and will continue in 2011 at the ISU Western Research Farm, Castana, IA in three mini-hoop barns each with two pens. Each hoop had one bedded and one non-bedded pen of pigs. Cornstalks were used as bedding. Each pen had a self-feeder with one feeder space and an automatic waterer. The gating between the pens was altered to allow no bedding to pass through. All pigs on the trials were barrows. There were 2 trials during summer 2010 and there will be 2 trials in summer 2011. There were five pigs per pen starting at approximately 150 lb and fed for 49 days. For the last 14 days of the trials, the feed included titanium oxide as an indigestible marker. After five days on the marker, a fecal grab sample was collected from each pig. Fecal samples were frozen for later analysis of the marker to determine feed digestibility. Because the experiment is not complete, statistical analysis was not conducted; however, the growth feed intake, feed efficiency, backfat thickness and loin muscle area were similar for the barrows with and without bedding during summer months.

An effect of the animal density on the animal behavior of pigs was observed. The treatment with lower animal density (1. 5 m 2 /animal) showed the highest both percentage of pigs eating during the feeding hours andresting pigs after fed. Pigs established three well differentiated areas of the deep bedding substrate: dirty area,humid area and resting area independently of animal density or substrate density.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the high fixed costs of {{confinement}} swine finishing buildings, coupled with increased pressure from environmental, community, and animal welfare groups have led swine farmers to explore hoop buildings as an alternative housing system. This experiment examined the growth and development of finishing pigs in relation to housing environment, and the seasonal effects of raising finishing <b>pigs</b> in <b>bedded</b> hoop or confinement buildings using serial ultrasound measurements of backfat thickness and loin muscle area, plus serial weighing during the finishing period. Pigs were either housed in a (9. 1 × 18. 3 m) hoop finishing building (designed to hold 150 pigs in one pen) or a mechanically ventilated, totally slatted confinement building (designed with six pens holding 22 pigs per pen). Feeder pigs {{were placed in the}} pens at 16 kg and were marketed at 124 kg. Pigs were randomly selected from the hoop building (n= 48) and eight pigs from each of the six pens in the confinement building (n= 48). All pigs were provided ad-libitum access to corn soy diets. Pigs were weighed and ultrasound images were recorded every 14 days during the last 56 days of the finishing phase. All pigs were scanned by a certified technician using an Aloka 500 - V SSD ultrasound machine. Two trials were conducted— one in summer (April–August) and one in winter (October– February). Comparisons were made between hoop and confinement buildings within a season (summer and winter) and for the seasons combined. Comparisons, between seasons within building type (hoop or confinement) were also made. Preliminary results indicate that although pigs in each building type reached a similar end weight at about the same time, hoop-fed pigs displayed more variation during the finishing period. Confinement-fed pigs in both seasons grew at a more constant rate. Environmental or seasonal variation may have more impact on growth, and fat and muscle deposition for <b>pigs</b> finished in <b>bedded</b> hoop buildings than pigs in confinement buildings. Also, differences in social structure and number of feeder holes in relation to pig number may impact appetite and feeding time causing more variation in live weight due to gut fill. Further research could be conducted to reduce the variability in growth caused in hoop buildings. Modifying diets, providing supplemental heat during the first 30 days pigs are placed in hoop buildings, and/or placing pigs into hoop buildings at heavier weights are all possible solutions that need further investigation...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} the combined effect of housing conditions and environmental enrichment on the behaviour {{and performance of}} pigs, a meta-analysis was performed using information from 45 experiments in 42 published manuscripts. Multiple regression models were applied to evaluate the effects of space allowance per pig (k-value; m 2 /BW 0. 667), group size (n), floor characteristics (solid, partly, or totally slatted floor), bedding (presence or absence), and the number and presentation sequence of point-source objects (no object, one object, two simultaneous objects, two alternated objects, three or more simultaneous objects or three or more alternated objects) on the general activity, enrichment and object-directed exploratory behaviour, social behaviour, and productive performance. A non-linear relationship between space allowance per pig and time spent sitting and lying was found (P < 0. 10 and P < 0. 01 for the k-value and its quadratic term respectively). Total time spent in exploration increased with space allowance per <b>pig</b> when <b>bedding</b> was present (P < 0. 01), and time spent exploring other pen items decreased with increasing space allowance per <b>pig</b> if no <b>bedding</b> was provided (P < 0. 001). Total time spent in exploration increased with group size (P < 0. 001). The lowest predicted total exploration time (least squares mean ± standard error) {{was found in the}} absence of bedding and point-source objects (13 ± 3 %; P < 0. 05), and the highest when bedding (18 ± 3 %) or point-source objects (19 ± 3 %) were present. Time exploring point-source objects was higher when different objects were provided (P < 0. 001). Suspended (P < 0. 05) and deformable (P < 0. 05) enrichment items increased the time spent manipulating them. Time spent exploring point-source objects was predicted to be higher in the absence of slats and bedding (32 ± 6 %; P < 0. 05), and lower when bedding (8 ± 9 %) or slats (12 ± 4 %) were present. Time engaged in negative social behaviours decreased in the presence of point-source objects (P < 0. 01), and increased with group size in the absence of bedding (P < 0. 001). Time engaged in positive social behaviours tended to decrease in the presence of point-source objects (P < 0. 10), and when space allowance per pig increased in the absence of bedding (P < 0. 10). Slight trends towards lower FCR were predicted when point-source objects (P < 0. 10) and bedding (P = 0. 10) were present.

In the UK ca 42 % of NH 3 emissions from buildings are from those in which cattle and <b>pigs</b> are <b>bedded</b> on straw. Additional straw may reduce NH 3 emission by reducing airflow across surfaces soiled by urine, and by immobilization of ammonium-N. The object {{of this study was}} to quantify the effects of increasing straw use on NH 3 emission from buildings housing cattle or pigs. The extra straw was applied in increments of up to 100 %, either over the entire floor (broadcast) or targeted to the areas where most excreta were deposited. An increase of 33 % straw, broadcast over the entire floor, reduced NH 3 emission from cattle by 50 %, but greater addition did not give any further significant reduction. However, for pigs only the broadcast addition of 100 % more straw reduced NH 3 emission and then by only c. 20 %. Targeted use of an additional 33 % straw reduced emission from cattle by 22 %, compared with broadcasting the same quantity of straw, but further additions of targeted straw use did not increase abatement. When the straw was targeted in the pig buildings there was no benefit from using additional straw.

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{the present}} thesis were to examine neuropeptide Y (NPY) {{responses}} in different human and guinea <b>pig</b> vascular <b>beds</b> and in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and to characterize, with different NPY agonists and the specific NPY Y 1 receptor antagonist (BIBP 3226), the NPY receptors involved. NPY-induced strong and potent contractions in human cerebral and subcutaneous arteries and in guinea pig basilar arteries. The contractions were shown to be mediated solely by the NPY Y 1 receptor. In human omental and guinea pig mesenteric arteries, NPY failed to induce contraction, instead a strong, NPY-induced, NPY Y 1 receptor-mediated, potentiation of the noradrenaline (NA) -induced contraction was seen. Treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against the NPY Y 1 receptor mRNA abolished the potentiation. The acetylcholine (ACh) -induced dilatation of guinea pig basilar arteries was attenuated by NPY. The receptor involved {{seemed to be the}} NPY Y 2 receptor. In 50 % of the human subcutaneous arteries studied, NPY, apart from contraction, also induced a NPY Y 1 receptor-mediated and nitric oxide (NO) dependent vasodilatation. With reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mRNA encoding the human NPY Y 1 receptor was detected in human cerebral, subcutaneous and omental arteries and in endothelial cells from human umbilical veins. In cultured VSMC from human subcutaneous arteries, NPY stimulated DNA synthesis and potentiated the NA-induced mitogenesis. Both responses appeared to be induced by the NPY Y 1 receptor. Administration of NPY and NA, in-vivo, into the human brachial artery reduced forearm blood flow and increased forearm vascular resistance. The opposite effects were seen after infusion of ATP.

Although feed is the largest single input into a pig production system, nearly 30 % of the non-solar energy use of a conventional [...] mechanically ventilated buildings with liquid manure handling [...] pig production system is associated with constructing and operating the <b>pig</b> facility. Using <b>bedded</b> hoop barns for gestating sows and grow-finish pigs reduces construction resource use and construction costs of pig production systems. The hoop based systems also requires approximately 40 % less non-solar energy to operate as the conventional system although hoop barn-based systems may require more feed. The total non-solar energy input associated with one 136 kg pig produced in a conventional farrow-to-finish system in Iowa and fed a typical corn-soybean meal diet that includes synthetic lysine and exogenous phytase is 967. 9 MJ. Consuming the non-solar energy results in emissions of 79. 8 kg CO 2 equivalents. Alternatively producing the same pig in a system using bedded hoop barns for gestating sows and grow-finish pigs requires 939. 8 MJ/pig and results in emission of 70. 2 kg CO 2 equivalents, a reduction of 3 and 12 % respectively.

40|$|Growth and {{development}} of finishing <b>pigs</b> in <b>bedded</b> hoop and confinement buildings during summer and winter was evaluated using serial ultrasound measurements of backfat (BF) thickness, loin muscle (LM) area, and serial weighing. A summer trial (April through August 2000) and a winter trial (October 2000 through February 2001) were conducted. Forty-eight pigs from the hoop building and eight pigs {{from each of the}} six pens in the confinement building were randomly selected and weighed; ultrasound images were recorded every 14 d during the last 56 d of the finishing phase. Backfat accretion rates were greater for summer hoop pigs (SH) than summer confinement pigs (SC) at 80 kg to 90 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but did not differ at 95 to 115 kg. In winter, BF accretion rates did not differ from 80 to 105 kg, but winter hoop pigs (WH) had less BF accretion than winter confinement pigs (WC) at 110 kg and 115 kg (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Loin muscle accretion rates did not differ at 80 and 85 kg or from 100 to 115 kg, but were less for SH than SC at 90 kg and at 95 kg (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). WH had greater LM accretion rates than WC at 80 kg to 115 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Bodyweight gain (BWG) did not differ between SH and SC from 80 to 95 kg and was greater for SH at 100 kg to 115 kg (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Bodyweight gain did not differ for WH and WC pigs from 100 to 115 kg, but was less for WH than WC at 80 kg to 95 kg (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). These results indicate that performance of finishing pigs is dependent on the thermal environment, and that hoop-reared pigs (particularly in winter) may compensate for a lag in performance early in the finishing period with greater accretion rates of LM and BW and lower accretion rates of BF later in the finishing period. Although overall pig performance in hoop and confinement buildings is similar, some differences in accretion rates for bodyweight, backfat, and loin muscle area occurred during the finishing period. These differences are probably due to seasonal variation in the thermal environment. Performance of pigs reared in hoop buildings may be compromised early in the finishing period by their inability to overcome the difference between temperature and thermoneutrality. However, it appears that hoop-reared pigs compensated for earlier lags in performance by increased BW gain and LM accretion, along with less BF deposition compared to pigs in confinement at the same BW. This study provides some evidence to justify feeding pigs in hoops to heavier weights. Research studying accretion rates of pigs at a wider range of bodyweights will be needed to better understand the effects of environment and building type on pig performance...|$|R

The aim of this study was to quantify the NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from two pig solid manure heaps, turned and not turned, in order to examine the effect of turning on gaseous emissions and to obtain additional information about emissions during composting in commercial conditions. The manure produced from the fattening of 72 <b>pigs</b> on straw <b>bedding</b> was divided between two identical heaps and stored outside on a concrete area for three months during autumn 2004. One heap was turned at day 0, 11 and 27. Gaseous emissions (NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2, H 2 O) of both heaps, covered for the purpose by ventilated greenhouses, were continuously measured over four periods (57 days in total). The tracer method, using SF 6, was used to measure the ventilation rate in the greenhouses. Concentrations inside and outside the greenhouses (to have a differential) were measured by photoacoustic infrared absorption spectrometry with a gas analyser coupled to a multipoint sampler and closer. Emissions were calculated by combining various flows and differential concentrations and interpolated between the different measuring periods. Results show that emission kinetics were very similar for the two heaps, except after turning, when emissions are given a new impetus. On average, the measured gas emissions for unturned and turned heaps represent a nitrogen loss (mainly in the form of NH 3) of 10. 5 % and 9 % of the initial nitrogen, and a carbon loss (mainly in the form of CO 2) of 24 et 28 % of the initial carbon. For both heaps, N 2 O is the primary greenhouse gas emitted (3 % of the initial nitrogen) and not CO 2 or CH 4. Considering the uncertainty on the measurements and the representativity of the experiment, these results did not show any clear difference between the two heaps.

40|$|The {{availability}} of a rooting substrate may profoundly affect behaviour and welfare of pigs. Apart from their actual housing environment, also the conditions present in early life and individual characteristics may influence the behaviour of pigs. The present study investigated {{the relative importance of}} the housing environment during rearing and the actual housing environment on behaviour during the finishing phase, pathological lesions of the heart and stomach wall and weight gain in pigs with diverging coping characteristics. Pigs were reared either without a rooting substrate (barren, B) or in identical pens enriched with straw bedding (enriched, E). During the suckling period piglets were subjected to the Backtest. The Backtest classification of pigs is, to a certain extent, predictive of their coping style. Each piglet was restrained in supine position for 1 min and its resistance (i. e. the number of escape attempts) was scored. Sixty high-resisting (HR) and 60 low-resisting (LR) pigs were selected. Half of these pigs were from barren and the other half from enriched rearing environments. Pigs were housed in groups of six (three HR and three LR) after weaning. At 10 weeks of age, environmental conditions (B or E) were switched for half of the pens. Behaviour patterns of pigs during the finishing phase were largely determined by the actual presence or absence of straw <b>bedding.</b> <b>Pigs</b> that changed from enriched to barren pens (EB pigs), however, showed an increased inactivity beyond the inactivity levels of pigs with a barren rearing history (BB pigs). The impact of rearing history on chewing, manipulative and play behaviour in later life was larger for LR than for HR pigs. The {{availability of}} straw reduced the occurrence of gastric lesions in LR, but not in HR pigs. Feed intake tended to be lower in EB pens than in EE pens, but this was reflected in the growth rate of HR pigs only. HR-EE pigs showed a higher weight gain than HR-EB pigs. In conclusion, behaviour patterns of pigs were largely influenced by the actual (in) availability of straw. The influence of rearing history on behaviour, occurrence of gastric lesions and weight gain was smaller, and depended to some extent on coping characteristics (LR or HR) of the pigs under stud...|$|R
40|$|Both dietary {{fermentable}} {{carbohydrates and}} the availability of straw bedding potentially affect activity patterns and energy utilisation in pigs. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effects of straw bedding and fermentable carbohydrates (native potato starch) on energy partitioning in growing pigs. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 16 groups of 12 pigs (approximately 25 kg) were assigned to either barren housing or housing on straw bedding, and to native or pregelatinised potato starch included in the diet. Pigs were fed at approximately 2. 5 times maintenance. Nitrogen and energy balances were measured per group during a 7 -day experimental period, which was preceded by a 30 -day adaptation period. Heat production and physical activity were measured during 9 -min intervals. The availability of straw bedding increased both metabolisable energy (ME) intake and total heat production (P < 0. 001). Housing conditions did not affect total energy retention, but <b>pigs</b> on straw <b>bedding</b> retained more energy as protein (P < 0. 01) and less as fat (P < 0. 05) than barren-housed pigs. Average daily gain (P < 0. 001), ME intake (P < 0. 001) and energy retention (P < 0. 01) were lower in pigs on the native potato starch diet compared to those on the pregelatinised potato starch diet. Pigs on the pregelatinised potato starch diet showed larger fluctuations in heat production and respiration quotient over the 24 -h cycle than pigs on the native potato starch diet, and a higher activity-related energy expenditure. The effect of dietary starch type on activity-related heat production depended, however, on housing type (P < 0. 05). In barren housing, activity-related heat production was less affected by starch type (16. 1 % and 13. 7 % of total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively) than in straw-enriched housing (21. 1 % and 15. 0 % of the total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively). In conclusion, the present study shows that the availability both of straw bedding and of dietary starch type, fermentable or digestible, affects energy utilisation and physical activity of pigs. The effects of housing condition on protein and fat deposition suggest that environmental enrichment with long straw may result in leaner pigs. The lower energy expenditure on the physical activity of pigs on the native potato starch diet, which was the most obvious in straw-housed pigs, likely reflects a decrease in foraging behaviour related to a more gradual supply of energy from fermentation processes...|$|R
