5|$|Alien vs. <b>Predator</b> {{began as}} a {{franchise}} in February 1990, when Dark Horse Comics published a comic book featuring Aliens from the Alien series of films in battle against the title characters of <b>Predator.</b> Both franchises are owned by Twentieth Century Fox. In November 1990, Fox released <b>Predator</b> 2, {{and one of the}} final scenes in the film showed an Alien skull inside a trophy case aboard a <b>Predator</b> ship. Fox began licensing merchandise for the new franchise, including comic books and video games. In 1993, the first Aliens vs. <b>Predator</b> video game was released; Alien vs <b>Predator</b> for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.|$|E
5|$|Jughead regroups {{with his}} {{remaining}} friends. Some {{members of the}} group decide to split up in hopes the <b>Predator</b> will continue to pursue Veronica, allowing them to escape. Dilton Doily, Archie, Betty, and Jughead stay behind with Veronica. When the <b>Predator</b> attacks again, it kills Dilton and Jughead and critically wounds Archie. Betty and Veronica take refuge at Lodge Manor, where they hook Archie to an experimental healing machine. Archie is killed and Veronica is knocked unconscious when the <b>Predator</b> breaks their barricade. During a struggle, Betty's left hand is cut off, causing the <b>Predator</b> to show regret since it was motivated by a crush on Betty. She uses the opportunity to wound the <b>Predator.</b> Veronica awakens to find Betty using the face and body reconstruction system on the healing machine to transform the wounded <b>Predator</b> into Archie.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Predator</b> ship uncloaks {{and several}} Predators appear. They {{retrieve}} their fallen comrade and an elite <b>Predator</b> presents Alexa {{with one of}} their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior symbolized by the alien blood Scar burned on her cheek before he died. As the Predators retreat into space, a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a <b>Predator</b> erupts from Scar's chest.|$|E
40|$|A new {{classification}} of lifestyles of phytoseiid mites is proposed {{based on the}} findings and suggestions from many studies conducted in the fifteen years since the publication of the lifestyle system by McMurtry & Croft (1997). In this newly proposed classification, Type I (Specialized mite <b>predators)</b> is divided into three subtypes to highlight mite prey specificity: subtype I-a—Specialized <b>predators</b> of Tetranychus species (Tetranychidae); subtype I-b—Specialized <b>predators</b> of web-nest producing mites (Tetranychidae); subtype I-c—Specialized <b>predators</b> of tydeoids (Tydeoidea). Type II (Selective <b>predators</b> of tetranychid mites) remains essentially the same. Type III (Generalist <b>predators)</b> is a huge and diverse group of general feeders; <b>predators</b> in this category are now grouped into five subtypes based on the microhabitat occupied and morphology: subtype III-a— Generalist <b>predators</b> living on pubescent leaves; subtype III-b—Generalist <b>predators</b> living on glabrous leaves; III-c—Generalist <b>predators</b> living in confined spaces on dicotyledonous plants; III-d—Generalist <b>predators</b> living in confined spaces on monocotyledonous plants; III-e—Generalist <b>predators</b> from soil/litter habitats. Type IV (Pollen feeding generalist <b>predators)</b> also remains essentially the same. Two possible additional lifestyles include phytoseiids living on aquatic plants and phytoseiids able to pierce leaf cells. Behavioral and biological information is updated and implications for biological control strategies are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Paramacronychiinae : This {{subfamily}} includes lepidopteran <b>predators</b> or parasitoids (Agria), <b>predators</b> on immatures (mainly prepupae) of bumblebees (Brachycoma) and generalist scavengers {{and insect}} <b>predators</b> (Sarcophila and Wohlfahrtia).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Volterra ecosystem driven by correlated noises. The competition of the <b>predators</b> induces an increasing in population {{density of the}} <b>predators.</b> The competition of the preys, however, leads the <b>predators</b> to decay. The <b>predators</b> may have better stability under strong correlated noises. The <b>predators</b> undergo a sensitivity to a random environment, whereas the preys exhibit a surprising endurance to this stochasticity. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a third-person action-adventure game. The single-player {{campaign}} {{is composed of}} 15 missions and features the <b>Predator</b> from the film. The player has access to <b>Predator</b> weapons as seen in movies and other sources in the franchise, including claws and a shoulder-mounted energy cannon. New weapons from the corresponding film include an energy pistol.|$|E
5|$|In Archie vs. <b>Predator,</b> a trophy-hunting alien {{arrives on}} Earth and begins {{stalking}} {{high school student}} Archie Andrews and his classmates. After a number of teenagers have been killed, the survivors realize they are being hunted and decide to fight back. Once the <b>predator</b> succeeds in killing Archie, it reveals it was motivated by a crush on one of Archie's girlfriends, Betty Cooper.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching <b>predator.</b> All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a <b>predator</b> because there is an advantage to seeing the <b>predator</b> first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E

50|$|The {{hunting of}} juveniles has {{developed}} {{as an effective}} anti-predator strategy and role reversal. Young <b>predators</b> are at risk from {{members of their own}} species and competitors, and they may also be vulnerable to adults of prey species, as young <b>predators</b> pose nearly no predation risk to adult prey. An experiment where juvenile prey were exposed to adult <b>predators</b> while they developed were more likely to kill juvenile <b>predators</b> as adults than prey that was not exposed as juveniles. Increased levels of attack against juvenile <b>predators</b> can deter the adult <b>predators,</b> as the adult <b>predators</b> will avoid locations where their young may be attacked. This in turn reduces the risk of predation on the prey species.|$|R
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the <b>predator</b> may be {{confused}} by the large group size. As the group moves, the <b>predator</b> has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the <b>predator,</b> making it harder for the <b>predator</b> to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} <b>predator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching <b>predator,</b> spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a <b>predator</b> is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the <b>predator,</b> backwards.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the <b>predator</b> {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and <b>predator,</b> resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{such as the}} sarcophagid fly Emblemasoma hunt cicadas by sound, being {{attracted}} to their song. Singing males soften their song so that {{the attention of the}} listener gets distracted to neighbouring louder singers, or cease singing altogether as a <b>predator</b> approaches. It has been asserted that loud cicada song, especially in chorus, repels predators, but observations of <b>predator</b> responses refute the claim.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian <b>predator,</b> and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground <b>predator.</b> When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the <b>predator</b> after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Predator</b> {{travels through}} {{rural and urban}} areas of Gunnison, {{fighting}} more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the <b>Predator</b> to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the <b>Predator</b> successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
50|$|Although no <b>predators</b> {{for this}} {{species have been}} reported, their main <b>predators</b> likely are large birds.Some {{terrestrial}} <b>predators</b> could include wolves and foxes. However, the Altai weasel is a fierce animal, so most <b>predators</b> usually look elsewhere for easier prey. The average lifespan of this animal is about seven to 10 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Predators</b> of {{primates}} include various species of carnivorans, birds of prey, reptiles and other primates. Even gorillas {{have been recorded}} as prey. <b>Predators</b> {{of primates}} have diverse hunting strategies and as such, primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis, alarm calls and mobbing. Several species have separate alarm calls for different <b>predators</b> such as air-borne or ground-dwelling <b>predators.</b> Predation may have shaped group size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups. With their technology and increased intelligence, modern humans are nearly free of threats from non-human <b>predators</b> and are themselves apex <b>predators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Predators</b> were {{involved}} in some controversy {{when it was announced}} that Alexander Radulov would make his return to the <b>Predators</b> after leaving for the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in 2008. Radulov, still in his final year of his entry-level contract with the <b>Predators,</b> did not need to clear waivers to return to the <b>Predators.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} Alien vs. <b>Predator</b> {{originated}} from the Aliens versus <b>Predator</b> comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull {{appeared in a}} trophy case aboard the <b>Predator</b> ship in <b>Predator</b> 2. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, {{which was based on}} the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a <b>predator</b> nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a <b>predator</b> can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a <b>predator</b> can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the <b>predator</b> that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, <b>predator</b> confusion, and {{the likelihood that the}} <b>predator</b> will attack some other individual.|$|E
50|$|The {{mourning}} cloak butterfly faces many <b>predators</b> {{throughout its}} development. The mourning cloak's eggs can be eaten by <b>predators</b> such as beetles, true bugs, ants, beetle larvae, wasps, assassin bugs, and mites. Some of the butterflies' major <b>predators</b> include praying mantises, assassin bugs, dragon flies, and vertebrate <b>predators</b> such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.|$|R
50|$|To avoid <b>predators,</b> Dasyatis {{americana}} bury {{and cover}} themselves in substrate. Their tails contain venom {{and are also}} utilized as protection from <b>predators.</b> Some <b>predators</b> of Dasyatis americana are humans and Hammerhead Sharks.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>predators</b> to reduce prey populations is {{generally}} {{ascribed to the}} consumption of prey individuals. However, <b>predators</b> may also induce behavioral changes in prey, individuals, which can reduce prey survival and reproduction. Pea aphid populations are impacted {{by a variety of}} <b>predators,</b> many of which induce escape responses in individual aphids. We created disturbance-only <b>predators</b> (surgically manipulated <b>predators</b> that were unable to consume prey, but were still able to forage and interact with prey) and measured their ability to suppress aphid population growth over a six-day period. The greatest reduction in aphid population growth was caused by normal <b>predators</b> that were able to both consume and disturb aphids, but aphid population growth was also strongly reduced by nonconsumptive, disturbance-only <b>predators.</b> These field experiments are the first to show that <b>predators</b> reduce prey population growth partly through predator-induced changes in prey behavior, as well as through consumption of prey individuals...|$|R
5|$|The game's plot is {{loosely based}} on the film, as players take {{the role of the}} film's primary <b>Predator.</b> After the events of the first film of the Alien vs. <b>Predator</b> franchise, the <b>Predator</b> has been charged by his society to hunt down and destroy any trace of Alien {{activity}} taking place in a small American town, in order to avoid its detection by humanity.|$|E
5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the <b>predator</b> for the <b>predator</b> to benefit: it is sufficient for the <b>predator</b> simply not to be identified as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
5|$|Their main <b>predator</b> is the eagle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} <b>predators</b> to the catshark, {{although}} juveniles typically spend their early {{life in the}} deeper offshore waters. This {{is believed to be}} to avoid <b>predators,</b> although what those <b>predators</b> are is unknown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Predators</b> include barn owls, great horned owls, long-eared owls, and short-eared owls. Prairie falcons {{are also}} {{reported}} as <b>predators.</b> Known or suspected mustelid <b>predators</b> of the long-tailed vole include ermines, long-tailed weasels, and American pine martens.|$|R
50|$|The {{most severe}} and {{pressing}} danger {{in regards to}} the existenceof the New Holland Mouse comes directly from the threat of <b>predators</b> in theenvironment. Predation is brought upon by the natural <b>predators</b> in theenvironment. Such <b>predators</b> include the Red Fox, cats, and dogs. These animalshave been identified as the major <b>predators</b> due to the reported increase inpopulations of <b>predators</b> in areas where large populations of the New HollandMouse have been documented. In addition to the increase of <b>predators,</b> anincrease in competition for resources in the environment has also been noted acontributor to their decline. The competition is most frequently encounteredbetween other species of rodents in the same habitat.|$|R
