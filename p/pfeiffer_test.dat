40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} prevalence of FI and associated factors in institutionalized elderly. A cross-sectional study is presented herein, conducted between October and December 2013, in 10 nursing homes (NHs) of the city of Natal (Northeast Brazil). Individuals over the age of 60 were included in the study, while those hospitalized or in terminal phase were excluded. Data collection included sociodemographic information, FI characterization, as well as variables related to the institution itself and to health conditions (comorbidities, medication, pelvic floor surgery, Barthel Index for functional capacity and <b>Pfeiffer</b> <b>test</b> for cognitive status). FI was verified through the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3. 0, which was also used to assess toileting programs. The Chi-square test and the linear Chi-square test were performed for bivariate analysis, as well as logistic regression for multivariate analysis. The final sample consisted of 321 elderly, mostly females, with mean age of 81. 5 years. The prevalence of FI was 42. 68 % (CI 95 %, 37. 39 - 48. 15). Most residents presenting FI were always incontinent (83. 9 %) and the most frequent incontinence type was total FI (solid and liquid stools). Incontinence control measures were applied only to 9. 7 % of the residents. The final model revealed a statistically significant association between FI and functional and cognitive impairments. It is concluded that FI is a health issue that affects almost half of the institutionalized elderly, and is associated with functional and cognitive disability...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a nutrition education intervention to prevent risk of malnutrition for dependent elderly patients receiving Home Care: A randomized controlled trialDOI: 10. 1016 /j. ijnurstu. 2017. 02. 020 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SIObjective To assess {{the effect of}} a nutrition education intervention included in the Home Care Program for caregivers to prevent the increasing risk of malnutrition of dependent patients at risk of malnutrition. Design Randomized controlled multicenter trial of 6 months of duration and 12 months follow-up. Settings 10 Primary Care Centers, Spain. Participants Patients enrolled in the Home Care Program between January 2010 and March 2012, who were dependent and at risk of malnutrition, older than 65, and had caregivers (n = 190). Intervention The nurses conducted initial educational intervention sessions for caregivers and then monitored at home every month for 6 months. Measurements The nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment test (primary outcome), diet, anthropometry, and biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin and cholesterol). Other descriptive and outcome measures were recorded: current medical history, Activities of daily living (Barthel test), cognitive state (<b>Pfeiffer</b> <b>test),</b> and mood status (Yesavage test). All the measures were recorded in a schedule of 0 – 6 – 12 months. Results 173 individuals participated after exclusions (intervention n = 101; control n = 72). Mean age was 87. 8 ± 8. 9 years, 68. 2 % were women. Difference were found between the groups for Mini Nutritional Assessment test score change (repeated measures ANOVA, F = 10. 1; P < 0. 001), the intervention improved the Mini Nutritional Assessment test score {{of the participants in the}} intervention group.

40|$|Abstract Background Malnutrition in {{dependent}} patients {{has a high}} {{prevalence and}} can influence the prognosis associated with diverse pathologic processes, decrease quality of life, and increase morbidity-mortality and hospital admissions. The aim {{of the study is}} to assess the effect of an educational intervention for caregivers on the nutritional status of dependent patients at risk of malnutrition. Methods/Design Intervention study with control group, randomly allocated, of 200 patients of the Home Care Program carried out in 8 Primary Care Centers (Spain). These patients are dependent and at risk of malnutrition, older than 65, and have caregivers. The socioeconomic and educational characteristics of the patient and the caregiver are recorded. On a schedule of 0 – 6 – 12 months, patients are evaluated as follows: Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), food intake, dentures, degree of dependency (Barthel test), cognitive state (<b>Pfeiffer</b> <b>test),</b> mood status (Yesavage test), and anthropometric and serum parameters of nutritional status: albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, haemoglobin, lymphocyte count, iron, and ferritin. Prior to the intervention, the educational procedure and the design of educational material are standardized among nurses. The nurses conduct an initial session for caregivers and then monitor the education impact at home every month (4 visits) up to 6 months. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) methodology will be used. The investigators will study the effect of the intervention with caregivers on the patient’s nutritional status using the MNA test, diet, anthropometry, and biochemical parameters. Bivariate normal test statistics and multivariate models will be created to adjust the effect of the intervention. The SPSS/PC program will be used for statistical analysis. Discussion The nutritional status of dependent patients has been little studied. This study allows us to know nutritional risk from different points of view: diet, anthropometry and biochemistry in dependent patients at nutritional risk and to assess the effect of a nutritional education intervention. The design with random allocation, inclusion of all patients, validated methods, caregivers’ education and standardization between nurses allows us to obtain valuable information about nutritional status and prevention.

40|$|Background. Peripheral C 4 A {{treatment}} (cerebral and peripheral vasotherapeutics) {{and especially}} Ginkgo biloba extracts are prescribed {{for a number}} of symptoms, particularly memory impairment, in elderly patients. It is postulated that because of its pharmacological actions, this treatment could prevent the decline of cognitive function, but no studies have been published to date to test its efficacy in prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. The potential association between use of C 4 A treatments, in particular EGb 761 (standardized Ginkgo biloba extracts), and dementia of the Alzheimer type was investigated. Methods. A case-control study was nested in a cohort of 1462 community-dwelling elderly women aged over 75 years. Sixty-nine women with Alzheimer-type dementia were compared with 345 paired women whose cognitive function remained normal. This study involved women whose cognitive function was evaluated at baseline by use of <b>Pfeiffer’s</b> <b>test</b> and whose medication history was taken. The onset of cognitive impairment was investigated over a 7 -year follow-up period. In order to study the factors associated with the onset of dementia, the data concerning women with a score of> 8 on <b>Pfeiffer’s</b> <b>test</b> at inclusion, indicating normal cognitive function, were analyzed. Results. A multivariate analysis including potential confounding factors showed that fewer women who developed Alzheimer’s dementia had been prescribed C 4 A treatment (including EGb 761) for at least 2 years (odds ratio 5 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval 5 0. 12 – 0. 82, p 5. 018). Figures for EGb 761 alone were similar but did not reach statistica...|$|R
40|$|Summarizing {{the results}} that have been cited, we have proved that the blood serum of convalescents from rat-bite fever {{contains}} antibodies which are specific against the causative agent of that disease. The serum of rat-bite fever was capable of destroying the spirochetes {{not only in the}} hanging drop preparations, but also in the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs. The guinea pigs employed for <b>Pfeiffer's</b> <b>test</b> always remained well. In the experimentally infected mice receiving intravenously or intraperitoneally serum equalling in quantity the amount of infected blood, the numbers of spirochetes were greatly decreased or they disappeared for a definite period. It is not yet clear how long after recovery from rat-bite fever the antibodies are effective in the blood of human beings, and further investigations are needed to elucidate this point. In our experiments we found that serum taken from Case I showed definite spirochetolytic and spirocheticidal properties 11 months after the onset of the disease. In Case 2, the period was 6 months, and in Case 3, 3 months following the onset of rat-bite fever...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation {{success is}} {{measured}} by instruments that assess performance of activities of daily living. Guidelines on the use and choice of these instruments are lacking. The present study aimed to analyse prognostic indicators of physical rehabilitation effectiveness in elderly patients according to three rehabilitation impact indices. METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal study in a post-acute care unit. The study included rehabilitation-eligible deconditioned elderly in-patients prospectively admitted to post-acute care (n[*]=[*] 685, aged 83. 2 [*]±[*] 8. 3 years, mean length of stay 15 [*]±[*] 9. 2 days). DATA COLLECTION: Premorbid health status variables (PHSV) : age, sex, comorbidity (Charlson index), medical history (heart failure, pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia), previous living situation and pre-admission functional status (premorbid Lawton and Barthel indices). Admission health status variables (AHSV) : main diagnoses, referral source, physical (Barthel-adm) and cognitive function (<b>Pfeiffer</b> <b>test),</b> undernutrition and dysphagia. OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute functional gain (AFG, admission-to-discharge Barthel change), relative functional gain (RFG, achieved percentage of potential gain) and rehabilitation efficiency index (REI, AFG over length of stay). Univariate analysis considered these parameters, along with PHSV and AHSV. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for AFG ≥ 20, RFG ≥ 35 % and REI[*]≥[*] 0. 50. RESULTS: Greater AFG was associated with 14 variables, 8 PHSV (57. 1 %) and 6 AHSV (42. 8 %); greater RFG with 9 variables, 3 PHSV (33. 3 %) and 6 AHSV (66. 6 %); and REI with 9 variables, 4 PHSV (44. 4 %) and 5 AHSV (55. 5 %). Mean AFG value was 34. 5 [*]±[*] 15. 8 in patients who achieved complete recovery (RFG 100 %, n[*]=[*] 189, 27. 5 %) and 35. 3 [*]±[*] 15. 0 (p[*]=[*] 0. 593) in the remaining patients (n[*]=[*] 311, 45. 4 %). In multivariate analysis, only Barthel-adm was related to all three rehabilitation impact indices. CONCLUSIONS: Both premorbid and acute-process variables have {{a greater impact on}} AFG and REI, compared to RFG. Although AFG gives information about the degree of reduction in dependence, it does not provide clinical information about post-rehabilitation functional status (mean AFG values did not differ between patients with and without complete recovery). A future implication for evaluating rehabilitation effectiveness in elderly patients is to recommend RFG corrected by premorbid Barthel score, which is less affected by previous health conditions, as the optimum method to assess the degree to which maximum potential improvement was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Since 1994 {{important}} supermarket chains in Switzerland successfully sell apples from verified organic production. However, {{in supermarkets}} customers often ask whether there are, {{apart from a}} more environmentally friendly production, objective arguments of inner fruit quality that justify the higher prices of organic apples. In a field study with the ‘Golden Delicious’ cultivar, we harvested fruits of 5 pairs of organic/integrated fruit farms.

40|$|Introduction NutriQoL® (Nestlé Health Science, Vevay, Switzerland) is a {{questionnaire}} developed {{to assess the}} health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) of patients with home enteral nutrition (HEN) irrespective of their underlying condition and route of administration. The aim of this work is assessing the questionnaire’s reliability and responsiveness to change. Methods Two cohorts of patients with HEN and their primary caregivers were enrolled to assess reliability and responsiveness, respectively. All participants had to be 18 {{years of age or}} older, without mental deterioration (≤ 3 or 4 errors in the <b>Pfeiffer’s</b> <b>test)</b> and with sufficient functional status (> 40 points on Karnovsky’s performance status scale). When the patients’ ability to respond to the questionnaire was impaired due to underlying disease, their caregivers answered on their behalf. NutriQoL was administered in two and three visits to reliability and responsiveness cohorts, respectively. Test–retest reliability and internal consistency were assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Cronbach’s α, respectively. Responsiveness was evaluated by standardized effect size and standardized response mean between basal visit and third visit. Finally, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was estimated. Results A total of 54 and 86 participants were recruited to the reliability and responsiveness cohort, respectively. Thirty-five caregivers were selected to assess the inter-observer reliability. ICC values confirmed the good reproducibility level (ICC > 0. 75) of the questionnaire in both “physical functioning and activities of daily living” and “social life” domains and total score. The assessment of internal consistency in both domains of the questionnaire showed good internal consistency in visit 2. ICC showed the excellent agreement level between caregiver and patient in the global NutriQoL score. Finally, patients classified as having a minimal change in their health reported a mean (standard deviation) MCID in NutriQoL score of 0. 63 (11. 51). Conclusion NutriQoL is a reliable and unique instrument to measure the HRQoL in HEN patients. NutriQoL detects changes in the health status of the patient. Nevertheless, {{further research is needed to}} determine the full extent of the questionnaire responsiveness.

40|$|There {{occurred}} {{an epidemic}} {{of a kind of}} feveric jaundice in some parts of Okayama City and its vicinity from the later part of Summer till early autumn 1935. As we had never learned such an outbreak of such an epidemic in these districts, we wished to make it clear. We have studied it under the guidance of Prof. M. Suzuki and our study as a whole resulted as follows: 1) To our regret, we could not succeed in isolating the causal agent. This may be we think, for when we set about the study, the epidemic had already come to its closing period. 2) The clinical symptoms of this disease, we observed, were quite identical with those of the Sakushu fever. 3) And as the serological tests we examined the <b>Pfeiffers</b> phenomenon <b>test</b> and the agglomeration reaction on 12 cases and obtained: 7 positive reaction with Akiyami repto. type A. 3 positive reaction with Akiyami repto. type B. these 10 negative reaction with repto. ict. haemorrha. and the rest 2 of 12 cases gave negative reaction with any of these reptospiras. 4) We cannot yet dare to describe clearly from the epidemiological point of view why such a prevalence of this disease broke out in 1935, but it might be regarded as remarkable facts to indicate some relationship between the great inundation and the epidemic that the infected locality was visited by a disastrous inundation in the preceding year, that the upper course district of the flooded river Asahi was known as the region influenced by the Sakushu fever, and that the infected parts of Okayama City borders the suburbs where a great number of the rats, regarded as the mediators of the Sakushu fever are living, etc. You will have still more reports after our further study in the future...|$|R
5000|$|NBC {{recorded}} all of Toscanini's broadcast {{performances on}} 16-inch 33-1/3 rpm transcription discs {{from the start}} of the Maestro's broadcasts in December 1937, but the infrequent use of higher fidelity sound film for recording sessions began as early as 1933 with the Philharmonic, and by December 1948, improved high fidelity made its appearance when RCA began using magnetic tape on a regular basis. High fidelity quickly became the norm for the company and the industry. NBC Radio followed, adopting the new technology in the fall of 1949 for its NBC Symphony broadcasts, among others. The first Toscanini recording sessions in Carnegie Hall followed immediately thereafter, although individual takes continued as with 78's, each running only about 4-1/2 minutes. RCA continued in this vein with 7-inch tape reels until 1953 when long takes on 10-inch reels were finally implemented for the recording of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. With RCA's experiments in stereo beginning in early 1953 when two-track decks were first delivered by the engineers to the record producers (per Jack Pfeiffer, 11/77 interview, NYC, by CWR), stereo tapes were eventually made of Toscanini's final two broadcast concerts, plus the dress rehearsal for the final broadcast, as documented by Samuel Antek in This Was Toscanini and by <b>Pfeiffer.</b> These followed <b>test</b> sessions in New York's Manhattan Center in December of Delibes with members of the Boston Symphony under Pierre Monteux, in February 1954 with the full Boston Symphony under Charles Munch in Berlioz' Damnation of Faust , and in early March with the NBC Symphony in Manhattan Center again under Stokowski doing the Beethoven Pastoral symphony. For Toscanini, later in March and in early April, the microphones were placed relatively close to the orchestra with limited separation, so the stereo effects were not as dramatic as the commercial [...] "Living Stereo" [...] recordings RCA Victor began to make in March with the Chicago Symphony a couple of weeks earlier ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA being the most notable. (The two Toscanini concerts recorded in stereo have been issued on LP and CD and have also been offered for download in digitally enhanced sound by Pristine Classical, a company which produces digitally enhanced versions of older classical recordings.) Two days after the final concert, Guido Cantelli took the podium in a hastily organized session to record the Franck SYMPHONY for RCA Victor using the same microphone and equipment set-up put in place for the Maestro, and the stereo version of the recording was finally released on LP by RCA in 1979 (EMI holds the rights and has issued several CD versions). Toscanini's June sessions were done monophonically, the tapes being intended as inserts in otherwise complete monophonic recordings.|$|R
