40|$|Abstract This article {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} post-fault {{performance of a}} ﬁve-phase permanent magnet motor drive, considering the open circuit fault of both one and two phases. The use of both a half-bridge and a full-bridge converter is considered. Proper current control strategies are applied to get <b>proper</b> <b>performances</b> under faulty operating condition. It is shown that {{the adoption of the}} full-bridge converter allows overcoming the constraint of having a zero sum of the currents, and this is particularly advantageous under the fault of two phases. All healthy and faulty operating conditions are experimentally tested...|$|R

2500|$|The {{theological}} {{function of}} the yasna ceremony, and the <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of it, is to further asha, that is, the ceremony aims to strengthen that which is right/true (one meaning of asha) in the existence/creation (another meaning of asha) of divine order (yet another meaning of asha). The Encyclopedia Iranica summarizes {{the aim of the}} yasna ceremony as [...] "the maintenance of the cosmic integrity of the good creation of Ahura Mazdā." [...] Zoroastrianism's cosmological/eschatological perception of the purpose of humankind is to strengthen the orderly spiritual and material creations of Mazda against the assault of the destructive forces of Angra Mainyu. In that conflict, theologically speaking, mankind's primary weapon is the yasna ceremony, which is understood to have a direct, immediate effect: [...] "ar from being a symbolic act, the <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of the yasna is what prevents the cosmos from falling into chaos." [...] The culminating act of the yasna ceremony is the Ab-Zohr, the [...] "strengthening of the waters".|$|E

Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the <b>proper</b> <b>performance.</b> However the rater will only get the idea that your behavior is not as bad as other, thus, you will be rate higher.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{achievement}} of our previously proposed space–time coding algorithm entitled full-rate linear-receiver space–time block code (FRLR STBC) has motivated us to propose, in this paper, {{a new class}} of high-rate space–time–frequency block codes (STFBCs) over frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. We have called these codes FRLR STFBCs with interleaving (FRLR STFBCs-I). FRLR STFBCs-I could achieve a full-diversity property over quasi-static channels. Simulation results also verify that the proposed schemes exhibit <b>proper</b> <b>performances</b> in comparison with the recently proposed STFBCs. The most outstanding characteristic of the newly introduced high-rate codes is the linear complexity of the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver which makes possible a fast and economical decoding process...|$|R

60|$|Lastly, {{there was}} a {{tribunal}} known as the Council of Music. This was composed of the best instructed persons in the country, without regard of rank, and was devoted to the encouragement of all branches of science and art. All works on these subjects had to be submitted to them, before they could be made public. They had the supervision of all the productions of art, and the more delicate fabrics. They decided on the qualifications of the teachers of the various branches of science, inquired into the <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of their duties, and instituted examinations of the pupils. The Council gave prizes for historical composition, and poems treating of moral or traditional topics. It was, in fact, at once a board of education, and a council of science and art. The kings of the three allied states had seats upon it, and deliberated with the other members on the adjudication of the prizes.|$|E
60|$|Establishment has its {{duties as}} well as its rights. The clergy of a State Church enjoy many {{advantages}} over those of unprivileged and unendowed religious persuasions; but they lie under a correlative responsibility to the State, and to every member of the body politic.

If preachers stray beyond the doctrinal limits set by lay lawyers, the Privy Council will see to it; and, if they think fit to use their pulpits for the promulgation of literary, or historical, or scientific errors, {{it is not only the}} right, but the duty, of the humblest layman, who may happen to be better informed, to correct the evil effects of such perversion of the opportunities which the State affords them and such misuse of the authority which its support lends them. Whatever else it may claim to be, in its relations with the State, the Established Church is a branch of the Civil Service; and, for those who {267} repudiate the ecclesiastical authority of the clergy, they are merely civil servants, as much responsible to the English people for the <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of their duties as any others.|$|E

The instructor is encouraged to pause as needed to demonstrate complex task components and may even demonstrate or describe common errors and root causes of those errors. The researcher likewise may ask the instructor to pause or slow down, and may ask targeted questions to support task decomposition, understanding of assessment metrics and techniques, common errors, and effective “tricks” or strategies for successful task completion. Following the think aloud task performance, the researcher may review the video with the instructor for further clarification to highlight underlying cognitive, psychomotor, and perceptual skills and instructor-specific feedback.|$|R
