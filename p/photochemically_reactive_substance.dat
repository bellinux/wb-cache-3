The production of these VOCs {{can be traced back}} to plant growth, maintenance and wound defence mechanisms. The gases emitted as part of these wound defence mechanisms are responsible for the smell of freshly cut grass, and are also highly <b>photochemically</b> <b>reactive.</b> These emissions from grass and cut grass are not currently included in urban and global emissions inventories. Our preliminary estimate is that, within an urban airshed, during the growing season, about one third of the emissions of <b>photochemically</b> <b>reactive</b> VOCs come from grass and cut grass. These grass emissions should be included in models of urban photochemical pollution so that accurate smog predictions can be obtained...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to establish concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> as a marker of lipid peroxidation in normal pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated with pre-eclampsia, and to estimate the possibility of using thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> as a screening method for development of pre-eclampsia. The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The study included 57 singleton pregnancies, gestation > 24 weeks, of which 29 were healthy pregnancies and 28 were with pre-eclampsia, defined as systolic arterial pressure of > 90 mmHg, diastolic of > 145 mmHg, and 24 h proteinuria of > 300 mg. Thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> concentrations evaluated by malondialdehyde equivalent standards (OxiSelect™ TBARS Assay Kit (malondialdehyde Quantitation), Cell Biolabs’ OxiSelect™) showed that oxidative stress was more evident in the group with pre-eclampsia, though not statistically significant (p= 0. 107). There was no correlation of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substance</b> levels with gestation in either group. The differences between the level of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substance</b> concentrations in pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnancies indicate the possibility of using thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> as a screening tool for the development of pre-eclampsia.

METHODS [...] Venous samples were taken from 19 patients receiving thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction before the start of therapy and every hour afterwards up to 5 hours and then at 24 and 48 hours and the concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> measured. These substances are markers of lipid peroxidation induced by free oxygen radicals. Early reperfusion was judged by regression of ST elevation and late coronary artery patency from the results of coronary angiography 24 - 72 hours after thrombolysis. RESULTS [...] The concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> increased in only 6 out of 14 patients with signs of early reperfusion. In patients with late coronary artery patency the corresponding number was 6 out of 15. However, {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> was found for the whole group 24 and 48 hours after treatment. The change in concentration in serum correlated significantly with that of C reactive protein [...] an acute phase reactant (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 01) [...] but not to the serum activities of markers of infarct size such as creatine kinase B and lactate dehydrogenase.

The values were compared with those obtained in three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (n = 16), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 6), and melanoma (n = 33). In healthy skin, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione were higher in epidermis than in dermis, whereas thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> were higher in dermis than in epidermis; whole skin had intermediate values. These results suggest that there is an induction of some anti-oxygen free radicals mechanisms in epidermis as a result of increased oxygen free radicals production. Glutathione S-transferase and thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> were higher in all types of tumor than in healthy epidermis but oxidized glutathione was lower. Reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity were lower in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma samples.

Higher glutathione S-transferase activity, particularly in the most invasive forms of melanoma, indicates that this type of cancer is more malignant. Similarly, a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity can also encourage progression of the tumor.
