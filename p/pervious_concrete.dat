25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, {{yet have a}} much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E

Referring to the <b>pervious</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> pier, based on Box-Behnken design, the ductility of 25 prestressed concrete piers is calculated by numerical method. The relationship between longitudinal reinforcement ratio, shear reinforcement ratio, prestressed tendon quantity, concrete compressive {{strength and ductility}} factor is gotten. The influence of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the shear reinforcement ratio, the prestressed tendon quantity and concrete compressive strength to curvature ductility is discussed.

With the increasing of the prestressed tendon quantity, the curvature ductility curved reduces. With the increasing of shear reinforcement ratio and compressive strength of concrete, the curvature ductility increases linearly. And the influence of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio to ductility of the prestressed concrete pier is insignificant...|$|R

The project is collaboration between University of Cantabria and Coventry University and it tries to introduce the use of pervious surfaces in Spain {{at the same time as}} innovating these techniques. An experimental study of the structural and hydraulic effectiveness and suitability of different materials for the <b>pervious</b> surface (<b>concrete</b> blocks, porous asphalt and porous concrete) and the sub-base (limestone, recycled concrete and mixes with recycled plastic) is being carried out considering their ability to support the microbiological communities for the biodegradation, including the study of geotextiles and their ability to retain humidity during dry periods. This research is taking place under weather conditions corresponding to the North of Spain, an area with excellent potential for introduction of all kinds of SUDS.

The permeable concrete mainly consists of the mixture of hydraulic cement, water and coarse aggregate; Although admixture or a small percentage of fine aggregate may also be included to improve certain properties thereof. Due to its lack or low percentage of fine aggregate, this technology of concrete obtains its particular characteristic of allowing the flow of liquids through it, being this in our area of interest, especially important for the management of runoff water.

40|$|The growing {{population}} {{in urban areas}} worldwide is having a severe {{impact on the environment}} and quality of life of inhabitants. To alleviate the impact on traditional transportation infrastructures, existing and future urban facilities must be more environmentally friendly and sustainable. One solution is to develop new "green transportation infrastructures" (GTI) as part of the urban storm water management system. Although technologies for GTI have been well-investigated, there is limited experience of their potential benefits globally and, specifically, in Italy. This work, funded by the Regione Piemonte in 2015 and supported by different areas of expertise, aimed at promoting new urban storm water systems through the retention, filtration, and restoration of natural soil water content. To this end, a laboratory investigation of porous road pavements (Figure 1), and vegetated boxes (Figure 2 and 3) that filter runoff pollutants from impervious pavements was conducted to examine ecological, hydraulic, and mechanical performance levels. Three different experimental scales (samples, columns, and boxes) for the two GTI technologies were considered. Samples were used to assess the permeability, void content, strength, and pollution reduction potential of different materials used to build full-scale bio-filter systems. The pollutant reduction was determined by the reduction in suspended solids and hydrocarbon concentration, with results confirming that it depends on filter type and permeability. The preliminary results are encouraging and show a high reduction in total suspended solids and hydrocarbon concentrations (from 65 % to 99 %). <b>Concrete</b> <b>pervious</b> pavements and vegetated bio-filter systems were reproduced in columns and boxes, combining materials and supports for biofilm bacteria (geotextile, plastic caps) to assess the abatement potential of pre-developed biofilm bacteria compared to systems where bacteria are present naturally.

5000|$|The proper {{utilization}} of <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> is a recognized Best Management Practice by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for providing first flush pollution control and stormwater management.

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{counteract}} {{the negative effects of}} impervious concrete, many new paving projects have begun to use <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete,</b> which provides a level of automatic stormwater management. <b>Pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> is created by careful laying of concrete with specifically designed aggregate proportions, which allows for surface runoff to seep through and return to the groundwater. This both prevents flooding and contributes to groundwater replenishment. If designed and layered properly, <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> and other discreetly paved areas can also function as an automatic water filter by preventing certain harmful substances like oils and other chemicals from passing through. Unfortunately there are still downsides to large scale applications of pervious concrete: its reduced strength relative to conventional concrete limits use to low-load areas, and it must be laid properly to reduce susceptibility to freeze-thaw damage and sediment buildup.|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} to decrease runoff from entering {{streams and rivers}} is the implementation of low-impact development practices.

50|$|<b>Pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> is {{installed}} by being poured into forms, then screeded off, to level (not smooth) the surface, then packed or tamped into place.

50|$|A common {{flatwork}} form has riser strips on top {{such that}} the screed is 3/8-1/2 in. (9 to 12 mm) above final pavement elevation. Mechanical screeds are preferable to manual. The riser strips are removed to guide compaction. Immediately after screeding, the concrete is compacted to improve the bond and smooth the surface. Excessive compaction of <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete</b> results in higher compressive strength, but lower porosity (and thus lower permeability).|$|E
50|$|Although some porous paving {{materials}} appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different.

50|$|Alternative paving {{materials}} : An alternative solution {{today is to}} use permeable paving surfaces, such as brick, <b>pervious</b> <b>concrete,</b> stone, special paving blocks, or tire-tread woven mats. These materials allow rain to soak into the ground through the spaces inherent {{in the parking lot}} surface. The ground then may become contaminated in the surface of the parking lot park, but this tends to stay in a small area of ground, which effectively filters water before it seeps away.
