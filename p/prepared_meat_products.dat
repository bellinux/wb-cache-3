40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, U. S. meat {{consumption}} patterns have changed. Food consumption patterns are influenced by changing demographic characteristics, changing lifestyles, increasing health, and nutrition concerns. Prior research suggests that these factors have significant influence on the demand for meat (Capps and Schmitz; Kinnucan, Hsia, and Jackson). By incorporating a demographic and a health information variable in the meat demand system, this study aims to quantify and interpret important non-price determinants of meat demand. Demographic and health information variables might act as demand shifters in the model. Evaluating the effects of changes on meat demand delivers information on the potential existence of structural change in the underlying consumer utility function. This research statistically estimates the impact of health and demographic information on the aggregate U. S. demand for beef, pork, poultry and fish over the period of 1970 to 1999. To estimate these demands, this study employed both the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) by Deaton and Muellbauer and the Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System (IAIDS) by Eales and Unnevehr. The well-defined preference structure and consistent aggregation from the micro to the market level has made the AIDS especially popular when modeling the demand for meat. The IAIDS is used in this study, because of the focus on perishable agricultural products; thus, it might seem appropriate to have quantities as exogenous permitting prices to adjust {{in order to allow}} short-run market clearance. Comparing the results of each demand system provides insight into which demand system most appropriately represents the variables of interest. However, in significant contrast to past studies that have focused on the role of health information on meat demand, this study will additionally explore how structural change depends on the endogeneity of prices and quantities (Capps and Schmitz; Eales and Unnevehr; Kinnucan, Hsia, and Jackson). This study treats demographic and health information measures as concomitant variables in the standard AIDS and IAIDS share equations. This research also evaluates whether these variables support the type of structural change in meat demand that have been proposed in previous research, such as that by Moschini and Meilke who suggest a mid 1970 s demand change. The health index in the model is represented by the cumulative sum of the net number of reviewed medical journal articles published, which support the linkage between cholesterol and heart disease. The study uses the original Brown and Schrader index as base data, subsequently weighted by a factor representing the relative proportion of all journal articles providing negative cholesterol information (Kinnucan, Hsia, and Jackson). Demographic information is represented by women's participation in the labor force. Results from this study indicate that the index of the percentage of women in the work force is a determining factor in estimating meat demand. This variable represents several demographic changes that have occurred over the past two decades. More women, particularly mothers, work, which leads to an increase in households with both parents in the work force. With more time spent outside the household, less time can be devoted to preparing meals for the family. The demand for easy-to-prepare meal solutions rises, and leads to a modification in consumption behavior. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the poultry and fish industries have responded to consumers' demand for easily <b>prepared</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> In contrast to previous research (Kinnucan, Hsia, and Jackson; Capps and Schmitz), this study shows that the health information index does not have a significant effect on aggregate meat demand. These results suggest that in aggregate, the concerns about cholesterol consumption have had little, if any, effect on meat demand. Disentangling the effects of health information and demographic changes on meat demand merits further investigation. The availability of this information will help producers develop products which better correspond to consumer tastes, preferences and demographics. Retailers will also benefit by developing more effective marketing strategies and an opportunity to expand market share. As a result, consumers could benefit from improved availability of products and information that meet their needs and circumstances. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to cephalosprins {{due to the}} {{production}} of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases is increasingly found in infections in humans outside the hospital. The genes encoding for these beta-lactamases are located on mobile DNA (plasmids), which can be transferred between bacterial species. Although the source of these bacteria is unknown, a food-borne source cannot be excluded. From 2003 to 2007 cefotaxime resistance increases in bacteria from broilers, but not in isolates from calves, pigs and dairy cows. Cefotaxime resistance is indicative for the presence of ESBLs or plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Molecular typing of the resistance genes and the plasmids of Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates from broilers revealed the presence of a variety of ESBL/AmpC genes: blaCTX-M- 1, blaCTX-M- 2, blaTEM- 52, blaSHV- 2, blaTEM 20, blaACC- 1 and blaCMY- 2, located on plasmids: IncI 1, IncHI 2 /P, IncK and some untypeable plasmids. A study performed at 26 broiler farms and a study performed in the broiler production pyramid showed that ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were ubiquitous present. All 26 broiler farms contained broilers with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in their faeces. Also in faeces of broiler farmers ESBL/AmpC producers were frequently found (33 % against 10 % described in the general population). ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were also present at every level in the broiler production pyramid. In addition, in a study on three broiler farms, ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were found in the environment of two of four poultry houses before arrival of the broilers at the broiler farm. At arrival, not all broilers carried ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates, but within one week these isolates could be cultured from faeces of all 25 broilers tested. blaCTX-M- 1 and blaTEM- 52 on IncI 1 plasmids were also found in bacteria isolated from infections in Dutch patients and subtyping of IncI 1 plasmids revealed that 19 % of the E. coli infections in Dutch patients was due to genetically identical resistance genes and plasmids as found in the broiler isolates. In addition, 94 % of broiler meat purchased at different stores in the Netherlands contained similar ESBL-producing bacteria. This shows a high potency of transfer via food to humans. ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were also found among 2 % of bacteria causing clinical infections in companion animals and horses. ESBL/AmpC genes found in these isolates are partly similar to the ones found in broilers, but also include types found more often in humans, which shows another possible route of these bacteria to humans. Due to the potential threat to human health it is important to control the spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates in the broiler production pyramid. This is feasible by preventing transmission from the top {{to the bottom of the}} broiler production pyramid, by identifying risk factors leading to the presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates, by reducing the selection pressure imposed by the use of antimicrobials and by preventing local recirculation within subsequent flocks. In the meantime hygienic measures at slaughterhouses, hygienic standards in <b>preparing</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> at retail and hygienic measures taken in the kitchen by the consumer are important measures to reduce the possibility of obtaining these isolate...|$|R
