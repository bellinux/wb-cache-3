5|$|Entrance to {{the mosque}} complex is via a two-storey edifice built of red {{sandstone}} which is elaborately decorated with framed and carved <b>paneling</b> {{on each of}} its facades. The edifice features a muqarna, an architectural feature from the Middle East that was first introduced into Mughal architecture with construction of the nearby and ornate Wazir Khan Mosque.|$|E
5|$|Oregon's House {{chamber floor}} {{is covered with}} a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern {{incorporates}} a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and <b>paneling</b> of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use black walnut for the <b>paneling</b> and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On {{the second floor of the}} capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the <b>paneling</b> is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (western meadowlark).|$|E
5|$|The house {{also has}} {{significant}} interior features, including marble fireplaces, wood <b>paneling,</b> coffered ceilings, window and door architraves, parquet floors, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail, {{primarily in the}} Adamesque mold. The original furnishings together were reported in 1895 to have cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, and to have included rare tapestries, carved woods, paintings, and Italian marble.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceilings}} {{from the}} main rooms of the castle were renovated with <b>panelings,</b> which were recovered, for some of them, by metal frames installed during {{the restoration of the}} 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|Some new {{features}} were the concealed running boards, deep cut doors, horizontal dart louvers, original treatment of windows, moldings and <b>paneling's,</b> and the [...] "rakish slant of the windshield." [...] The Speedster {{and the two}} Pirate models were on [...] chassis and the Pursuit was on a [...] chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} made of hewn stone and tiled roof, in {{accordance}} with the usual pattern of churches. It was a rectangular structure with artistically painted wooden <b>panelings</b> in lieu of an arch to which were attached support and strong beams which crisscrossed the walls to protect the building from earthquakes, attractive and hade plain and simple altar ornaments without the extravagant carvings that were characteristic of the past century.|$|R
5|$|She {{was fitted}} {{out over the}} {{remainder}} of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted promenade deck contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak <b>paneling,</b> velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{temple in}} Houston, Texas, was {{inspired}} by Greco-Roman architecture. It is the largest temple constructed by La Luz del Mundo in the United States as of 2011. The temple's pillars resemble the Parthenon, according to religious historian Timothy Wyatt. The {{front of the building}} is decorated with carved scenes from the Bible and three panes of stained glass also depict biblical scenes. The temple can hold 4,500 people. The interior has marble floors, glass chandeliers, and wood <b>paneling.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pyramid core was {{constructed}} in a step-like structure, a construction technique {{similar to that of}} the 4th dynasty although the building material was of a significantly lower quality. The outer casing of the pyramid was made of fine Tura limestone which certainly ensured Userkaf's construction an appearance {{similar to that of the}} glorious 4th Dynasty pyramids. There was however no red granite <b>paneling</b> over the lower part of the pyramid as in the case of the Pyramid of Menkaure.|$|E
50|$|The Cyprus was {{discovered}} {{lying on her}} port side in about 460 feet of water. Her hull is totally intact, which is surprising considering the rather violent manner in which she foundered. Wreckage consisting of wall <b>panelings,</b> doors, railings, pipes, and her cargo of iron ore are scattered about the bottom up to 270 {{feet away from the}} wreck. Her name and port of call remains completely legible on her stern.|$|R
2500|$|The bedroom {{adjacent}} {{to the dining room}} and the subsequent house chapel are the only rooms of the palace that remain in neo-Gothic style. [...] The king's bedroom is dominated by a huge bed adorned with carvings. Fourteen carvers worked more than four years on the bed canopy with its numerous pinnacles and on the oaken <b>panelings.</b> It was in this room that Ludwig was arrested in the night from 11 to 12 June 1886. The adjacent little house chapel is consecrated to Saint Louis, after whom the owner was named.|$|R
50|$|Keeping in {{mind the}} {{traditional}} seating requirements at Indian classical musical concerts and performances, the Tata Theatre stage is built in the almost semi-circular thrust shape. The alternate concave and convex triangular forms on the overhead and the wall <b>panelings</b> ensure even distribution of acoustics over the entire auditorium. The acoustic forms of high-density compressed plaster were handmade and lifted manually up into their positions. The architects ensured that every musical instrument played in the orchestra could individually be heard and appreciated {{in every corner of}} the auditorium.|$|R
5|$|This smaller room {{may have}} been used by Henry and Thomas Lyte for their studies. It too has later <b>paneling</b> and an alcove in which are {{displayed}} a collection of early glassware. Above this room is the Little Chamber, used by Sir Walter Jenner as his bedroom. The bed came from Burton Pynsent House in Somerset, a house given to William Pitt the Elder by an admirer of his achievements as prime minister.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the main}} family sitting room on the ground floor, with the south-facing grand window giving views to the gardens, and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533. In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood <b>paneling</b> (including Ionic pilasters) and the {{internal}} porch: these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts. In the 20th century the room was {{being used as a}} store for farm equipment. Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the panelling to reveal the original warm-coloured oak.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers' trip to Norway {{provided}} essential {{knowledge for}} the animators {{to come up}} with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive <b>paneling</b> and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.|$|E
5000|$|The Mitchell House is a Neo-Classical Revival Style {{building}} in Lebanon, Tennessee {{that was built}} as a home by Dr. David Mitchell and his wife, Elizabeth. It was designed by architects Thompson, Gibel & Asmus. [...] Construction began in 1906 and was completed in 1910 with 10,600 square feet of living space. At the time, Dr. Mitchell {{was the president of}} Cumberland University and a co-founder of Castle Heights Military Academy. Craftsmen were brought in to work on the extensive millwork and wood <b>panelings</b> and floors. Chandeliers were imported from Italy and rugs were imported from Austria.|$|R
25|$|Located in room 204, the walnut-paneled Mulert Memorial {{classroom}} {{was designed}} by Philadelphia architect Gustav Ketterer and university architect Albert Klimcheck. The room features wood floors, fluted ionic columns, red velvet draperies, and student chairs with leather seats. The room's doors have fluted jams and <b>panelings</b> of Greek rosettes. A Mulert family coat-of-arms and memorial inscription {{is located on the}} rear wall of the room. The room was provided for in the will of the late Mt. Lebanon resident Justus Mulert, the room was dedicated on December 21, 1942, and serves as a memorial to Mulert's wife, Louise and his son Ferdinand Max, who died in 1912 during his senior year at Washington and Jefferson College.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{her sisters}} built for ferry service, cabins were {{built on the}} planned {{car-deck}} on the B- and C-decks on the Bohème. The car decks had in fact been originally planned to accommodate temporary cabin modules during the winter when Lion Ferry, the company that had originally ordered the Bohème, planned to use her for cruising to the Canary Isles. Additionally a small gymnasium and cinema were added in place of cargo hold on D-deck. All stairways and public rooms were panelled in light Nordic woods, while the deluxe cabins received dark oak <b>panelings.</b> During the 1983 refit much of the original panelling was replaced either by colourful paintings or mirrors to give an increased sense of space. Similarly much of the upholstery and carpets were changed into cheerier colours.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with <b>paneling.</b> An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate <b>paneling</b> and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany <b>paneling</b> remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
50|$|The {{temple was}} built in a navaratna (nine-spired) style before the {{destruction}} caused by the earthquake of 1897. The characteristic features of the erections are the four centered and wide multi-cusped arches, the plastered surface of the walls having immense rectangular and square <b>panelings,</b> prominence of the central archway and the central mihirab by making the slightly larger and setting in a projected fronton in the outside directions, the use of ornamental turrets on the {{either side of the}} fronons, the semi-octagonal mirirab apertures,the archway opening under half-domes, the Persian muquarnas work in stucco inside the half-domes over the entrance arches and mihirab niches,the bulbous outline of the domes with constructed necks, domes on octagonal drums with lotus and kalasa finials as the crowning elements, the round pendentives to make up the phase of transition for the domes and the multi-faced corner towers rising high above the horizontal merloned parapets.|$|R
40|$|Panels from {{renewable}} resources {{to be used}} in the automotive industry have already been explored for quite a long time. Now, with respect to the end of live vehicles directive 2000 / 53 /EC, this subject is being discussed again. Presently natural fibre semiproducts are utilised for mainly two-dimensional <b>panelings</b> in the car-interior. Frequently used matrix systems are polypropylene (PP) and polyurethane (PUR). For the manufacture of components characterised by a high conversion ratio like e. g. dashboard panels, increased demands are made on the drape of the fibre semiproducts. To be able to realise these complex components based on natural reinforcing fibres, it is necessary to determine the decisive parameters of the manufacture of semiproducts while considering the respective fibre characteristics on the drape. Thus, the manufacturer of semiproducts is enabled to produce tailor-made materials for such applications. Herewith, a basis for standardisation as well as quality control should be created, which is of great importance especially for safety relevant structures...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of quantifying the production of wood in the Area of the Fourth Colony of Italian Immigration in Rio Grande do Sul. Firstly, using a questionnaire, a census of the consuming companies of wood in that area was made, investigating mainly the amount, type, origin of the consumed raw material, and the amount, type and end use of wood products. As principal results, it was verified that such area presents 77 consuming companies and wood processing units. These were classified into micro and small companies, with familiar features and capital, and low industrialization. In the visits made to the industries, it was evident that many technological aspects are not known or are neglected, thus causing loss of the raw material and/or in low quality of the final products. A great amount of raw material (96, 8 % of the boards and 98, 9 % of the timber) comes from other areas of the State or the country. In the same way the main products are sold abroad (wood frames 86, 3 %, <b>panelings</b> 99, 7 %, sawed wood 53 %). </p...|$|R
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the <b>paneling</b> and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood <b>paneling</b> with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak <b>paneling,</b> {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E
5000|$|From {{a few of}} {{his parents}} clients in New York, Christophe started to build a clientele. He {{eventually}} met Amy Perlin and became her shop manager and advisor as she started her business. The renowned Designer John Saladino, a client of the gallery, would later discover Christophe amazing ability to recreate old period finishes and gave him his big break. Since then clients have included Mayor Bloomberg, the City of New York, The Holy see mission, famous personalities and designers as renowned as David Kleinberg, Bunny Williams and Benjamin Noriega Ortiz. Christophe is quoted to say: [...] " [...] I have my entrance to each and every building on Fifth and Park Avenues; from 9am to 4pm...Service entrance that is!!!" [...] Martha Stewart came to appreciate Christophe's work for her very well cared for personal Antiques and furniture. She invited him repeatedly on her TV and Radio Shows for segments on furniture care and maintenance and to showcase artisanal techniques and crafts. Other notable conservation projects include the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, residence of the Mayors of New York, George Washington writing desk and the Council Room wood <b>panelings</b> both in NY City Hall.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a set of}} novel optimization approaches for dealing with three different architecturally motivated rationalization tasks: First, a planarization technique for enabling efficient (e. g., glass) <b>panelings</b> of tessellated freeform geometries is presented. The formulation is based on plane intersections and yields planar panels by construction. Furthermore, the used constraints are straightforward algebraic expressions of lower polynomial degree than used in various comparable methods. The generality of the method is demonstrated by application {{to a variety of}} architecturally inspired optimization problems. Then, for a new type of support structures called point-folded structures an anti-diversification technique is developed for reducing the number of geometrically different panels. By a problem-adapted parametrization and carefully designed search strategy, the shape redundancy can be reduced by over 90 % for various freeform designs, enabling significant reductions of fabrication costs in practice. Finally, for the still largely unexplored high potential area of constrained tessellation techniques, i. e., tessellation algorithms restricted to using only structural elements from a predefined set, two novel approaches based on a commercially available construction system (Zometool) are presented. The first method concerns approximation of closed surfaces of arbitrary genus, and implements an effective model-exploration strategy to efficiently find a solution. Furthermore, for guaranteeing planarity of panels when tessellating the architecturally important class of freeform surface patches, a second method based on an advancing front method guided by a novel growing strategy is developed...|$|R
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when <b>paneling</b> from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, <b>paneling,</b> doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany <b>paneling,</b> velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E
