I can only listen very hard, as it were, {{taking it all in}} with bowed head and clasped hands, not to say moist eyes even, and feel that--well, that the whole thing has been after all worth while then. But one is simply in the hands of such a reader and appreciator as you--one yields even assentingly, gratefully and irresponsibly to the current of your story and consistency of your case. I feel that I really don't know much--as to what your various particulars imply--save that you are delightful, are dazzling, and that you must be beautifully right as to any view that you take of anything. Let me say, for all, that if you think so, so it must be; for clearly you see and understand and discriminate--while one {{is at the end of}} time one's self so very vague about many things and only conscious of one's general virtuous intentions and considerably strenuous effort. What one has done has been conditioned and related and involved--so to say, fatalised--every element and effort jammed up against some other necessity or yawning over some consequent void--and with anything good in one's achievement or fine in one's faculty conscious all the while of having to pay by this and that and the other corresponding dereliction or weakness. You let me off, however, as handsomely as you draw me on, and I see you as absolutely right about everything and want only to square with yours my impression: that is to say any but that of my being [...] "dim" [...] in respect to some of the aspects, possibly, of Mrs. Brookenham--which I don't think I am: I really think I could stand a stiff cross-examination on that lady.

Significant training wage premia are found only in the case of young or highly educated employees. By contrast training appears to have a strong impact on employment security, measured through subjective measures, in the case of both older and low-educated workers. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, one needs to take into account that, as standard in the literature, wage premia are estimated on a truncated sample including only employed workers. Due to downward wage rigidity, those workers who are unable to maintain their productivity are more frequently laid-off - rather than experiencing a wage fall and be retained in employment - and thereby excluded from the sample...|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of dual modulation Faraday rotation spectroscopy {{has been applied}} for near shot-noise limited detection of HO 2 at the exit of an atmospheric pressure flow reactor. This was achieved by combining direct current modulation at 51 kHz of an external cavity quantum cascade laser system with 610 Hz modulation of the magnetic field generated by a Helmholtz coil. The DM-FRS measurement had a 1. 8 times better signal-to-noise ratio than an AC-FRS measurement acquired under identical flow reactor conditions. Harmonic detection of the FRS signal also eliminated the substantial DC-offset associated with electromagnetic intereference pick-up from the Helmholtz coils that is observed in the AC-FRS spectrum. A noise equivalent angle of 4 x 10 ^(- 9) rad Hz^(- 1 / 2) was observed for the DM-FRS measurement, and this corresponds to a 3 sigma detection limit of 0. 2 ppmv Hz^(- 1 / 2).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} {{to characterize the}} space of identifiable inertial parameters in system identification of an articulated robot. This problem has been considered in the literature for decades; however, existing methods suffer from common drawbacks. Methods either rely on symbolic techniques that do not scale, or rely on numerical techniques that {{are sensitive to the}} choice of an input motion. The contribution of this work is to propose a recursive algorithm for this problem that requires only the structural parameters of a mechanism as its input. This Recursive Parameter Nullspace Algorithm (RPNA) can be applied to general open-chain kinematic trees, and does not rely on symbolic techniques. Drawing on the exponential parameterization of rigid-body kinematics, classical linear controllability and observability results can be directly applied to inertial parameter identifiability. The high-level operation of the RPNA is based on a key observation [...] undetectable changes in inertial parameters can be interpreted as sequences of inertial transfers across the joints. This observation can be applied recursively, and lends an overall complexity of O(N) to determine the minimal parameters for a system of N bodies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} matter density fluctuations on supernova collective neutrino flavor oscillations. In particular, we use full multi-angle, 3 -flavor, self-consistent simulations {{of the evolution of}} the neutrino flavor field in the envelope of an O-Ne-Mg core collapse supernova at shock break-out (neutrino neutronization burst) to study the effect of the matter density "bump" left by the He-burning shell. We find a seemingly counterintuitive increase in the overall electron neutrino survival probability created by this matter density feature. We discuss this behavior in terms of the interplay between the matter density profile and neutrino collective effects. While our results give new insights into this interplay, they also suggest an immediate consequence for supernova neutrino burst detection: {{it will be difficult to}} use a burst signal to extract information on fossil burning shells or other fluctuations of this scale in the matter density profile. Consistent with previous studies, our results also show that the interplay of neutrino self-coupling and matter fluctuation could cause a significant increase in the electron neutrino survival probability at very low energyComment: 12 pages, 11 figures.

40|$|Heat flow {{between a}} large "bath" {{and a smaller}} system brings them {{progressively}} closer to thermal equilibrium while increasing their entropy. Deviations from this trend are fluctuations involving {{a small fraction of}} a statistical ensemble of systems interacting with the bath: in this respect, quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement. Can there be drastic differences between them? Here we address a distinctly quantum mechanical setting that displays such differences: disturbances of thermal equilibrium between two-level systems (TLS) and a bath by frequent and brief quantum (non-demolishing) measurements of the TLS energy-states. If the measurements are frequent enough to induce either the Zeno or the anti-Zeno regime, namely, the slowdown or speedup of the TLS relaxation, then the resulting entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are found to be completely unrelated to what is expected by standard thermodynamical rules that hold for memoryless baths. The practical advantage of these anomalies is the possibility of very fast control of heat and entropy, allowing cooling and state-purification of quantum systems much sooner than their thermal equilibration time.

The second process was to provide <b>pre-submission</b> feedback for the first essay. The qualitative data showed how students perceived their ways of learning, their potential contributions to small groups, and that appropriate student contributions to lectures, tutorials and assignments are important to the learning process. The study also investigates the effectiveness of providing structured feedback about draft assessment to students before the submission of their first university assignment, showing that a statistically significant improvement in assessment marks results from allowing students to submit a draft of their first university assignment, provided that they receive constructive feedback.

40|$|Interfacing a kinetic {{action of}} a person to an action of a machine system is an {{important}} research topic in many application areas. One of the key factors for intimate human-machine interaction {{is the ability of}} the control algorithm to detect and classify different user commands with shortest possible latency, thus making a highly correlated link between cause and effect. In our research, we focused on the task of mapping user kinematic actions into sound samples. The presented methodology relies on the wireless sensor nodes equipped with inertial measurement units and the real-time algorithm dedicated for early detection and classification of a variety of movements/gestures performed by a user. The core algorithm is based on the approximate Bayesian inference of Vector Autoregressive Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (VAR-HHMM), where models database is derived from the set of motion gestures. The performance of the algorithm was compared with an online version of the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm, where we used offline expert based classification as the benchmark. In almost all of the evaluation metrics (e. g. confusion matrix, recall and precision scores) the VAR-HHMM algorithm outperformed KNN. Furthermore, the VAR-HHMM algorithm, in some cases, achieved faster movement onset detection compared with the offline standard. The proposed concept, although envisioned for movement-to-sound application, could be implemented in other human-machine interfaces. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, a <b>pre-submission</b> draf...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} cold, particle {{interpretation of}} dark matter (CDM) still lacks laboratory support and struggles with the basic properties of common dwarf galaxies, which have surprisingly uniform central masses and shallow density profiles. In contrast, galaxies predicted by CDM extend to much lower masses, with steeper, singular profiles. This tension motivates cold, wavelike dark matter (ψDM) composed of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate, so the uncertainty principle counters gravity below a Jeans scale. Here we achieve the first cosmological simulations of this quantum state at unprecedentedly high resolution capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, with only one free parameter, m_B, the boson mass. We demonstrate the large scale structure of this ψDM simulation is indistinguishable from CDM, as desired, but differs radically inside galaxies. Connected filaments and collapsed haloes form a large interference network, with gravitationally self-bound solitonic cores inside every galaxy surrounded by extended haloes of fluctuating density granules. These results allow us to determine m_B=(8. 1 ^+ 1. 6 _- 1. 7) × 10 ^- 23 eV using stellar phase-space distributions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Denser, more massive solitons are predicted for Milky Way sized galaxies, providing a substantial seed to help explain early spheroid formation. Suppression of small structures means the onset of galaxy formation for ψDM is substantially delayed relative to CDM, appearing at z≲ 13 in our simulations.

This new journal is a partner journal to the International Journal for Parasitology (IJP). The mandate of IJP-DDR is to publish original research aimed at developing drugs for control of unicellular or multicellular parasites of human or veterinary importance. It is intended to disseminate new knowledge {{in the area of}} anti-parasitic drugs and drug development and foster research aimed at defining mechanisms of drug resistance, as well as stimulating debate on matters of current controversy in these areas. In keeping with current publishing trends, IJP-DDR will be an open-access journal. The two founding Editors-in-Chief, Kevin Saliba and Andrew Kotze, will be responsible for the editing of submissions in the area of unicellular and multicellular parasites, respectively. They are supported by an internationally respected team of Editorial Board members spanning the many specialist research areas within the broad field of parasitology and drugs. We encourage colleagues in this field of research to submit appropriate papers to IJP-DDR. Please send your <b>pre-submission</b> inquiries to the communal Elsevier e-mail address. At a time when parasite drug resistance continues to threaten human and animal health, the Australian Society for Parasitology is delighted to have fostered the founding of this new journal which we anticipate will provide an excellent forum for the dissemination of original discoveries in this critical area of parasitology research...|$|E
40|$|This thesis study {{followed}} six MA in English Language Teaching/Applied Linguistics {{students as}} they started out on their one-year programmes at the University of Reading, UK. They came from various academic, professional and national backgrounds. One was a native speaker of English; the other five were not. The study takes an ethnographic approach in exploring how these mature students learned to meet writing requirements in this context (which were within the essayist tradition of academic literacy), both as individual case studies and as a group. The focus was on three Terml writing assignments which all students had in common. However, the research sought to contextualise first term experiences {{in the framework of}} the whole year of study. I therefore interviewed these students about their writing five times in the year, including after submission of their year-end dissertations, and contacted them again a year later for post-course insights. The study explored how they responded to <b>pre-submission</b> advice from tutors and their reactions to and use of summative feedback provided. It also examined assignment briefings and documentation, students' meetings with personal tutors and my interviews with module tutors, as well as feedback on outlines and on the three assignments, and the assignments themselves. Although the students were, of course, six unique individual cases, themes emerged from this study of their development as academic writers in this context. These include the influence of background (such as academic, professional, discipline, linguistic), personal characteristics (eg expectations and approach to learning), and the role of literacy brokers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pre-submission</b> draft Probabilistic {{reasoning}} fallacies {{in legal}} practice {{have been widely}} documented. Yet these fallacies continue to occur. This paper considers how best to avoid them. Although most fallacies can be easily explained and avoided by applying Bayes’ Theorem, attempts to do so with lawyers using the normal formulaic approach seem doomed to failure. In our experience, for simple arguments {{it is possible to}} explain common fallacies using purely visual presentation alternatives to the formulaic version of Bayes in ways that are fully understandable to lay people. However, as the evidence (and dependence between different evidence) becomes more complex, these visual approaches become infeasible. We show how Bayesian networks can be used, in conjunction with visual presentations, to address the more complex arguments {{in such a way that}} it is not necessary to expose the underlying complex Bayesian computations. In this way Bayesian Networks work like an electronic calculator for complex Bayesian computations. We demonstrate this new approach in explaining well known fallacies and a new fallacy (called the Crimewatch fallacy) that arose in a recent major murder trial in which we were expert witnesses. We also address the barriers to more widespread take-up of these methods within the legal profession, including the need to ‘believe ’ the correctness of Bayesian calculations and the inevitable reluctance to consider subjective prior probabilities. The paper provides a number of original contributions: a classification of fallacies that is conceptually simpler than previous approaches; the new fallacy; and a proposal, whose necessity is based on real case experience, for a radically new means of fully exploiting Bayes to enhance legal reasoning 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pre-submission</b> version. The {{number of}} people without secure access to food has risen over the past 15 years, in large part {{propelled}} by high and volatile food prices. This pattern {{is likely to continue}} under the influence of speculation, increasing demand from rapidly growing economies and for biofuels and due to the effects on production of climate change and variability. Most vulnerable are consumers and small farmers in countries where farming is predominantly rainfed. The impact of rising levels of hunger on human health and major diseases is of wide concern, however our ability to predict their impact is limited. With respect to HIV, much of what is known about the effect of hunger and other facets of poverty comes from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of limited duration that shed little light on dynamic effects, whether trends, cycles, or major shocks. The fact that hunger is both a cause and a consequence of HIV further limits the ability of these methods to disentangle the effect of change in either of them. The evidence reported here brings new light to bear on this question. It assesses the 2001 - 03 famine in Malawi as a country-scale “unnatural experiment” on the effect of hunger on the dynamics of HIV. As described below, the famine “intervention” was “sharp, well-defined but unplanned” and its effects were unequally experienced among rural areas, between rural and non-rural areas and between men and women – characteristics of a natural experiment. The Malawi famine was unnatural in that it was a consequence largely of actions and policies that, as in many famines, restricted people’s access to food. Analysis of this experiment suggests important implications for the understanding of HIV dynamics and conception of prevention, discussed in the final section...|$|E

Seventy seven SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP) (HLA matched unrelated donor (MUD), n= 50; matched related donor (MRD), n= 27) underwent whole exome sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generating alloreactive peptide libraries for each DRP (9 -mer peptide-HLA complexes); Human CMV CROSS (Cross-Reactive Open Source Sequence) Database was compiled from NCBI; HLA class I binding affinity for each DRPs HLA was calculated by NetMHCpan 2. 8 and hCMV- derived 9 -mers algorithmically compared to the alloreactive peptide-HLA complex libraries. Short consecutive (6 or greater) amino acid (AA) sequence homology matching hCMV to recipient peptides was considered for HLA-bound-peptide (IC 50 < 500 nM) cross reactivity. Of the 70, 686 hCMV 9 -mers contained within the hCMV CROSS database, 29, 658. 8 +/- 9038. 5 were found to match MRD DRP alloreactive peptides and 52, 910. 2 +/- 16121. 8 matched MUD DRP peptides (Student's T-test, p< 0. 001). In silico analysis revealed multiple high affinity, immunogenic CMV-Human peptide matches (IC 50 < 500 nM) expressed in GVHD-affected tissue-specific manner (proteins expressed at 10 RPKM or greater). hCMV+GVHD was found in 18 patients, 13 developing hCMV viremia before GVHD onset with a subset analysis of 7 instances of hCMV viremia prior to acute GVHD onset (n= 3), chronic GVHD (n= 2) and acute + chronic GVHD (n= 2) indicating cross reactive peptide expression within affected organs. We propose that based on our analysis and preliminary clinical correlations that hCMV immune cross-reactivity may cause antigenic mimicry of human alloreactive peptides triggering GVHD.

40|$|We {{forecast}} the main cosmological parameter constraints achievable with the CORE space mission which {{is dedicated to}} mapping the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). CORE was recently submitted in response to ESA’s fifth call for mediumsized mission proposals (M 5). Here we report the results from our <b>pre-submission</b> study {{of the impact of}} various instrumental options, in particular the telescope size and sensitivity level, and review the great, transformative potential of the mission as proposed. Specifically, we assess the impact on a broad range of fundamental parameters of our Universe {{as a function of the}} expected CMB characteristics, with other papers in the series focusing on controlling astrophysical and instrumental residual systematics. In this paper, we assume that only a few central CORE frequency channels are usable for our purpose, all others being devoted to the cleaning of astrophysical contaminants. On the theoretical side, we assume ΛCDM as our general framework and quantify the improvement provided by CORE over the current constraints from the Planck 2015 release. We also study the joint sensitivity of CORE and of future Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Large Scale Structure experiments like DESI and Euclid. Specific constraints on the physics of inflation are presented in another paper of the series. In addition to the six parameters of the base ΛCDM, which describe the matter content of a spatially flat universe with adiabatic and scalar primordial fluctuations from inflation, we derive the precision achievable on parameters like those describing curvature, neutrino physics, extra light relics, primordial helium abundance, dark matter annihilation, recombination physics, variation of fundamental constants, dark energy, modified gravity, reionization and cosmic birefringence. In addition to assessing the improvement on the precision of individual parameters, we also {{forecast the}} post-CORE overall reduction of the allowed parameter space with figures of merit for various models increasing by as much as ∼ 107 as compared to Planck 2015, and 105 with respect to Planck 2015 + future BAO measurements...|$|E

Microbial pest control products and agents can include those derived through genetic engineering. When the PMRA was established in 1995, specific directions were given by government to facilitate access to alternatives to traditional chemical products; to support environmental sustainability; and to pursue international cooperation to accelerate registration. Currently in Canada, there are 8 active ingredients and 34 products registered. In 1998, there were 19 research permits and notifications for active ingredients, an increase from 1997. Data requirements are set out in guidelines (Pro 98 - 01 Regulatory Proposal: Guidelines for the registration of microbial pest control agents and products), rather than in regulation. General categories for data requirements for Tier 1 (the set of information which is typically sufficient to allow regulators to determine that a product presents an acceptably low level of risk) include information or data on characterization, health toxicity, environmental toxicity, and efficacy. <b>Pre-submission</b> consultations between registrants and PMRA are encouraged. The main objectives of these consultations are to determine the appropriate study protocols and the subset of data requirements from the guidelines that may be required for the registration of a particular proposed product {{as well as the}} type of information required to support data waivers. Key issues, questions and challenges regarding registration 1. Characterization of the microbial active ingredient is seen as critical and fundamental to the determination of the other data requirements both in environment and in health. The key components are:• identification of the microorganism• relationship to mammalian or other pathogens• toxin producing potential• manufacturing process, including potential for contaminants• physical/technical properties, including storage stability. 2. Building on good information on characterization, for environmental risk assessment, information on host/target range, geographical distribution of host/target, and the geographical distribution of the microbial are key questions. 4. With respect to publicly-funded research groups, {{there is a need for}} links with commercial partners at an appropriate stage in order to love their products into the regulatory System and onto the marketplace. PMRA is working to support the registration and use of microbial products through developing data requirements appropriate to microbiais, working with growers and other stakeholders to support the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that include the use of microbials, harmonizing data requirements with both the US and other OECD countries, and ensuring the development of regulations and policies to encourage registration of these products...|$|E
40|$|Data {{policy of}} {{scientific}} journals: the Nature perspective. An inherent principle of publication is that others {{should be able}} to replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. Therefore, a condition of publication in a Nature journal is that authors are required to make materials, data and associated protocols available in a publicly accessible database or, where one does not exist, to readers promptly on request. Any restrictions on the availability of materials or information must be disclosed at the time of submission of the manuscript, and the methods section of the manuscript itself should include details of how materials and information may be obtained, including any restrictions that may apply. One preferred form of disclosure is a link from the methods section to a copy of the relevant Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) form, which is hosted as Supplementary Information accompanying the paper on the journal's web site. Authors may charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs of producing and distributing materials. If materials are to be distributed by a for-profit company, this should be stated in the paper. The Nature journals recommend specific databases or repositories for the following types of data: mutant strains, cell lines, sequences, structures, 'omics' and microarrays. Any supporting data sets {{for which there is no}} public repository must be made available to peer-reviewers at submission and any interested reader on and after the publication date from the authors directly, the author providing a URL to be used in the paper on publication. Such material must be hosted on an accredited independent site (URL and accession numbers to be provided by the author), or sent to the Nature journal at submission, either uploaded via the journal's online submission service, or if the files are too large or in an unsuitable format for this purpose, on CD or DVD. Such material cannot solely be hosted on an author's personal or institutional web site. After publication, readers who encounter a persistent refusal by the authors to comply with these guidelines should contact the chief editor of the Nature journal concerned. In cases where editors are unable to resolve a complaint, the journal reserves the right to refer the correspondence to the author's funding institution and/or to publish a statement of formal correction, linked to the publication, that readers have been unable to obtain necessary materials or reagents to replicate the findings. <b>Pre-submission</b> discussion. Nature journals do not wish to hinder communication and discussion of data between scientists. Our guidelines for authors and potential authors in such circumstances are clear-cut in principle: communicate with other researchers as much as you wish, whether on a recognised community preprint server, by distribution of preprints, by discussion at scientific meetings, or online via a wiki or other collaborative website, but do not discuss preprints or submitted manuscripts with the media. This policy embodies a long-term view: that publication in a peer-reviewed journal is the appropriate culmination of any piece of original research, and an essential prerequisite for public discussion...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{the settings}} {{of drug use}} influence the affective and neurobiological response to heroin versus cocaine in addicts. Chapter 1 reviews the neuropharmacology of heroin and cocaine and the theoretical background for drugs-settings interactions, including a detailed discussion of findings from previous studies in animals and humans that show how the same settings can influence in opposite directions the reinforcing effect of heroin and cocaine. Cocaine self-administration, for example, was greatly facilitated when rats were tested outside the home environment relative to rats test at home. The opposite pattern was found for heroin. Translational studies in humans yielded similar results. Indeed, heroin and cocaine co-abusers reported using the two drugs in distinct settings: heroin preferentially at home and cocaine preferentially outside the home. The aim of this dissertation is {{to determine whether the}} setting could also influence in opposite manner the affective and neurobiological response to heroin and cocaine in human addicts. Chapter 2 illustrates the findings of a study aimed at testing the hypothesis that the affective state experienced under cocaine or heroin is the result of an interaction between central and peripheral drug effects and the surroundings of drug use. According to this hypothesis, when cocaine is taken at home there is a mismatch between the familiar environment and the peripheral effects such as arousal, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and increased muscular tension (which are usually produced in stressful situations). This mismatch dampens cocaine-rewarding effects. A mismatch would also occurs when heroin (which produces sedation and decreases heart rate, respiratory rate, and muscular tension) is used outside the home in contexts requiring vigilance. We found indeed that co-abusers subjectively experienced opposite changes in arousal, heart rate, respiratory rate, and muscular tension in response to cocaine (increase) versus heroin (decrease). Most important, using a novel two-dimensional visual test, we found that in agreement with the working hypothesis the valence of the affective state produced by heroin and cocaine shifted in opposite directions {{as a function of the}} setting of drug use: heroin was reported to be more pleasant at home than outside the home, and vice versa for cocaine. Chapter 3 illustrates the results of in which emotional imagery was combined with fMRI to investigation the neurobiological underpinnings of drug and setting interactions in addicts. Heroin and cocaine co-abusers were asked to recreate real-world settings of drug use during fMRI. In agreement with the working hypothesis, we found that heroin and cocaine imagery produced opposite changes in BOLD in the prefrontal cortex and in the striatum, regions implicated in brain reward in humans. Furthermore the same pattern of dissociation was observed in the cerebellum, suggesting that that a fronto-triatal-cerebellar network is implicated in processing drug-setting interactions. Chapter 4 includes a summary of the results, a general discussion, and suggestions for future research and implication. The major finding is that the environment surrounding drug use can influence in opposite manner the affective and neurobiological response to heroin and cocaine, suggesting that therapeutic approaches to the treatment of drug addiction should take into account the distinctive effects of different classes of drugs as well as the contexts of drug use. The Appendix includes reprints of two papers reporting on additional studies conducted during the course of the Ph. D. program, which are not directly germane to the aims of the dissertation. Other three papers are in the <b>pre-submission</b> stage...|$|E
