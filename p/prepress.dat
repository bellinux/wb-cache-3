30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the deformation behavior of bamboo bundle laminated veneer lumber (BLVL) manufactured with veneer preprocessing densification technology under low velocity impact loading. The influence of different preprocessing temperatures, times, and stacking sequences was studied with respect to impact loading. Laminates with bamboo bundles parallel to the length direction were labeled as type I, and cross-ply was labeled as type II. The results indicated that delamination and fiber breakage were the main damage models for BLVL made with veneer preprocessing densification technology, and its impact performance under a veneer <b>prepressing</b> temperature of 90  °C and a time of 10  min was fairly comparable to that of BLVL without preprocessing densification. The impact index decreased as the densification temperature increased. The impact properties for type II were better than that of type I. The curve characteristic of impact deflection vs. time presented a linear trend, while the curve of impact velocity first decreased and then tended to level off as time elapsed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractComposite slab {{consists}} of the layer of concrete above the trapezoidal sheeting.

The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L'Équipe (formerly L'Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.|$|E

The moisture and temperature of veneers and pressed plywood sheets rank among the most important parameters affecting shape stability. The size of the camber of pressed plywood sheets was also determined. Results showed that the warping of plywood sheets resulted particularly from the area distribution and variation of the moisture of veneers and plywoods, which was also related to temperature. These values of moisture and temperature result, e. g., from the relative air humidity and temperature, pressing parameters but also storing in stacks and appropriate storage.

40|$|Experimental data on {{the rate}} of {{extraction}} of oil from rapeseed were collected on a bench scale batch extractor, using commercial hexane (Skelly F) as a solvent. The experimental data were then used to fit a two stage washing/diffusion mathematical model. The effects of variables such as particle thickness, extraction temperature, cooking, degree of agitation, change of total mass of seed and solvent, as well as, the seed to solvent ratio, on the rate of extraction were studied. The reason for examining so many variables in this project was {{to make certain that}} in general the mathematical model would be applicable to any operating condition of the extraction process, without any restrictions. The extraction process was found, indeed, to be the summation of two processes involving a washing and a diffusion process. The washing process was very rapid and took place in the early stage of the extraction in which the oil was removed {{from the surface of the}} crushed seeds. The diffusion process, however, was slow, took place in the latter stage of the extraction, and two mechanisms appeared to be involved; one slow and one very slow. The slow mechanism was responsible for the removal of a portion of oil which was held in the partially broken cells, whereas, the very slow mechanism was responsible for the removal of a portion of oil within the unruptured cells. Kinetic coefficients of both (cooked and uncooked) <b>prepressed</b> and flaked seed were obtained for the model and ranged from 0. 79 to 9. 35 min⁻¹ for the washing stage, 0. 056 to 0. 38 min⁻¹ for the unhindered diffusion stage, and 0. 0015 to 0. 01 6 min⁻¹ for the hindered diffusion stage over the following range of conditions: particle size from 0. 76 mm to 0. 06 mm, solvent to seed ratio 0 of 4, agitation speed of 170 rpm and at the temperature of 40 °C. A reduction in particle thickness, an increase in temperature of extraction and heat treatment of the seed prior to extraction increased the rate of extraction. The rate of extraction also increased as a result of increasing the agitation speed of the stirrer and increasing the seed to solvent ratio. Also, the rate of extraction increased as the total mass of seed and solvent increased...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most important and urgent tasks in mechanical engineering development - the creation of low-density and environmentally-friendly thermoinsulation from available cheap basalt fibers for products to operate at temperatures up to 700 °C. One of the most effective applications of such thermo-insulation is to develop and provide highly porous coatings from short basalt fibers by liquid filtration for tubing (T) to supply superheated up to 420 ° C steam under pressure of 35 MPa in the deep layers with severe highviscosity oil. Tubing with the short low-density basalt insulation can be used for a greater depth than the vacuum-insulated tubing, which are also called "thermo-cases", and do not fully meet business needs for long-term reliability of oil vacuum tubes, too large mass per unit length of their design and, as a consequence, the impossibility to use such pipes for deep wells. The aim of the work is to simulate a liquid filtration process of short fibers and determine technological parameters of producing thermal insulation coatings of tubing pipes from basalt fibers and mineral binder shaped as cylinders and cylindrical shells. The paper proposes a mathematical model of free filtration deposition of short fibers from liquid slurry, which describes dynamics of creating thermal insulation products and allows us to determine the rational parameters of their manufacturing process. It shows methods to improve the products quality while forming the thermal insulation by filtration through additional vacuum deposition of a filtrate chamber and the final <b>prepressing</b> of sediment layer, giving dimensions and shape to the final product. The paper defines a prescription hydro mass composition. It shows that to increase the compressive strength of highly fibrous rings and cylindrical shells it is necessary to use based on oxide А 12 O 3 5 - 7 % by weight mineral binder, which fixes basalt fibers in places of their contacts. It is proved that in order to reduce a manufacturing time of long-length cylindrical shells from short basalt fibers by liquid filtration it is necessary to use the scheme of their molding from a plane of the cylinder element. Taking into account the thermal characteristics of basalt fibers and highly porous structure of the thermal insulation on the received samples are determined the real porosity, density of material and the thickness of the tubing pipe coatings. </p...|$|R

30|$|Laboratory {{experiment}} ideally, is {{the main}} method to obtain PVT properties of {{the oil and gas}} reservoir fluids. The alternative two methods widely used when laboratory experiments are not available are: equation of state (EOS) and empirical PVT correlations. The EOS requires lots of numerical computations based on identifying the full compositions of the reservoir fluids properties. The measurement and calculation of these properties are very expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, using of PVT correlations which are based on easily measured field data such as reservoir pressure and temperature, and gas and oil density is reliable and more economic. In this work, three artificial intelligence (AI) technique models were developed to predict the oil–gas ratio (Rv) for volatile oil and gas condensate reservoirs. Thirteen actual reservoir fluid samples (five volatile oils and eight gas condensates) covering a wide range of fluid behavior and characteristics were used. Whitson and Torp three parameters EOS were used to generate modified black oil (MBO) PVT properties that were used as a data set for model development. The MBO PVT data points were extracted for each sample using commercial PVT software at five different separator conditions. The nature of the input data was studied showing that data type is clustered. In addition, the correlations between the input parameters were checked. This preprocessed is helpful in selecting the best method to deal with the input parameters that will be fed to the developed models. According to this analysis and since the input parameters have different ranges, normalization of these parameters is vital to improve the accuracy of the models and to get the solution quickly and efficiently. Results showed that taking the log for the input parameters is the best among the other normalization techniques. The AI techniques that have been implemented in this research are; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, Functional Networks (FNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Models developed based on these techniques used 17, 941 data points and a ratio of 70 % for training, 15 % for validation, and 15 % for testing. To develop these models, three Matlab codes were written for each tool where the provided input data in excel format were read and <b>prepressed</b> before implementation. Results obtained using these techniques showed that the ANN model predicted Rv with an average square correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and an average relative error of 0.15 % while FNs predicted Rv with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9635 and an average relative error of 27.6 %. It was noted that SVMs gave the best results with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9990 and an average relative error of 0.12 %. The results concluded that ANN and SVM accurately predicted such data since this type of data are clustered and these two models can handle this kind of data. The newly developed models depend only on easily obtainable parameters in the field and can have varied applications when typical lab PVT reports are not available.|$|R

40|$|Opisthorchiasis {{is a form}} of {{foodborne}} trematodiasis which is caused by liver flukes. It has been shown that a chronic Opisthorchiasis infection increases a risk of cholagiocarcinoma of liver. It is commonly believed that a gradual change of homeostasis in a parasite microenvironment (bile) leads to liver fluke-induced cancer. Nevertheless, no systematic, analytically driven studies confirming this hypothesis have been published yet. The restricted access to clinical material and extreme complexity of the biological matrix (bile) both are the important “rate limiting factors” for a progress in the field. Here we present {{for the first time a}} cross-platform mass spectrometric analysis of bile juice collected from the patients with cholangiocarcinoma-associated diseases. We show that an effective analysis of such complex biological matrix as bile juice requires a combination of orthogonal analytical platforms (e. g. RPLC–MS and HILIC–MS) maximizing coverage of the metabolic space. Materials and methods: 28 patients with O. felineus infection and 30 negative controls were included in the study. The infection status was confirmed using microscopy analysis of the bile. Bile samples were collected from the gallbladder using sterile puncture, directly frozen and stored at − 80  °C until analysis. The samples were randomized and organized into the acquisition blocks consisting of the samples and quality controls (QC). Experiments were carried out with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 LC system (Thermo Scientific/Dionex, The Netherlands) equipped with a Dual Gradient Separation pump allowing for parallel LC analysis, and hyphenated to an Impact UHR-qTOF mass analyzer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Reversed-phase experiments (RPLC) were performed with an UHPLC BEH Shield RP 18 column 100  ×  2. 1  mm, 1. 7  μm (Waters) and HILIC experiments with a Luna HILIC column (Phenomenex, The Netherlands) of 100  ×  2. 00  mm, 3  μ m. RPLC data were acquired in ESI positive mode and HILIC in negative mode, respectively. The data acquisition rate was set to 1  Hz over a mass range of m/z 50 – 1000. The LC–MS data files were aligned by using the in-house developed alignment algorithm MS-Align 2 tool (www. ms-utils. org/msalign 2). Results: After the data <b>prepressing,</b> which includes alignment, noise filtering and peak picking two data matrixes costing of 412 features (metabolites) for RPLC and 428 ones for HILIC were generated. To evaluate a degree of similarity between the two data matrixes the RV coefficient (a multivariate extension of correlation coefficient) was used. The coefficient has flattened at 0. 58 showing that despite a strong overlap between the datasets there is a substantial number of the “platform specific” metabolites. Those structures will certainly be missed if a single platform strategy is applied. Conclusion: Here we present for the first time a cross-platform mass spectrometric analysis of bile juice collected from the patients cholangiocarcinoma-associated diseases. We show that a combination of the two platforms greatly improves the coverage of the metabolome and as such should be a firstchoice for exploratory studies of the complex biological matrixes.
