5|$|In {{the most}} complex <b>placer</b> <b>mining,</b> groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces (370t) of gold were removed {{in the first five}} years of the Gold Rush (worth over US$16billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for <b>placer</b> <b>mining</b> have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. <b>Placer</b> <b>mining</b> in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge <b>placer</b> <b>mining</b> and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E
5|$|In Alder, MT 287 {{leaves the}} valley of the Ruby River and heads east through Alder Gulch, a narrow valley along which the highway ascends the more {{moderate}} mountains between the Tobacco Root Mountains to the north and the Gravelly Range to the south. The length of the valley is filled with tailings, or small hills of mining waste left behind by gold dredge <b>placer</b> <b>mining</b> over decades of mining. The highway passes through the village of Nevada City, the site of the Finney House and the Dr. Don L. Byam House. MT 287 follows the Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad, an isolated narrow-gauge railway, until the route reaches Virginia City. The highway enters the town on Nevada Street but mainly follows Wallace Street through the Virginia City Historic District, a National Historic Landmark preserving buildings of Montana's second territorial capital. MT 287 leaves Virginia City and ascends to its highest point along Daylight Creek. The highway descends into {{the valley of}} the Madison River along Eightmile Creek. MT 287 meets the northern end of S-249 (Varney Road) where the highway curves north on arriving at the Madison River. The highway enters the town of Ennis along Bauer Lane and curves east onto West Main Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 287, which heads north and east along Main Street.|$|E
25|$|<b>Placer</b> <b>mining</b> {{continued}} {{on a small}} scale in the Omineca for many years and then, in the 1890s large companies from Victoria and Ottawa came to the district and began hydraulic mining which continued well into the 1900s.

25|$|Miners {{working in}} the {{industrial}} enterprise of underground metal mining often came from non-industrial backgrounds. <b>Placer</b> <b>mining</b> was gradually replaced by lode mining from 1860 to 1910, forcing miners to go deeper underground and resulting in an increasing level of industrialization. Tensions resulted from changing demands for job skills and work discipline.|$|E
25|$|Yukon has {{abundant}} {{mineral resources}} and mining was {{the mainstay of}} the economy until recently.

25|$|Because {{the gold}} in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams. However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners {{graduated}} to more complex <b>placer</b> <b>mining.</b> Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.|$|E
25|$|After the sluice-box stage, <b>placer</b> <b>mining</b> {{may become}} {{increasingly}} large scale, requiring larger organisations and higher capital expenditures. Small claims owned and mined by individuals {{may need to}} be merged into larger tracts. Difficult-to-reach placer deposits may be mined by tunnels. Water may be diverted by dams and canals to placer mine active river beds or to deliver water needed to wash dry placers. The more advanced techniques of ground sluicing, hydraulic mining and dredging may be used.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{machinery}} {{is used in}} mining {{to explore}} and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed. Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land. In the case of <b>placer</b> <b>mining,</b> unconsolidated gravel, or alluvium, is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or trommel which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel. The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs.|$|E

25|$|The first donkeys {{came to the}} Americas {{on ships}} of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus, and were landed at Hispaniola in 1495. The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by Juan de Zumárraga, the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach {{what is now the}} United States may have crossed the Rio Grande with Juan de Oñate in April 1598. From that time on they spread northward, finding use in {{missions}} and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679. By the Gold Rush years of the 19th century, the burro was the beast of burden of choice of early prospectors in the western United States. With the end of the <b>placer</b> <b>mining</b> boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a feral population established itself.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the gold}} rush {{attracted}} {{tens of thousands of}} newcomers to the San Joaquin River area, deposits of the precious mineral petered out within a few years, especially on {{the upper reaches of the}} San Joaquin and its tributaries which were only suitable for <b>placer</b> <b>mining.</b> Many of these people settled in the San Joaquin Valley, most in the existing towns such as Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield but some establishing new settlements. These included San Joaquin City, near the confluence of the San Joaquin with the Stanislaus, probably the largest of these post-gold-rush boomtowns. Established in 1851, the town maintained considerable size until 1880, when trade competition from nearby Stockton caused it to diminish. Another notable but much smaller settlement was Las Juntas, near present-day Mendota. This was a haven for criminals and fugitives, and was frequented by the infamous bandits Joaquín Murrieta and Tiburcio Vásquez.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{the heyday}} of a placer gold rush would last only a few years. The free gold supply in stream beds would become {{depleted}} somewhat quickly, and the initial phase would be followed by prospecting for veins of lode gold that were the original source of the placer gold. Hard rock mining, like <b>placer</b> <b>mining,</b> may evolve from low capital investment and simple technology to progressively higher capital and technology. The surface outcrop of a gold-bearing vein may be oxidized, so that the gold occurs as native gold, and the ore needs only to be crushed and washed (free milling ore). The first miners may at first build a simple arrastra to crush their ore; later, they may build stamp mills to crush ore more quickly. As the miners dig down, they may find that the deeper part of vein contains gold locked in sulfide or telluride minerals, which will require smelting. If the ore is still sufficiently rich, it may be worth shipping to a distant smelter (direct shipping ore). Lower-grade ore may require on-site treatment to either recover the gold or to produce a concentrate sufficiently rich for transport to the smelter. As the district turns to lower-grade ore, the mining may change from underground mining to large open-pit mining.|$|E
