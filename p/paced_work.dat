However, studies {{on the effectiveness of}} tutor software have been conducted mainly in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, and little is known about how these systems might be used in other contexts with differing classroom practices and values. To understand this question, we studied the usage of mathemat-ics tutoring software for middle school at sites in three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica. While cognitive tutors were designed for individual use, we found that students in these classrooms worked collaboratively, engaging in interdependently <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> and conducting work away from their own computer.

40|$|Associations {{of psychosocial}} factors with {{interpersonal}} conflicts at work were studied {{in a sample}} drawn from the Finnish population using a mailed questionnaire. The sample consisted of 14, 578 employees aged 24 - 64 years. The frequency of interpersonal conflicts at work was equal among both sexes. Our results suggest that occupational factors such as hectically <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> monotonous work and white collar status are associated with interpersonal conflicts at work; and more conflicts {{are found in the}} younger age-groups. In the multivariate analyses, dissatisfaction with life, daily stress, neuroticism and hostility were found to be the significant risk factors for interpersonal conflicts at work for both sexes, whereas a higher educational level was a considerable risk factor only for men, and low self-assurance only for women. Among men the combination of hectically paced and monotonous work was also found to be a significant risk factor. The results indicate complexity of the concept of human relationships at work, and the importance of both occupational factors and psychological characteristics. conflict stress work personality...|$|E

40|$|Background: Approximately 30 % of Sri Lankans {{work in the}} {{agricultural}} industry, with the third largest agricultural product being rubber. Rubber tapping involves repetitive and high <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> static muscle loading, non-neutral body postures, and forceful physical exertion, all potential risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on two plantations near Galle, Sri Lanka to study the risk factors of MSDs and injuries in rubber tappers. Questionnaires were administered to 300 rubber tappers, and an ergonomic analysis using Quick Exposure Check was performed on 90 tappers. Univariate and multivariate analysis {{were used to determine}} risk factors for MSDs and injuries. Results: 66 % of rubber tappers reported experiencing an MSD in the past 12 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that many demographic, work condition, personal and psychosocial factors were associated with MSDs. A total of 594 injuries were experienced in the last 12 months, resulting in tappers missing 1080 days of work. Factors associated with injuries were working an additional job and depression. Conclusions: MSDs and injuries are common among rubber tappers in Sri Lanka. Numerous factors contribute to the high prevalence. These results suggest a need for injury monitoring on plantations. Furthermore, work process modifications should be used to help reduce the number of MSDs and injuries. Thesi...|$|E

Survey was done in a sample consisted of 23 establishments, 630 workers, and 47 supervisors, meanwhile 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) for workers, and 5 FGDs for supervisors. Workers and supervisors alike reported illnesses and job dissatisfaction. Survey showed that the most prevalent issues among workers were: the need to upgrade skills (76. 3 %), pressured in doing work (60. 5 %), fast <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> (60. 5 %), repetitive work (63 %), and that work is both physically and mentally tiring (59. 7 %). On the other hand, supervisors described their work as challenging and stimulating (66 %), needed regular upgrading of skills (46. 8 %), and needed literacy on information technology (31. 9 %). Focus group discussions showed that workers and supervisors were confronted with stress, fast-paced work, the need to upgrade skills due to accommodation of information technology into the work production, fatigue, re-engineering and downsizing by management, low job control and difficult worker-supervisor relationship. This study was able to show that health of workers and supervisors were affected by both organizational and management factors at work...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that variations in assembly jobs increase workers’ exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|Traditional machine-paced work shows {{adverse effects}} on worker health and learning. It is hardly known whether {{technological}} pacing shows the same effects in computer work. Hypotheses on work stress and learning were formulated regarding the effects of technological pacing, {{in the context of}} computer work performed during {{at least half of the}} working day, especially. Further, method–order (m–o) autonomy was conceived as another control and standardisation mechanism and taken into account as a potentially important modifier of the effects. As hypothesised, this study's secondary analyses of a European survey of 18, 723 employees revealed that the level of adverse work stress for technological pacing among computer workers was almost equal to the level found for ‘traditionally machine-paced’ workers. Distinct interactions with m–o autonomy were also shown. For instance, lack hereof was especially problematic for work stress among technologically paced computer workers. Software's flexible nature and its relatively easy adaptability to chosen work organisation modes may explain this. Lastly, in technologically <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> m–o autonomy appeared to reinforce learning. In sum, many hypotheses were supported especially on the main and interaction effects regarding work stress, but less so regarding learning.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the quantitative impact of working conditions on cardiovascular diseases in Denmark. DESIGN [...] The study {{was based on a}} review of recent epidemiological research publications in which relative risks were estimated and risk factor prevalences were determined. The impact of working conditions was quantified by means of aetiological fractions. SETTING [...] The aetiological fractions were estimated on the Danish population. MAIN RESULTS [...] 16 % of the premature cardiovascular mortality in men and 22 % in occupationally active women is avoidable through interventions in the work environment. If "sedentary" work is included in the occupational risk factors, the aetiological fractions reach 51 % for men and 55 % for women. Taken separately, the major aetiological fractions for cardiovascular risk factors at work are respectively (women in parentheses) 6 % (14 %) for monotonous high <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> 7 % (7 %) for shift work, and 2 % (2 %) for passive smoking.

40|$|Abstract: Knowledge {{sharing in}} an {{organization}} {{is an important part}} of knowledge management and its success or failure will be directly related to how much knowledge could be used by employees. Unfortunately there are some de-motivators in work environment that prevent employees to share knowledge with each others. This paper intends to interrogate employee monitoring as one of the de-motivators of knowledge sharing in organizations. In an insecure work environment where employee behaviors are monitored employees may not intend to share their knowledge with others because of confidentiality, job insecurity, mistrust. Therefore, the aim of this research is to examine the relationship between organizational knowledge sharing and employee monitoring. Employees who have negative attitude against employee monitoring complained that the implementation of electronic monitoring in their workplace caused <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> lack of involvement, reduced task variety and clarity, reduced peer social support, reduced supervisory support, fear of job loss, routinized work activity, and lack of control over tasks. It is assumed that there is a relationship between negative attitudes against employee monitoring and knowledge sharing in organizations.

40|$|This is an {{investigation}} on {{the interaction between}} the subjective and objective occupational conditions in affecting the overall health of women workers in industries that have accommodated information technology. The sample consisted of 23 establishments and 630 women respondents. Results show that the most prevalent issues among workers in the electronics industry included the need to upgrade skills, repetitive and fast <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> pressure at work, and work that entailed both physically and mentally demanding tasks. It was found that the overall good physical health of the workers was affected by these factors: overtime, mental work, close monitoring, medium industries, poor quality of work, and hazardous work (P. = 0. 05). Meanwhile, heavy physical workload, awkward positions, long hours of standing, tasks that produce pressure, pressure at work, limited rest breaks and low participation in benchmarking were variables found to be associated with body pains (P. = 0. 05). On the other hand, workers in the electronics industry with poor quality of work and exposure to hazards faced a higher risk of deafness. The same risk was also present among those that do have health and safety policies, and fair regular benefits (P. = 0. 05). The study has shown that work in the 21 st century in spite of being Information-Technology (IT) intensive is still beset with work and health issues.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{temporary}} work (TW) {{has increased in}} European countries due to the greater uncertainty in the economy. AIMS: To compare the prevalence of non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms of the upper extremities (UEMSDs) and their main risk factors in blue-collar workers employed through temporary agencies (TW) and in those in permanent employment (PE). METHODS: UEMSDs occurring during the preceding 7 days were assessed using a Nordic questionnaire completed by 1493 blue-collar workers randomly included in a surveillance programme for UEMSDs (171 in TW and 1322 in PE) in a large French region. Personal factors and work-related risk factors for UEMSDs were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. RESULTS: The prevalence of UEMSDs during the preceding 7 days did not significantly differ between workers in TW or PE. However, after adjustment for age and gender, TW had {{a higher risk of}} symptoms of the wrist/hand region (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 2. 6). TW was characterized by higher exposure to <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 0), repetitive work (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 3. 4), awkward postures of the wrist (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 4) and intensive use of vibrating hand tools (OR = 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 3). Workers in TW suffered from a lack of autonomy (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 6) and skill discretion at work (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 1) more frequently, but {{there was no difference in}} relation to psychological demands of the task or social support. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary workers were more frequently exposed to working time constraints, repetitive work and biomechanical constraints of the wrist/hand region when compared to permanent workers and may represent a subpopulation at particularly high risk of UEMSDs...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a major}} health problem among workers. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the risk factors for CTS in workers of a large French working population. Methods: A total of 3, 710 workers representative of a French region’s working population were randomly included in the study between 2002 and 2005. A total of 134 cases of CTS were diagnosed by 83 trained occupational physicians performing a standardized physical examination that strictly applied the methodology and clinical tests of the ‘Criteria document for evaluation of the work-relatedness of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders’ (2001). Individual factors and work exposure were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical associations between CTS and individual and work-related factors were analyzed using logistic regression modeling.   Results: The personal risk factors for CTS were age (Odd Ratios (OR) up to 3. 5 [95 % CI 2. 2 - 3. 1] after 50 years), female gender (OR= 2. 2 [1. 5 - 3. 2]) and obesity (OR= 1. 9 [1. 1 - 3. 2]). The work-related risk factors were the high repetitiveness of the task (≥ 4 h/day) without recovery period (OR= 1. 7 [1. 0 - 3. 0]), use of vibrating hand tools (≥ 4 h/day) (OR= 1. 8 [1. 1 - 2. 9]), sustained or repeated wrist deviation (≥ 2 h/day) combined with high perceived physical demand (OR= 1. 8 [1. 1 - 2. 9]), high psychological demand of the task (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 – 2. 1]) and low social support from colleagues (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 – 2. 3]). Three factors related to the work organization were associated with CTS: <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> dependant on quantified targets (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 3]), frequent changes of job/task during the week (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 8]) and work with colleagues in flexible employment (OR= 1. 6 [1. 1 - 2. 3]). Discussion: Personal and work-related physical, psychosocial and organizational factors were associated with CTS.

Methods: UEMSDs occurring during the preceding 12 months or the preceding 7 days were assessed using the ‘Nordic’ questionnaire in 1, 493 blue collar workers included in a surveillance program for MSDs (171 in TW and 1, 322 in PE). Personal factors and work-related risk factors for UEMSDs were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Exposure to work constraints of blue collar workers in TW and in PE was compared using logistic regression models adjusted for age and gender. Results: The prevalence rates of UEMSDs during the preceding 12 months or preceding 7 days did not significantly differ between workers in TW and PE, except for a higher prevalence in the hand-wrist region during the preceding 7 days after adjustment for age and gender (19. 9 % [95 % CI 13. 9 - 25. 9] vs. 14. 9 % [13. 0 - 16. 9], P < 0. 05). TW was characterized by higher exposure to <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> (Odds ratio (OR) = 2. 1 [95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 0]) and time constraints dependent on an automatic rate, permanent control or colleagues’ work, and to repetitive movements (OR= 2. 3 [1. 6 - 3. 3]), awkward postures of the wrist (OR= 1. 6 [1. 2 - 2. 4]) and intensive use of vibrating handtools (OR= 1. 6 [1. 1 - 2. 3]).

40|$|Our hectic {{world is}} one filled with {{constant}} change through motion: {{the movement of}} ideas, political thought, money, people, and cargo all coming together to create an economy of global scale and activity. Transportation is the connection between both these intangible notions and physical bodies. It is through the evolution {{of one of the}} fastest growing and most influential transportation industries that we have conquered an international shipping exchange. International trade has dominated as a leader of world economics through the traffic in ports, its ancillary coastal regulations, management of the navigable waterways, and a revolution in containerization. This ‘industry on the sea’ transports billions of dollars worth of goods across rivers and oceans each year. Ports stand as a connecting facility to process this cargo to its final destination. Ports symbolize much more than a coastal processing complex. Above and beyond functional satisfaction, these seacoast landmarks represent business, international relations, a welcoming committee, a center for trade, a fast <b>paced</b> <b>work</b> environment of deadlines and scheduling, and the most expensive, technologically advanced marinas on our coastlines. This study focuses on the value of ports from a practical and business approach, detailing the importance of operational offloading, the container transformation of the shipping industry during the 1960 s and its direct relationship to employment, scheduling, overhead, and ship movement, and the technological innovations in port machinery. The overall impact of ports on the environment and governmental interest has also led to multiple Acts, government funding, and country wide initiatives to balance the delicate scale of environmental protection and economic trade. Strict Coastal Zone Management regulations, environmental directives, and efforts to appease the local aesthetic and ecological desires further tip that fragile scale. Recent national and international issues have also substantially impacted the shipping industry and add an interesting segment to my analysis. Hurricane Katrina, forming August 23, 2005, caused havoc in the southern U. S. states, particularly affecting the New Orleans coastal region and one of the largest port centers on the Atlantic coast. Current political controversy between the United States and Dubai has also left many intrigued on our fragile international relations. This study is dedicated to a deeper understanding of ports and their role in our global economy, also focusing on factors contributing to the unprecedented growth. The initiatives taken on behalf of local and federally involved leaders of the shipping world to understand and develop ports as an imperative part of global business truly demonstrate the dependency we have on ports to sustain our trade relationships...|$|E

40|$|Musculo-Skeletal Disorders (MSDs) of {{back pain}} and upper limbs {{are the most}} common {{occupational}} injury group in Ireland (HSA, 2007). Across Europe upper limb related MSDs account for over 45 % {{of the total number of}} reported cases of occupational ill health and injuries (EUROSTAT, 2004). MSD risk factors include poor posture, repetitive or forceful movements, fast <b>paced</b> <b>work,</b> vibration and poor ergonomic conditions, and affect muscles, tendons, ligaments and blood circulation. High task repetition can lead to residual fatigue, which over time can result in damage to tissues. But the role of repetition can often be overly simplified in job evaluation and in the study of its relationship with occupational MSDs. This thesis focuses on the role of dynamic loading of the upper limb (with emphasis on the shoulder) as part of a broader interpretation of repetition as a risk factor for upper limb MSDs. Two case studies and five laboratory experiments were conducted. The case studies demonstrated high levels of muscle activity and movement variability. This thesis proposes that dynamic loading of the upper limb is multifactorial comprising cycle time, movement frequency, muscle activity variability, work/rest regime and posture variability. Quantitative testing (using electromyography and electrogoniometers) as well as qualitative testing (discomfort) methods was used to study musculoskeletal strain. The laboratory experiments tested combinations of these factors at various levels to test for main effects. Taguchi methods were used to model the effects of physical factors on the perception of discomfort in the shoulder region. The studies for the distal part of the upper limb revealed that high movement frequency within the shoulder’s safe range of motion (0 - 40 ° flexion, 0 - 30 °) abduction did not increase the average electrical activity of the forearm muscles above the level of 50 %MVE, even for the heaviest tasks of load lifting. This suggests that the shoulder muscles may not be affected by heavy loading in the hands as anticipated. Results from collective study of shoulder movement frequencies, work/rest regimes, postures and loads using a Taguchi experiment design and regression analyses were used to test and model shoulder discomfort effects. The findings of low levels of EMG fatigue recorded across many of the experimental conditions indicate that for the Upper Trapezius high movement frequency dynamic contractions may affect the rate of the Motor Unit (MU) recruitment in order to protect the muscle from overloading, at least in short duration treatments. There is a need to further investigate the effects of interactions of repetition with other factors on MU recruitment patterns in the muscles of the upper limb...|$|E
