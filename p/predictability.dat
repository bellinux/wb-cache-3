5|$|The 1910 visitation is also {{recorded}} {{as being the}} travelling companion of the first known English Muslim to make the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. However, his explanation of its scientific <b>predictability</b> did not meet with favour in the Holy City.|$|E
5|$|Wind power {{forecasting}} {{methods are}} used, but <b>predictability</b> {{of any particular}} wind farm is low for short-term operation. For any particular generator there is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% {{in an hour and}} a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.|$|E
5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased <b>predictability</b> can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into <b>predictability.</b> In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended to blend the <b>predictability</b> of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle {{was going to be}} especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E
5|$|The Australian pelican has two {{reproductive}} strategies {{depending on}} the local degree of environmental <b>predictability.</b> Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.|$|E
5|$|The Shafi'i {{school of}} thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, {{considered}} it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the <b>predictability</b> and uniformity of a sound legal system.|$|E
5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in two months {{and based on the}} events {{surrounding}} the Communist Party and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes– the victimisation of Communist Party members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its subject matter and criticised it for its <b>predictability.</b> It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the <b>predictability</b> of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E
5|$|There were {{tactical}} deficiencies as well, {{particularly the}} <b>predictability</b> of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians {{to take full}} toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained. Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After {{the failure of the}} final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians {{might have been able to}} bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.|$|E

25|$|Because the h-index {{was never}} meant to measure future {{publication}} success, recently, a group of researchers has investigated the features that are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its <b>predictability.</b> Thus, the true <b>predictability</b> of future h-index is much lower compared to what has been claimed before.|$|E

25|$|Amid {{the social}} and {{economic}} turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, <b>predictability,</b> and pride. He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory in World War II, and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} {{may not always}} be successful; the player may intentionally switch from his favoured spot after witnessing the goalkeeper obtaining knowledge of his kicks. Most times, especially in amateur football, the goalkeeper is often forced to guess. Game theoretic research shows that strikers and goalies must randomize their strategies in precise ways to avoid having the opponent take advantage of their <b>predictability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Likewise, for {{litigation}} {{of commercial}} disputes {{arising out of}} unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the <b>predictability</b> afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, London is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of admiralty cases.|$|E
25|$|Numerical Weather Prediction is a {{main focus}} in {{understanding}} air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric <b>predictability,</b> and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models {{are run by}} national meteorological agencies.|$|E
25|$|Retreat mining is {{a method}} in which the pillars or coal ribs used {{to hold up the}} mine roof are extracted; {{allowing}} the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This {{is one of the most}} dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect <b>predictability</b> of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.|$|E
25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for <b>predictability</b> and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and <b>predictability</b> in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
25|$|As {{the table}} above indicates, {{there is a}} certain degree of <b>predictability</b> of the plural form based on the gender and the number of syllables in a word. However, even among regular nouns, the choice between -er and -e for common gender nouns is not {{predictable}} in monosyllables and one can only generalize that borrowings tend to take -er. Furthermore, there are many irregular nouns, as exemplified below.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the judge}} is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases, making <b>predictability</b> of legal interpretation difficult. The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges (qadi) and lawyers form part of the ulema, the country's Islamic scholars.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principles}} of Chinese legislative drafting include generality and flexibility. Sometimes excessive generality and omissions in Chinese law, coupled with the wide discretionary powers conferred on local authorities to implement laws, undermines the <b>predictability</b> and certainty of law. Furthermore, as Chinese law {{is intended to be}} educative, the language of the law is that of the ordinary language comprehensible to the average citizen, although many laws are drafted in broad and indeterminate language.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{article from}} {{researchers}} of ReRAM concluded that Strukov's (HP's) initial/basic memristor modelling equations {{do not reflect}} the actual device physics well, whereas subsequent (physics-based) models such as Pickett's model or Menzel's ECM model (Menzel is a co-author of that paper) have adequate <b>predictability</b> but are computationally prohibitive. As of 2014, the search continues for a model that balances these issues; the article identifies Chang's and Yakopcic's models as potentially good compromises.|$|E
