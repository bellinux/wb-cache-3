40|$|AbstractThe paper {{analyzes}} publishers’ copyright {{policies and}} self-archiving conditions of Spanish scientific journals. Data are {{extracted from the}} directory DULCINEA that contains information of 1318 Spanish journals, of which 775 (61 %) allow some form of self-archiving to be about 60 % of the post-print version and allowing them 87 % of the deposit of the version of record. In 72 % of journals the deposit can be performed immediately after publication and in 16 % after article acceptance. 72 % of the journals are freely available without charge to the user this figure raises up to 86 % if free access after an embargo is considered. Only 18 % of the journals use Creative Commons licenses. The adoption of different open access journals model in Spain is favorable, however {{there is still a}} high percentage of journals (39 %) that do not provide any information about authors and <b>publishers</b> <b>rights</b> and that difficult or inhibits reuse of published articles...|$|E

Catalogers can build authority records using the Web and all communities (<b>publishers,</b> <b>rights</b> management agencies, archives, museums, and other libraries) can use this information and reduce costs worldwide. Authority control will help users of the Web to benefit from collocation and search precision that authority control enables. And, very importantly, it also means we can do it in ways that are meaningful to users in their preferred language and script. We can open up the valuable information within our authority records to users worldwide and use the authority records as tools to connect, not only to bibliographic data, but to biographical dictionaries, telephone directories, abstracting and indexing services, official Web sites for the entity, and more. The authority records can be a key part, a building block for the infrastructure of the Semantic Web and beyond...|$|E
