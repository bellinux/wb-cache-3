5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how <b>people</b> <b>use</b> language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

50|$|This plant had {{a number}} of {{medicinal}} uses for Native American groups. The Cherokee <b>people</b> <b>used</b> it for nausea. The Choctaw <b>people</b> <b>used</b> it as a remedy for snakebite and gonorrhea, and the Delaware <b>people</b> <b>used</b> it for intestinal worms. Many groups made it into tea to treat gastrointestinal complaints. The Koasati attributed magical powers to the plant.|$|R

5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, <b>people</b> <b>use</b> rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni <b>people</b> <b>use</b> the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 <b>people</b> <b>use</b> the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{host to the}} European {{headquarters}} of IBM and, until 2007, the UK {{headquarters of}} Zurich Financial Services. In the city centre, shopping is centred on Commercial Road and the 1980s Cascades Shopping Centre, with over 100 high street shops between them. Approximately 185,000 to 230,000 <b>people</b> <b>use</b> the Cascades Shopping Centre each week. Recent redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the upmarket Gunwharf Quays—a redevelopment of the HMS Vernon naval shore establishment— containing fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema, and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to the tourist sector and holds an annual Victorian Christmas market. Ocean Retail Park sits on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island and was built on land previously occupied by a Metal Box factory in September 1985.|$|E
5|$|The list {{of names}} {{consists}} of entries from 17 Southeast and East Asian nations and the United States who have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into five lists, and each list is cycled with each year. Unlike tropical cyclones {{in other parts of}} the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, PAGASA retains its own naming list, which does consist of human names. Therefore, a typhoon can possibly have two names. Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon. In Japan, <b>people</b> <b>use</b> the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, <b>people</b> <b>use</b> weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many <b>people</b> <b>use</b> the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

40|$|Teeth loss still {{becomes a}} major problem {{especially}} in developing countries. It can cause disfunction of mastication and Temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Furthermore, missing teeth can influence economic factor {{as well as physical}} and psychological aspect including aesthethic factor. Replacing of teeth loss with artificial denture {{is the only way to}} prevent those factors. A total sample 779. 496 responden age 12 years and above were analysed using data of National Health Research (Riskesdas) 2007. The objective of the study is to determine the index of missing teeth (M-T) and the percentage of <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses. The data is descriptively analysed using the Decayed (D-T), Missing (M-T), FilledfF-T), and Decayed Missing Filled Teeth (DMF-T), and data from Dentogram based on the result of permanent teeth examination; Missing Treatment Index (MTI) and <b>people</b> <b>using</b> fixed and removable prostheses. The result of the study shows that M-T= 3. 9 out of DMF-T= 4. 8 and MTI= 79. 6 %. Moreover, the percentage of <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses is 4. 5 %. M-T, MTI, and <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses increase in aged group of 35 - 44 years old. M-T, MTI, and <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses is higher in women compared to men. In addition, M-T and MTI are higher in rural area compared in urban area. However, the percentage of <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses are higher in urban area than in rural area. According to the level of household expenditure per capita shows that MT and MTI are higher in group of people with low level of household expenditure. In contradictory, the percentage of <b>people</b> <b>using</b> prostheses is higher in those with high level of household expenditure.   Keywords: caries experience, DMF-T, Missing Teeth, Protesa</p...|$|R
