40|$|Generally, voided {{reinforced}} concrete floor slabs in building structures {{have a lower}} shear strength compared with solid slabs owing to the reduction in their cross-sectional area. This study shows that the void shape and material of the void-shaper also influence the shear strength of <b>voided</b> <b>slabs.</b> To verify these assumptions, one-way shear tests were conducted for four test specimens. The first was a conventional solid slab {{and the others were}} <b>voided</b> <b>slabs.</b> The <b>voids</b> had toroidal or ‘doughnut&# 39; shapes as well as non-doughnut shapes. The void-shaper was made of polypropylene plastic and glass-fibre-reinforced plastic.

Considering the aspect of structural performance, <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> systems are vulnerable to shear capacity, when compared to solid slabs (Aldejohann and Schnellenbach-Held 2002; Hegger et al. 2009; Jung et al. 2016; Miwa et al. 1995; Chung et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011). Schnellenbach-Held and Pfeffer (2002) found that while the so-called control perimeter is treated as a shear resistance section in flat slab designs, the shear area within the bubble-containing <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> could be reduced. Chung et al. (2009) indicated that the shapes of the void formers might be crucial factors that determine the capacities of the shear forces in <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> systems. They maintained that donut-shaped void formers could resist approximately 20 % more shear strength over other shapes of void formers. Lee et al. (2011) performed experimental studies to evaluate the punching shear of two-way voided slab-to-column connections with TVS lightweight balls. Along with the shear resistance performance of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> system, various studies have also attempted to evaluate the flexural performance of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab.</b> Many studies have confirmed that the flexural capacities of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> are similar in performance to the solid slab system for equal depth (Chung et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2014). Chung et al. (2013) demonstrated that two-way slab systems with donut type void formers showed similar flexural capacities, when compared with the conventional reinforced concrete slabs.|$|R

Usually, the void has a circular or a rectangular cross section in the slab which is, approximately, 40 cm thick. The floor heights of the <b>void</b> <b>slab</b> buildings are less than those of conventional buildings, because they require no beams. Sometimes, the voids are used as duct spaces.

30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> systems was performed without any floor finishing material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor finishing material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|R

30|$|Multi-unit dwellings, such as {{apartment}} housing, town houses, and flats, {{are some}} of the most common housing types in Korea, as well as in other countries. Such multi-unit dwellings are considered an effective means to overcome the housing problems of high-density population in urban areas, owing to their high efficiency of land utilisation. However, interlayer noise complaints, such as footsteps or dragging items in apartment housing, are an inevitable problem in apartment dwelling conditions, because each household in an apartment shares walls and ceilings with other households.

30|$|A <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> {{system is}} an {{efficient}} construction method {{that reduces the}} concrete dead-load or self-weight, to enable {{an increase in the}} span of a building or structure (Aguado et al. 2016; Aldejohann and Schnellenbach-Held 2002; Brunesi and Nascimbene 2015; Chung et al. 2009; Hwang et al. 2015). It has a number of advantages, such as economic efficiency, usability, and environmental friendliness. On the other hand, it also presents several disadvantages, such as difficulty of construction, decrease in construction quality, and deterioration of economic efficiency when the void part is not properly installed (Chung et al. 2013; Bhagat and Parikh 2014; Lee et al. 2011). In order to overcome such disadvantages of the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> systems, various academics and practitioners have tried to find solutions.|$|R
40|$|Circular voids {{are often}} {{incorporated}} into concrete bridge decks {{to reduce their}} self-weight without greatly reducing the flexural stiffness. Incorporating <b>voids</b> within a <b>slab</b> offers many advantages over a conventional solid concrete slab, for example a lower total cost of construction, reduced material use, and enhanced structural efficiency. The advantages of this topology are obvious, however the <b>voids</b> within the <b>slab</b> complicate {{the analysis of the}} structure. The incorporation of the <b>voids</b> within the <b>slab</b> results in different flexural stiffness in the longitudinal and transverse directions, resulting in an orthotropic slab. Another feature which distinguishes <b>voided</b> <b>slabs</b> from other common bridge types is the deformable nature of their cross-sections, which influences the load distribution of the structure. The need for a method of analysis which accounts for the orthotropic behaviour and deformable nature of the cross-section has been suggested by many in the past. The idealisation of <b>voided</b> <b>slabs</b> as an orthotropic plate {{has been the subject of}} extensive research. When modelling a <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> as an orthotropic plate, it is necessary to calculate the reduction in the longitudinal and transverse stiffness due to the presence of the voids. Several equivalent plate parameters, which take on numerous forms, have been suggested by various authors to account for the effect of the voids. No research has been reported in technical literature to compare these different methods employing orthotropic plate parameters. Key shortcomings to these methods include the lack of definition of the suggested equivalent plate parameters, and the geometrical parameters of <b>voided</b> <b>slabs</b> which influence their behaviour. In an attempt to address these limitations, the aim of this study is to verify and validate the effect of the void diameter ratio and void spacing on the structural behaviour of <b>voided</b> <b>slabs,</b> which are the main influences on the orthotropic behaviour and cross-section deformation. The different methods of analysis using orthotropic plate theory suggested by various authors employing equivalent plate parameters are compared and discussed. The objectives of the study were achieved based on the finite element approach using ABAQUS. Finite element models with a <b>void</b> diameter to <b>slab</b> depth ratio range of 0. 5 to 0. 9, and a void spacing range of 0. 9 m to 2. 7 m were considered and analysed. Comparisons were made of the longitudinal and transverse stress distribution results from these models in order to draw conclusions. Results from solid models using both isotropic and orthotropic materials based on the equivalent plate parameters suggested from literature are also presented for comparison in order to verify the methods suggested by the technical literature for the analysis of <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> bridge decks. Results of the finite element modelling show that the addition of voids causes large variations to the transverse stress distribution from the typical parabolic transverse stress distribution shape, leading to large peak transverse stresses in the flanges above and below the voids. These variations are due to the deformable nature of the cross-section. The voids also lead to a stress raising effect on the longitudinal stresses. It was found that an increase in <b>void</b> diameter to <b>slab</b> thickness ratio results in a rapid increase in both the longitudinal and transverse stresses, which shows that there is an increase in orthotropic behaviour and deformation of the cross-section with an increase in void diameter ratio. From the results, it can be concluded that the optimal void diameter ratio is between 0. 6 and 0. 8. This range of void diameter ratios allow for greater efficiency due to reduced dead load and material use, without generating excessive stresses due to cellular distortion resulting from excessively thin and flexible flanges above and below the voids. The spacing of the voids was found to have minimal effect on the stress distributions for a logical void spacing. These results show that the orthotropic behaviour and deformation of the cross-section are more sensitive to variations in void diameter ratio than the spacing of the voids. The void diameter ratio should therefore form the basis of the equivalent plate parameters for the use of orthotropic plate theory. The use of a solid orthotropic plate to idealise a <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> showed reasonable agreement with the results from three-dimensional models, with some discrepancies in the different authors' methods noted. The net effect of using a two-dimensional analysis is the averaging out of the stress transverse distribution, which cannot predict the peak stresses around the voids. The orthotropic models compared more favourably with the 3 D model than the isotropic models with increasing void diameter ratio. The results presented have shown that the incorporation of voids begins to affect the structural behaviour of the <b>slab</b> once the <b>void</b> diameter ratio exceeds 0. 6, and the orthotropic behaviour becomes considerable. The stress raising effect of the voids should therefore be accounted for in the analysis of a <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> once the <b>void</b> diameter ratio exceeds 0. 6. It is recommended that a solid isotropic slab can be used to idealise a <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> when the <b>void</b> diameter to <b>slab</b> depth ratio is less than 0. 6. When the void diameter ratio is greater than 0. 6, the transverse stiffness should be evaluated independently from the longitudinal stiffness, and orthotropic models are more suitable. For higher void diameter ratios, the method employed by Sen et al. (1994), which employs a reduced depth solid orthotropic slab in conjunction with stress multipliers, was found to be the most accurate method for idealising <b>voided</b> <b>slabs.</b> It is evident from this study, that while a three-dimensional finite element model may be too complex for everyday use, it may be extremely valuable for determining the local effects due to the presence of the voids...|$|R

The program utilizes the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) to compute transient heat conduction and temperature distribution of the cross section of the <b>void</b> <b>slab.</b> Using this computer prigram, the temperature variation of the void air for nine types of void slabs: uninsulated, upside of the slab insulated, the surface of the voids insulated, both upside of the slab and the surface of the voids insulated are all simulated under actual air-conditioning conditions for a commercial building. The following results are obtained based on the simulations. (1) When voids in an uninsulated roof slab are used as heating ducts, outlet air from the voids loses oveｒ 50 % of supplied sensible heat.

To avoid the heat loss/gain from the void to the outside, insulation {{on the surface of the}} void as well as on the exterior surface of the roof should be required.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as structure-borne sounds that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of concrete slab, inserting sound absorptive materials, and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of floating floors (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A floating floor is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete floors and floating floors in dwellings. In their study, the floating floor would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the <b>voided</b> <b>slab</b> system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the floating floor systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS void formers were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure.
