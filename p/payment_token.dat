40|$|Wallet may be {{described}} as container application used for configuring, accessing and analysing data from underlying payment application(s). There are two dominant types of digital wallet applications, proximity wallet and remote wallet. In the payment industry, one often hears about authentication approach for proximity or remote wallets or the underlying payment applications separately, {{but there is no}} such approach, as per our knowledge, for combined wallet, the holder application. While Secure Element (SE) controlled by the mobile network operator (i. e., SIM card) may ensure strong authentication, it introduces strong dependencies among business partners in payments and hence is not getting fraction. Embedded SE in the form of trusted execution environment [3, 4, 5] or trusted computing [24] may address this issue in future. But such devices tend to be a bit expensive and are not abundant in the market. Meanwhile, for many years, context based authentication involving device fingerprinting and other contextual information for conditional multi-factor authentication, would prevail and would remain as the most dominant and strong authentication mechanism for mobile devices from various vendors in different capability and price ranges. EMVCo <b>payment</b> <b>token</b> standard published in 2014 tries to address security of wallet based payment in a general way. The authors believe that it is quite likely that EMVCo <b>payment</b> <b>token</b> implementations would evolve in course of time {{in such a way that}} token service providers would start insisting on device fingerprinting as strong means of authentication before issuing one-time-use <b>payment</b> <b>token.</b> This paper talks about challenges of existing authentication mechanisms used in payment and wallet applications, and their evolution...|$|E

All existing solutions only assume the rational lazybut- honest workers. In this paper, we first introduce the rational lazy-and-partially-dishonest workers in the outsourcing computation model. In addition, we propose a new fair conditional payment scheme for outsourcing computation that is only based on traditional electronic cash systems. The proposed construction uses a semitrusted third party T to achieve the fairness and efficiency. However, is only involved in the protocol in the exceptional case, namely {{in the case of}} disputes. Moreover, since neither the secret sharing/splitting scheme nor the cut-and-choose protocol is used for the generation or verification of the <b>payment</b> <b>token,</b> our solution clearly outperforms the existing schemes in terms of efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Firefox OS is an {{operating}} system for mobile {{devices such as}} smartphones and tablets. It is developed by Mozilla but it aims {{to be free from}} any proprietary technology. It lets users run applications developed entirely using web technologies, like HTML 5, JavaScript, CSS. It is not directly competing with iOS. It has some common target markets with Android. For now Firefox OS targets specific type of clients - people that don't have smartphones yet. Available devices are low-end and as a result prices of Firefox OS phones are low. Firefox OS is aimed to be free from a proprietary technology so, as an effect, flexible and open. There should be no more device or vendor fragmentation. All apps are supposed to be built once and run everywhere. It is possible thanks to Web Apps and Web APIs. Mozilla makes a big effort in order to standardize Web APIs, so that the device hardware could be accessed more easily. Mozilla also introduced its sign-in system for the Web. Mozilla Persona allows sign-in by using any of user's existing email addresses. Persona implements a BrowserID protocol that is a universal login system that does not require email providers to support it. Furthermore, the identity provider cannot track user's activity thanks to a certification system. Implementing persona requires very little code so it can be quickly deployed. At this point the biggest issue that Mozilla is facing is the lack of websites using their system. Mozilla also wants to redefine the way payments work for mobile applications. Firefox OS allows two types of paid content: paid applications and in-app payments. There are three important parts in the payment process: Payment Provider, Client App and App Server. They communicate with each other and use a <b>payment</b> <b>token</b> to provide all necessary information concerning the product being purchased. Mozpay,the principal part of the payment flow, was introduced in the first version of Firefox OS. Recently mozpay was proposed to be depreciated, because it made the payment process to rigid for certain payment providers. There are several solutions like PayPal, Google Wallet or Stripe that can be easily added to the web content by injecting JavaScript into web pages. The new solution is to securely expose Payment Provider primitives that websites can use to implement mobile payments. The subject is still under discussion. Firefox OS is still in the early phase. Different features and functionalities keep changing. The existing applications are not all working smoothly yet but the marketplace keeps growing. So far Firefox OS was launched in several countries like Spain and Poland. There are other carriers that will start selling it in other countries sometime soon. The opinions about Firefox OS are divided. So far all sold devices are low-end so they are targeting a certain type of clients, users that are not very emanding. As a result it is difficult to clearly evaluate this system or to compare it to existing technologies. The future of Firefox OS is still unsure. Although thanks to growing interest in Web Apps and Web APIs and cooperating with other companies and mobile carrier the system may become successful...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{e-commerce}} has gained much importance. Traditional commerce (in {{which case the}} customer physically goes to the merchant’s shop, purchases goods and/or services and makes a payment) is slowly being replaced with e-commerce and more people tend to prefer doing their shopping online. One {{of the main reasons}} for this attraction is the convenience the e-commerce provides. Customers can choose from a lot of different merchants at the convenience of their homes or while travelling by avoiding the hassle and stress of traditional shopping. However, e-commerce has lots of challenges. One key challenge is trust as transactions take place across territories and there are various legal & regulatory issues that govern these transactions. Various protocols and underlying e-commerce technologies help in the provision of this trust. One way to establish trust is to ensure fair exchange. There is also a question about traceability of transactions and customers’ need for privacy. This is provided by anonymity – making sure that the transactions are untraceable and that the customers’ personal information is kept secret. Thus the aim of this research is to propose a protocol that provides fair exchange and anonymity to the transacting parties by making use of a Trusted Third Party. The research is also aimed at ensuring payment security and making use of a single <b>payment</b> <b>token</b> to enhance the efficiency of the protocol. The proposed protocol consists of pre-negotiation, negotiation, withdrawal, purchase and arbitration phases. The analysis of the protocol proves that throughout all the phases of the e-commerce transaction, it is able to provide fair exchange and complete anonymity to the transacting parties. Anonymity provides the privacy of customers’ data and ensures that all Personally Identifiable Information of the transacting parties are kept hidden to avoid misuse. The protocol proposed is model checked to ensure that it is able to show that the fair exchange feature is satisfied. It is implemented using Java to show that it is ready-to-use and not just a theoretical idea but something {{that can be used in}} the real-world scenario. The security features of the protocol is taken care of by making sure that appropriate cryptographic algorithms and protocols are used to ensure provision of confidentiality and integrity. This research explores those areas that have not been covered by other researchers with the idea that there is still a lot of scope for improvement in the current research. It identifies these v opportunities and the ‘research gaps’ and focuses on overcoming these gaps. The current e-commerce protocols do not cover all the desirable characteristics and it is important to address these characteristics as they are vital for the growth of e-commerce technologies. The novelty of the protocol lies in the fact that it provides anonymity as well as fair exchange using a Trusted Third Party that is entirely trustworthy unlike certain protocols where the trusted third party is semi-trusted. The proposed protocol makes use of symmetric key cryptography wherever possible to ensure that it is efficient and light weight. The number of messages is significantly reduced. This overcomes the drawback identified in various other protocols which are cumbersome due to the number of messages. Anonymity is based on blind signature method of Chaum. It has been identified that usage of other methods such as pseudo-identifiers have resulted in the inefficiency of the protocol due to the bottlenecks created by these identifiers. It also ensures anonymity can never be compromised unlike certain protocols whereby an eavesdropper can find out the customer’s identity as the customer is required to disclose his/her public key during transactions. Further to this, the protocol also provides immunity against message replay attacks. Finally, the protocol always assumes that one or more parties can always be dishonest which is unlike certain protocols that assume only one party can be dishonest at any point. This ensures that all scenarios are taken into consideration and two parties cannot conspire against the other thus compromising on the fairness of the protocol. Detailed analysis, implementation, verification and evaluation of the protocol is done to ensure that the research is able to prove that the protocol has been carefully designed and the key goals of fair exchange and anonymity. All scenarios are taken into consideration to prove that the protocol will indeed satisfy all criteria. The research thus expects that the protocol could be implemented in real-life scenarios and finds a great potential in the e-commerce field...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, {{the desire}} for user privacy in {{intelligent}} transportation systems seemed to {{be at odds with}} the cost constraints of <b>payment</b> <b>tokens.</b> There is need for low-cost payment devices that can be produced in massive quantities while sophisticated cryptographic techniques seem to be too computationally intensive to be used in such devices.

40|$|International audienceMost {{electronic}} payment systems for applications, such as eTicketing and eToll, involve a single entity acting as both merchant and bank. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving post-payment eCash system suitable {{for this particular}} use case that we refer to, afterwards, as private eCash. To this end, we introduce a new partially blind signature scheme based on a recent Algebraic MAC scheme due to Chase et al. Unlike previous constructions, it allows multiple presentations of the same signature in an unlinkable way. Using it, our system is the first versatile private eCash system where users must only hold a sole reusable token (i. e. a reusable coin spendable to a unique merchant). It also enables identity and token revocations as well as flexible payments. Indeed, our <b>payment</b> <b>tokens</b> are updated in a partially blinded way to collect refunds without invading user's privacy. By implementing it on a Global Platform compliant SIM card, we show its efficiency and suitability for real-world use cases, even for delay-sensitive applications and on constrained devices as a transaction can be performed in only 205 ms...|$|R
