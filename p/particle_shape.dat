40|$|Shapes of ice {{crystals}} can significantly affect the radiative transfer in ice clouds. The angular {{distribution of the}} polarized reflectance over ice clouds strongly depends on ice crystal shapes. Although the angular-distribution features of the total or polarized reflectance over ice clouds implies a possibility of retrieving ice cloud <b>particle</b> <b>shapes</b> by use of remote sensing data, {{the accuracy of the}} retrieval must be evaluated. In this study, a technique, which applies single ice crystal habit and multidirectional polarized radiance to retrieve ice cloud <b>particle</b> <b>shapes,</b> is assessed. Our sensitivity studies show that the retrieved <b>particle</b> <b>shapes</b> &om this algorithm can be considered good approximations to those in actual clouds in calculation of the phase matrix elements. Although a fractal poly-crystal shape or an inhomogeneous hexagonal column may also produce this type of phase functions, more representative single-scattering properties from combinations of natural <b>particle</b> <b>shapes</b> and size distributions may still be necessary in accurate retrieval of other cloud properties such as optical thickness and particle size...|$|R
