40|$|CONTEXT: Scientific {{journals}} issue <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> {{to disseminate}} scientific news about articles they publish. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> about journal articles {{were associated with}} publication of subsequent newspaper stories. DESIGN: Retrospective content analysis of newspaper stories, journal <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> and journal tables of contents. From December 1, 1996, to February 28, 1997, <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and tables of contents were collected from BMJ, Nature, Science, and The Lancet, along with newspaper stories on scientific research published in The New York Times (United States), Le Figaro and Le Monde (France), El País and La Vanguardia (Spain), La Repubblica (Italy), and the International Herald Tribune. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Number of newspaper stories that contained reference to articles appearing in the 4 scientific journals, number of newspaper stories that referred to journal articles described in <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> and {{the order in which}} journal articles were mentioned in <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> RESULTS: Of the 1060 newspaper stories analyzed, 142 referred to journal articles; of these, 119 (84 %) referred to articles mentioned in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and 23 (16 %) referred to journal articles not mentioned in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> (comparison of proportions, P=. 03). Articles described first or second were referenced in more newspapers than articles described later in the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> (P=. 01 by chi 2 analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Journal articles described in <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> in particular those described first or second in the <b>press</b> <b>release,</b> are associated with the subsequent publication of newspaper stories on the same topic...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to research how much and how journalists of five Estonian regional newspaper use <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> I tried to find answers to the following questions: which role a <b>press</b> <b>release</b> has for a journalist, which is {{the practice of the}} usage of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and which is a good <b>press</b> <b>release</b> for a journalist. Research showed that even though journalist use more <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> than originally thought, they don’t take these as their main sources of information. Regional papers’ editors and reporters prefer their regular sources who tend to be regular people, friends and family or specialists working in a field of journalist’s subject field. Mainly <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> are used as backround information, for educational purposes or for finding a theme for a longer story. Journalists receive a different amount of <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> There is a tendency for a newspaper’s general e-mail to receive more <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> than journalist’s personal work e-mail. Number of the received <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> is between 10 and 150. Relying on the journalists’ personal preferences only maximum 5 of these are used. This means that the average usage of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> for the interviewed journalists is only nearly 7, 5 %. Journalists say that most of the received press realeases are good and well-structured, but they are not being used nevertheless. Most common reasons not to use the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> tend to be it’s subject not being close enough to the reader, impossibility to focus the story to the region, or release being too much of an advert to use as a piece of news. <b>Press</b> <b>release’s</b> sender is not important fot the interviewed journalists. Their opinions differ in a question weather a <b>press</b> <b>release</b> should include someones commentary and photos. Ladder are considered importand when there is not much time until the deadline or the article is meant for the online paper. All journalists find it important that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> is geographically or emotionally close to the reader and it fills the criteria of news values. Backround information in the <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> is usually considered unnecessary – first hand it should be short and concrete, while the most important information should be placed in the beginning of a release and less important should come towards the end. Journalists definitely use a <b>press</b> <b>release</b> that is well-composed, short and concrete, important to the local reader and fills the criteria of news values.

30|$|I {{checked the}} <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> for several DVA {{disclosures}} and constructed respective binary variables (see similar: Baumker et al. 2014). Ment, {{indicates that the}} quarterly earnings <b>press</b> <b>release</b> mentions DVAs. Sign indicates that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> contains information on the DVAs’ sign (i.e., whether DVAs are positive or negative). Size indicates that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> contains the DVAs’ size as an absolute or per share figure. 3 Due indicates that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> contains information explaining that DVAs stem from a change in debt value or from a change in credit risk. Dir indicates that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> contains directional information on DVAs. For example, in firm-quarters with negative DVAs, Dir indicates that the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> contains the information that the negative DVAs stem from an increase in own debt’s value and/or that they stem from {{a decrease in the}} firm’s own credit risk.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous studies {{indicate}} that in published reports, trial results can be distorted {{by the use of}} "spin" (specific reporting strategies, intentional or unintentional, emphasizing the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment). We aimed to (1) evaluate the presence of "spin" in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and associated media coverage; and (2) evaluate whether findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and media coverage are misinterpreted. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically searched for all <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> indexed in the EurekAlert! database between December 2009 and March 2010. Of the 498 <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> retrieved and screened, we included <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> for all two-arm, parallel-group RCTs (n =  70). We obtained a copy of the scientific article to which the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> related and we systematically searched for related news items using Lexis Nexis. "Spin," defined as specific reporting strategies (intentional or unintentional) emphasizing the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment, was identified in 28 (40 %) scientific article abstract conclusions and in 33 (47 %) <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> From bivariate and multivariable analysis assessing the journal type, funding source, sample size, type of treatment (drug or other), results of the primary outcomes (all nonstatistically significant versus other), author of the <b>press</b> <b>release,</b> and the presence of "spin" in the abstract conclusion, the only factor associated, with "spin" in the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> was "spin" in the article abstract conclusions (relative risk [RR] 5. 6, [95 % CI 2. 8 - 11. 1], p < 0. 001). Findings of RCTs based on <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> were overestimated for 19 (27 %) reports. News items were identified for 41 RCTs; 21 (51 %) were reported with "spin," mainly the same type of "spin" as those identified in the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> and article abstract conclusion. Findings of RCTs based on the news item was overestimated for ten (24 %) reports. CONCLUSION: "Spin" was identified in about half of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> and media coverage.

40|$|Background: <b>Press</b> <b>releases</b> are {{a popular}} vehicle to {{disseminate}} health {{information to the}} lay media. While the quality of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> issued by scientific conferences and medical journals has been questioned, no efforts to assess pharmaceutical industry <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> have been made. Therefore, we sought to systematically examine pharmaceutical company <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> about original research for measures of quality. Methodolgy/Principal Findings: <b>Press</b> <b>releases</b> issued by the ten top selling, international pharmaceutical companies in the year 2005 were selected for evaluation. A total of 1028 electronic <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> were issued and 235 were based on original research. More than half (59 %) reported results presented at a scientific meeting. Twenty-one percent of releases were not explicit about the source of original data. While harms or adverse events were commonly cited (76 %), study limitations were rarely noted (6 %). Almost one-third (29 %) of releases did not quantify study results. Studies presented in abstract form were subsequently published within at least 20 months in 53 % of cases. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical company <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> frequently report basic study details. However, readers should be cautioned by the preliminary nature of the data and lack of identified limitations.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is concerned with}} <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> from the European Commission and national ministries. Political <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> may serve other purposes than those issued by business organisations, and they are also a fairly unexplored field in <b>press</b> <b>release</b> research, which this study sets out to remedy. The linguistic dimension of EU communication is also a neglected field of study, and this paper is aimed at introducing the linguistic dimension of the European Commission communication as a field of study worthy of closer examination. Within a genre-based analytical framework, the present paper aims at examining to what extent we can identify a unique community text pattern in European Commission <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> I propose a macro-structural text analysis in which I compare a number of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> issued by the European Commission with national equivalents from French and Swedish ministries. In particular, I will focus on three recurrent and characteristic text features of the European Commission <b>press</b> <b>release,</b> viz. the introduction, the quotation and the intertextual references. It is shown that {{the way they are}} designed in the European Commission <b>press</b> <b>release</b> is quite special and that this can be explained with reference to the communicative situation of the European Commission. In doing so, I will be drawing on ethnographic data that I gathered from fieldwork at the European Commission. It will be suggested that the results from this study can be extrapolated to the study of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> in general. That is, <b>press</b> <b>release</b> research may benefit from the genre-based methodological approach chosen here, since, indeed, the <b>press</b> <b>release</b> is a situated practice whose understanding depends on a comprehensive study of the communicative situations it functions within...|$|R
