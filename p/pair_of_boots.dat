25|$|The second Campbell County {{victim was}} found on April 3, 1985, but her hair color is unknown, which does not {{immediately}} indicate she {{was a victim of}} the Redhead Murderer. She was believed to have died between 1981 and 1984, one to four years before. Unlike the other victims, she was younger, between 9 and 15, when the others were estimated to be over 16. She was located by a passerby about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico in Campbell County, some distance from interstate 75, near a strip mine. The cause of this girl's death is unknown, as her remains were partial, but still may be homicide. Thirty-two bones, including her skull, were all that were recovered from the scene. Her skull allowed facial reconstruction. She wore a necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons from clothing. There were a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots</b> recovered that were size 5, which may not belong to the victim, and a few scraps of clothing. Due to the condition of her body, her height, weight, eye color and hair color were not possible to estimate.|$|E

Within the series, set in a fictional 19th century, Lenalee is an exorcist of the Black Order organization tasked with destroying demonic beings called Akuma created by the Millennium Earl, and aiding the Black Order in its fight against the Earl's group, the Noah Family. To facilitate this, she uses a type of weapon called [...] "Innocence" [...] that, in her case, takes {{the shape of a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots.</b> Lenalee was originally forced to become an exorcist when she was a child, but ended up appreciating it after her older brother, Komui Lee, moved to the Black Order to avoid being left, alone {{and at the same time}} became friends with all the staff.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira {{getting out of}} bed in the middle of a full-moon night. Her nails begin to grow and she is shown lacing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots.</b> Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage most of my life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E
500|$|The {{geographer}} E. G. R. Taylor, {{reviewing the}} book for the Royal Geographical Society in 1955, wrote that Hoskins {{made the case for}} getting a strong <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots</b> to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of urban geography. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins [...] "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'" [...] She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to [...] "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past", where, she wrote, he [...] "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'" [...] Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, [...] "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".|$|E

500|$|The first Test {{began at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932, and was played in a tense and heated atmosphere. Bradman, whose {{discomfort}} and poor form against the tourists' bowling in the preparatory games had become sources of anxiety, was prevented from playing by illness. England won the game by 10 wickets; Larwood's match figures were 10 for 124, with only limited use of fast leg theory. The match's most successful batsman was Australia's Stan McCabe, who scored 187 in his side's first innings, attacking both the orthodox and leg theory attacks in a [...] "death or glory" [...] approach. During the match Hugh Buggy, {{a reporter for the}} Melbourne Herald, used the word [...] "bodyline" [...] to describe the English leg theory bowling. The term was soon universally adopted in Australia, though English sources continued to refer to [...] "leg theory". The second Test, at Melbourne beginning 30 December, was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace attack. Larwood was further handicapped by pains from sore feet, caused by a new <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots.</b> Bradman returned to the Australian side and scored a century, guiding his team to victory by 111 runs; his success led many commentators to suppose that fast leg theory would thenceforth prove ineffective. The series was tied 1–1 and, {{in the words of the}} writer-historian Ronald Blythe, [...] "all was sweetness and light".|$|E
500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots</b> for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E
500|$|Gaga wore {{a myriad}} of costumes, {{including}} a feathered crown from Gympie milliner Cindy Vogels during [...] "I Won't Dance". Vogels was contacted by Brandon Maxwell Studios from New York—Gaga's stylist—for designer pieces available for the concert. According to the milliner the crown almost never reached Gaga since the entire shipment was seized in Anchorage, Alaska due to the feathers on the piece being subjected to wildlife import issues with US customs officials. After much paperwork for five days the millinery designs were finally released and arrived {{just in time for}} the Cheek to Cheek promotional photo shoot. Vogels recalled, [...] "It was nerve racking and exciting at the same time and a relief when the shipment was finally released from customs." [...] Maxwell said that he and his team did the wardrobe for the dancers and Gaga, and first took references from Wilson regarding the set and lighting designs. The team then started with eight full racks of clothing, between 200 and 300 dresses, and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show, along with its accessories. Regarding the absence of jewellery, Maxwell explained that most of the outfits [...] "were more about the silhouette and structure of gowns" [...] and too much of accessories would have been a distraction. He wanted the emphasis on Gaga's vocals, hence the jewellery usage was reduced. Designers used for the costumes include Roberto Cavalli, Michael Costello, Mathieu Mirano, Valentino as well as David Samuel Menkes, who created the leather jumpsuit. Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns, belted in the middle. Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too tight in Gaga's abdomen area, since it would have been difficult for her to sing. Sandals were provided by Brian Atwood, Stuart Weitzman and Sophia Webster, while a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>boots</b> were designed by Giuseppe Zanotti. They created custom made shoes which made Gaga appear tall and move freely in the long gowns.|$|E
