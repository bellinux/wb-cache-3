Osteoarthritis is {{a disease}} that causes decreases in hand function in the elderly adult {{and can lead to}} full disability of the hand. There is no clear cause of osteoarthritis of the hand, although injury and overuse can contribute to development of the disease. Traditional treatments include splinting, <b>paraffin</b> <b>therapy,</b> medications and, in severe cases, joint replacement. Nontraditional therapies include mobility training, therapeutic touch, acupuncture and exercise. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the non-traditional treatment of hand-strengthening exercise as a way to improve hand function. Specifically, this study evaluated the effects of an eightweek hand exercise program utilizing Hand Exercisers and FlexBars on hand grip strength and dexterity in 13 elderly women aged 70 - 85 (M= 80. 4, SD= +/- 4. 25) who showed signs and symptoms of hand osteoarthritis, which are pain, stiffness and swelling [...] Participants were evaluated before and after the exercise intervention for grip strength, pinch strength, range of motion of the trapeziometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal and wrist joints, and were timed on a hand dexterity test that involved putting on and buttoning a shirt with ten 3 / 8 th inch buttons. A repeated measures ANOVA was the mode of data analysis. Hand strength significantly improved (p< 0. 05), as both grip (19 %) and pinch (26 %) strength showed improvements. In range of motion testing, palmar flexion (12 %), interphalangeal flexion (46 %), metacarpophalangeal flexion (39 %) and wrist extension (11 %) showed significant improvements while palmar abduction (12 %) and wrist flexion (8 %) did not. Hand dexterity also improved as evidenced by a 24 % decrease in the amount of time to button a shirt. Pain, stiffness and disability, as measured by the AUSCAN, also decreased significantly, with a 17. 3 % decrease in means. The results indicate that hand exercise programs can be used to increase hand function while decreasing the signs and symptoms in patients with hand osteoarthritis...|$|E

40|$|Betamethasone {{has been}} used {{extensively}} to accelerate fetal lung maturation, yet little is known of its effects on neuronal morphogenesis in the developing fetus. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are a diverse family of cytoskeletal proteins that are important for brain development {{and the maintenance of}} neuroarchitecture. Vehicle (n = 7) or betamethasone (10 μg h− 1, n = 7) was infused I. V. to fetal sheep over 48 h beginning at 0. 87 of gestation (128 days of gestation), producing fetal plasma betamethasone concentrations resembling those to which the human fetus is exposed during antenatal glucocorticoid <b>therapy.</b> <b>Paraffin</b> sections of the left hemisphere were stained with monoclonal antibodies against MAP 1 B and the MAP 2 isoforms MAP 2 a,b,c and MAP 2 a,b. The level of the juvenile isoform MAP 2 c was determined by comparison of the two MAP 2 immunostainings. We were able to detect MAP 1 B and MAP 2 immunoreactivity (IR) in the fetal sheep brain. MAP 2 c was the major MAP 2, constituting 90. 2 % of the total MAP 2. Betamethasone exposure diminished MAP 1 B IR in the frontal cortex and caudate putamen (P < 0. 05) but not in the hippocampus. A decrease of MAP 2 IR was found in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and caudate putamen (P < 0. 05). Loss of MAP 2 IR was mainly due to the loss of MAP 2 c IR. Haematoxylin–eosin staining did not demonstrate irreversible neuronal damage. Regional cerebral blood flow determined using coloured microspheres was significantly decreased by 28 % in the frontal cortex and by 36 % in the caudate putamen but not in the hippocampus 24 h after the onset of betamethasone exposure (P < 0. 05). The loss of MAP 1 B and MAP 2 a,b,c IR showed a significant correlation to the cerebral blood flow decrease only in the frontal cortex (P < 0. 05). These data suggest that mechanisms other than metabolic insufficiency caused by the decreased cerebral blood flow may contribute to the loss of MAPs. The results suggest that clinical doses of betamethasone may have acute effects on cytoskeletal proteins in the fetal brain...|$|R
