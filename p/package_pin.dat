5|$|Joe, Shelley, Styles, and Williams {{advanced}} to the semifinals. The first match {{took place on the}} August5 episode of Impact! between Joe and Shelley. Joe slammed Shelley back-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then choked him unconscious with the Coquina Clutch at 9 minutes and 4 seconds to win and advance to the finals. In the second semifinal match on August10, Styles defeated Williams with a small <b>package</b> <b>pin</b> at 9 minutes and 19 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The last quarterfinal match {{featured}} A.J. Styles and Super Eric against Awesome Kong and B.G. James. Super Eric {{picked up}} Kong and slammed her into B.G., who was {{laying on the}} ring mat. Later, Styles attempted to perform a move by jumping off the ropes, but legitimately tripped, falling face-first on the mat. Then B.G. lifted Styles to perform a suplex, which Styles countered into a small <b>package</b> <b>pin</b> attempt, resulting in a victory at five minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles {{executed}} his aerial technique the Spiral Tap, in which he jumps {{off one of the}} top padded turnbuckles, spins and flips in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but was distracted by Angle and Booker T.

5|$|Jay Lethal {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Petey Williams, who was {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan, in a contest lasting eleven minutes and forty-one seconds. Near {{the end of the}} bout, Khan distracted the referee, at which time Steiner came down to the ring and interfered in the match, allowing Williams to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. SoCal Val then interfered as the referee was counting the pinfall, removing him from the ring. Khan began to chase Val, before Sonjay Dutt came to her rescue. When Williams went for another pin attempt, Lethal countered it into a small <b>package</b> <b>pin,</b> winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The last {{semifinal}} {{match between}} LAX, accompanied by Guerrero and Salinas, and Styles and Super Eric.

Later, Styles held Homicide in a small <b>package</b> <b>pin</b> attempt until Salinas distracted the referee, allowing Guerrero to enter the ring and readjust Styles and Homicide to make the pin in LAX's favor. Afterwards, the referee counted the pin, giving LAX the win at seven minutes and forty seconds, although Styles' shoulders were clearly not fully against the mat.|$|E

40|$|Power {{and ground}} planes on {{multilayer}} PCBs can effectively radiate electromagnetic fields {{excited by the}} IC simultaneous switching noise. The high frequency electromagnetic radiation is often calculated from the electric field {{along the edge of}} the PCB, which can be estimated with a cavity model using magnetic walls. The excitation of the cavity modes is related to the via current passing through the power bus planes at the interconnection between IC package and PCB. Usually the attention is focused on the differential-mode current of the <b>package</b> <b>pins,</b> but in the present paper it is shown that the common-mode current flowing out from <b>package</b> <b>pins</b> plays a very important role in the excitation of cavity modes, and its neglect implies a fatal underestimation of the electromagnetic radiation from the power bus planes in some circumstances. A second important contribute to the radiation is given by the common mode current on the pins, together with the current flowing on the PCB ground plane. With the proposed equivalent circuit, the effectiveness of decoupling inductors depending on their location and on the value of the parasitic capacitance is studied...|$|R

50|$|The BGA is a {{solution}} to the problem of producing a miniature package for an integrated circuit with many hundreds of pins. Pin grid arrays and dual-in-line surface mount (SOIC) packages were being produced with more and more pins, and with decreasing spacing between the pins, but this was causing difficulties for the soldering process. As <b>package</b> <b>pins</b> got closer together, the danger of accidentally bridging adjacent pins with solder grew. BGAs do not have this problem if the solder is factory-applied to the package.|$|R
