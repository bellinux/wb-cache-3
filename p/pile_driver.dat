5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E

There are two v-shaped cantilever sections supporting the bridge deck, each [...] long, [...] balanced on large concrete pilings at opposite sides of the ship canal which serve as the two main supporting anchors. Some 828 timber piles were driven for the foundation of the south anchor and 684 piles for the north. They range in size from [...] and rest [...] {{below the surface of the}} water.

2500|$|Prefabricated piles {{are driven}} into the ground using a <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> Driven piles are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though concrete piles can be spliced with mechanical and other means. Driving piles, as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their load-bearing capacity. Driven piles are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the Pile Driving Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for Nils Ericsons sluss ("Lock of Nils Ericson") he made detailed studies and minute calculations in 1845–1846. He concluded there were insufficient stonemasons in the Stockholm area, and therefore had limestone and granite {{brought in from}} other parts of Sweden, quarries Ericson knew well from his earlier projects. He constructed a circular saw turned inwards to cut the head each stock at equal level for the bottom of the caisson, an instrument which was, like virtually all heavy tasks during the project, hand operated by several men. [...] Empty barrels were used as rafts. Ericson gave directions for all sorts of tasks, including dredging, securing the rabbeting of planks, earth fillings, and determining the inclination of the caisson walls {{in order for them to}} withstand the pressure from the levees. [...] He had to use an expensive steam dredger, but could avoid a machine for the drainage which saved a lot of money. He also made great efforts to make the extensive piling for the foundation more efficient; the drop forge of the <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> should hit the pile with a constant effect, why Ericson had the labourers lower the device as the pile sunk. The timbered caisson was built as a huge box on Djurgården, just north-east of the bridge Lilla Sjötullsbron, slightly more than 79 meters long, 16,5 meters wide and 6,2 meters high (266½×56×21 feet), subsequently towed into place before the ends were removed. [...] The temporary drydock on Djurgården is still discernible as a depression in the landscape. The construction work on the caisson began in May 1847 with the construction of barracks for 60 men and a smithy. [...] In the drydock keel blocks [...] tall were then placed and the bottom of the caisson was built upon them [...] a bed consisting of [...] deal, [...] beams, and 1inches of boards. The caisson was completed in August, water was let in and the building berth and the barrage were removed. [...] The floating was done in two hours 2-4 a.m., and its dimensions produced enthusiastic comparisons: [...] "larger than the Stockholm Cathedral!", [...] "...could house the entire Swedish Army and its paraphernalia." ...|$|E
50|$|Gravity exerts a {{force on}} the hammer head. If {{hammering}} downwards, gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each blow. If hammering upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow. Some hammering methods, such as traditional mechanical <b>pile</b> <b>drivers,</b> rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.|$|R

However, there is evidence that a comparable device was used in the construction of Crannogs at Oakbank and Loch Tay in Scotland as early as 5000 years ago. In 1801 John Rennie came up with a steam piledriver in Britain. Otis Tufts is credited with inventing the steam <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> in the United States.|$|E
