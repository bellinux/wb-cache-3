30|$|For one current expatriate, an {{engineer}} {{who works for}} the <b>product</b> <b>support</b> <b>department</b> and often travels to solve technical problems, speaking Mandarin is essential. For the production floor, most workers are not Japanese or English speakers; they tend to use their local language, dialect of Chinese. For Japanese engineers to communicate with production floor workers, they need Mandarin proficiency or an interpreter. During a brief factory tour, I saw a Japanese engineer instructing a group of Chinese workers via a Chinese interpreter. All the bulletin boards were mostly displayed in Mandarin with some Japanese, indicating that some of the posters (e.g., safety information) were translated from Japanese originals.|$|E
50|$|On May 27, 2009, Danfoss {{announced}} that it would cease production in Flensburg within a year and lay off another 450 employees in response to the recent financial crisis. The company's chief operations officer, Kim Fausing, reported that its household compressors business was incurring millions in losses. Politicians appealed to Danfoss executives to reconsider, saying that keeping the production plant in Flensburg would give a positive signal for the German-Danish economic region, but the company went forward with the closing. The Flensburg headquarters continued to house the company's research and development, sales, and <b>product</b> <b>support</b> <b>departments.</b>|$|R

In June 1986 he was designated an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (AEDO). He served as a production test pilot at the Naval Aviation Depot, NAS Jacksonville, Florida, flying the F/A-18 Hornet and the A-7 Corsair aircraft. He was also assigned as Director of the <b>Product</b> <b>Support</b> (engineering) <b>Department.</b> He was next assigned as the Deputy Director of the Tactical Aircraft Systems Department at the Naval Air Development Center at Warminster, Pennsylvania.

Yet, even {{as the number of}} <b>support</b> <b>departments</b> and their costs increase, the adoption of the reciprocal method has been hampered since it requires solving simultaneous equations for reciprocated costs of each <b>support</b> <b>department.</b> Matrix functions in spreadsheets will solve for reciprocated costs of many <b>support</b> <b>departments.</b> The Sasha Case illustrates the use of matrices to model services among <b>support</b> and operating <b>departments,</b> to solve simultaneous equations for the reciprocated costs of <b>support</b> <b>departments,</b> and to allocate the reciprocated costs to other departments...|$|R
40|$|The direct, {{step-down}} and reciprocal {{methods are}} commonly used for allocating costs of <b>support</b> <b>departments.</b> While each method has benefits and drawbacks, the direct and step-down methods are used often because of their simplicity in allocating costs. In contrast, the preferred reciprocal method is difficult to adopt as simultaneous equations are needed for solving reciprocated costs of each <b>support</b> <b>department.</b> The Al-Jo’anee Company presents a matrix approach to model <b>support</b> services among <b>departments,</b> to solve for reciprocated costs of <b>support</b> <b>departments,</b> and to allocate the reciprocated costs to five <b>support</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} helps {{bridge the}} gap between conventional <b>product</b> <b>support,</b> where the support system is considered as a stand-alone application, and the new paradigm of responsive one, where the support system frequently communicates with its environment and reacts to stimuli. This new paradigm would enable <b>product</b> <b>support</b> knowledge to be captured, stored, processed, and updated automatically, being delivered to the users when, where and in the form they need it. The research reported in this thesis first defines <b>Product</b> <b>Support</b> Systems (PRSSs) as electronic means that provide accurate and up-to-date information to the user in a coherent and personalised manner. <b>Product</b> <b>support</b> knowledge is then identified as the integration of product, task, user, and support documentation knowledge. Next, the thesis focuses on an ontology-based model of the structure, relations, and attributes of <b>product</b> <b>support</b> knowledge. In that model <b>product</b> <b>support</b> virtual documentation (PSVD) is presented as an aggregation of Information Objects (IOs) and Information Object Clusters (IOCs). The description of PSVD is followed by an analysis of the relation between IOs, IOCs, and domain knowledge. Then, the thesis builds on the ontology-based representation of <b>product</b> <b>support</b> knowledge and explores the synergy between <b>product</b> <b>support,</b> problem solving, and knowledge engineering. As a result, a structured problem solving approach is introduced that combines case-based adaptation and model-based generation techniques. Based on that approach a knowledge engineering framework for <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems is developed. A conceptual model of context-aware <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems that extends the framework is then introduced. The conceptual model includes an ontology-based representation of knowledge related to the users, their activities, the support environment, and the device being used. An approach to semi-automatically integrating design and documentation data is also proposed as part of context-aware <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems development process.

50|$|Performance-based {{logistics}} (PBL), {{also known}} as performance-based life-cycle <b>product</b> <b>support</b> or performance-based contracting, is a strategy for cost-effective weapon system support. Rather than contracting for the acquisition of goods and services, the <b>product</b> <b>support</b> manager identifies <b>product</b> <b>support</b> integrator(s) (PSI) to deliver performance outcomes as defined by performance metric(s) for a system or product. The integrator often commits to this performance level at a lower cost, or increased performance at costs similar to those previously achieved under a non-PBL or transactional portfolio of <b>product</b> <b>support</b> arrangements for goods and services.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Problem solving has {{traditionally}} {{been one of the}} principal research areas for artificial intelligence. Yet, although artificial intelligence reasoning techniques have been employed in several <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems, the benefit of integrating <b>product</b> <b>support,</b> knowledge engineering, and problem solving, is still unclear. This paper studies the synergy of these areas and proposes a knowledge engineering framework that integrates <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems and artificial intelligence techniques. The framework includes four spaces; the data, problem, hypothesis, and solution ones. The data space incorporates the knowledge needed for structured reasoning to take place, the problem space contains representations of problems, and the hypothesis space utilizes a multimodal reasoning approach to produce appropriate solutions in the form of virtual documents. The solution space is used as the gateway between the system and the user. The proposed framework enables the development of <b>product</b> <b>support</b> systems in terms of smaller, more manageable steps while the combination of different reasoning techniques provides a way to overcome the lack of documentation resources.
