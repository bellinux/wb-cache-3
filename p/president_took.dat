5|$|In 1990, Jaruzelski {{resigned}} as Poland's president and was succeeded by Wałęsa, {{who won the}} 1990 presidential elections. Lech Wałęsa's inauguration as <b>president</b> <b>took</b> place on 22 December 1990; he accepted the prewar presidential insignia from the stepping down President-in-Exile Ryszard Kaczorowski, distancing himself from Wojciech Jaruzelski. Wałęsa defeated Mazowiecki {{and in the second}} round Stanisław Tymiński, but under his presidency economic policy remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} foil any {{plans for a}} coup d'état, the <b>president</b> <b>took</b> control of the {{military}} and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th <b>President</b> <b>took</b> place on January 20, 2009. In his {{first few days}} in office, Obama issued {{executive}} orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice <b>President</b> <b>took</b> Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Congress {{passed the}} Former Presidents Act, {{offering}} a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president. Hoover, {{who was the}} only other living former <b>president,</b> <b>took</b> the pension even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing former President Truman whose precarious financial status {{played a role in the}} law's enactment.|$|E
25|$|The Sindhi and Urdu-speaking {{class in}} Sindh Province revolted against the One Unit policy. The {{violence}} spread to Balochistan Province, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Province. The One Unit policy {{was a failure}} in West Pakistan, and its survival was seen as improbable. However, with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the <b>President</b> <b>took</b> over executive powers for West Pakistan.|$|E

By February 1946, when Dutch troops had already returned to Java, he went to Yogyakarta to work as a military educator, teaching for a time at the military academy there.|$|E

25|$|The {{presidency}} of John Quincy Adams began on March 4, 1825, when John Quincy Adams was inaugurated as President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1829. Adams, the sixth United States <b>president,</b> <b>took</b> office following the 1824 presidential election, {{in which he}} and three other Democratic-Republicans—Henry Clay, William H. Crawford, and Andrew Jackson—sought the presidency. No candidate won a majority of Electoral College votes, and so the United States House of Representatives chose the president in a contingent election. With the help of Clay, Adams was elected by the House, and Clay became Adams's Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|After {{the student}} revolution, power was briefly held by an interim {{administration}} under {{the foreign minister}} Heo Jeong. A new parliamentary election was held on July 29, 1960. The Democratic Party, which {{had been in the}} opposition during the First Republic, easily gained power and the Second Republic was established. The revised constitution dictated the Second Republic to {{take the form of a}} parliamentary cabinet system where the <b>President</b> <b>took</b> only a nominal role. This was the first and the only instance South Korea turned to a parliamentary cabinet system instead of a presidential system. The assembly elected Yun Bo-seon as President and Chang Myon as the prime minister and head of government in August, 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{strain of}} this period, serving as both ACTU President and Labor Party <b>President,</b> <b>took</b> {{its toll on}} Hawke and in 1979 he {{suffered}} a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, {{and that he would}} make a concerted – and ultimately successful – effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with writer Blanche d'Alpuget, who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader Bill Hayden or Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.|$|E

25|$|Robert Noyce was Intel's CEO at its {{founding}} in 1968, followed by co-founder Gordon Moore in 1975. Andy Grove became the company's president in 1979 and added the CEO title in 1987 when Moore became chairman. In 1998, Grove succeeded Moore as Chairman, and Craig Barrett, already company <b>president,</b> <b>took</b> over. On May 18, 2005, Barrett handed the reins of the company over to Paul Otellini, {{who had been the}} company president and COO and who was responsible for Intel's design win in the original IBM PC. The board of directors elected Otellini as President and CEO, and Barrett replaced Grove as Chairman of the Board. Grove stepped down as chairman but is retained as a special adviser. In May 2009, Barrett stepped down as chairman of the Board and was succeeded by Jane Shaw. In May 2012, Intel vice chairman Andy Bryant, who had held the posts of CFO (1994) and Chief Administrative Officer (2007) at Intel, succeeded Shaw as executive chairman.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of Adams, Clay became {{the leader of the}} National Republicans. In 1830, Clay began making {{preparations}} for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. Early in Jackson's presidency, many doubted that Jackson would seek a second term, and Clay, Vice President John Calhoun, and former Treasury Secretary William Crawford (whose health had somewhat improved since 1824) all began preparations for the upcoming election. In 1831, Jackson {{made it clear that he}} was going to run for re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. While the two previous elections had essentially been intra-party contests among Democratic-Republicans, the election of 1832 saw the development of discrete political parties. Jackson's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies. John C. Calhoun's Nullifier faction opposed Jackson after the <b>president</b> <b>took</b> a strong stance against nullification, but the Nullifiers and National Republicans disagreed about the tariff, limiting the possibility of cooperation. The Anti-Masonic Party, a new political party opposed to Freemasonry, nominated former Attorney William Wirt for president. Clay, himself a Freemason, considered withdrawing from the race in hopes of unifying Jackson's opponents, but he ultimately decided to stay in the race. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party's national convention, Clay's followers arranged for a national nominating convention, with the intention of anointing Clay as the National Republican nominee. Facing little opposition at the convention, Clay won the party's presidential nomination, and the convention nominated Pennsylvania Congressman John Sergeant as Clay's running mate. As the election approached, the debate over the re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States emerged as the most important issue. In his veto of the bank, Jackson effectively made the case that the bank was a tool of the elites, bolstering his popularity with the people.|$|E
