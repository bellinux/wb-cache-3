40|$|Abstract. Steel and {{concrete}} composite structures {{are widely used}} in bridge engineering, for it can fully utilize the compression property of concrete and tensile behavior of the steel. However, the coupled behavior of shrinkage and creep exist in concrete. The creep behavior {{is dependent on the}} initial stress, while shrinkage is not. The shrinkage and creep of the concrete have a significant influence on the internal force and deformation and it may cause the cracking or even the failure of the structure. Nowadays, <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> is widely adopted in the composite bridges to reduce the effect of shrinkage and creep. Storage time is a critical parameter for the <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> to reach the best economic benefit and mechanical behavior of the structure.

40|$|Composite action {{between the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> and steel beam in a {{building}} frame is typically achieved by using headed stud shear connectors that are welded to the top flange of the steel beam to produce robust shear connection, but their demolition necessarily is associated with much waste and uses considerable energy. Moreover, the slab is usually cast in situ onto profiled steel decking with conventional reinforcement placed on site, which is time consuming and labour intensive and which can increase the construction costs considerably. This paper describes the results of three push-out tests conducted to determine the load-slip behaviour of deconstructable bolted shear connectors for <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> in a configuration {{which can be used}} in composite beams and joints. In this system, precast “green concrete” slabs having reduced emissions during their manufacture are attached compositely to the steel beam via post-installed pre-tensioned bolt shear connectors. Based on the experimental results, the structural behaviour of these new systems is assessed and compared with traditional stud shear connectors. The test results show that the behaviour of post-installed pretensioned bolted shear connectors is completely different to stud shear connectors, and these connectors provide reliable and adequate shear connection to composite beams and connections with <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} of building structures typically occurs when an abnormal loading condition causes a sudden {{loss in the}} structural capacity {{of one or more}} critical members, which leads to a chain reaction of failure and ultimately a catastrophic collapse. It is well accepted that in order to prevent the progressive {{collapse of}} beams or slabs, the establishment of catenary action mechanism is crucial to attain adequate post-collapse resistance. Experimental, numerical and analytical studies have been conducted to investigate the catenary behavior of the <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> system following the removal of their intermediate wall supports. Results also reveal that for the ties designed with inadequate embedment length, the slip and the resulting large deflection will effectively trigger the catenary action. However, the full bond will limit the development of deflection and lead to the fracture of tie bars before the catenary action is trigged.

Discomfort {{is one of the main}} complaints for cyclists, especially when related to the type o pavement they use while riding. This work presents a study of measurement and evaluation of human exposure to hand-arm vibration in the leisure cyclist activity in different pavements in order to classify according to vibration discomfort and to vibration injury risk. Methods: Vibration measurements are performed for three pavement types, asphalt (AS), <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> (PC), and interlocking concrete blocks (BI), using two bicycle models (time trial speed racing bike, S and mountain bike, MB), and cyclists with different physical characteristics. It is performed a quantitative analysis of each confi guration – pavement type × bike model × cyclist – where the daily vibration exposure A(8) is evaluated, as defi ned in ISO 5349 - 1 Standard, for 2 h daily exposure. It is also evaluated the maximum daily exposure in order to reach limit values, as defi ned by Directive 2002 / 44 /EC. Results: Based on a subjective analysis (survey), it is evaluated the comfort degree for vibration exposure for each tested pavement, according to a survey within cyclists. Finally, the results are compared using both quantitative and subjective analysis. Conclusions: Not surprisingly, it has been noticed that the most comfortable pavement type is the asphalt pavement (AS), followed by the precast concrete pavement (PC) and by the interlocking concrete blocks pavement (BI), confi rming the opinion pool within cyclists.

This paper reports on {{the determination of the}} effective cross sectional area of the proposed cold-formed sections that embedded in <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> The cold-formed steel sections are single and double lipped channel section, with 100 mm in depth, 50 mm width, 12 mm lips length and 1. 55 mm thickness. In order to determine the flexural capacity of the composite slab system, it is necessary to identify the effective cross sectional area of the section contributes to load-carrying of the slab system. The calculation method was based on the effective width method concept from BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 5. Four types of cold-formed steel frame profiles that embedded in the concrete to form a new type of composite slab system were used to study in this paper. The four types of cold-formed steel section configuration are S 1 -SV, S 2 -SH, S 3 -DV and S 4 -DH. From the analytical calculation, S 3 -DV has the highest effective cross-sectional area, which it only consists of 2 % ineffective area for load-carry capacity. Besides that, single lipped section S 2 -SH fully utilized the cross sectional in carrying load. It can be concluded that S 3 -DV is predicted to have highest bending resistance than other three types of configuration with condition that the reliability of the prediction need to verify as other factors such as shear bonding and shifted neutral axis happened due to combination of concrete and cold-formed section which, will also contribute the strength capacity of the composite slab system...|$|E

Steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) has been used increasingly {{in recent years and}} has been applied to various structural components. Considerable interest has been developed in using steel fibers in concrete to increase the load-carrying capacity of the structural members in service. It has been used recently to increase the flexural capacity of concrete slabs by applying a thin layer of SFRC onto an existing slab, a technique known as cement-base bonded overlay. The objective of this research is the investigation of the flexural behavior of a <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> with a steel fiber concrete topping. To reinforce the concrete overlay, hooked-end steel fibers with a length of 30 mm and a diameter of 0. 75 mm were used. Because the performance of this composite slab depends on the bonding between the old and new concrete, different types of roughness at the interface has used to provide good bonding between the two layers. Based on experimental tests, the flexural performance was shown to depend not only on adding the steel fibers to the topping but also on the type of interface roughness. To examine the composite behavior of the specimens, the interface slip was also measured throughout the test.

Steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) has been used increasingly in recent years and has applied to various structural components. It is also known that using 0. 5 – 2. 5 % fibre in concrete mix can significantly improve the concrete properties. In recent years, it has been used as a strengthening technique for concrete slabs. Cement-base bonded overlay technique consists of applying a thin layer of SFRC onto the existing slab. Beneficial effect of fibre reinforcement on the durability of cement-base bonded overlay has been amply demonstrated by previous researchers. The objective of this research is investigation on flexural behavior of <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> with steel fibre concrete topping. The parameter investigated includes steel fibre volume fraction and surface condition between old and new concrete. A series of 108 specimens (cube, cylinder and prism), without and with three different steel fibre volumes were investigated by ratio of 0. 7 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % to determine the optimum percentage volume of steel fibre in application to reinforced concrete topping. To reinforce the concrete overlay, hooked-end steel fibres was used; length of 30 mm and diameter of 0. 75 mm. These slabs have three different surface textures between the substrate and concrete topping which include smooth as-cast and roughened in both longitudinal and transverse direction. The results show good reliability on using SRFC as concrete topping replacing the conventional construction method. The highest bond strength was achieved with roughening the top substrate in transverse direction which can sustain 2. 5 times more moment compared with the calculated values...|$|E

The complex is 200m north of Blackwall DLR station, with its direct links to the City of London and separated by a bus terminus. It is within sight of the nearby Balfron Tower; both are highly visible examples of Brutalist architecture.|$|R
40|$|The shear {{capacity}} of headed studs in <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> hollow-core <b>slab</b> construction {{has been determined}} experimentally in 12 full-scale push-off tests. The tests were used to {{study the effects of}} the size of the gap between the ends of the precast slabs, and the amount of tie steel placed transversely across the joint, and the strength of concrete infill. Under certain situations the {{capacity of}} the stud is reduced compared with that in a solid reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> Maximum resistances are compared with the predictions of BS 5950 and EC 4, and a reduction formula for the precast effect is derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{prestressed}} concrete (PC) stress ribbon footbridge {{is a type}} of suspension bridge without towers, which has been applied in Japan and all over the world for years in light of its low construction cost and aesthetic merit. It generally consists of the <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> with embedded cables. However, the walking-induced lateral vibration trouble of the Millennium Bridge in London in 2000 gave a lesson to the engineers that the lateral vibration feature must be taken into consideration for the footbridge vibration evaluation. In this sense, the field investigations on the lateral vibration features of 14 pre-stressed concrete stress ribbon footbridge in Japan was carried out by artificial impact and damping free vibration tests. According to the investigations, the larger the bridge span, the lower the frequencies of lateral-related vibration modes. In addition, based on the damping-free vibration field tests, there was a tendency toward the damping constant degradation when bridge span became larger...|$|R
