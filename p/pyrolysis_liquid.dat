40|$|Fast {{pyrolysis}} {{of biomass}} is a significant technology for producing pyrolysis liquids [also known as bio-oil], which contain a number of chemicals. The <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> {{can be used as}} a fuel, can be produced solely as a source of chemicals or can have some of the chemicals extracted and the residue used as a fuel. There were two primary objectives of this work. The first was to determine the fast pyrolysis conditions required to maximise the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> yield from a number of biomass feedstocks. The second objective was to selectively increase the yield of certain chemicals in the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> by pre-treatment of the feedstock prior to pyrolysis. For a particular biomass feedstock the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> yield is affected by the reactor process parameters. It has been found that, providing the other process parameters are restricted to the values shown below, reactor temperature is the controlling parameter. The maximum <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> yield and the temperature at which it occurs has been found by a series of pyrolysis experiments over the temperature range 400 - 600 °C. high heating rates > 1000 °C/s; pyrolysis vapour residence times 400 but < 500 °C; rapid quenching of the product vapours. Pre-treatment techniques have been devised to modify the chemical composition and/or structure of the biomass in such a way as to influence the chemical composition of the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> product. The pre-treatments were divided into two groups, those that remove material from the biomass and those which add material to the biomass. Component removal techniques have selectively increased the yield of levoglucosan from 2. 45 to 18. 58 mf wt. % [dry feedstock basis]. Additive techniques have selectively increased the yield of hydroxyacetaldehyde from 7. 26 to 11. 63 mf w. % [dry feedstock basis]. Techno-economic assessment has been carried out on an integrated levoglucosan production process [incorporating pre-treatment, pyrolysis and chemical extraction stages] to assess which method of chemical production is the more cost effective. It has been found that it is better to pre-treat the biomass in order to increase the yield of specific chemicals in the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> and hence improve subsequent chemicals extraction...|$|E

This is an exploratory evaluation {{of the potential for}} recovering renewable fuels from the EFB via fast pyrolysis. Preliminary studies were done on the characteristics of the empty fruit bunches, and the thermal behaviours using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were included as well. For the fast pyrolysis experimentation, a 150 g/h fluidized bed bench scale unit was used to study the effect of reaction temperature and vapour residence time on the pyrolysis products. Reaction temperatures studied were from 400 to 600 ºC. It was found that the maximum organics liquid yield was at a reactor temperature of 450 ºC.

In this study, we characterized <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> and solid residues of waste wood-based composites such as particle board (PB) and medium density fiberboard (MDF). The study focuses mainly on the evolution of nitrogen compounds. Thermogravimetric analysis helped us to determine the optimum pyrolysis temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Archeological {{studies have}} found that <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> were already used in the time of the Neanderthal. Wood vinegar and other slow <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> are {{produced}} as a by-product of charcoal production. However, future business ideas may be the other way round as <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> may replace synthetic chemicals in the form of pesticides and biocides. Directives and regulations related to the sustainable use of pesticides govern and direct plant protection strategies towards a lower use of synthetic chemicals. It is hoped that many mega trends of global policies will boost the use of plant based products given that a reduced reliance on fossil fuel is a general target in the global food and feed production economy. Pyrolysis technology has been actively studied and developed around the world and is linked {{to the development of the}} knowledge based bio-economy. The importance and social impact of pyrolysis technologies will also be enhanced because it is a practicable technique in the sustainable use of wastes and biomasses. However, very little scientific evi-dence is available to support efficacy claims of wood vinegar and toxicology assessments of the products used. Wood tar has been investigated a bit more thoroughly. The aim of this review was to clarify the potential of slow <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> in agricultural use, in particular, in pesticide applications.

40|$|A techno-economic {{analysis}} of mild catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of woody biomass followed by upgrading of the partially deoxygenated <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> is performed to assess this pathway’s economic feasibility {{for the production}} of hydrocarbon-based biofuels. The process achieves a fuel yield of 17. 7 wt% and an energy conversion of 39 %. Deoxygenation of the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> requires 2. 7 wt% hydrogen while saturation of aromatic rings in the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> increases total hydrogen consumption to 6. 4 wt%. Total project investment is $ 457 million with annual operating costs of $ 142 million for a 2000 metric ton per day facility. A minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $ 3. 69 /gal is estimated assuming 10 % internal rate of return. Twenty-nine percent of the capital outlay is the result of including a co-generation system to consume heat generated from burning part of the off-gases from pyrolysis and upgrading and all of the coke during regeneration of catalysts. Forty-five percent of the MFSP arises from the cost of biomass feedstock. Hydrogen required for the upgrading process is generated using the balance of the process off-gases. The analysis reveals that an optimum design would include a cogeneration unit; however using natural gas for hydrogen generation is more favorable than using process off-gases as the feed.

The product, <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids,</b> can either substitute {{heavy fuel oil}} directly, or be upgraded via e. g. hydroprocessing to diesel and petrol. This study presents a systematic evaluation of production costs and CO 2 mitigation potentials of different fast pyrolysis value chain configurations. The evaluation considers types of localisations, emissions from electricity and hydrogen production, biomass feedstocks, and final products. The resulting production costs {{were found to be}} in the range of 36 – 60 EUR/MWh for crude <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids,</b> and 61 – 90 EUR/MWh upgraded to diesel and petrol. Industrial integration was found to be favoured. The CO 2 mitigation potential for the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> was in the range of 187 – 282 t-CO 2 /GWh biomass. High variations were found when upgraded to diesel and petrol –best-case scenario resulted in a mitigation of 347 t-CO 2 /GWh biomass, while worst-case scenarios resulted in net CO 2 emissions. Favourable policy support, continued technology development, and/or increased fossil fuel prices are required for the technology to be adapted on an industrial scale.

40|$|Hydrogen can be {{obtained}} from biomass <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> by catalytic steam reforming. Catalyst deactivation by coking and the formation of carbon deposits are the major known limitations although the specific causes are unidentified. It is proposed that these limitations could be reduced by selectively reforming specific fractions of the bio-oil. The hydrophobic fraction mainly composed of heavy oligomers can be separated by water extraction as a high-value product. In the current work, the particular interest is on efficient hydrogen production from the residual aqueous fractions. There are certain challenges introduced due to the complexity of these mixtures. An improved understanding of the underlying steam reforming characteristics of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> compounds will provide the opportunity to predict hydrogen yields and to potentially identify undesired compounds. Different fractions were studied to determine which ones can be used more efficiently to produce hydrogen with existing steam reforming technologies. A fractionating condenser system was used to collect different fractions of fast <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids.</b> The hydrophilic components from the different fractions were analyzed and steam reformed using a nickel-based commercial catalyst loaded fixed bed reactor. First it was found that bio-oil injection into this kind of reactors is an issue since there has to be quick and effective contact of the bio-oil with the catalyst and avoiding preheating of the oils. When reforming at 500 yC, an overall positive effect in hydrogen yields was observed for the fractions with higher concentrations of lower molecular weight oxygenated compounds like acetic acid and acetol while the effect heavier compounds may be detrimental. Higher selectivity towards hydrogen suggests less selectivity towards carbon deposits. Mostly the samples that contained the heavier compounds also contained less of the light compounds so that their individual effects need to be deconvoluted. The coking phenomena needs to be further studied to find the species and reaction conditions that promote its deposition. It was found that the changes caused by aging effect of aqueous bio-oil had a detrimental effect in hydrogen production but the causes are not well understood. Also seemingly insignificant traces of potential catalyst poisons found in bio-oils can irreversibly deactivate the nickel reforming catalyst difficulting their study...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use {{of fossil}} carbon sources for fuels and {{petrochemicals}} has serious impacts on our environment and {{is unable to}} meet the demand in the future. A promising and sustainable alternative is to substitute fossil carbon sources with microbial cell factories converting lignocellulosic biomass into desirable value added products. However, such bioprocesses require tolerance to inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment of biomass. In this study, the process of sequential two-step bio-conversion of biomass <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> containing levoglucosan (LG) to citric acid without chemical detoxification has been explored, which can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass. Results: The sequential two-step bio-conversion of corn stover <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> to citric acid has been established. The first step conversion by Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium) is desirable to decrease the content of other compounds except levoglucosan as a pretreatment for the second conversion. The remaining levoglucosan in solution was further converted into citric acid by Aspergillus niger (A. niger) CBX- 209. Thus the conversion of cellulose to citric acid is completed by both pyrolysis and bio-conversion technology. Under experimental conditions, levoglucosan yield is 12 % based on the feedstock and the citric acid yield can reach 82. 1 % based on the levoglucosan content in the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> (namely 82. 1 g of citric acid per 100 g of levoglucosan). Conclusion: The study shows that P. chrysosporium and A. niger have the potential to be used as production platforms for value-added products from pyrolyzed lignocellulosic biomass. Selected P. chrysosporium is able to decrease the content of other compounds except levoglucosan and levoglucosan can be further converted into citric acid in the residual liquids by A. niger.

Herein the content of acetol can be concentrated from below 4 % in the raw wood vinegar to above 60 %, and the number of main components reduce from over 20 to 5, while the yield of acetol is still rather low. It was found that in the organic solution distillation process, acetol can be easily concentrated from 1 % to above 40 %, while a further distillation of the concentrated acetol system was rather hard.

These resins are primarily employed {{in the manufacture of}} wood panels such as plywood, MDF, particle-board and OSB. The most important thermal conversion methods for this purpose are fast pyrolysis and vacuum pyrolysis, pressure liquefaction and phenolysis. Many feedstocks have been tested for their suitability as sources of phenolics including hard and softwoods, bark and residual lignins. Resins have been prepared utilising either the whole liquid product, or a phenolics enriched fraction obtained after fractional condensation or further processing, such as solvent extraction. None of the phenolics production and fractionation techniques covered in this review are believed to allow substitution of 100 % of the phenol content of the resin without impacting its effectiveness compared to commercial formulations based on petroleum derived phenol.

The analytical results of the 475 oC liquids showed that the tire-derived liquids are a complex mixture of C 5 –C 16 organic compounds, {{with a lot of}} high value light hydrocarbon limonene, single ring alkyl-aromatics and long-chain hydrocarbons. The present research result shows a better solution for energy and environment. Index Terms — Energy, environment, management of scra...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicrocellular Si-SiC porous {{ceramics}} {{were prepared}} from rigid foams derived from tannin-based natural resins. Such natural foams were used either as such, i. e. in the ``green'' state, or after conversion at 900 degrees C into vitreous cellular carbon foams. Various preparation methods were tested: replica with preceramic polymers followed by <b>pyrolysis,</b> <b>liquid</b> silicon infiltration (LSI) and vapour silicon infiltration (VSI). Depending on the method, very different materials have been obtained, whose morphology and microstructure {{have been investigated}} by SEM, XRD and Raman, whereas oxidation resistance has been evaluated by weight loss measurements in dry air at high temperature. The resulting porous ceramics' properties were discussed {{in relation to the}} preparation methods and their morphology and conversion of tannin-based foams into SiC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pyrolysis {{is one of}} {{promising}} disposal outlets for sewage sludge. The behavior of heavy metal ions is always paid attended to in the solid sludge and char during sludge pyrolysis process. Here, the distribution of metals in the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> and its distilling products was analyzed. It {{was found that the}} high content of Al and Ca do not appear in the pyrolysis oil and only about 10 % of total metals come into the liquid during sludge pyrolysis. Through comparing of the metal content of pyrolysis oil and its process products, it is inferred that distillation is a feasible method for desalt from pyrolysis oil. During distillation, most metals are enriched in the residue. The pyrolysis oil and its products must be desalted deeply if they want to use in engine...|$|E
30|$|Also, bio-oil can be {{produced}} by heating biomass under controlled conditions using specific equipment, obtaining a mixture of several different molecules of high-added value [80],[81]. Crude bio-oil is dark brown, with a composition that varies according to the biomass used. Although coined as oil, the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquid</b> does not mix with other liquid hydrocarbons due to its high oxygen content. In order to upgrade bio-oil to usual fuel such as gasoline and diesel, the samples need to be deoxygenated [51],[65]. Several different biomasses have been tested for bio-oil production. There is an uncomplicated commercial process for bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis operating in Brazil, named Bioware, and which {{has the support of}} the University of Campinas. The operating pilot facility has a nominal capacity of 300  kg h− 1, and was built to produce bio-oil from elephant grass and sugarcane for industrial applications [51].|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present work aims {{to perform}} a {{characterization}} of chars obtained in the co-pyrolysis of waste mixtures composed by plastics, tires and pine biomass, to provide knowledge about the composition, leaching behavior and risk assessment of these materials in order to define strategies for their possible valorization or safe disposal. The chars were submitted to sequential solvent extractions with organic solvents of increasing polarity that allow the recovery of significant amounts of the pyrolysis oils trapped in the crude chars improving the yield of the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids.</b> An acidic demineralization procedure was successfully applied to the chars and high efficiency removals {{of the majority of}} the heavy metals were achieved. The demineralization study also demonstrated that hazardous heavy metals such as chromium, nickel and cadmium are significantly immobilized in the char matrix, and other heavy metals of concern such as zinc and lead will not represent a leaching problem if acidic conditions were not used. The obtained chars present sufficient quality and characteristics to be used as fuel or alternatively, to be used as adsorbents or precursors of activated carbon...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{technological}} and economic limits wood-chip based heating systems typically operate as baseload units, leaving peak load and backup heat production to fossil fuel boilers. The techno-economic feasibility {{of greenhouse gas}} mitigation with SNG (Synthetic Natural Gas) and FPL (Fast <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>Liquids</b> or <b>Pyrolysis</b> Oil) wood based biofuels are examined in this study. Both fuels are feasible but SNG does not meet current natural gas quality standards but the matter is more regulatory than technical and FPL would require significant new infrastructure. The cost of SNG production varies from $ 10. 72 to $ 56. 29 per GJ (Gigajoule), depending on technology and wood costs. FPL production costs range from $ 17. 40 to $ 24. 66 per GJ. Emissions mitigation costs range from $ 155 to $ 1052 per tonne CO~'' (carbon dioxide). SNG being most viable due to fewer civil works required at the district heating plant. Larger-scale systems are most viable with costs. [...] leaf i. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of steam reforming of the aqueous species in bio-oils produced from the fast pyrolysis of biomass is examined. A fractionating condenser system {{was used to}} collect a set of fractions of fast <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>liquids</b> with different chemical characteristics. The water-soluble components from the different fractions were steam-reformed using a nickel-based commercial catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor system. When reforming at 500 Â°C, an overall positive effect in hydrogen yields was observed for the fractions with higher concentrations of lower molecular-weight oxygenates, such as acetic acid and acetol, while the heavier compounds, such as the carbohydrates, showed an opposite effect. In general, higher selectivity toward hydrogen correlated to a lower tendency toward carbon deposits. Overall, the bio-oil fraction corresponding to the light end performed the best with the highest activity toward hydrogen. A range of steam/carbon ratios was examined. Carbon accumulation in the reactor was clearly a main issue during steam reforming {{of all of the}} bio-oil fractions studied. Chemical changes caused by aging of aqueous bio-oil were found to have a detrimental effect on hydrogen production...|$|R
