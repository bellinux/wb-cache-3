5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and <b>power</b> <b>relations</b> in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> in qualitative research {{and especially the}} importance of taking into consideration the problematic aspects of the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> when executing the final interpretation of qualitative research. The methodology literature examines the unequal <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> in qualitative research by focusing on how society has become an interview society and {{on the lack of}} equality in interviews. Although the literature recommends being aware of asymmetry between research participants, it fails to look at how to address the final interpretation of qualitative research if the interpretation also takes the unequal <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> into account. Consequently, interpreting the researched in a respectful manner is difficult. This article demonstrates the necessity of increasing awareness of the unequal <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> by posing, discussing and, to some extent answering, three methodological questions inspired by meta-theory that are significant for qualitative research and qualitative researchers to reflect on. This article concludes that respectful interpretation and consciously paying attention to the unequal <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> in the final interpretation require decentring the subject, dissociating from the ideal of intersubjectivity, being descriptive instead of normative, accepting the unconquerable distance between the researcher and the researched and looking at the entire research process and analyses as an undeniable coproduction and interpretation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I explore why China’s labor share {{measured}} by the conventional approach experienced a major decline over the period from the mid- 1990 s to {{the outbreak of the}} global financial and economic crisis in 2008. I adopt a Marxian approach to address this question. Following the Marxian approach, I focus on how the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> in the sphere of production affects labor’s share. I argue that major changes in the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> that took place during the transition of China’s economic system have {{played a crucial role in}} the changes of distribution. To this end, I build homogenous series of labor’s share {{measured by the}} Marxian approach. This measure changes following an inverse-U shape over the reform era. Further, I analyze the relationship between labor’s share measured by the conventional approach and that measured by the Marxian approach with the cointegration method, which shows that there is a long-run relationship between them. I divide the reform era into two stages according to the Marxian measure. I find that, in the first stage (from 1978 to the early 1990 s), resulting from the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> between the state, cadres and workers, labor’s share continuously increased, which led to recurrent inflation and squeezed profits. In the second stage (from the mid- 1990 s to 2008), the state launched a series of reforms to resolve these problems, resulting in the commodification of labor power and the division between cadres and workers, which repressed the power of workers and caused labor’s share to decline. Based on the historical analysis of the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> during the transition process, I provide an econometric analysis of the determinants of labor’s share measured by the conventional approach over the reform era, using region-level data. I find that there is a U-shaped relationship between the bonus-wage ratio and labor’s share in the first stage; also, variables that reflect the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> (reserve army effect, fallback position, and management-worker inequality) in the second stage have significant effects on labor’s share. Both macro and micro evidences support that the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> is a crucial factor in the determination of labor’s share...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{available}} documentation, and the multiple oral testimonies collected for this thesis agree {{that the most important}} changes that have occurred in Keiskammahoek district over the past half century resulted from the implementation of the government's conservationist policy known as betterment. The work is thus dominated by a wideranging look at betterment in Keiskammahoek The thesis is arranged chronologically, and each of the successive periods designated is analysed in terms of power. The first period considered is c. 1920 -c. 1936; this was the time during which betterment policy was conceived. The key question that is posed here is why the policy was formed. Foucault's idea of power/knowledge features prominently in answering this question. For all of the remaining periods a conspicuously,important <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> (unequal relationship) is chosen, and the analyses consist of plotting the histories of the various relations. The first of these periods is that which preceded the implementation of betterment in the district, i. e. c. 1936 - 1960. Since multi-form resistance against betterment characterised this period, the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> considered is that {{between the state and the}} various communities of Keiskammahoek. Next, attention is given to the actual implementation of betterment in the district. Because betterment affected locations in which land was held communally so differently from locations in which land was held under title, these two categories of location are analysed separately. In communal locations, a <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> spawned by betterment that has come to dominate life is that between village neighbours. In the other category of location, betterment has often further differentiated the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> between title-deed holders and non title-deed holders. The thesis is not exclusively devoted to betterment. The 1970 s saw many people being forcibly removed to Keiskammahoek. The final section of the work examines these events in relation to the changing economy of South Africa. In this section the <b>power</b> <b>relation</b> that is deemed important is that between the employed and unemployed The overall aim of the thesis then is to give an indication of the variety of forms or configurations of power that run through modernday Keiskammahoek...|$|R

Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's <b>power</b> <b>relations</b> and political dynamics.
