40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} exchange rate pass-through into prices changed when the inflation targeting scheme was adopted in Peru. Firstly, a small dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is simulated, which shows that adopting this scheme induces an increase in exchange rate volatility. Furthermore, applying {{the theory of the}} currency denomination of international trade, it is demonstrated that increased exchange rate volatility reduces the share of firms that set their prices in foreign currency (dollars). Given that the pass-though has a direct relationship with this share, it is shown that adopting inflation targeting generates a pass-through contraction. Secondly, we empirically test whether the Peruvian Central Bank’s decision to adopt inflation targeting in January 2002 actually had an effect on the pass-through estimating a time-varying vector autoregressive model which allows for an asymmetrical estimation of the pass-through. It provides parameters for both the pre and <b>post</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting regimes {{based on the assumption that}} the transition from one regime to the other is smooth.

40|$|The {{appropriateness}} of inflation targeting in South Africa is examined. South Africa has adopted flexible inflation targeting, wherein considerations for other macroeconomic variables are prioritized. There {{is evidence of}} growing concern regarding South Africa’s monetary policy framework., emerging primarily from the trade union movement and the communist party. The concerns are borne out of the developmental challenges that are still facing South Africa, ranging from high unemployment, high levels of poverty and inequality, and low economic growth. In attempt to understand these concerns, the following key economic variables GDP, Manufacturing Data, Exchange Rate, and Repo Rate were investigated using both Eviews and Stat tool. To eliminate {{the impact of the}} recent global recession, the data that has been analyzed is up to 2008. The research compares two periods, namely; the pre inflation targeting period (1990 – 1999) and <b>post</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting period (2000 – 2008). The study has found that despite unemployment, inequality and economic growth having being sluggish over the years, these factors are not as a result of inflation targeting. Evidence indicates that inflation has been reduced and stabilized since the adoption of inflation targeting. This research argues that this methodology is important for South Africa’s economic development, as evident by increased output. This research concludes that the implementation of inflation targeting is appropriate for South Africa. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Models of inflationary magnetogenesis with a {{coupling}} to the electromagnetic {{action of the}} form f^ 2 F_μνF^μν, are known to suffer from several problems. These include the strong coupling problem, the back reaction problem and also strong constraints due to Schwinger effect. We propose a model which resolves all these issues. In our model, the coupling function, f, grows during inflation and transits to a decaying phase <b>post</b> <b>inflation.</b> This evolutionary behaviour is chosen {{so as to avoid}} the problem of strong coupling. By assuming a suitable power law form of the coupling function, we can also neglect back reaction effects during inflation. To avoid back reaction post-inflation, we find that the reheating temperature is restricted to be below ≈ 1. 7 × 10 ^ 4 GeV. The magnetic energy spectrum is predicted to be non-helical and generically blue. The estimated present day magnetic field strength and the corresponding coherence length taking reheating at the QCD epoch(150 MeV) are 1. 4 × 10 ^- 12 G and 6. 1 × 10 ^- 4 Mpc, respectively. This is obtained after taking account of nonlinear processing over and above the flux freezing evolution after reheating. If we consider also the possibility of a non-helical inverse cascade, as indicated in direct numerical simulations, the coherence length and the magnetic field strength are even larger. In all cases mentioned above, the magnetic fields generated in our models satisfy the γ-ray bound below a certain reheating temperature. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, Published in PR...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} for triggering the universe inflation {{could be that}} at very early periods the time variable was discrete instead of smooth. Alternatively, and perhaps equivalently, {{it could be the}} consequence that the metrics of the early universe was a strongly concentrated gravitational coherent state with very high frequency oscillations, allowing local pair creations by a generalisation to gravity of the Schwinger mechanism, perhaps by creation of black holes of masses superior to the Planck scale. The lattice spacing between two clicks in the discrete time picture corresponds to the inverse frequency of the gravitational coherent state in the other picture. In both cases, a much lower time than the Planck time might represent a new fundamental scale, giving new type of physics. To make possible a concrete estimation of the pair production probability, we propose that the oscillating coherent state metrics that defines this very early geometry minimises the Einstein gravity action coupled to interacting 1 -, 2 - and 3 -forms. Part of our intuition relies on a condensed matter analogy with laser-induced superconductivity. An independent section suggests that the new physical time scale we introduce for the Markovian discret time of the pre-inflation epoch can be identified with the stochastic time one uses for standard quantisation in the post-inflation limit. In the pre-inflation phase its discreteness is the observable driving force for the universe evolution, while in the <b>post</b> <b>inflation</b> phase it becomes unobservable and it can can effectively replaced by the continuous time coordinate of standard quantum field theory.

Here we analyze the {{displacement}} around Grimsvötn during these last three eruptive cycles using 10 GPS stations. The observed displacements in this region generally contain a linear component of tectonic and glacio-isostatic origin, {{in agreement with the}} previously estimated values of plate motions and vertical rebound. Larger amplitude deformation observed close to Grimsvötn at the GFUM continuous GPS station clearly reflects a major volcanic contribution superimposed on a tectonic component. We estimate and subtract the tectonic trend at this station using regional observed displacement. The direction and pattern of the residual volcanic displacement (for coeruptive and intereruptive periods) are consistent for all three of these eruptive cycles. The <b>post</b> eruptive <b>inflation</b> is characterized by an exponential trend, followed by a linear trend. In this study, we explain this temporal behavior using a new analytic model that has two connected magma chambers surrounded by an elastic medium and fed by a constant basal magma inflow. During the early post eruptive phase, pressure readjustment occurs between the two reservoirs, with replenishment of the shallow chamber from the deep chamber. Afterward, due to the constant inflow of magma into the deep reservoir, the pressurization of the system produces linear uplift. A large deep reservoir favors magma storage rather than surface emission. Based on displacement measured at GFUM station, we estimate an upper limit for the radius of the deep reservoir of ∼ 10 km...|$|R

Patients and methodsOur study is retrospective including 619 patients undergoing percutaneous angioplasty by 769 eluding stents during the period between juillet 2003 and June 2009. ResultsThe mean age was 63, 25 years and most patients were men (80, 7 %). The majority of patients (61, 6 %) were diabetic. Most patients (46, 3 %) had multivessel disease. Coronary lesion sites were located mainly on the left descending coronary artery at 71, 4 %. The mean diameter stent was 2, 93 ± 0, 37 mm, and the mean length was 26, 95 ± 6, 91 mm. Coronary lesion was in the most time long (in 43, 1 %). We used Taxus stents in 81, 4 % of cases. The stenting was direct in 72, 1 % of procedures, and after dilatation in 22 procedures%. A <b>post</b> <b>inflation</b> was achieved in 11, 3 % of procedures. The mean of pression inflation was 14, 29 mmhg. The angiographic success was noted in 100 %.

40|$|We {{explore the}} role of {{inflation}} credibility in self-fulfilling debt crises. In particular, we propose a continuous time model of nominal debt {{with the potential for}} selffulfilling debt crises as in Calvo (1988) and Cole and Kehoe (2000). We characterize crisis equilibria conditional on the level of commitment to low inflation. With strong commitment, which can be interpreted as joining a monetary union or issuing foreign currency debt, the environment is a version of the one studied by Cole and Kehoe. The paper contrasts this framework with one in which sovereign debt is nominal and is vulnerable to ex <b>post</b> devaluation. <b>Inflation</b> is costly, but reduces the real value of outstanding debt without the full punishment of default. In a debt crisis, a government may opt to inflate away a fraction of the real debt burden rather than explicitly default. This flexibility potentially reduces the country’s exposure to self-fulfilling crises. On the other hand, the government lacks commitment not to inflate in the absence of crisis. This latter channel raises the cost of debt in tranquil periods and makes default more attractive {{in the event of a}} crisis, increasing the country’s vulnerability. We characterize the interaction of these two forces. We show that there is an intermediate level of commitment that minimizes the country’s exposure to rollover risk. On the other hand, low inflation credibility brings the worst of both worlds – high inflation in tranquil periods and increased vulnerability to a crisis. Weak inflationary commitment also reduces the country’s equilibrium borrowing limit. These latter results shed light on the notions of original sin and debt intolerance highlighted in the empirical literature; that is, the fact that developing economies issue debt exclusive in foreign currency to international investors as well as encounter solvency issues at relatively low ratios of debt-to-GDP.

Sophisticated analyses that explicitly model correlation rather than consider it a nuisance, like mixed effects and state-space models, offer potentially novel insights into the process of resource selection, but additional work is needed to make them more generally applicable to large datasets based on the use–availability designs.

40|$|Introduction: Elevated {{blood levels}} of Cardiac Troponin (cTnT) are the gold {{standard}} for diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However cTnT is not detectable for 3 - 4 hours after symptom onset; an early marker of myocardial ischaemia is therefore desirable. The peptide Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) is released from nerve endings during myocardial ischaemia and has cardioprotective effects. Intermedin (IMD), from the same family, is elevated in myocardial infarction and oxidative stress in animal studies. Methods: I enrolled 81 patients with chest pain, suspected to have acute coronary syndrome to a chest pain study (1). Samples were taken on admission, at 12 hours after pain, the next day and the following day. Samples were analysed for intermedin, & CGRP (radioimmunoassay) and High-Sensitivity troponin (HsTnT). Study 2 assessed 30 patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI) with 6 controls. Samples taken, pre, 1, 5, 10, 30, 120 or 240 minutes <b>post</b> balloon <b>inflation</b> and next day. Results: Study 1 - Intermedin showed a non-significant trend towards elevation in ACS patients. In those patients who were (cTnT) negative « 0. 03 ng/ml) on presentation, IMD & CGRP were significantly elevated. CGRP was significantly elevated at 12 hours after ACS onset and appeared to remain elevated for 48 hours. HsTnT identified more ACS on an admission sample than cTnT. Study 2 - IMD showed a small but significant rise at ten minutes after balloon inflation. HsTnT was significantly elevated the next day following PC!. Neither marker was related to number of stents/inflations, balloon pressure or length of inflation. Conclusions: The novel peptide IMD is elevated in ischaemia and infarction, but the rise is too small to be clinically useful. CGRP had a significant rise in ACS patients, but again of a small magnitude. The time course of their elevation is incompletely defined. HsTnT is more sensitive in ACS than cTnT on a presenting blood sample. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{comparisons}} with Germany and Switzerland {{as well as}} an analysis of the time pattern of sub-indices of the Consumer Price Index do not indicate that the introduction of the euro had strong inflationary impact. In some sectors, however, there were price increases which {{may be related to the}} adoption of the new currency. One sector which attracted a lot of public attention was cafés and restaurants. In contrast to Germany (and other countries of the euro area), in Austria the turn of the year 2001 - 02 was not used to raise prices. It was not until June 2002 that price increases were implemented which can be interpreted as lagged effects of the euro cash changeover. As far as other service prices are concerned, the development in Austria deviates only marginally from that in the euro area. Prices of hairdressing, car repairs and plumbing were raised more than usual. The inflation rates of individual service prices, however, exceeded the mark of 5 percent in only a few instances. Prices of non-energy industrial goods posted only modest increases, with inflation rates well below those in Germany and in the euro area. A slight acceleration was, however, recorded in recent months. Consumer surveys suggest that consumers have perceived inflation as being higher than it has been in reality. A majority of consumers believes that the rise in inflation, which occurred in the period leading up to the introduction of the euro, was causally related to the adoption of the new currency. Part of the explanation for the divergence between actual and perceived inflation is that consumers attach a relatively large weight to price developments of items that are frequently purchased, while price developments of products less frequently purchased attract less attention. Indeed, prices of items frequently purchased, such as petrol, meat, vegetables and restaurant services <b>posted</b> high <b>inflation</b> rates in the second half of 2001 and at the beginning of 2002, while prices of other items (such as non-energy industrial goods, rents) recorded a stable development. Thus, it is likely that consumers formed an unrepresentative picture of overall price developments.

40|$|Besides the {{introduction}} and conclusion, this thesis {{is comprised of}} six independent chapters. In this thesis we provide an in-sample and out-of-sample assessment of how the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) sets its policy rate, <b>post</b> 2000 <b>inflation</b> targeting regime, {{in the context of}} both linear and nonlinear Taylor-type rule models of monetary policy. <p. Chapter 2 provides the theoretical foundations and the case study discussion. The literature has shown that the Taylor (1993) rule has gone through many modifications since {{the last decade of the}} 20 th century. The modifications of the Taylor rule include interest rate smoothing, backward and forward looking versions, and nonlinear approximations. Furthermore, there has been increasing debate on whether central banks should respond to asset prices and financial variables. Despite some disagreements, economists seem to agree on the role of the financial market in determining inflation and economic performance. As far as South Africa is concerned, a stable financial system is one of the mandates of the central bank. Chapter 3 discusses the research methods used in the thesis. First, the chapter provides an overview on the Hodrick-Prescott Filter used to detrend some series. Second, more focus is oriented on a class of estimators, used in this thesis, called Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators. GMM is important in that it can be applied to several estimation contexts besides the linear model. In fact, GMM can provide a simple alternative to other estimators, especially when it is difficult to write down the maximum likelihood estimator. Chapter 4 is aimed to provide the source of data, to show the transformation made to some of them and to explore the data for preliminary results. The Augmented Dickey- Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP), GLS transformed Dickey-Fuller (DFGLS) and Kwiatkowski, et. Al. (KPSS) tests suggest that all the series follow a stationary process. The chapter also reveals that the financial conditions index measured as an equal weight average of its components yields a smallest AIC than other alternative suggested herein. Furthermore, the chapter shows that the models that consider coincident business cycle indicator, rather than industrial production, perform better in terms of goodness of fit. Given the controversial debate on whether central banks should target asset prices for economic stability, chapter 5 investigates whether the SARB pays close attention to asset and financial markets in their policy decisions. The main findings are that the SARB policy-makers pay close attention to the financial conditions index when setting interest rate. In the same chapter, it is also found that nonlinear Taylor rule improves its performance with the advent of the financial crisis, providing the best description of insample SARB interest rate setting behaviour. The 2007 - 2009 financial crisis witnesses an overall increased reaction to inflation and financial conditions. In addition, the financial crisis saw a shift from output stabilisation to inflation targeting and a shift, from a symmetric policy response to financial conditions, to a more asymmetric response depending on the state of the economy. Although one could have expected that the SARB’s response of monetary policy to output during the crisis to increase, the response has dropped significantly. These results show the concern over the high level of inflation observed during the second semester of 2008. <p. In chapter 6, we test the concept of Opportunistic Approach to monetary policy. The findings support the two features of the opportunistic approach. First, we find that the models that include an intermediate target that reflects the recent history of inflation rather than a simple inflation target improve the fit of the models. Second, the data supports the view that the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) behaves with some degree of non-responsiveness when inflation is within the zone of discretion but react aggressively otherwise. Recursive estimates from the preferred model reveal that overall there has been a subdued reaction to inflation, output and financial conditions amidst the increased economic uncertainty of the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis. Chapter 7 compares forecast performance of linear and nonlinear monetary policy rules estimated in the two previous chapters but rewritten in their backward looking versions. Recursive forecasts values are computed for 1 - to 12 -step ahead for the out-of-sample period 2006 : 01 to 2010 : 12. For the nonlinear models we use bootstrap method for multi-step ahead forecasts as opposed to point forecasts approach used for linear models. The aim is to evaluate the performance of three competing models in an out of-sample forecasting exercise. Overall ranking reveals the superiority of the nonlinear model that distinguishes between downward and upward movements in the business cycles in closely matching the historical record. As such, forecasting performance tests reveal that the SARB pays particular attention to business cycles movements when setting its policy rate. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
