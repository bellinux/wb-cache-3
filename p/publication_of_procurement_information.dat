40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{accounts for about}} one-third of gross capital formation. Governments have major roles as clients, regulators, and owners of construction companies. The industry is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} most corrupt: large payments to gain or alter contracts and circumvent regulations are common. The impact of corruption goes beyond bribe payments to poor quality construction of infrastructure with low economic returns alongside low funding for maintenance-and this is where the major impact of corruption is felt. Regulation of the sector is necessary, but simplicity, transparency, enforcement, and a focus on the outcomes of poor construction are likely to have a larger impact than voluminous but poorly enforced regulation of theconstruction process. Where government is the client, attempts to counter corruption need to begin at the level of planning and budgeting. Output-based and community-driven approaches show some promise as tools to reduce corruption. At the same time they will need to be complimented by a range of other interventions including <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> documents, independent and community oversight, physical audit, and public-private anticorruption partnerships.

With this in mind the governments have set regulations for public <b>procurement.</b> <b>Procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Systems is especially challenging due to the complexity of procuring unknown technology and the importance an information system has for different stakeholders in an organization. Public <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> systems (IS) and services provides several challenges to the stakeholders involved in the procurement processes. However, these are not well established or understood, and there is a knowledge gap that needs to be covered. This paper presents results from a Delphi study, which involved 46 experienced <b>procurement</b> managers, chief <b>information</b> officers, and vendor representatives in the Norwegian public sector. The participants identified 98 challenges related to IS procurement, and subsequently ranked the relative importance of the top issues. The study supports findings from previous research related to diverging stakeholder goals; challenges in balancing between objectives; in requirement specifications; and in too narrow cost focus. In addition to providing empirical confirmation of these previous propositions the study revealed new findings, such as benefits realization in IS procurement; coordinating and standardizing public procurement processes; complex and constraining government regulations; issues of technological integration and compatibility; and inter-municipal cooperation. Developing clear requirements specifications stands out as critical for public sector officials. The results provide a rich overview <b>of</b> IS <b>procurement</b> challenges in the public sector in Norway, and may also give a good picture of challenges in other countries with similar procurement regulations.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 directed the President to {{set a goal of}} awarding not less than 23 percent of the federal government's prime contracting dollars to small business for each fiscal year. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is charged with working with federal agencies to ensure that agency goals, in the aggregate, meet or exceed the overall goal. To help SBA determine if agency goals are being met, the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC) [...] part of the General Services Administration [...] collects data on all federal contract actions and calculates the government's annual small business achievements on the basis <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>information</b> received from the agencies. This report reviews (1) SBA's process for establishing annual small business prime contract goals and the reasons for recent changes to the process; (2) the types of contracts that are excluded when achievements are calculated, as well as SBA's rationale for excluding them; and (3) the dollar value of the excluded contracts. GAO found that in fiscal year 2000, SBA began assigning goals directly to individual agencies because the goals that agencies proposed did not in the aggregate reach the mandated 23 -percent governmentwide goal. When calculating the percentage <b>of</b> federal <b>procurements</b> awarded to small businesses, FPDC must exclude (a) those contracts for which small businesses' chances to compete are limited or nonexistent, (b) those using non-appropriated funds, and (c) those made by agencies which are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation or are otherwise exempted by statute. The excluded contracts total about 10 percent <b>of</b> federal <b>procurement</b> dollars and are usually military contracts for foreign sales and contracts performed outside the United States. SBA's annual guidance is the only source of information to which federal agencies, the small business community, and Congress can turn for information on the contracts that are excluded from the small business baseline. However, the guidance is unclear and incomplete, precluding a clear picture of the universe of contracts reflected in FPDC's annual reports of small business achievements. ...|$|R

40|$|Working Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The United States, the EU, and {{virtually}} all European nations undertook solemn commitments to promote small business access to public procurement and R&D programs {{as part of the}} 2000 OECD Bologna Charter on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) Policies. Notwithstanding these mutual commitments, the Europeans have continued challenging America''s Small Business Act of 1953 and the set-asides it authorizes as unfair barriers to trade. Thus far, the United States has resisted the criticism. To put the transatlantic debate over small business contracting into concrete terms, this article compares European and US approaches to small business <b>procurement</b> assistance. Subjects <b>of</b> comparison include approaches to defining a small business concern; creation <b>of</b> small business <b>procurement</b> assistance agencies; availability of suitable contracts through reductions in bundling and consolidation; small business goals and set-asides; contracting with small firms for economic sustainability and remedial purposes; measures to enhance transparency and availability <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> <b>information</b> for small firms; small business subcontracting policies; and use <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> to stimulate innovation. The article notes that Europe is competing with the United States for best SME assistance policies. It concludes that the main elements of European and US policies to support SME access to public procurement and R&D are very similar and are continuing to further converge. Accordingly, EU trade complaints are without substantial merit. Indeed, both sides in this debate have legitimate reasons to help their small contractors, both sides have weaknesses in their SME policies, and both sides can learn from each other''s best practices.
