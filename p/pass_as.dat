5|$|Reporting to the {{training}} camp, Mulan is able to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> a man, although her military skills are initially inexperienced. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main Imperial Army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment and discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.|$|E
5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> an Indian.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Chatterton, {{whose father}} was sexton of St Mary Redcliffe, {{was born in the}} house next to the church in 1752. He studied the church records in a room above the south porch, and wrote several works which he {{attempted}} to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> genuine medieval documents. He committed suicide in London at the age of seventeen. In 1795 the church saw the marriages of Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Sara Fricker and Robert Southey to Sarah's sister Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Water-based {{recreation}} {{is available}} near the <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> well, {{particularly on the}} Roaring Fork side. At the Grottos climbing cliffs eight miles (14.4km) {{to the west of}} the pass, a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil's Punchbowl, with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls. It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters. The river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well, and some even make the hike from the pass up to Blue Lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks.|$|E

5|$|With the {{admission}} of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead <b>Pass,</b> <b>as</b> the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|After winning out a close {{competition}} with Jevan Snead, McCoy became the 2006 starting {{quarterback for the}} University of Texas. The season opener saw McCoy lead the Longhorns to a 56–7 victory over North Texas, throwing for three touchdowns and rushing a yard for another, while throwing no interceptions. He was 12-19 in passing, and ran for 27 yards to help set up a touchdown. In only his second <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> a college quarterback McCoy threw a 60-yard touchdown pass. He was the first Texas freshman quarterback to start and win a season-opening game since Bobby Layne in 1944. The next week, the Longhorns faced #1 Ohio State at home. McCoy went 19-32, 156 yards, one touchdown, and one interception while rushing four times {{for a total of}} eight yards. Ohio State defeated the Longhorns 24–7, ending the Longhorns 21-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|Born, raised, {{and educated}} in Los Angeles, Kemp {{was the third}} of four sons of Frances Elizabeth (née Pope) and Paul Robert Kemp Sr. Paul turned his {{motorcycle}} messenger service into a trucking company that grew from one to 14 trucks. Frances was a well-educated social worker and Spanish teacher. Kemp {{grew up in the}} heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles, but his tight-knit middle-class family attended the Church of Christ, Scientist. In his youth, sports consumed Kemp, who once chose the forward <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> the subject of a school essay on important inventions, although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, the Parthians {{were soon}} {{driven out of}} the Levant by a Roman counteroffensive. Publius Ventidius Bassus, an officer under Mark Antony, {{defeated}} and then executed Labienus at the Battle of the Cilician Gates (in modern Mersin Province, Turkey) in 39 BC. Shortly afterward, a Parthian force in Syria led by general Pharnapates was defeated by Ventidius at the Battle of Amanus <b>Pass.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Pacorus I temporarily withdrew from Syria. When he returned {{in the spring of}} 38BC, he faced Ventidius at the Battle of Mount Gindarus, northeast of Antioch. Pacorus was killed during the battle, and his forces retreated across the Euphrates. His death spurred a succession crisis in which Orodes II chose Phraates IV of Parthia (r. c.38–2BC) as his new heir.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas <b>Pass.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E

5|$|German forces {{reached the}} regimental {{positions}} on 12 April; the following day, {{their attempts to}} cross the river in assault boats were repulsed. During the evening, the regiment disengaged and fell back to Kolindros; it was attacked by German tanks and infantry on 14 April. Boys anti-tank rifles were useless against the German tanks, although Bren gun fire was effective against the German infantry. When its positions were flanked by tanks, the regiment retreated to Olympus Pass and was ordered to take up positions at Deskati <b>Pass</b> <b>as</b> a rearguard. The pass, a possible withdrawal route for the 1st Armoured Brigade, was reached on 15 April. On the 17th, division commander Major General Bernard Freyberg dispersed the regiment to screen the rear of his retreating troops. The next day, A and C Squadrons withdrew from Olympus Pass and Eleftherochorion after a German tank attack. B Squadron fought a rearguard action at Tempe, retreating down the Volos road and losing several carriers.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E
5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> a secular portrait.|$|E

5|$|The Steelers entered {{their first}} matchup with the Cleveland Browns having won 15 {{of the last}} 16games between the two teams. Ben Roethlisberger started the game despite missing {{practice}} time during the week due to a shoulder injury suffered in Week One. The Steelers' defense held the Browns to 16yards on their first four drives, as the teams played to a scoreless tie after the first quarter. After a Bryant McFadden interception the Steelers drove 70yards and Roethlisberger connected with Hines Ward for their third touchdown combination of the season. Cleveland responded with a 14play, 71yard drive, but Troy Polamalu intercepted a Cleveland <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> time expired {{in the first half}} solidifying Pittsburgh's seven point halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ends in the}} {{community}} of Greenwater, named for the river, where the roadway encounters Forest Road70, which has been proposed to become SR168 over Naches <b>Pass</b> <b>as</b> an alternative to the Chinook Scenic Byway. From Greenwater, the road travels south alongside the White River into Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, passing Ranger Creek State Airport, a state-owned airport that is open in the summer and early fall. The byway travels south into Mount Rainier National Park. SR 410 is closed at the gate to Morse Creek, about 5 miles east of the Chinook Pass Summit during the winter and early spring due to high wind, limited cell service and avalanche danger. It intersects SR123 at Cayuse Pass. SR410 turns east at the intersection and heads through a series of hairpin turns, passing Tipsoo Lake, to Chinook Pass.|$|E
5|$|The second Playford was {{something}} of a loner, but at the age of 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child. In order to avoid the social stigma of the situation, and on the advice of his parents, Playford enlisted in the British Army in 1810. While three years under the acceptable age, Playford's height (6ft 2 in) enabled him to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> eighteen. He spent 24 years {{in the service of the}} Life Guards, fighting all over Europe in Portugal, Spain and France, including the Battle of Waterloo at the age of 20.|$|E
