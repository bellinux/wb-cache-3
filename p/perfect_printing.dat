Richard March Hoe had invented the rotary press in 1843, but Bullock's press was an {{improvement}} over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|R

25|$|A plastic {{print is}} a {{friction}} ridge impression {{left in a}} material that retains {{the shape of the}} ridge detail. Although very few criminals would be careless enough to leave their prints in a lump of wet clay, this would make a <b>perfect</b> plastic <b>print.</b> Commonly encountered examples are melted candle wax, putty removed from the perimeter of window panes and thick grease deposits on car parts. Such prints are already visible and need no enhancement, but investigators must not overlook the potential that invisible latent prints deposited by accomplices may also be on such surfaces. After photographically recording such prints, attempts should be made to develop other non-plastic impressions deposited from sweat or other contaminants.|$|R
50|$|As in any analog process, every {{re-printing}} degrades the picture, {{just like}} a photocopy of a photocopy. Properly performed contact printing generally creates less degradation provided that the contact between the negative and the <b>print</b> film is <b>perfect.</b> Optical <b>printing</b> can emphasize the grain structure and any imperfections in the negative. Also, since a new, different piece of film was exposed and printed, matching the exact colors of the original was a problem. Usually the printer work was limited to only the parts of a dissolve needing the effect. The original footage was spliced mid-shot with the optically-printed portion, often resulting in an obvious change in image quality when the transition occurs.|$|R

5000|$|Continuity - The {{supervisor}} {{is responsible}} for working with all departments (camera, lighting, sound, wardrobe, make-up, properties and sets) {{to make sure that}} continuity errors do not happen. The script supervisor takes notes on all the details required to recreate the continuity of a particular scene, location, or action. For every take, the script supervisor will note the duration of the take (usually with a stopwatch) and meticulously log information into a daily editor log about the action of the take, including position of the main actor(s), screen direction of their movement, important actions performed during the shot, type of lens used, and additional information which may vary from case to case. When multiple cameras are in use, the script supervisor keeps separate notes on each. These logs also notate a director's comments on any particular take as to whether it is no good, a hold take (ok, but not <b>perfect),</b> or a <b>print</b> take (a good take). All of these notes are crucial not just for continuity - they provide the editor information on what the director prefers, any problems with any of the takes and other notes to assist the editing process.|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis is a {{study of}} the {{composition}} of three Modernist first editions: Ulysses (1922), The Making of Americans (1925) and A Draft of XXX Cantos (1930). The bibliographical and figurative commitments made to being in print by Ulysses, A Draft of XXX Cantos and The Making of Americans set a coherent program for reading Modernist texts in their <b>perfected</b> form: in <b>print.</b> The editorial reception of the Modernist book has proceeded, however, with reference to the editorial and bibliographical principles established by the New Bibliographers. In deferring to the authors and manuscripts of Modernist books as the highest source of textual authority, the vital significance of being in print to literary Modernism is obscured. The figure of the ideal Book concentrates the central aesthetic, intellectual and bibliographic problem posed the Modernist book: the making of literature. The rhyme with The Making of Americans is appropriate: this book intensifies and consolidates the propositions made about objective and autonomous composition made more hesitantly by Ulysses and A Draft of XXX Cantos. These three books display a gradual refusal to equate inscription and intention; their composition effaces all traces of a sovereign creative subjectivity. The vision of the book guides Modernist composition, and requires a critical distinction be drawn between manuscripts and printed letters. Modernism must be read in print. The vestigial nostalgia for Romantic modes of textual production and creation in Ulysses is repeated on the placards and proof-pages for the book. Printed drafts are revised and reformed by the pen of the author. The finality asserted by the printed letter is only reluctantly ceded on the publication of Ulysses. The composition of A Draft of XXX Cantos represents a further transition away from the script economy of Romanticism. The interplay between authorial typescripts, early publications and the first edition of A Draft of XXX Cantos assert an intermediate order of Modernist textuality which takes the printed page as its foundation. The Making of Americans relies on the absolute objectivity and anonymity of its composition for the effect of its narrative. Objectivity is the intellectual and aesthetic strategy which produces literature rather than the personality and memory of the author. The impersonality of the apparently automatically written manuscripts and scarcely revised typescripts for The Making of Americans severs the visible links between the writing author and her page. In their unwillingness to corroborate the modes of textual generation described by the New Bibliographers, these three books thematise their own composition as the exemplary Modernist and modern mode of textual generation. The Modernist book attenuates or denies a Romantic connection between the creative hand of the author and the surface image of the page: the mechanisms of print deliberately detach the author from the literary text. The distance of the author from the scene of textual reproduction is measured by the printed book. The composition of this analytical object is not a fallacy but an actuality, commemorated in the archive, enacted by the book. Modernism is the literature of the imprimatur rather than of authorial inscription and accordingly it is towards the first editions of Modernist texts that the attentions of editors and textual scholars must be directed...|$|R
