5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern <b>pumpkin</b> is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the <b>pumpkin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive <b>Pumpkin</b> bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a <b>Pumpkin</b> bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
