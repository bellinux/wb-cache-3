50|$|Banded rudderfish, Seriola zonata, is the second-smallest amberjack. This jack can be {{distinguished}} from the pilot fish {{by the presence of}} a first dorsal fin. Juveniles are banded vertically like <b>pilotfish,</b> and follow large objects or animals. Large individuals (over 10 inches) have no bands. This fish, though commonly caught, is rarely identified. Large ones, with a raccoon-stripe on the eye and an iridescent gold stripe on the side, are usually called amberjacks when caught, and juveniles are called <b>pilotfish.</b> They are found as far north as Nova Scotia. They are less dependent on sharks, etc., than <b>pilotfish.</b> They can be caught on shrimp, silversides, lures (e.g. spoons), and flies.|$|E

The age and growth parameters of this species were estimated by length frequency analysis and daily growth increments observed in the otoliths. To validate the daily formation of the ring observed in the sagittae otoliths, a marking otoliths experiment with SrCl 2 was carried out with juvenile specimens kept in laboratory conditions. The growth parameters obtained from otolith interpretation were based on age at length of 99 specimens ranging between 15 and 31. 2 cm FL. Length frequency analyses were based on the monthly length distribution obtained in 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1996. The results obtained from the two methods were similar and showed rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation from otoliths was FL= 28. 97 (1 -e (- 6. 87 (t - 0. 055)).

40|$|The use {{of mobile}} {{computing}} within {{in the construction}} industry is an emerging field within informatics and software engineering research. This thesis presents a system design of an application server, which is thought to act as a gateway between existing information systems and mobile devices used within in a construction industry context and especially on a construction site. The purpose of the project was to investigate how a mobile application server should be designed. The system design focuses on aspects like integration with existing information systems, synchronization matters, vendor independence, platform independence and generic support for existing and future mobile clients. Today, {{there are a number of}} existing and emerging technologies to choose from when designing new IT artefacts. In this project the Java 2 Enterprise Edition framework and various XML frameworks, have been applied. The mobile applications server is based on an application server following the J 2 EE specification. Besides the above mentioned technologies the Aptus telematics platform from <b>Pilotfish,</b> which incorporates telematic functionality in the system design in the form of machine connectivity have been used. The results are presented in the form of a general design, which is vendor independent, with regard to software components and third party frameworks, and a specified design containing various products found relevant for a future implementation. The specified design is platform independent since all of the components used are pure java software. Since the work has been design oriented the main research approach has been to apply evolutionary prototyping methods, design patterns and software engineering best practice. Besides the general and the specified design the results also includes some prototype applications implemented on a Compaq iPAQ running SavaJe OS, which provides a fast J 2 SE compliant runtime environment.
