40|$|An {{affine space}} A 3 {{is called a}} double {{isotropic}} space I 3 (2), if in A 3 a metric is induced by an absolute, f, F, consisting of the line f in the plane of infinity of A 3, and a point F in f. The <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> quadrics {{is a set of}} 1 2 nd order surfaces having common 4 th order space curve. Intersecting a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> quadrics by a general plane we obtain a <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> 2 nd order curves. In this paper <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> quadrics in a double isotropic space I 3 (2) are analysed whereby the <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> surfaces is observed as the pencil associated with the <b>pencil</b> <b>of</b> second order curves (conics) belonging to isotropic absolute plane. In this process we use the classification <b>of</b> <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> conics in the isotropic plane given in 2, the classification of 2 nd order surfaces in I 3 (2) 4, and the projective properties <b>of</b> the <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> second order surfaces [9, 16].
