5|$|Although now 67 {{years old}} and in {{indifferent}} health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital {{to start a new}} magazine, John Blunt, as a rival to John Bull, but the new venture lasted {{little more than a year}} before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> stardom.|$|E

25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a {{piece that}} exists in the initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
25|$|Defunct ranks include detective, inspector, {{and deputy}} chief. In the mid 1980s, all active duty detectives were {{reclassified}} to sergeants.

50|$|Having {{graduated}} from the Army Academy as a second lieutenant, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> first lieutenant in 1984, and to captain in 1987. After joining the Croatian Armed Forces, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> major in 1992, to lieutenant colonel in 1993 and to colonel in 1995. In 1996, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> the rank of staff brigadier and brigadier general in 2000. In 2005, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> major general, in 2011 he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> lieutenant general, and in 2014, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> general.|$|R
50|$|He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> major on May 15, 1917. On June 12, 1918, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> {{colonel in}} the National Army. On August 8, 1918, he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> brigadier general.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} {{additional}} pieces (the iron and stone generals, knights, angry boars, cat swords, evil wolves, violent oxen, and flying dragons, which all <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> gold generals), {{the rules of}} dai shogi {{are thought to have}} corresponded very closely to those of its descendant chu shogi.|$|E
25|$|The {{promotion}} {{rules of}} dai shogi {{may have changed}} significantly over time. The promotion rules in the earlier Heian shogi and Heian dai shogi provide for all weak stepping pieces to <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the gold general, which is true for sho shogi and modern shogi. However, in chu shogi many of these pieces have changed promotions to ranging pieces in the initial setup. Dai shogi has a mixture of these rules: the weak steppers or limited rangers unique to dai shogi all <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the gold general, but those present in chu shogi keep their promotion from the latter game. It is likely that these differing promotions in chu shogi are a later historical innovation, that was later copied back into dai shogi when chu shogi became more popular than dai shogi.|$|E

In case one team wins both the opening and the closing tournament, these matches will not be played and the team is promoted automatically.|$|E

25|$|These {{average values}} {{do not take}} into account the special status of the king as a royal piece. They have also been {{normalized}} so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions. Additionally, pieces gain in value if they have a good chance of promotion. This is particularly significant for the old kite and poisonous snake, which <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the two most powerful pieces in the game.|$|E
25|$|If a piece which cannot retreat or move to {{the side}} {{advances}} to the far rank, {{so that it would}} otherwise have no further legal move, it is trapped. These pieces are the pawn, knight, iron general, and lance. In practice this would never occur for pawns or lances, which <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> pieces which keep their old moves, so that there is never any reason to defer their promotion, as stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player.|$|E
25|$|Any piece, {{promoted}} or not, {{that captures}} a Deva or teaching king (a promoted Deva) promotes to a teaching king. This is effected by replacing {{it on the}} board with the captured piece. Similarly, any piece that captures a dark spirit or Buddhist spirit (a promoted dark spirit) promotes to a Buddhist spirit. The only exception is (potentially) royal pieces (emperors, kings, princes, and drunk elephants) which <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> their normal promoted forms, or stay as they are if already promoted.|$|E

Robin Veith was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> staff writer and wrote three episodes. Kater Gordon was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> staff writer and co-wrote her first episode of the series. Joining the writing staff in the second season were consulting producers Rick Cleveland, Jane Anderson, and Marti Noxon, who each wrote an episode.

25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece {{has the effect of}} changing how that piece moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves exactly like the original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (Which can be a reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still <b>promote</b> (<b>to</b> dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E
25|$|There are {{peculiar}} chess compositions featuring double stalemate. At {{left and}} at right are double stalemate positions, in which neither side has a legal move. There {{is also a}} bizarre chess variant, Patt-schach, that begins from a double stalemate position. Each player begins by making an illegal move (although they cannot capture enemy pieces with these illegal moves, and the rules of check and checkmate are still respected), and then normal play begins. Since all pawns are just one step from promotion, they may only <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> captured pieces: if no pieces may be captured, pawns may not move to the last row.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that about 3% of all promotions are underpromotions. The frequency of truly significant underpromotions is, however, less than this. Note that the promoted piece {{does not have}} to be a piece that has previously been captured. A player may <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> any piece they wish, regardless of whether or not such a piece has been captured. In theory, a player could have nine queens, ten knights, ten bishops or ten rooks, though these are highly improbable scenarios. Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns. If an extra queen is unavailable, it is often represented by an upside-down rook instead.|$|E
