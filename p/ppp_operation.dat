40|$|Background: Non-governmental {{organizations}} (NGOs) have a {{key role}} in improving health in low- and middle-income countries. Their work needs to be synergistic, complementary to public services, and rooted in community mobilization and collective action. The study explores how an NGO and its health services are perceived by the population that it serves, and how it can contribute to reducing barriers to care. Design: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted in remote Ecuador, characterized by its widespread poverty and lack of official governance. An international NGO collaborated closely with the public services to deliver preventative and curative health services. Data were collected using focus group discussions and semistructured interviews with purposively sampled community members, healthcare personnel, and community health workers based on their links to the health services. Conventional qualitative content analysis was used, focusing on manifest content. Results: Emerging themes relate to the public private partnership (PPP), the NGO and its services, and community participation. The population perceives the NGO positively, linking it to healthcare improvements. Their priority is to get services, irrespective of the provider's structure. The presence of an NGO in the operation may contribute to unrealistic expectations of health services, affecting perceptions of the latter negatively. Conclusions: To avoid unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction, and to increase and sustain the population's trust in the organization, an NGO should operate {{in a manner that is}} as integrated as possible within the existing structure. The NGO should work close to the population it serves, with services anchored in the community. PPP parties should develop a common platform with joint messages to the target population on the provider's structure, and regarding partners’ roles and responsibilities. Interaction between the population and the providers on service content and their expectations is key to positive outcomes of <b>PPP</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the High Voltage Power Converter Unit on DS 1 allows both the {{spacecraft}} avionics and ion propulsion to operate in a stable manner near the PPP of the solar array. This approach relies on a fairly well-defined solar array model to determine the projected PPP. The solar array voltage set-points have to be updated every week to maintain <b>operation</b> near <b>PPP.</b> Stable <b>operation</b> even to the LEFT of the Peak Power Point is achievable {{so long as you}} do not change the operating power level of the ion engine. The next step for this technology is to investigate the use of onboard autonomy to determine the optimum SA voltage regulation set-point (i. e. near the PPP); this is for future missions that have one or more ion propulsion subsystems...|$|R

40|$|Financing mode of {{municipal}} public utilities in agricultural High-tech Demonstration Zone of Yangling City was mainly divided into five kinds, including financial financing mode, debt financing mode, enterprise accumulation mode, business resources mode, {{foreign direct investment}} and private capital financing mode. Due to the single investment subject, narrow financing channel, monopoly management and ineffectiveness of capital utilization in infrastructure financing, PPP mode based on the co-operative financing of public sector and private enterprises was put forward. The financing applications of PPP mode in Yangling Demonstration Zone were discussed either. However, attentions should be paid to establish a benign partnership between government and private sector, and practice positively in the introduction of <b>PPP.</b> The <b>operation</b> mode of <b>PPP</b> mode as well as experience accumulated in bidding design and building construction could play a referential role in the infrastructure construction of Yangling Demonstration Zone and other regions.

40|$|The goal in {{developing}} a robust parallelization tool {{is that it is}} easy to use, it requires minimal modifications to the original serial code, it is extensible {{to a wide variety of}} applications, and that it provide good portable performance. A directive-based parallelization tool is described called the Parallel Pre-processor (PPP) that meets most of these goals. The user inserts directives, in the form of comments, into existing Fortran code. PPP translates the code and directives into a parallel version that runs efficiently on shared and distributed memory high-performance computing platforms including: SGI Origin, IBM SP 2, Cray T 3 E, SUN, Alpha and Intel Clusters. Twenty directives are available to support operations including array re-declarations, inter-process communications, loop transformations, and parallel I/O <b>operations.</b> <b>PPP</b> also provides support for incremental parallelization and parallel debugging.

50|$|There are {{two options}} to the State Governments for State Wide Area Network establishment. The first option is the {{public-private}} partnership (<b>PPP)</b> model for <b>operation</b> {{and maintenance of}} the Network. In the PPP model State/UT identifies a suitable PPP model and selects an appropriate Network Operator agency through a suitable competitive bid process. The second option is designating National Informatics Centre (NIC) as the prime implementation agency for the SWAN {{as an integral part}} of NICNET. In the NIC model the State / UT designates NIC as the prime implementation agency for SWAN for establishment, operation and maintenance of the Network. NIC in turn would identify a Facility Management Service (FMS) agency for the State / UT concerned, to manage day-to-day management and operation of the network.Department of IT support covers the entire cost of establishment, operation and maintenance of the SWAN for a period of five years on 100% grant basis. A majority of the States / UTs have opted for the PPP model. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited has been identified as a preferred bandwidth service provider for SWANs.|$|R
40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{have been}} extensively used to deliver {{an array of}} infrastructure projects in Australia; they have {{become an integral part}} of several state governments' procurement strategies. Over the last decade, however, several major PPP projects have incurred significant cost and schedule overruns, which have marred their use as a mechanism for delivering much-needed infrastructure. The paucity of performance measurement frameworks has contributed to the difficulty of proactively managing the effective and efficient delivery of <b>PPPs,</b> particularly during <b>operations</b> and maintenance. With this in mind, a lifecycle and stakeholder-oriented performance measurement framework (PMF) is conceptualized within the context of social infrastructure PPPs. The opinions of 160 practitioners about the proposed measures and their core indicators were solicited using a questionnaire survey. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the significance of proposed measures and their relevant core indicators (CIs) for measuring the performance of PPP projects throughout their lifecycle. The analysis reveals that the proposed PMF is a reliable and robust tool that can be used to assist with ensuring that social infrastructure PPPs can be delivered successfully throughout each phase of their lifecycle. The developed PMF provides governments and private consortiums with a robust and practical tool to measure and control the performance of their future projects.

40|$|The neo-liberal {{restructuring}} of state assets and facilities, which {{has taken place}} internationally {{over the past three}} decades, as well as in South Africa, has been a matter of great controversy. Privatisation, in particular, has been a polarising issue, especially when applied to fields like healthcare. Supporters of privatisation view it as cutting costs, mobilising funding, expertise and innovation, resulting in improved delivery, and opening possibilities for a spread of ownership. Critics claim the process involves retrenchments, declining services for the (poorer) majority of people, and a focus on the elites as citizens become transformed into customers, and with any economic empowerment going to the already prosperous. This thesis examines these issues by looking at the privatisation of hospitals in South Africa, with a case study of the Netcare-Settlers Public Private Partnership (PPP) (also known as the Settlers Private Hospital) in Grahamstown, South Africa. Netcare is South Africa’s largest private hospital company, and also has substantial operations in the United Kingdom. The thesis sets out the context: a highly inequitable healthcare system in the country, the rise of privatisation in the apartheid and post-apartheid eras, and healthcare privatisation. In terms of the Netcare-Settlers PPP, the thesis examines how the PPP was structured and developed, focusing on the impact of the <b>PPP</b> on non-clinical <b>operations.</b> The thesis argues that the results of the PPP are mixed, that it has greatly improved areas like facilities, maintenance, cleaning and catering, performed less well in increasing the doctor/ patient ratio or in attracting specialists, and is associated with the widespread and problematic use of outsourcing of service workers like cleaners and security. Overall, the PPP has improved healthcare, with some effective sharing of resources between the public and private parts of the hospital, but also relies on a pool of relatively low waged, under-unionised, labour. In terms of the general debate over privatisation, the Netcare-Settlers PPP shows that both supporters and critics have some valid points, and that privatisation in practice is not an either/ or, black/ white, good/ bad proposition, but something more complex. The success and failure of PPPs depend on the details of the contracts, and these can be used to maximise the performance of both the public and private partners. Better contracts may help avoid the uneven results seen at institutions like the Netcare-Settlers PPP...|$|R
