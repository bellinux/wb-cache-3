In consequence, it is {{focusing}} on reflexion of these phenomenons in literature, principally in essays. In {{the introduction to the}} thesis, I describe unique and peculiar features of Chilean identity and there also appears a definition of the chilenidad conception. The main attention is concentrated on el huacho figure as it symbolizes Chilean illegitimacy and mestizaje. The main aim of this thesis was to find out similar and dissimilar attributes between the huacho and Chilean society. In addition, <b>patrial</b> aim was to decide whether the huacho belongs either to location or to community. Final part is dedicated to comparison of huacho and pachuco figures and, it also confronts Chilean essays with Octavio Paz essay works. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{case of a}} 28 -year-old Caucasian female with {{progressive}} hemifacial atrophy and atrophy of the rhomboid muscles on the ipsilateral side is reported. The {{literature on}} this condition and its treatment is reviewed. The first published reports on progressive hemifacial atrophy were attributed to Parry ' in 1825 and Romberg 2 in 1846. Characterised by progressive atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, cartilage, or bone, the condition can leave a marked deformity {{on one side of}} the face. Extension to the ipsilateral upper extremity and to the entire half of the body have also been described. The condition usually presents during the first two decades of life, often beginning in the paramedian area of the face. It may cease at any stage and leave only a minimal disfigurement. Progressive hemifacial atrophy should be distin-guished from localised scleroderma, hemifacial microsomia, traumatic fat necrosis, atrophy secondary to facial paralysis, and unilateral <b>patrial</b> lipodystrophy. There has been speculation on the relationship between hemifacial atrophy and local-ised scleroderma. Wartenberg 3 in his extensive review concluded that the two conditions are essenti-ally the same, and this view has been supported by Rees. 4 However, Crickler et al. ' and Dawson ' con-cluded that scleroderma is a different entity. Case repor...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, Tissue Velocity Imaging (TVI) {{established}} as a routine diagnostic tool in human medicine. Nowadays it is used in small animal medicine with increasing importance. Primary studies adumbrate a utilizability of TVI in horses as well. The objective {{of this study was}} to test TVI section planes according to the 16 segment-modell of the American Society of Echocardiography to their adaptability on horses. Therefore 12 horses with no clinical signs after clinical and conventional echocardiographic examination have been investigated by coloured and pulsed-wave TVI in the equine clinic of the Free Universtity of Berlin. Coloured TVI was performed on 6, pulsed-wave TVI on 5 measuring points of the left ventricle. In addition 22 horses were examed with the same modus operandi. 11 of these 22 patients showed a at least moderate insufficiency of the aortic valve. 9 of the 11 horses showed a dilatation of the left heart chamber, 1 with an accessory enlarged left atrium. The other 11 horses exhibited an at least moderate insufficiency of the mitral valve with a dilatated left atrium in 7 patients. The measurements enfolded 4 complete heart cycles that have been saved digital as cineloops. The myocardial systolic peak velocity was measured off-line in each cycle. The identification of the adequate velocity graph was secured with a revolving ECG. The assignability of the TVI section planes used in human medicine to horses is possible. The measurement of the radial myocardial velocity succeeded in all positions scheduled therefore in humans. A reliable determination of longitudinal myocardial deformation is not possible in horses. In addition to the measured section plane, differences occurred among the groups. The horses with aortic valve insufficiency showed a significant increase of systolic peak velocity in all section planes and examination modes along the interventricular septum. On the other hand, the examination of horses with mitral valve insufficiency did only show <b>patrial</b> significant differences in myocardial systolic peak velocities compared to horses with no clinical findings...|$|E

O direito à proteção consular, no artigo 36 da Convenção de Viena sobre Relações Consulares dispõe sobre a comunicação do Estado que envia com seus nacionais. Estabelece ainda que as autoridades do Estado {{receptor}} devem informar ao Estado <b>patrial,</b> sempre que um nacional seu seja detido de qualquer maneira. A importância dessa prerrogativa de proteção consular se dá em razão da garantia ao preso estrangeiro de um processo justo, com meios adequados de defesa, além de sua integridade física e mental, o que ameniza a desvantagem que sofre por estar em território estranho. Os Estados Unidos já foram demandados três vezes na Corte Internacional de Justiça por violações à convenção pela falta de comunicação consular de presos estrangeiros, que acarretaram, segundo os reclamantes, prejuízo em seus processos criminais, tendo por consequência condenações ilegais. No presente trabalho, analisa-se a importância desse direito de proteção consular, especificamente nos casos dos dois brasileiros condenados à morte por tráfico de drogas na Indonésia, país conhecido pelo combate agressivo a esse tipo de crime. A partir da análise desses casos concretos, o trabalho colabora para a compreensão sobre a possibilidade de aplicação da pena de morte a brasileiros no exterior, quando essa punição não é prevista no ordenamento brasileiro, para esse tipo de transgressão. Por fim, o presente trabalho destaca as formas das quais o Brasil dispõe para se recorrer dessas condenações. The {{right to}} consular {{protection in the}} article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations states the communication of the sending State with its nationals. It also settles that national authorities must report the sending State, through its consular authorities, everytime when a foreign is detained. The consular means of protection are important considering that they guarantee not only an equal process of judgement but also assure adequate defending measures {{and the maintenance of}} its prisoners’s physical and mental integrity. This contributes to avoid any disadvantage considering they are in unfamiliar territory. The U. S. has already been sued three times at the International Court of Justice for violating the Convention due to lacking of consular communication of the foreign prisoners. According to the claimants, the violation caused prejudice in the prisoners’s criminal process such as an illegal conviction. This paper intends to analyze the relevance of the right to consular protection, considering the situation of two Brazilians who were involved in drug trafficking in Indonesia, which determined their condemnation to death. Indonesia is known for its agressive fighting to this specific crime. Upon the analysis of these two occurances, this thesis contributes to the understanding about the possibility of applying the death penalty to brazilians abroad. This type of sentence is not included in the Brazilian legal system for this kind of violation. The last analysis in this paper consists in Brazilian’s ways of reverting these condemnations...|$|E
40|$|The use of SF 6 Gas-Insulated Systems (GIS) is {{increasingly}} taking {{the place of}} conventional air-insulated systems. It may appear that the reliability of gas-insulated systems has been proven through its satisfactory operating experience, however, partial discharge (PD) detection technique is still required to check the integrity of SF 6 in GIS. <b>Patrial</b> Discharges can be {{a major cause of}} deterioration of the dielectric efficiency of GIS. This study has been performed with the aim of examining the various possible techniques available for impurity determination in GIS. In addition the effects of PDs on electrodes have been examined. Detection of partial discharges has been obtained by using the Computer-Based Data Analyser (CDA 3) and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR). Other possible methods have been investigated such as the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method and the Raman technique. The changes on the surfaces of the electrodes have been studied using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the Electron Probe X-Ray Microanalyses. Partial discharges have been generated in pure and contaminated SF 6. Moisture and oxygen have been used as a contaminants in our experiments- these are common contaminants in GIS. To have a complete picture about the effect of PD in SF 6 Gas-Insulated Systems all the three elements (electric discharges, gas and electrodes) involved during the existence of partial discharges should be considered: first of all, by the usage of a Computer-Based Data Analyser (CDA 3) the electric partial discharge activity is studied. To simulate PD activity in GIS a point-plane pd source in SF 6 was used. Very little {{can be found in the}} literature about the details of partial discharge, obtained by a point-plane geometry stressed by negative DCHV, magnitude and its repetition rate in SF 6 for long periods of time. Its behaviour over a period of 60 hours is monitored and studied. There have been no such long term (60 hours) studies of PD effects reported. The second element is the gas analysis. Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) method had received only a little attention compared with other methods. After detailed studies and investigation FTIR has been found to be very suitable for gas analysis. The author has proposed this technique for monitoring SF 6 integrity in GIS maintenance. Moreover, the author has an expectation that on line monitoring with the FTIR method is possible and should not be difficult. No previous attempt has been made to use the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method or Raman technique. Therefore, we decided to take the initiative to apply these methods for the gas analysis. The NMR results revealed some hope in applying this method for the gas analysis however the Raman technique results did not show any promising signs for use of this method for the gas analysis. Beside that, the third issue is the effect of discharge on the morphology of the surfaces of the electrodes and what are the changes that can be responsible for the behaviour of PDs. This is also part of this study. Because the issue of the affect of partial discharges on the surfaces of the electrodes has not yet been tackled in detail elsewhere many original results have been obtained from this research. This investigation has taken two directions: one was to study the morphology of the reacted surfaces of the electrodes after being exposed to discharges and the second was to quanti fy the changes in the percentages of the elements on the surfaces of the electrodes. The first direction has been achieved using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the other second direction has been achieved using the electron probe microanalyses. Furthermore, the affect of the changes of the surfaces of the electrodes on the PD behaviour has been studied too. The results did show that the surfaces roughness of polished electrodes has increased from 3 pm to about 30 pm because of PD activity and that has enhanced the electric field and increased the magnitude of PD by 4 times higher...|$|E
