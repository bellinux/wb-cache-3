5|$|Convolve the <b>pixelated</b> {{image with}} a heat kernel to {{simulate}} its evolution under the heat equation {{for a short}} time step. The result is a Gaussian blur of the image, or equivalently the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function, with radius proportional to the square root of the time step.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the Jumbotron screens were to be replaced; the previous screens were inferior and had become <b>pixelated.</b> On 16 July 2014 the club paid a lasting tribute to Sandy Jardine by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Many {{publications}} and websites use the <b>pixelated</b> alien graphic as an icon for video games in general, including video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, technology website Ars Technica, and concert event Video Games Live. There {{have also been}} Space Invaders themed merchandising, including necklaces and puzzles. The trend continues to this day, with handmade sites like Etsy and Pinterest showcasing thousands of handmade items featuring Space Invaders characters.|$|E

50|$|A common {{technique}} {{is to use}} raster graphics to display text in a font that cannot be trusted to be available on most computers. Text created this way <b>pixelates</b> when scaled and cannot be partially selected. In contrast, sIFR text elements mimic normal HTML text - they are relatively resizable and copyable.|$|R
50|$|At low bit rates, any lossy block-based {{coding scheme}} {{introduces}} visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries. These boundaries can be transform block boundaries, prediction block boundaries, or both, and may coincide with macroblock boundaries. The term macroblocking {{is commonly used}} regardless of the artifact's cause. Other names include tiling, mosaicing, <b>pixelating,</b> quilting, and checkerboarding.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the isometric projection game engine known as Filmation II, {{which was used}} previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game Nightshade. The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of <b>pixelated</b> drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a <b>pixelated</b> style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out <b>pixelated</b> portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
50|$|Voodoo Chat, {{apart from}} its text-based chatting system, also has avatars, images {{representing}} oneself, displayed {{on the top of}} the screen on the foreground of a web page. Said images can be any size width or height, though the programs defaults are set at 300x300, and the file size limit is 15KB. Images also have effects supported in-house such as flipping, rotating, turning black and white, inverting, <b>pixelating,</b> blur, grow and shrink.|$|R

50|$|According to <b>Pixelate,</b> OpenX Marketplace had {{the highest}} quality ad {{inventory}} in 2015, beating Google's ad marketplace (Google Adx). OpenX integrations are widely distributed / long tail and currently sees the second most impressions (2%) on the internet, after Google. Its new traffic quality platform for viewability and fraud detection technology {{has the ability to}} leverage this position by seeing impressions earlier than existing ad verification / pre-bid solutions used by DSP and agency trading desks.|$|R
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the <b>pixelated</b> image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a <b>pixelated</b> environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events {{over the next four}} years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} sexual referents is Volkswagen's {{campaign}} for the Beetle Cabriolet. The advert <b>pixelates</b> the non-existent roof to the car, similar to the pixilation that occurs when female's breasts are exposed in some forms of media. Volkswagen {{have a history of}} producing tongue-in-cheek adverts, and this one serves to compare their new convertible to a woman who goes topless at a beach. It implies the car is relaxed and fun, like someone who goes topless at a beach.|$|R
40|$|Pixel art is {{a popular}} style of digital art often found in video games. It is {{typically}} characterized by its low resolution and use of limited colour palettes. Pixel art is created manually with little automation because it requires attention to pixel-level details. Working with individual pixels is a challenging and abstract task, whereas manipulating higher-level objects in vector graphics is much more intuitive. However, {{it is difficult to}} bridge this gap because although many rasterization algorithms exist, they are not well-suited for the particular needs of pixel artists, particularly at low resolutions. In this thesis, we introduce a class of rasterization algorithms called pixelation that is tailored to pixel art needs. We describe how our algorithm suppresses artifacts when <b>pixelating</b> vector paths and preserves shape-level features when <b>pixelating</b> geometric primitives. We also developed methods inspired by pixel art for drawing lines and angles more effectively at low resolutions. We compared our results to rasterization algorithms, rasterizers used in commercial software, and human subjects [...] -both amateurs and pixel artists. Through formal analyses of our user study studies and a close collaboration with professional pixel artists, we showed that, in general, our pixelation algorithms produce more visually appealing results than na√Øve rasterization algorithms do...|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago the Indian {{government}} tried unsuccessfully to ban all smoking scenes in movies [1]. Thailand <b>pixelates</b> cigarettes on television [2]. In the US, over 20 public health agencies and the World Health Organization [3] are campaigning to require that most smoking scenes should trigger restricted (adult) film classification [4]. They believe that such ratings would significantly reduce the exposure of youth to smoking scenes in movies, which they argue directly cause the uptake of smoking [5]. Should this policy become adopted, historical figures (such as King Georg...|$|R
5|$|The game world's {{design and}} the game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that <b>pixelated</b> CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E
5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are <b>pixelated</b> in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
25|$|On many episodes, {{answers that}} are deemed {{inappropriate}} for broadcast are edited out with comical effects, including a slide whistle sound effect dubbed over the audible answer {{in place of}} the usual bleep censor.

Results indicated that participants were still able to recognize some of the viewed faces, despite these image degradations. In addition, moving images of faces were recognized better than static ones. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|On July 10, 2014, {{the series}} began airing in the United States on NBC on Thursdays at 9:00 pm. and on The Comedy Network in Canada. For the US broadcasts, {{some of the}} scenes had to be edited, {{including}} dubbing over obscene dialogue and <b>pixelating</b> nudity. On August 4, after four episodes, NBC renewed the series for the second season. Although US ratings for the show were not considered particularly high in either total viewers or viewers in the 18-49 key demographic, NBC noted that the 18-49 viewership skewed to a more valuable upscale audience.|$|R
50|$|Kino {{provides}} {{a range of}} audio and video effects and transitions. Audio effects include silence, fade in/out, gain envelope, dub (from file), mix (from file), and crossfading support. Video effects include black/white, sepia tone, multiple color balance and masking tools, reverse (i.e. inverse or negative), mirror, kaleidescope, swap (flip), fade to/from black, blur (triangle), soft focus, titler and <b>pixelate.</b> Transitions include fade to/from color dissolve, push wipe, barn door wipe, color differences, and extensible wipes with numerous common SMPTE wipes (box, bar, diagonal, barn door, clock, matrix, four box, iris, and checkerboard).|$|R
25|$|Initially, most profanity was bleeped, {{but later}} episodes were bleeped for {{explicit}} language, sometimes {{to such an}} extent that speech became incomprehensible. In addition, nudity, the partial exposure of breasts or buttocks as well as the middle finger is <b>pixelated.</b> After longtime producer Richard Dominick left, the show reverted to the traditional style of bleeping, which remains in place today. A The New York Times report from April 1998 found that each episode had about 85 to 130 bleeps.|$|E
25|$|Rashid Rana {{has emerged}} as a leading name among the young-generation artists on the {{contemporary}} art scene. He is known to develop a conceptually driven, well-informed art practice, which maintains a <b>pixelated</b> attention to formal concerns. His works revolve around a subtle simultaneous exploration of media and identity ‚Äì both bound by a sharp political edge as he satirizes pop culture and looks to reinterpret varied elements of art and cultural history. His new media projects are a visual commentary and parody of socio-political scenarios.|$|E

50|$|Jonathan Lewis (born 1970) {{lives and}} works in New Jersey, USA. He makes photo-based art that explores themes of {{production}} and consumption via the elemental properties of the pixel. His subjects, ranging from candy wrappers and cigarettes to haute couture and works of art reflect an uncritical fascination for the artificial and the man-made. His process, often <b>pixelating</b> images beyond recognition, criss crosses the border between figuration and abstraction, and his work takes the form of digital prints, sculpture, video and books. He is {{a founding member of the}} ABC Artists' Books Cooperative.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} screened only at two small venues in Japan: at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo in September 2009, {{and at the}} Tokyo International Film Festival in October 2009 where it received mixed reviews. A Japanese film distributor, Medallion Media/Unplugged, subsequently acquired the rights to screen the film in Japan. The company hoped to begin a run of the movie in Japanese cinemas in June 2010. Medallion prepared the documentary for presentation in Japan by <b>pixelating</b> the faces of Taiji residents and fishermen depicted in the film. Nationalist protesters vowed to block {{the release of the}} film in Japan and dozens equipped with loudspeakers have demonstrated outside of the distributor's office in central Tokyo.|$|R
5000|$|Vector art {{is ideal}} for {{printing}} since the art is made {{from a series of}} mathematical curves, it will print very crisply even when resized. For instance, one can print a vector logo on a small sheet of copy paper, and then enlarge the same vector logo to billboard size and keep the same crisp quality. A low-resolution raster graphic would blur or <b>pixelate</b> excessively if it were enlarged from business card size to billboard size. (The precise resolution of a raster graphic necessary for high-quality results depends on the viewing distance; e.g., a billboard may still appear to be of high quality even at low resolution if the viewing distance is great enough.) ...|$|R
25|$|Compound {{eyes are}} {{found among the}} {{arthropods}} and are composed of many simple facets which, depending {{on the details of}} anatomy, may give either a single <b>pixelated</b> image or multiple images, per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and which can give a full 360¬∞ field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image, creating vision. With each eye viewing a different thing, a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain, providing very different, high-resolution images.|$|E
25|$|The ACU {{originally}} {{used the}} Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), which used a <b>pixelated</b> pattern of tan, gray and green (Desert Sand 500, Urban Gray 501 and Foliage Green 502) and {{was intended to}} work equally in desert, woodland, and urban environments. It is aesthetically similar to the USMC's MARPAT and Canadian CADPAT camouflage scheme on which it was based. The shade black was omitted from the uniform since it is highly visible both {{to the naked eye}} and to modern optics. Pure black, when viewed through night vision devices, appears excessively dark and creates an undesirable high-contrast image. The pattern proved to be ineffective in certain environments, and is thus scheduled to be fully phased out by 30 September 2019.|$|E
25|$|During {{early summer}} 2002, Rosa {{suddenly}} laid down work. As an artist {{he could not}} live under the conditions Egmont was offering him, {{but he did not}} want to give up making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and try to come to an agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or <b>pixelated</b> computer conversions of the illustrations. Another matter was that his name was used in promotion of books and collections of stories without his agreement and without sending royalties to him. Rosa has never, as with any other Disney artist, received royalties for a single use of any of his stories worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Narrow@band {{photoconductivity}} with a {{spectral width}} of 0. 16 eV is obtained from solution@ processed colloidal ZnO nanocrystals beneath the band@edge at 2. 25 eV. A new model involving electron transfer from deep defects to discrete sha llow donors is introduced {{to explain the}} narrow spectrum and the exponential form of the current rise and decay transients. The defects are tentatively assigned to neutral oxygen vacancies. The photocurrent responsivity can be enhanced by storage in air and this correlates with the form ation of carbonate surface species by capture of carbon dioxide during storage. This controllability is exploited to develop a low@cost and scalable photolithographic approach to <b>pixelate</b> photodetectors for applications such as object discrimination, sensing etc. The spectral response can be spatially patterned so that dual (ultraviolet and green) and single (ultraviolet only) wavelength detecting ZnO pixels can be produced on the same substrate.
