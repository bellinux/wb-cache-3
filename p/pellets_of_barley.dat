40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of periods of adjustment and duration of performance test on estimating genetic variance parameters for ADG. Variance components were estimated from ADG data collected from 1978 to 1984 on a total of 1, 047 Targhee ewe and ram lambs at the U. S. Sheep Experiment Station (Dubois, ID). Across all years, lambs averaged 84 ± 9 d of age and 25 ± 5. 4 kg of weight when placed on test. Lambs were provided ad libitum access to a commercial <b>pellet</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> grain and ground alfalfa for 14 wk. Every 2 wk, ADG was recorded. Overall mean ADG for the entire 14 -wk period across all years was 249. 3 ± 56. 5 g. Variance components were estimated from a single-trait animal model using REML for cumulative combinations of time on feed in 2 -wk intervals from 4 to 14 wk and varying the adjustment period from 2 to 6 wk. The model included fixed effects for year (1978 to 1984), sex of lamb (ewe or ram), and genetic line (selected or control), and two covariates (age and weight at beginning of performance test). As the duration of the performance test increased, phenotypic variances for ADG decreased: 54 and 13 g 2 at 4 and 14 wk on test, respectively. Also, estimates of direct heritability increased with extended duration on test: 0. 20 ± 0. 06 and 0. 35 ± 0. 07 at 4 and 14 wk on test, respectively. Heritability estimates increased little after 8 wk on feed (0. 33, 0. 33, 0. 38, and 0. 35 for 8, 10, 12, and 14 wk, respectively). Genetic and environmental correlations among durations of the performance test were estimated from two-trait models. All genetic correlations among durations of performance test were greater than 0. 88 which suggests that all measures of ADG were genetically similar. However, environmental correlations among duration of performance test ranged from 0. 31 to 1. 00 with the smaller environmental correlations occurring between 4 to 6 wk with 12 to 14 wk on feed. These results indicate that a period of 8 wk or greater was sufficient to observe differences among animals for ADG due to direct genetic effects under this environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} benzoic acid on Salmonella Typhimurium was {{compared}} to formic acid + lactic acid in naturally infected weaners. Addition of 1 % benzoic acid or 0. 5 % lactic acid + 0. 5 % formic acid {{did not result in}} a significant reduction of Salmonella prevalence, neither bacteriologi-cal nor serological, after 5 weeks of administration, compared to a control diet consisting of pel-leted feed without organic acid. In contrast, adding organic acid to the diet improved average daily gain and other production parameters, irrespective of the type of acid. Introduction Reduction of Salmonella infection pressure in pig herds can be achieved in different ways, e. g. through feed intervention strategies. Many studies have shown a decrease in Salmonella prevalence in pigs following the use of meal feed instead <b>of</b> <b>pelleted</b> feed, inclusion <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> in the diet, coarse grinding, and addition of organic acids (e. g.

40|$|Keywords: heat treatment, maize, barley, starch, protein, in sacco, in vivo, dairy, {{perennial}} ryegrass, grazing, supplementation, ruminal fermentation, VFA, rumen, degradability, synchrony. In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} different ways <b>of</b> thermal processing (<b>pelleting,</b> expanding, toasting) <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> and maize on the degradative behaviour of their starch and protein in the rumen of lactating dairy cows are described. In situ studies showed that all thermal processing methods increased the ruminal starch and protein availability of maize, while all thermal processing methods decreased ruminal starch availability but only pelleting increased ruminal protein availability <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Based on in vivo experiments compared to untreated grains, expander treatment increased the apparent rumen and total tract digestibility of maize starch but {{did not affect the}} digestibility <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> starch. Supplementing grazing dairy cows with pelleted and pressure toasted maize and barley slightly (not significantly) decreased the dry matter intake of grass in the first grazing event in the morning after milking, and it decreased ruminal clearence of nitrogen. Supplementing pasture grass with pelleted and pressure toasted cereal grains decreased the pH, the NH 3 -N level in the rumen, the ammonia to total VFA (TVFA) ratio, the isobutyrate proportion, the acetate to propionate ratio and the non-glucogenic to glucogenic ratio in the rumen. Simultaneously it increased TVFA concentrations, propionate, butyrate and valerate proportions {{as a percentage of the}} TVFA. All processed grains did affect production responses in dairy cows, by elevating milk protein and decreasing milk fat production, and milk urea nitrogen but no significant differences between these two heat treatments were found. It is concluded that the need of synchrony is specially important with diets based on fresh grass, in which markedly asynchronous rates of release of energy and nitrogen occur in the rumen. It appears that to generate a better ruminal N and organic matter synchrony to improve microbial N yield and N utilization feeding different types of cereal grain that differ by nature in rate and extent of ruminal degradation has more effect than using one of this processing methods on the same type of grain. Responses obtained from cereal grain supplementation are very dependent on the quality and degradation characteristics of the pasture consumed, which changes through the grazing season. </TR...|$|R

Whole barley plants were extracted at growth stage 4 (stems not developed enough), whilst for the following growth stages roots, stems, panicles and leaves were extracted separately. Seedling growth bioassays demonstrated that the wild-oat responded differently to the allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> For wild-oat radical growth and coleoptile growth were more depressed than germination, though. The allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> plant parts was not stable over its life cycle for wild-oat. Leaves and stems were the most phytotoxic barley plant parts for wild-oat in the all stages. Among the varieties Eizeh appeared as the best one showing toxicity to seed germination of wild oat at its stage 4 and 8.

40|$|Mature barley lectin is a dimeric protein {{composed}} of two identical 18 -kilodalton polypeptides. The subunits <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin are initially synthesized as glycosylated proproteins, which are post-translationally processed to the mature protein preceding or concomitant with deposition <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles. To investigate the functional role of the glycan in processing and intracellular transport <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin to vacuoles, the sole N-linked glycosylation site residing within the COOH-terminal propeptide <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. cDNA clones encoding wild-type (wt) or glycosylation-minus (gly-) barley lectin preproproteins were placed under the transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38. Barley lectin synthesized from both the wt and gly- constructs was processed and correctly targeted to vacuoles of tobacco leaves. Localization <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles processed from the nonglycosylated gly- proprotein indicated that the high-mannose glycan <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> lectin proprotein was not essential for targeting barley lectin to vacuoles.
