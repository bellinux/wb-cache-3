5|$|May Fung Yee Pang (born October 24, 1950) is an American, {{best known}} as the former girlfriend of John Lennon. She had {{previously}} worked as a personal assistant and <b>production</b> <b>coordinator</b> for Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} production {{earlier in}} the month, Double Dare 2000 broadcast its first episode on January 22, 2000, now hosted by Jason Harris with Tiffany Phillips as announcer. Additional episodes were taped in July of the same year. Eileen Braun, {{who worked on the}} original Double Dare as a production assistant and a <b>production</b> <b>coordinator,</b> was the executive producer for Double Dare 2000. Marc Summers advised on production as an executive consultant. Tia Schroeder and Will Finley worked on Double Dare 2000 as stage assistants.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and <b>production</b> <b>coordinator</b> May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E

5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated {{a great deal from}} the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a <b>production</b> <b>coordinator</b> during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E

500|$|Walls and Bridges {{rose to the}} {{top spot}} on the album charts. Lennon {{achieved}} his only number one solo single in his lifetime with [...] "Whatever Gets You Thru the Night". Pang's is the voice whispering Lennon's name on [...] "#9 Dream". Another song, [...] "Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)", was written about her. Julian played drums on the album's last track, [...] "Ya Ya". While recording Walls and Bridges, Al Coury, vice president of promotion for Capitol Records, got possession of the chaotic Spector session tapes and brought them to New York. Lennon would complete his oldies album, which would be called Rock 'n' Roll, with the same musicians he used on Walls and Bridges. Pang received an RIAA gold record award for her work on Walls and Bridges and continued her work as <b>production</b> <b>coordinator</b> of Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album, where she was credited as [...] "Mother Superior". Pang also worked on albums by Nilsson, Starr, Elton John and David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Michelle formed her own {{boutique}} {{film production}} company called Via Rosa Productions, which ran for ten years. The company would allow Pfeiffer to produce and/or star in films tailored for strong women. She asked {{her best friend}} Kate Guinzburg to be her producing partner at the company. The two met {{on the set of}} the film Sweet Liberty (1986) and quickly became friends. Kate was the <b>Production</b> <b>Coordinator</b> on the film and became close with Pfeiffer {{over the course of the}} shoot. Via Rosa Productions was under a picture deal with Touchstone Pictures, a film label of The Walt Disney Studios. The first film the duo produced was the nostalgic independent drama Love Field (1992). Pfeiffer earned an Academy Award nomination for Actress in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture Drama for her performance as Lurene Hallett in the film, which had been temporarily shelved by the financially troubled Orion Pictures. It was finally released in late 1992, in time for Oscar consideration. The New York Times review wrote of Pfeiffer as [...] "again demonstrating that she is as subtle and surprising as she is beautiful." [...] For her portrayal of the eccentric Dallas housewife, she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival.|$|E
