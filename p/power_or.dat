5|$|A novel solar CPV/CSP {{hybrid system}} has been proposed, {{combining}} concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar <b>power,</b> <b>or</b> also known as concentrated solar thermal.|$|E
5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as <b>power</b> <b>or</b> energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} <b>power</b> <b>or</b> use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar <b>power,</b> <b>or</b> a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E
5|$|Thus, a {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power best when playing off another person's hereditary <b>power,</b> <b>or</b> when the organisation benefits largely from {{an air of}} mystery. By contrast, the wirepuller suffers a wane in power when the organizational élite {{is made up of}} competent individuals (Russell 1938:34).|$|E
5|$|Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if {{written law}} confers power on a {{minister}} {{to give a}} direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered to exercise a <b>power</b> <b>or</b> perform a duty to, {{in the absence of}} any statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the <b>power</b> <b>or</b> perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice); may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the Government Gazette. The minister remains capable of exercising the <b>power</b> <b>or</b> performing the duty personally. The power to make subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without <b>power</b> <b>or</b> communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without <b>power</b> <b>or</b> telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|Although the NHC is {{an agency}} of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has {{designated}} it as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas. If the center loses <b>power</b> <b>or</b> becomes incapacitated, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific Ocean while the Weather Prediction Center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|During a song, avatars of {{the virtual}} band, {{including}} one character selected by the player, will perform {{in time to the}} music, responding appropriately to the unleashing of Star <b>Power</b> <b>or</b> the failing of a song. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock has a cast of thirteen characters, which the player can further customize with alternate guitar skins and stage outfits using in-game money earned from successful performances. The player can access the game's three boss characters—Tom Morello, Slash, and Lou the Devil—as playable characters once they have completed their respective Boss Battles in Career mode. Although Bret Michaels appears in the game and sings specific songs, he is not a playable character in the game.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without <b>power</b> <b>or</b> telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any <b>power</b> <b>or</b> responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, <b>power,</b> <b>or</b> visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler {{and a desire to}} be useful to him; he did not seek <b>power</b> <b>or</b> prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine <b>power,</b> <b>or</b> shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, after certain quests are completed Legend of Mana gives the player the option to delve into optional gameplay aspects centered around the hero or heroine's house. The player can forge or improve weapons and armor using raw materials found throughout the game, or combine equipment with items to change their <b>power</b> <b>or</b> add special effects. They can grow different types of fruit in the orchard, raise pets to use as adventuring companions, create items, and build golems. Pets can also be raised with the Japan-only PocketStation peripheral, and two players can battle each other in an arena.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the <b>power</b> (<b>or</b> force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the <b>power</b> <b>or</b> if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful. If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose, the administrative action may be held valid.|$|E
