50|$|A {{large number}} of support and {{peripheral}} ICs were also implemented using (often static) depletion-load based circuitry.

50|$|While {{working for}} Intel in the 1970s, Masatoshi Shima {{designed}} {{a number of}} Intel <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips.</b> Some of his <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> {{were used in the}} IBM PC, including the Intel 8259 interrupt controller, 8255 parallel port chip, 8253 timer chip, 8257 DMA chip, and 8251 serial communication USART chip.|$|R
5000|$|Several PC {{expansion}} cards, such as Adaptecs SCSI boards, {{have been}} using the Z80/Z180 and <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> were {{designed}} {{so they could}} also be used with other microprocessors, for example the datasheet of the 2672 suggests using it with an Intel 8048 microcontroller.|$|R
5000|$|Because the DECchip 21064's {{signalling}} {{is incompatible}} with the EISA chipset and the system peripherals, the DECchip signals are interfaced to two buses, an address and command bus and a 32-bit data bus that masquerades as the 80486 interfaces. These two buses {{are referred to as}} [...] "pseudo-486". The EISA bus itself was implemented by a subset of the Intel 82350DT chipset. The 82358 EBC (EISA Bus Controller) chip and 82357 ISP (Integrated System <b>Peripheral)</b> <b>chip</b> implements the EISA bus and provides it with an interface to the system. Two 82352 EBB (EISA Bus Buffer) chips are also present, with one used to interface the EISA bus to a 32-bit pseudo-486 data bus, and the other used to interface the EISA bus to a pseudo-486 address and command bus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interrupt}} vector register, , is {{used for}} the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the [...] instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of service routine addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an interrupt acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine. The pointer identifies a particular <b>peripheral</b> <b>chip</b> and/or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called daisy chain for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>chip</b> were {{introduced}} by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters {{that could be}} used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse. This was a very popular chip and was even used in the original IBM PC Monochrome Display Adapter with the Intel 8088 16-bit microprocessor in 1981, and in the follow-up IBM Color Graphics Adapter for the original PC and successors; the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter card contained custom IBM chips that emulated the Motorola 6845, with minor differences.|$|E
50|$|The set of <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> {{selected}} for the original IBM PC defined the functionality of an IBM compatible. These became the de facto base for later application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used in compatible products.|$|R
50|$|The SS-30 I/O Bus had {{the address}} {{decoding}} on the motherboard. Each slot was allocated 4 address (the later MC6809 version upped this to 16 address.) This made for very simple I/O boards, the Motorola <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> connected directly to this bus.|$|R

40|$|NASA-JSC {{required}} an avionics platform capable of serving {{a wide range}} of applications in a cost-effective manner. In part, making the avionics platform cost effective means adhering to open standards and supporting the integration of COTS products with custom products. Inherently, operation in space requires low power, mass, and volume while retaining high performance, reconfigurability, scalability, and upgradability. The Universal Mini-Controller project is based on a modified PC/ 104 -Plus architecture while maintaining full compatibility with standard COTS PC/ 104 products. The architecture consists of a library of building block modules, which can be mixed and matched to meet a specific application. A set of NASA developed core building blocks, processor card, analog input/output card, and a Mil-Std- 1553 card, have been constructed to meet critical functions and unique interfaces. The design for the processor card is based on the PowerPC architecture. This architecture provides an excellent balance between power consumption and performance, and has an upgrade path to the forthcoming radiation hardened PowerPC processor. The processor card, which makes extensive use of surface mount technology, has a 166 MHz PowerPC 603 e processor, 32 Mbytes of error detected and corrected RAM, 8 Mbytes of Flash, and I Mbytes of EPROM, on a single PC/ 104 -Plus card. Similar densities have been achieved with the quad channel Mil-Std- 1553 card and the analog input/output cards. The power management built into the processor and its <b>peripheral</b> <b>chip</b> allows the power and performance of the system to be adjusted to meet the requirements of the application, allowing another dimension to the flexibility of the Universal Mini-Controller.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present the conception, {{technological}} fabrication and electrical characterization of 3 D hybrid pixel detector modules based on read out chips (ROCs) with through silicon vias (TSVs) which are flip chip bonded onto silicon photon sensors for X-ray detection. The TSVs in the ROCs enable a vertical routing of their peripheral IOs to the back side where they are spread to a land grind array (LGA) with 800 μm pitch. Thus, {{the back side of}} the ROCs can be used for next level interconnection to LTCC system boards which allows a pure vertical system architecture. With this routing concept, area-consuming wire bond connections from the peripheral IOs of the ROCs to the system board can be avoided which is the base for edgeless detector configurations with a tiled assembly of ROCs without imaging dead zones. To enable the envisioned vertical system concept, the ROCs were post-processed with 100 μm deep copper filled TSVs, front and back side redistribution, micro solder bumps for connection to the detector and land grid array (LGA) for connection to the system board. The UFXC 32 k (Ultra Fast X-ray Chip with 32 k channels) served as ROC device featuring an array of 32768 pixel IOs using a pitch of 75 mm, 87 <b>peripheral</b> <b>chip</b> IOs and a total size of 2 cm 2. The sensor tiles were post-processed with copper pads to enable a side by side flip chip assembly of two ROCs onto each sensor. The LGAs on {{the back side of the}} ROCs were used to mount the sub-modules to the LTCC system boards, which were pre-assembled with SMDs and corresponding solder ball arrays. The fabricated 3 D hybrid pixel modules show a good electrical performance and passed real X-ray imaging experiments. A high interconnect yield was achieved with only maximum 17 dead pixels out of 65536 total pixels per detector. These investigations took place in a joint project between Fraunhofer IZM in Berlin and AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow...|$|E

Like the other engineers on the team, Peddle visited potential customers and solicited their feedback. Peddle and John Buchanan built {{one of the earliest}} 6800 demonstration boards.

50|$|Motorola {{responded to}} MOS Technology's $20 {{microprocessor}} by immediately reducing the single-unit {{price of the}} 6800 microprocessor from $175 to $69 and then suing MOS Technology in November 1975. Motorola claimed that the eight former Motorola engineers used technical information developed at Motorola {{in the design of}} the 6501 and 6502 microprocessors. MOS Technology's other business, calculator chips, was declining due to a price war with Texas Instruments so their financial backer, Allen-Bradley, decided to limit the possible losses and sold the assets of MOS Technology back to the founders. The lawsuit was settled in April 1976 with MOS Technology dropping the 6501 chip that would plug into a Motorola 6800 socket and licensing Motorola's <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips.</b> Motorola reduced the single-unit price of the 6800 to $35.|$|R
50|$|Motorola's next {{generation}} 8-bit microprocessor architecture, the MC6809 (1979), {{was used in}} the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer and the compatible Dragon 32/64 which was sold in Europe. SWTPC also released a 6809 based system, the s/09, as did other SS-50 vendors. The 6809 was not binary code compatible with the 6800, but nearly all assembly code would assemble and run on the 6809; 6800 family <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> worked as a matter of course. The later 16/32 bit 68000 was incompatible at both the binary and assembly code level with the 68xx MPUs, but some higher level source code software could be used (e.g., programs in Pascal, FORTH, or FORTRAN); most of the 6800 family perhipheral chips could be used (with some care) with the 68xxx MPUs) and even more easily with the 68008 (8-bit bus version).|$|R
50|$|LPC's main {{advantage}} is that the basic bus requires only seven signals, greatly {{reducing the number of}} pins required on <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips.</b> An integrated circuit using LPC will need 30 to 72 fewer pins than its ISA equivalent. It is also easier to route on modern motherboards, which are often quite crowded. The clock rate was chosen to match that of PCI in order to further ease integration. Also, LPC is intended to be a motherboard-only bus. No connector is defined, and no LPC peripheral daughterboards are available, except Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) with a TPM daughterboard whose pinout is proprietary to the motherboard vendor. Device discovery is not supported; since only motherboard devices or specific models of TPM are connected, the host firmware (BIOS, UEFI) image will include a static description of any devices and their I/O addresses expected to be present on a particular motherboard.|$|R
40|$|A delay-insensitive inter-chip {{communication}} system is proposed that optimises pin- and power-efficiency. When data {{is being transmitted}} bidirectionally, a data symbol passed in one direction is acknowledged by a data symbol passing in the other direction.

50|$|To get {{the best}} results out of the 8088's modest performance, many popular {{software}} applications were written specifically for the IBM PC. The developers of these programs opted to write directly to the computer's (video) memory and <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips,</b> bypassing MS-DOS and the BIOS. For example, a program might directly update the video refresh memory, instead of using MS-DOS calls and device drivers to alter {{the appearance of the}} screen. Many notable software packages, such as the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft's Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0, directly accessed the IBM PC's hardware, bypassing the BIOS, and therefore did not work on computers that were even trivially different from the IBM PC. This was especially common among games. As a result, the systems that were not fully IBM PC-compatible couldn't run this software, and quickly became obsolete. Rendered obsolete with them was the CP/M-inherited concept of OEM versions of MS-DOS meant to run (through BIOS calls) on non IBM-PC hardware.|$|R
5000|$|Zilog {{introduced}} {{a number of}} peripheral parts for the Z80, which all supported the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space. These included the Counter/Timer Channel (CTC), the SIO (Serial Input Output), the DMA (Direct Memory Access), the PIO (Parallel Input-Output) and the DART (Dual Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter). As the product line developed, low-power, high-speed and CMOS versions of these chips were produced.Like the 8080, 8085 and 8086 processors, but unlike processors such as the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502, the Z80 and 8080 had a separate control line and address space for I/O instructions. While some Z80-based computers such as the Osborne 1 used [...] "Motorola-style" [...] memory mapped input/output devices, usually the I/O space was used to address {{one of the many}} Zilog <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> compatible with the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.|$|R
5000|$|The 8080 {{supports}} up to 256 input/output (I/O) ports, accessed via dedicated I/O instructions taking port addresses as operands. This I/O mapping {{scheme was}} regarded as an advantage, as it freed up the processor's limited address space. Many CPU architectures instead use so-called memory-mapped I/O, in which a common address space is used for both RAM and <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips.</b> This removes the need for dedicated I/O instructions, although a drawback in such designs may be that special hardware must be used to insert wait states, as peripherals are often slower than memory. However, in some simple 8080 computers, I/O was indeed addressed {{as if they were}} memory cells, [...] "memory-mapped", leaving the I/O commands unused. I/O addressing could also sometimes employ the fact that the processor would output the same 8-bit port address to both the lower and the higher address byte (i.e. [...] would put the address 0505h on the 16-bit address bus). Similar I/O-port schemes were used in the backward-compatible Zilog Z80 and Intel 8085, as well as the closely related x86 families of microprocessors.|$|R

50|$|Peddle {{continued}} {{working for}} Motorola while looking for investors {{for his new}} microprocessor concept. In August 1974 Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. He was followed by seven other Motorola engineers: Harry Bawcum, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, Mike James, Will Mathis, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. Peddle's group at MOS Technology developed two new microprocessors that were compatible with the Motorola <b>peripheral</b> <b>chips</b> like the 6820 PIA. Rod Orgill designed the MCS6501 processor that would plug into a MC6800 socket and Bill Mensch did the MCS6502 that had the clock generation circuit on chip. These microprocessors would not run 6800 programs {{because they had a}} different architecture and instruction set. The major goal was a microprocessor that would sell for under $25. This would be done by removing non-essential features to reduce the chip size. An 8-bit stack pointer was used instead of a 16-bit one. The second accumulator was omitted. The address buffers did not have a three-state mode for Direct Memory Access (DMA) data transfers. The goal was to get the chip size down to 153 mils x 168 mils (3.9 mm x 4.3 mm).|$|R
50|$|When National Semiconductor {{decided to}} leave the Unix market, the chip was {{redesigned}} into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on <b>chip</b> <b>peripherals.</b> The <b>chip</b> turned out to be too expensive for the laser printer market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, Sequent introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design's few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The MIPS R2000 (1984) and R3000 (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by SGI, among others. Other designs included the Zilog Z80000, which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly.|$|R
