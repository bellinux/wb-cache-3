40|$|Very often, {{decision}} <b>procedures</b> <b>in</b> a <b>committee</b> compensate potential manipulations {{by taking}} into account the ordered profile of qualifications. It is therefore rejected the standard assumption of an underlying associative binary connective allowing the evaluation of arbitrary finite sequences of items by means of a one-by-one sequential process. In this paper we develop a mathematical approach for non-associative connectives allowing a sequential definition by means of binary fuzzy connectives. It will be then stressed that a connective rule should be understood as a consistent sequence of binary connective operators. Committees should previously decide about which connective rule they will be condidering, not just about a single operator...|$|R

40|$|The {{call for}} "more {{transparency}} " is voiced nowadays by politicians and pundits alike, {{as a solution}} to almost any failure of the political system. Proponents of transparency emphasize its bene…ts such as enhanced accounability, enhanced predictability, and the provision of expert information to the economy. Both political scientists and economists noted however that, in the presence of career or reputation concerns, transparency may yield ine ¢ cient decisions as decision makers will not necessarily state their private views in public, thereby distorting the process of information aggregation. In this paper I consider the optimality of transparency of committees. 1 I build on a model of committees composed of experts who have career concerns, provided in Levy (forthcoming). When the decision making <b>procedure</b> <b>in</b> a <b>committee</b> is transparent, outsiders can observe the individual votes of the experts, whereas when it is secretive, only its …nal decision is known to outsiders. As I emphasize in Levy (forthcoming), whether committees should be transparent or secretive cannot be analyze...|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{villager}} committee {{elections have}} entered {{a phase of}} legalization and standardization, {{as indicated by the}} formal promulgation of the Organic Law on Villager <b>Committees</b> <b>in</b> 1998. Jilin Province is the birthplace of the haixuan method of villager committee elections. Haixuan, or “sea election, ” means that candidates are not predetermined by higher-level government offices or leaders but nominated by villagers having the right to vote. Final candidates are then determined according to the number of nominations each individual receives. (Wang Zhoutian, 1995) As early as 1986, a portion of Lishu County, Jilin Province began using the haixuan method. By the 4 th round of village <b>committee</b> elections <b>in</b> 1997, 86. 8 % of all villages in Jilin Province had moved to the haixuan method. (Jilin Province People’s Congress Internal Affairs and Justice Committee, et al., 2001) In November 2000, the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress in Jilin Province ratified the Jilin Province Measures for the Election of Villager <b>Committees,</b> standardizing many <b>procedures</b> <b>in</b> villager <b>committee</b> elections.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study analyses {{the procedure for}} adopting the draft State Budget in the Parliaments of selected member states of the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Great Britain, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden). The {{aim of this study}} is to outline the possibility for deputies, deputy groups and parliamentary groups to present amendments to the draft State Budget (for example, to present amendments to the total revenues and expenditures, to the structure of the expenditure side etc.). In the United Kingdom and in the Nordic countries, the Governments have a strong competence in budgetary matters and in the process of voting on the budget in the Parliaments, the deputies have limited competence to table amendments to the draft State Budget. Moreover, deputies of coalition parties in the above mentioned countries tend to fully respect the Government proposal and do not submit amendments during discussions in Parliament. On the other hand, deputies in countries such as Belgium, the Slovak Republic and Estonia can have an impact on the state expenditure of the Budget during the voting <b>procedure</b> and <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> discussions; this is evidenced by the fact that the sum of all approved deputy proposals amending the draft State Budget for 2005 exceeded 1 per mille of their GDP. In most other countries, amendments may be tabled by MPs, deputy groups or parliamentary groups. Only in Sweden may amendments to the proposed state budget be submitted only by deputy groups or parliamentary groups (individual MPs can not submit amendments) ...|$|R

40|$|The Gender and Excellence {{expert group}} {{was set up}} to provide {{recommendations}} on the improvement of transparency <b>in</b> the <b>procedures</b> used <b>in</b> selection <b>committees</b> for the award of grants and fellowships and in access to research funding in general. This report gives an analysis of the gender dynamics among applicants, recipients and gatekeepers of research funding, in funding processes, instruments and criteria, and the role of key funding organisations in promoting gender equality in research. The analysis was carried out in 33 countries, an overview of which is annexed to the report. These countries could be roughly divided into two groups: proactive countries, which promote and monitor gender equality in research and research funding with active policies and measures, and countries relatively inactive in this area, with few, if any, initiatives. The expert group has not found a large and systematic gender imbalance in terms of success rates in research funding in the funding systems studied, although a few exceptions exist. However, there is a clear difference in application behaviour: women are less likely to apply for funding than men, and this needs further study. To encourage the funding organisations and other stakeholders to take the gender challenge in research funding seriously in practice and take action, this report provides a number of recommendations, flags up some good practices, and outlines future research themes...|$|R

5000|$|Since 1947, the Prime Minister of Japan {{has been}} chosen in the [...] "designation {{election}} of the prime minister" [...] (Naikaku sōridaijin shimei senkyo, 内閣総理大臣指名選挙) in the National Diet. It is held after a cabinet has submitted its resignation - the outgoing cabinet remains as caretaker cabinet until the Imperial inauguration ceremony of a new prime minister -; a cabinet must resign en masse under the constitution (Articles 69 and 70) 1. always on convocation of the first Diet after a general {{election of the}} House of Representatives, 2. if the post of prime minister has fallen vacant - that includes cases when the prime minister is permanently incapacitated, e.g. by illness, kidnapping or defection -, or 3. if a no-confidence vote in the House of Representatives is not answered by {{the dissolution of the}} chamber. Though both Houses of the Diet vote in two-round elections to select a prime minister, the House of Representatives has the decisive vote: If the two Houses vote for different candidates (as they did in 1948, 1989, 1998, 2007 and 2008), a <b>procedure</b> <b>in</b> the joint <b>committee</b> of both houses (ryōin kyōkaigi) may reach a consensus; but eventually the candidate of the House of Representatives becomes that of the whole Diet and thereby prime minister-designate. The designated prime minister must still be ceremonially appointed by the Emperor in the Imperial Investiture (shinninshiki) to enter office; but unlike some heads of state, the Emperor has no reserve power to appoint anyone other than the person elected by the Diet.|$|R
