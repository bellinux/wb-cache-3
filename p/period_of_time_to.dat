5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which {{was reflected in the}} title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E
5|$|The moult {{of their}} flight {{feathers}} can cause serious problems for birds, {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly. Different species have evolved different strategies for coping with this, ranging from dropping all their flight feathers at once (and thus becoming flightless for some relatively short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time)</b> <b>to</b> extending the moult {{over a period of}} several years.|$|E
5|$|September 10, 1964– Hurricane Dora makes {{landfall}} as {{a weakening}} Category 2 hurricane near Jacksonville, the first hurricane in an extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> strike the area. Dora produces moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation which peaks at 23.73inches (603mm) in Mayo, causing flooding damage and killing one from drowning. Wind gusts peak at 125mph (200km/h) near St. Augustine, causing massive utility failures and heavy damage to buildings. Two Navy personnel die when their evacuating plane crashed upon takeoff. Damage totaled about $220million (1964USD, $1.53billion 2008USD).|$|E

5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full New London service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for a certain <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed for a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|The UN also {{declares}} and co-ordinates international observances, <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> observe issues <b>of</b> {{international interest}} or concern. Examples include World Tuberculosis Day, Earth Day, and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.|$|R

5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath {{for use as a}} viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
5|$|White nose {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} associated with the deaths of millions of bats in the Eastern United States and Canada. The disease is named after a white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, found growing on the muzzles, ears, and wings of afflicted bats. This fungus, which is mostly spread from bat to bat, is the sole cause of the disease. The fungus was first discovered in central New York State in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire Eastern US north of Florida; mortality rates of 90–100% have been observed in most caves. New England and the mid-Atlantic states have, since 2006, witnessed entire species completely extirpated and others with numbers that have gone from the hundreds of thousands, even millions, to a few hundred or less. The provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick have witnessed identical die offs, with the Canadian government making preparations to protect all remaining bat populations in its territory. Scientific evidence suggests that longer winters where the fungus has a longer <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> infect bats results in greater chances of mortality. In 2014, infection crossed the Mississippi River, but species native to northern Mexico and the West {{had not yet been}} affected.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, bank {{interest}} rates in Japan were near zero for an extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then {{the total value of}} money markets have remained low.|$|E

25|$|The basic medical {{degrees in}} India and Bangladesh are MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery), BHMS (Bachelor of Homoeopathic Medicine and Surgery) and BUMS (Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery). These {{generally}} {{consist of a}} four-and-a-half-year course followed by a year of compulsory rotatory internship in India. In Bangladesh it is five years course followed by a year of compulsory rotatory internship.
