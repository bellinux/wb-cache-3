40|$|In nuclear {{counting}} detection experiments, {{only small}} fraction of nuclei are <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> and recorded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> detector.

Therefore, the accuracy in measuring radioactivity of a material is directly proportional to the time allocated for measurement. Laboratories are faced with huge number of materials to be analyzed in a limited span of time. The objective in this research is to find the optimum testing time for these materials to minimize the inaccuracy. Since a smaller value for the standard deviation is used as a measure of accuracy, the problem translates into minimizing the standard deviations under time constraint. Analytical solution was devised for validation purposes. Results found using this formulation were compared with those using the analytical solution; both produced identical results...|$|R
