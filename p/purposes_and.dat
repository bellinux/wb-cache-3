40|$|<b>Purpose</b> <b>and</b> meaning are primary {{facets of}} eudaimonic well-being, yet are understudied in {{adolescent}} development. Using data from 579 adolescents from Latin American, Asian, and European backgrounds, demographic differences in <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> meaning, links with psychological and academic adjustment, links with ethnic identity, and the mediating role of <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> meaning in associations between {{ethnic identity and}} adjustment were examined. Although no generational or gender differences in <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> meaning were found, Asians reported higher search for meaning than did Latin Americans and Europeans. Presence of meaning was positively associated with self-esteem, academic attitudes and motivation, daily well-being, and ethnic affirmation and exploration, whereas search for meaning was related to lower self-esteem and less stability in daily well-being. Presence of meaning mediated associations between ethnic identity and adjustment, explaining 28 - 52 % of the initial effect of ethnic identity and providing one mechanism to account for ethnic identity’s protective effect on development.
