40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple Unix-based repository that supports programming intensive courses. Initially {{motivated by the}} need to capture sample artifacts for the capstone course sequence, the repository has evolved to support program submission, on-line testing, and automated <b>program</b> <b>grading.</b> Repository features enforce naming conventions, assignment due dates, while supporting the use of Unix in programming classes. The repository also facilitates consistent on-line <b>program</b> <b>grading</b> along with detailed capture of program compilation and execution. Repository utilities are provided to support first-time adoption, for archiving repositories from past terms, and for establishing repositories for a new academic term. Results from the transfer of the technology to first-time adopters are presented...|$|E
40|$|Today a {{large number}} of {{software}} tools are available to use computer to support traditional on-campus based courses. One such tool that we are using for automated <b>program</b> <b>grading</b> in our on-campus diploma programmes is Parikshak system. Today many Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are available for delivering courses online or in blended mode. Tools which are useful for on-campus course students can be easily integrated with the chosen LMS, to make them available for off-campus students. But, most of the times, these tools (like Parikshak) gets implemented as a standalone application without any inherent mechanism to allow seamless integration with other applications or frameworks. In this paper, we investigate how well Web services meet the interoperability requirements by transforming a real example of Parikshak system into a <b>program</b> <b>grading</b> Web services framework using the open source gSOAP toolkit and providing standard Web service interfaces for seamless integration to other applications...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the APA call for explicit “capstone ” experiences, we developed a new capstone course and examined {{the efficacy of the}} new course in an undergraduate psychology <b>program.</b> <b>Grading</b> rubrics for a capstone portfolio and student surveys were collected and analyzed. Students were meeting program goals to a significant degree and were generally satisfied with the course. As expected, students expecting higher grades for the course indicated greater satisfaction with the course. Students planning on attending graduate school had higher scores on all portfolio areas (goals, writing, overall points) while those planning on employment had significantly higher resume scores. Students taking the capstone course in their last term had significantly higher portfolio scores...|$|E
