25|$|Mycorrhizas {{are present}} in 92% of plant {{families}} studied (80% of species), with arbuscular mycorrhizas being the ancestral and predominant form, and the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom.</b> The structure of arbuscular mycorrhizas has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record, with both the development of ectomycorrhizas, {{and the loss of}} mycorrhizas, evolving convergently on multiple occasions.|$|E

25|$|The Herbaceous Grounds (Order Beds) were devised in {{the late}} 1860s by Sir Joseph Hooker, then {{director}} of the Royal Botanic Gardens, so that botany students could learn to recognise plants and experience at first hand {{the diversity of the}} <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom.</b> The collection is organised into family groups. Its name arose because plant families were known as natural orders in the 19th century. Over the main path is a rose pergola built in 1959 to mark the bicentennial of the Gardens. It supports climber and rambling roses selected for the length and profusion of flowering.|$|E
25|$|The fungal endophytes are {{a diverse}} group of organisms forming {{associations}} almost ubiquitously throughout the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom.</b> The endophytes which provide indirect defense against herbivores may have come from a number of origins, including mutualistic root endophyte associations and the evolution of entomopathogenic fungi into plant-associated endophytes. The endomycorrhiza, which live in plant roots, are made up of five groups: arbuscular, arbutoid, ericoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizae. The majority of species are from the phylum Glomeromycota with the ericoid species coming from the Ascomycota, while the arbutoid, monotropoid and orchid mycorrhizae are classified as Basidiomycota. The entomopathogenic view has gained support from observations of increased fungal growth in response to induced plant defenses and colonization of plant tissues.|$|E
50|$|Aminopeptidases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the cleavage of amino acids from the amino terminus (N-terminus) of proteins or peptides. They are widely {{distributed throughout the}} animal and <b>plant</b> <b>kingdoms</b> and are found in many subcellular organelles, in cytosol, and as membrane components. Aminopeptidases are used in essential cellular functions. Many, but not all, of these peptidases are zinc metalloenzymes.|$|R
40|$|Evolution {{of steroids}} such as sex hormones and ecdysteroids {{occurred}} independently {{in the animal}} and <b>plant</b> <b>kingdoms.</b> <b>Plants</b> use phytoecdysteroids (PEs) to control defense interactions with some predators; furthermore, PEs can exert beneficial influence on many aspects of mammalian metabolism. Endocrine disrupting compounds such as the estrogen agonist bisphenol A (BPA) are widespread in the environment, posing a potential hormonal risk to animals and plants. Adverse BPA effects on reproductive development and function are coupled with other toxic effects. BPA bioremediation techniques could be developed by exploiting some tolerant plant species...|$|R
5000|$|At first, {{microscopic}} organisms {{were classified}} within {{the animal and}} <b>plant</b> <b>kingdoms.</b> However, by the mid-19th century, it had become clear to many that [...] "the existing dichotomy of the <b>plant</b> and animal <b>kingdoms</b> become rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded". In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed a third kingdom of life, the Protista, for [...] "neutral organisms" [...] which were neither animal nor plant. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom {{a number of times}} before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants).|$|R
25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom,</b> being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E

500|$|Much {{was learned}} about plant {{sexuality}} by unravelling the reproductive mechanisms of mosses, liverworts and algae. In his [...] of 1851 Wilhelm Hofmeister (1824–1877) {{starting with the}} ferns and bryophytes demonstrated {{that the process of}} sexual reproduction in plants entails an [...] "alternation of generations" [...] between sporophytes and gametophytes. This initiated the new field of comparative morphology which, largely through the combined work of William Farlow (1844–1919), Nathanael Pringsheim (1823–1894), Frederick Bower, Eduard Strasburger and others, established that an [...] "alternation of generations" [...] occurs throughout the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom.</b>|$|E
500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of molecular methods for phylogenetic analysis, taxonomists considered fungi {{to be members of}} the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom</b> because of similarities in lifestyle: both fungi and plants are mainly immobile, and have similarities in general morphology and growth habitat. Like plants, fungi often grow in soil and, in the case of mushrooms, form conspicuous fruit bodies, which sometimes resemble plants such as mosses. The fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, from which they appear to have diverged around one billion years ago. Some morphological, biochemical, and genetic features are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to the fungi, clearly separating them from the other kingdoms: ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{example of}} ancient Indian plant {{classification}} {{is found in}} the Rigveda, a collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns from about 3700–3100 BP. Plants are divided into [...] (trees), [...] (herbs useful to humans) and [...] (creepers), with further subdivisions. The sacred Hindu text Atharvaveda divides plants into eight classes: [...] (spreading branches), [...] (leaves with long clusters), [...] (bushy plants), [...] (which expands); [...] (those with monopodial growth), [...] (creeping plants), [...] (with many stalks), and [...] (plants with knotty joints). The Taittiriya Samhita classifies the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom</b> into , [...] and [...] (trees), [...] (shrubs with spreading branches), [...] (herbs), [...] (spreading plant), [...] (climber), [...] (bushy plant), [...] (creeper), and [...] (spreading on the ground). Other examples of early Indian taxonomy include Manusmriti, the Law book of Hindus, which classifies plants into eight major categories. Elaborate taxonomies also occur in the Charaka Samhitā, Sushruta Samhita and Vaisesika.|$|E

30|$|Cationic {{antimicrobial}} peptides are widespread {{throughout the}} animal and <b>plant</b> <b>kingdoms</b> and play {{a fundamental role in}} innate immune defense, both through direct antimicrobial activity and immunomodulatory effects (Lo and Lange 2015). Egg was reported to have antimicrobial activity arising partially from some egg yolk components such as immunoglobulin Y, but mostly from egg white components (Li-Chan et al. 1995; Kovacs-Nolan et al. 2005).

500|$|As {{early as}} the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo {{expressed}} the opinion that cultigens (as we call them now) were produced from wild plants {{as the result of}} the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods. In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided. This has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification. All biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups, known as a nested hierarchy, but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution. [...] The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371–286 BCE), known as the [...] "father of botany". In his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom</b> into trees, shrubs, undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated, flowering and non-flowering, deciduous or evergreen.|$|E
500|$|New {{and revised}} [...] "phylogenetic" [...] {{classification}} {{systems of the}} <b>plant</b> <b>kingdom</b> were produced, perhaps the most notable being that of August Eichler (1839–1887), and the massive 23 volume [...] of Adolf Engler (1844–1930) & Karl Prantl (1849–1893) published over the period 1887 and 1915. Taxonomy based on gross morphology was now being supplemented by using characters revealed by pollen morphology, embryology, anatomy, cytology, serology, macromolecules and more. The introduction of computers facilitated the rapid analysis of large data sets used for numerical taxonomy (also called taximetrics or phenetics). The emphasis on truly natural phylogenies spawned the disciplines of cladistics and phylogenetic systematics. The grand taxonomic synthesis An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants (1981) of American Arthur Cronquist (1919–1992) was superseded when, in 1998, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny of flowering plants based on the analysis of DNA sequences using the techniques of the new molecular systematics which was resolving questions concerning the earliest evolutionary branches of the angiosperms (flowering plants). The exact relationship of fungi to plants had for some time been uncertain. Several lines of evidence pointed to fungi being different from plants, animals and bacteria – indeed, {{more closely related to}} animals than plants. In the 1980s-90s molecular analysis revealed an evolutionary divergence of fungi from other organisms about 1 billion years ago – sufficient reason to erect a unique kingdom separate from plants.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and <b>Plant</b> <b>Kingdoms</b> was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809.
