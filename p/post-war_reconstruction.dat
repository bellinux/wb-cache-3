5|$|During the <b>post-war</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> era, Virginia {{adopted a}} {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E

5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of <b>Post-War</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E

Assigning values to recent and very recent architectural production is, in fact, variegated and controversial which, in many ways has established a dialogue with the old fabric. </p...|$|R
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues that faced Maxwell and the justices primarily involved <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E
5|$|With {{virtually}} no new work being commissioned, Holden spent {{the war years}} planning for the reconstruction {{that would be required}} once it was over. Holden {{was a member of the}} RIBA's twelve-man committee which formulated the institute's policy for <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Holden's town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin {{moved to}} London, leaving their son with his {{grandmother}} at Blashford in Hampshire. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote {{to the director of}} the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI). After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post. Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, This Is Colour (a history of the British dyeing industry) and New Towns For Old (on <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction).</b> These Are The Men (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. Conquest of a Germ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. Our Country (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction</b> meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and the {{issue of whether or not}} to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E
5|$|While {{in exile}} in London between 1940 and 1944, Pierlot served as both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and played an {{important}} role in wartime negotiations between the Allied powers, laying the foundation for Belgian <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Pierlot returned to Brussels where, against his wishes, he headed a fresh government of national unity until February 1945. Criticism from the political left and the failure of the new government to deal with the serious issues facing the country following the liberation led to the fall of the government in February 1945 and he was replaced by the socialist Achille Van Acker. Pierlot's stance against Leopold III during the war made him a controversial figure during his lifetime and he was widely disliked in the same royalist and conservative circles from which his own Catholic Party (later the Christian Social Party) drew most of its support. He retired from politics in 1946 amid the crisis of the Royal Question, surrounding whether Leopold could return to the Belgian throne, and died peacefully in 1963. After his death, Pierlot's reputation improved as the decisions he took during the war were reconsidered by historians.|$|E

40|$|For repatriates from Imperial {{colonies of}} Japan, {{continuity}} of human capital such as education, work experiences, and social class, is mainly examined those who return to main islands of Japan {{and only a}} few examined those who return from Taiwan. This study examines the repatriates from Taiwan to Okinawa, where <b>reconstruction</b> of the <b>post-war</b> period had been done by the control of United States. In particular, this paper focuses on those who were middle class in colonial Taiwan as bureaucrats, teachers and business men, and considers how they acquired social status at the time of decolonization and reconstruction of Okinawa with utilizing their human capitals. Moreover, with comparing the female repatriates to main islands of Japan, the life course of their daughters is considered. The findings of this study are as follows. First, the repatriates who were bureaucrats or teachers to Okinawa mostly take different job from the one in Taiwan. This is a sharp contrast to those who return to main islands of Japan got jobs that have any continuity with former career. Secondly, their daughters are also quite different, not only they did not quite jobs and be housewives, they could have university education and important positions in the reconstruction of Okinawa such as pharmacist, medical staffs, and teachers. Finally, these differences found to be based on different social background in <b>post-war</b> <b>reconstructions...</b>|$|R
25|$|The unique {{conditions}} attendant to {{the creation}} of the state led the Federal government to sometimes regard West Virginia as differing from the other border states in the <b>post-war</b> and <b>Reconstruction</b> Era. The terms of surrender granted to the Confederate army at Appomattox applied to the soldiers of the 11 Confederate states and West Virginia only. Returning Confederate soldiers from the other border states were required to obtain special permits from the War Department. Similarly, the Southern Claims Commission was originally designed to apply only to the 11 Confederate states and West Virginia, though claims from other states were sometimes honored.|$|R
