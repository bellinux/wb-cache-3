40|$|Regiospecific syntheses of {{the three}} monomethylthio analogues of 1 -(2, 4, 5 -trimethoxypheny 1) - 2 -aminopropane are described. The three {{isomeric}} amines were evaluated for potential psychotomimetic potency using the rabbit hyperthermia assay. Enantiomeric compositions and time-concentration curves in rat brains were determined following intraperitoneal administration of each compound. The biological data are contrasted with the corresponding results obtained with the potent human psychotogen l-(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -methylphenyl) - 2 -aminopropane (DOM). Extensive structure-activity relationship studies among the ring-substituted 1 -phenyl- 2 -aminopropanes have es-tablished that compounds bearing methoxy groups at the 2 and 5 positions and an alkyl, alkoxy, or halo substituent at the 4 position are potent psychotomimetic agents in man. l This ring-substitution pattern also {{is found in the}} sympatholytic agent 6 -hydroxydopamine (1). * We 3 and other workers 4 have examined the metabolic fate of the well-known <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> 1 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -methylphenyl) - 2 -aminopropane (2, DOM).

40|$|Excitatory {{amino acids}} (EAAs) {{are known to}} play an {{important}} role in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. This thesis examined effects of EAAs and modulators of EAA receptor activity on the release of ($ sp 3 $H) dopamine (($ sp 3 $H) DA) from dissociated cell cultures of ventral mesencephalon. The results provide evidence that multiple EAA receptor subtypes are present on DA-releasing neurons and participate in regulating this release. NMDA, quisqualate and kainate, preferred agonists for respectively named EAA receptor subtypes, stimulated Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$-dependent, tetrodotoxin (TTX) -insensitive ($ sp 3 $H) DA release, with 3 distinct profiles of sensitivity to antagonists and of ontogenic development in culture. Low concentrations of the endogenous EAAs, glutamate, homocysteate, homocysteine sulfinate, cysteate and cysteine sulfinate evoked Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$-dependent ($ sp 3 $H) DA release through activation of NMDA receptors, although non-NMDA receptors mediated effects of these agonists at higher concentrations ($ geq$ 100 $ mu$M, depending upon the EAA tested). Aspartate induced ($ sp 3 $H) DA release that was mediated solely by the NMDA receptor. Glycine potentiated NMDA-evoked ($ sp 3 $H) DA release when the test was made under nominally Mg$ sp{ 2 +}$-free conditions, but caused strychnine-sensitive inhibition of the NMDA response in the presence of 1. 2 mM Mg$ sp{ 2 +}$. It is suggested that these results demonstrate how voltage-dependent blockade of the NMDA receptor by Mg$ sp{ 2 +}$ may regulate sensitivity of NMDA responses to convergent inputs. Micromolar concentrations of the <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> phencyclidine (PCP) blocked NMDA-evoked ($ sp 3 $H) DA release. At higher concentrations ($ geq$ 100 $ mu$M), PCP-related compounds stimulated TTX-insensitive ($ sp 3 $H) DA release. This stimulatory effect was not due to actions of these compounds at the PCP/NMDA receptor, sigma binding site, dopamine uptake site, or cation channels for Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$ or Na$ sp{+}$, but may have been caused by K$ sp{+}$ channel blockade...|$|E

40|$|Subchronic {{administration}} of PCP, a <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> acting as an NMDAR channel blocker, produces in rodents a syndrome that models {{some aspects of}} schizophrenia. Our research investigates the consequences of PCP administration on glutamatergic functionality in rodents' prefrontal cortex (PFC). Rats were treated once daily for 7 or 14 days with either PCP (5 mg/kg) or saline. 24 h after the last treatment, glutamatergic functionality is evaluated in terms of glutamate release capacity in acute PFC slices stimulated with high KCl (60 mM). Slices from rats pre-exposed to PCP released less glutamate than slices from saline-treated animals. Such a defect persisted 72 h after the last treatment and was not observed in a different cortical area, the visual cortex. For 14 days treatments, the adaptive changes are extinguished 7 days after the last exposure to PCP. These findings were then reproduced in mice. Furthermore, we tested the effect of antipsychotics (haloperidol and olanzapine) in PCP-treated animals. PCP treatment lasted 14 days, antipsychotics were administered in parallel starting from the 8 th day (when the glutamate release defect is already established). Both antipsychotics reversed the PCP-induced defect, restoring a normal glutamate release capacity. The plastic modifications apparently occur {{at the level of}} glutamatergic terminals, as synaptosomes prepared from the PFC of PCP-treated animals showed defective glutamate release in comparison to control animals. In this preparation we are now studying the molecular target of PCP action, focusing our attention on a likely presynaptic NMDAR and the regulation of Ca__ increases leading to neurotransmitter release. Preliminar data demonstred that NMDA administration on PFC synaptosomes increases the glutamate release induced by 8 mM KCl, while a pre-incubation with PCP fully blocks this effect. In parallel, we are interested in assessing the effects of PCP treatment on PFC functionality, in order to establish a possible link between glutamatergic function, performance in behavioural tests involving this region and its metabolic activity during the test determined by 2 -deoxyglucose quantitative auroradiography. Thus, the 'PCP model' highlights functional anomalies that could underlie aspects of the psychopathology of schizophrenia (glutamatergic hypofunction) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{representative}} drugs from three classes of psychotomimetic compounds (arylcyclohexylamines, benzomorphan opioids and dioxolanes) {{have been examined}} on synaptic transmission at an identified monosynaptic pathway in rat hippocampal slices. The compounds tested were phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, the racemate and isomers of SKF 10, 047 (N-allylnormetazocine), and the isomers of dioxadrol (dexoxadrol and levoxadrol). In the absence of added magnesium ions (Mg) in the perfusion medium low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway evoked a burst of population spikes in the CA 1 cell body region. The secondary components of this response could be abolished by the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (APV). PCP (1 microM) or ketamine (10 microM) selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. The effect of PCP was neither mimicked nor prevented by hexamethonium and atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, or clonidine and was therefore unlikely to involve cholinergic or adrenergic neurotransmitter systems. The sigma opiate, (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 (10 microM) also abolished selectively the secondary components of the synaptic response. There was no apparent difference between the potency of the stereoisomers of this compound. The action of (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 was not affected by either naloxone or haloperidol, indicating that this effect did not involve opioid receptors or the haloperidol-sensitive sigma site. Dexoxadrol (10 microM), but not levoxadrol (10 microM), also selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. It is concluded that these <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> can block an NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and that this effect is mediated by a specific PCP/sigma site...|$|R
40|$|Stupor is {{an unusual}} but {{striking}} phenomenon generally recognized but difficult to define precisely. This condition is clinically characterized by the basic triad of akinesis, mutism and clear consciousness (Joyston-Bechal 1966). However, the degree of akinesis and mutism may vary. The patient characteristically assimilates the external stimuli but the output is curtailed. There {{are a number of}} causes for stupor and catatonic schizophrenia is one of the important ones (Gelenberg 1976). Neurological disorders (Plum 1972; Penn et al 1972), metabolic conditions including <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> such as mescaline and phencyclidine, ethyl alcohol and amphetamine (Gatewood et al 1975, Jaffe 1967), and pharmacological agents include aspirin, ACTH, and neuroleptics (Weinberger and Kelly 1978) produce a catatonic state. Therefore, catatonia is not always due to a functional psychiatric disorder and thus does not imply an automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia. In every case of a catatonic syndrome, a process of clarification of the etiological diagnosis must proceed systematically. Such a procedure will assist in making the proper diagnosis and administration of appropriate therapy. As the initial step, it is important to ascertain whether the patient is suffering from an organic or a functional illness by means of a good history, physical examination, and the results of laboratory investigations. A clear consciousness is more in favour of a functional disorder. Subsequently, it is imperative to search thoroughly for the etiology and then clinical diagnosis in functional stupor. To illustrate the importance of making the proper diagnosis of catatonic stupor, we wish to report the case history of a patient who presented with typical catatonic stupor and on investigation she was found to have temporal lobe epilepsy (Partial Comple...|$|R
40|$|WIDESPREAD {{interest}} in drugs currently used for treating emotional dis-orders {{has created the}} erroneous impression that pharmacologic approaches to psychiatric treatment are something new. Both the number and the variety of drugs employed {{in the past have}} been large. The present review will cover only those agents used for functional emotional disorders within the last 20 years, first considering briefly the older treatments. The fact that each of these has been described as ameliorating the course of emotional illness emphasizes the difficulty of evaluating such treatment. This aspect of drug therapy is still unchanged. The second purpose of this review will be to consider drugs presently used for treating emotional disorders. Some of these drugs are in fact new, both in their chemical structures and in their pharmacologic actions. Others are closely related to previous agents, as will be evident. The popularity of the new drugs has not diminished with time, their therapeutic effects being quite genuine {{in a wide variety of}} emotional illnesses. Considerable argu-ment still exists concerning their role in the total treatment of these disorders. Finally, we shall consider the enlarging series of <b>psychotomimetic</b> <b>agents.</b> These drugs, though not often applied therapeutically, are believed to be use-ful tools for investigating psychologic, neurophysiologic and biochemical phenomena of disturbed mental function. DRUGS IN EMOTIONAL DISORDERS: PAST The aims of drug therapy in emotional disorders a decade ago were analogous to those of the present. They may be categorized as follows: 1. Calming anxious or disturbed patients, an effect formerly called seda-tion, currently named tranquilization. A logical extension of this procedure was inducing sleep, the so-called "sleep therapies. " 2. Production by drugs of either convulsive or nonconvulsive shock therapy, rather than convulsive therapy initiated by electroshock. 3. Amelioration of depressed states by stimulation of the central nervous system. 4. Facilitation of psychotherapy by decreasing inhibitions and affording emotional release. * Received for publication June 1, 1959...|$|R
