While this technique has produced useful results it not clear how it may be extended to complex networks. In this report we introduce a linear model for point process systems. The finite Fourier transform of this model leads to a regression type analysis of the relations between spike trains. An advantage {{of this approach is}} that the full range of techniques for multivariate regression analyses becomes available for spike train analysis. The two main parameters used for the identification of neural networks are the <b>coherence</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>coherences.</b> The coherence defines a bounded measure of association between two spike trains and plays the role of a squared correlation coefficient defined at each frequency �.

50|$|Classically {{this was}} done with a SIMO (single-input, multiple-output) approach, that is, one {{excitation}} point, and then the response is measured at many other points. In the past a hammer survey, using a fixed accelerometer and a roving hammer as excitation, gave a MISO (multiple-input, single-output) analysis, which is mathematically identical to SIMO, due {{to the principle of}} reciprocity. In recent years MIMO (multi-input, multiple-output) have become more practical, where <b>partial</b> <b>coherence</b> analysis identifies which part of the response comes from which excitation source. Using multiple shakers leads to a uniform distribution of the energy over the entire structure and a better coherence in the measurement.

Here, we present another route to evaluate the <b>partial</b> directed <b>coherences</b> in multivariate time series. The method proposed is non parametric, and utilises the strong spectral factorization of the inverse of the spectral density matrix of the multivariate process. To perform the factorization, we have recourse to an algorithm developed by Davis and his collaborators.
