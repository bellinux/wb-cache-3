The men who had two radiographs available, the first taken some time between the above two dates and the latest available radiograph {{which had to be}} at least two years after the first one numbered 1454 : 793 continued exposure after the first radiograph and 661 did not. The films were read by a panel of three readers. Data available included age, years of exposure to asbestos and other mining, intensity of exposure to asbestos and other dust, and smoking habit. Progression was expressed as the difference between the average readings of radiograph 2 [...] radiograph 1 in minor categories per year of irregular opacities. Changes in pleural abnormality were also measured. No differences of progression in the profusion or change in size of the irregular opacities were found between the two groups or in the number of zones affected. "New attacks" appeared equally frequently between the two groups. No difference in the change in extent of any type of <b>pleural</b> <b>change</b> was seen.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{differences}} of high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary involvement of collagen vascular disease (CVD). We analyzed the HRCT findings of 33 patients with IPF and 23 patients with CVD in terms of predominant pattern, site of involvement, mediastinal lymph node enlargement, <b>pleural</b> <b>change,</b> and pulmonary volume loss. The predominant HRCT pattern was honeycombing for IPF (58 %), and ground-glass opacity for CVD (57 %). Predominantly subpleural involvement was seen in 90 % of IPF and 83 % of CVD patients. Mediastinal lymph node enlargement was seen in 61 % of the patients with IPF and 13 % with CVD (p = 0. 0004). Pleural thickening was seen in 97 % of the patients with IPF and 35 % with CVD and the severity of pleural thickening is statistically significant (p = 0. 00001). Pleural effusion was seen in 6 % of the patients with IPF and 26 % with CVD (p = 0. 0351). The hilar height ratio was more than 1. 5 in 52 % of the patients with IPF and 30 % with CVD (p = 0. 2620).

40|$|ABSTRACT During a 10 -year period (1970 - 79) all {{patients}} in Uppsala County {{found to have}} <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> related to asbestos exposure were followed. The lesions could be divided into four types: parietal pleural plaques, exudative pleurisy, thickening of the visceral pleura, and progressive pleural fibrosis. There were 891 cases. The most common type was parietal plaques, which was seen in 827 patients, some of whom later developed other changes. In 22 patients exudation was proven radiologically, and in 84 more cases obliteration of the costo-phrenic angle was seen. The exudations almost all had a benign course, despite sometimes fairly large and bloody effusions. They were practically all symptom-free, being a surprise finding on chest radiography. Thickening of the visceral pleura can only be seen radiologically in the fissures and occurred {{in a few cases}} in addition to other changes. In a small group of more heavily exposed individuals, a progressive pleural fibrosis developed, sometimes after an initial effusion. <b>Pleural</b> <b>changes</b> are common among those exposed to asbestos.

50|$|The ILO Classification system {{includes}} the printed Guidelines and sets of standard radiographs, available in both film and, as of 2011, digital forms. The reader compares the subject chest X-ray (only the appearances seen on postero-anterior, or PA, chest x-ray) {{with those of}} the standard set. The standard radiographs provide differing types ("shape and size") and severity ("profusion") of abnormalities seen in persons with pneumoconiosis, including Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis, silicosis, and asbestosis. The reader then classifies the subject x-ray, often recording the findings on the NIOSH Roentgenographic Interpretation form.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{interaction}} exists between smoking and exposure to asbestos in the occurrence of lung cancer, whereas occurrence of malignant mesothelioma has not been related to smoking. In the case of pleural thickening related to asbestos, there is a disagreement in previous studies as to the effect of smoking. This could be because the diagnosis of <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> has a subjective element. Taking this into account, in the present work the maximum width of the pleura was used as an index of <b>pleural</b> <b>changes.</b> Study subjects were 134 asbestos workers of a brake manufacturing company who had received medical checks in 1978 and in 1990. The maximum width of the pleura on the chest x ray films of the workers was measured by two examiners who did not know the year of examination or smoking state of the worker. A general linear model was applied to analyse the effects of smoking, the year of examination, age, and duration of exposure to asbestos. The difference between maximum widths measured in 1978 and 1990 suggested chronological progression. The increase in width during the 12 years, however, did not differ significantly between smokers and nonsmokers. This suggests that smoking does not significantly increase pleural thickening in asbestos workers...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos is a {{naturally}} deposited fibrous mineral that was extensively mined and industrially used over many {{decades in the}} 20 th century. Today the use of asbestos is largely restricted or banned in many industrialised countries because of well-known adverse health effects. Apart from the carcinogenic effect (lung cancer, laryngeal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma), exposure to asbestos dust can cause various benign changes of the lung (asbestosis) and the pleura (pleural plaques and diffuse pleural thickening). Statutory accident insurance institutions in Germany are legally required to actively detect clinical symptoms and conditions depending on occupational history, and to compensate asbestos-related diseases. The insurance institutions have therefore organised standardised surveillance programmes for the early detection of asbestos-related diseases. It is generally accepted that computed tomography has a higher sensitivity and specificity for the early detection of asbestos related changes of lung and pleura, but the required higher radiation dose in former times and the higher costs precluded a wider use in early detection programmes. 3257 most former power industry workers {{were included in the}} analysis. Based on exposure history, smoking history and age at the time of examination, a subgroup of participants was considered as having an increased risk of developing asbestos-related radiologic changes. These participants were examined with MDCT (n= 196), the participants with lower risk were examined with chest X-ray (n= 3061). The aim of our study was to assess the importance of common risk factors associated with specific radiological changes such as parenchymal fibrosis and pleural thickening. We did this with the view that determining rates of radiological changes typical for specific risk profiles would help differentiate large scale surveillance and early detection programmes. To assess the influence of selected risk factors (age, time since first exposure, exposure duration, cumulative exposure and pack years) on typical asbestos-related radiographic changes, we applied multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. On X-ray we found low rates of asbestos-induced parenchymal (1 %) and <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> (plaques 7. 9 %, diffuse pleural thickening 5. 9 %) compared to MDCT (20. 4 % parenchymal and 57. 1 % <b>pleural</b> <b>changes).</b> On CXR, <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> and asbestosis were strongly associated with age, years since first exposure and exposure duration. Plaques were also associated with cumulative exposure and diffuse pleural thickening and parenchymal changes with pack-years. In the CT group parenchymal changes were associated with age and pack-years whereas <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> were associated with latency, exposure duration and cumulative exposure. The ROC analysis resulted in optimal cut-offs of 55 years for age, 17 years for the exposure time and 38 years for latency to discriminate between patients with and without radiological chances. Participants aged 55 years and older and those with an asbestos exposure of at least 17 years or 28 years since first exposure should be seen as having an increased risk of abnormal radiological findings...|$|R
2500|$|The {{abnormal}} {{chest x-ray}} and its interpretation remain {{the most important}} factors in establishing the presence of pulmonary fibrosis. The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the ILO Classification system, [...] "s", [...] "t", and/or [...] "u" [...] opacities predominate. CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT) are more sensitive than plain radiography at detecting pulmonary fibrosis (as well as any underlying <b>pleural</b> <b>changes).</b> More than 50% of people affected with asbestosis develop plaques in the parietal pleura, the space between the chest wall and lungs.

The patient developed a febrile illness with wide-spread bilateral lung infiltrations nonresponsive to b-lactam and macrolide antibiotics. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy showed a "hypersensitivity-like " interstitial lung disease, which cleared almost completely within 2 months after simple drug withdrawal.

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} {{evaluate}} certain parameters that might indicate {{the beginning of a}} certain fibrogenic activity in the lung parenchyma, even before such changes become visible on the chest x-ray. The hypothesis is that studies such as certain bronchoalveolar immunological characteristics and Gallium- 67 lung scans may be more sensitive indicators of parenchymal lung damage in response to asbestos inhalation than conventional radiographic criteria. If so, then in those cases where the criteria for the diagnosis of asbestosis lack the presence of parenchymal changes, it would be unwise to deny the diagnosis unless further investigations, such as the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis and the Gallium- 67 lung scan techniques, are made available. ^ Four groups of individuals have been included in this study. The volunteer group showing no history of asbestos exposure with normal chest x-rays {{has been used as a}} normal healthy comparison group. The other three groups are all asbestos-exposed but differ as to their findings in the chest radiographs. One has parenchymal changes (0 / 1 or more, ILO Classification), the second has no parenchymal but <b>pleural</b> <b>changes,</b> and the third has neither. ^ The most significant laboratory parameter for bronchoalveolar lavage, in this study, is that of Neutrophils (PMNs). All three asbestos-exposed groups showed no differences when compared with each other, while such differences were statistically significant when such groups were separately compared with the normal comparison group. A similar finding existed also when the Helper: Suppressor T-Cell ratios were compared, and found to be higher in all the asbestos-exposed groups. ^ Another sensitive test is that of Gallium- 67 lung scan. This was found to be positive in some patients where parenchymal changes were absent. Even in some of those who showed neither parenchymal nor <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> in their chest x-ray showed positive test results. Such changes indicate a state of an underlying pathogenic process that is still undetectable by conventional radiography. This highly recommends the future application of such tests for the early detection of active pulmonary disease, especially in those who show no parenchymal changes in their chest x-rays.

40|$|Introduction: Jarcho-Levin {{syndrome}} is manifested by vertebral body and rib malformations. Large rib defects with paradoxical chest motion lead to early deathdue to progressive respiratory insufficiency, hence it is a lethal syndrome. The {{only means of}} improving survival is early stabilisation of the chest wall defect by containing the thoracic herniation. Nitcher et al. and Thatte et al. showed that reconstruction of the chest wall was life saving. Thatte et al. had postulated that early coverage of the lungs and thoracic contents with functional latissimus dorsi may prevent the visceral overgrowth and secondary <b>pleural</b> <b>changes.</b> Materials and Methods: Our three cases which had medium- and long-term follow-up help to support this postulation. Three patients were assessed retrospectively. Their ages at surgery were 6 months, 8 months and 1 year, respectively. All had laboured breathing and paradoxical respiration. All of them were operated with ipsilateral latissimus dorsi flap. Results: The results were evaluated clinically. The patients had reduced or no respiratory infections.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of mesothelioma in {{man has been}} shown to be associated with exposure to asbestos fibres (Wagner et al., 1960) while in unexposed populations these tumours are rare. A doseresponse relationship for mesothelioma has been shown in several different groups of asbestos workers (Newhouse & Berry, 1976; McDonald & McDonald, 1980) and data from the Devonport Dockyard population at Plymouth tends to support this (Sheers & Coles, 1980). These workers have been extensively studied and their exposure to asbestos carefully documented (Harries, 1976, 1977). Terasaki et al. (1977) have pointed out that there is no strong abnormality in overall HLA antigen frequency among solid cancers, and they only demonstrated a weak negative association between HLA-A 1 and B 8 and carcinoma of the prostate. In studies of lung cancer significant positive HLA associations have been reported with good prognosis although at diagnosis these associations have not been found. (Weis et al., 1980; Ford et al., 1981). Lung cancer is associated with smoking and in asbestos workers there is a multiplicative effect (Berry et al., 1972). Smoking, however, has no effect on mesothelioma rate (McDonald & McDonald, 1980). Studies of genetic markers in mesotheliomas are of interest, therefore, because it is the response to asbestos dust by itself which might be shown to be influenced by genetic constitution. An investigation of the HLA-A and B antigen frequencies in relation to asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis and various <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> has been undertaken in the Devonport Dockyard population (Darke et al., 1979).

OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluate more details of imaging findings to help earlier diagnosis of pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 66 patients with positive smear for AFB and no response to first line anti-TB drugs were divided into two groups by PCR and culture: MDR-TB (43 patients) and NTM (23 patients). Age, sex, history of anti-TB treatment, smoking and CT-scan findings (parenchymal, pleural and mediastinal variables) by details and lobar distribution were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean age of NTM patients was slightly higher (52 versus 45) and there is no significant difference in sex and smoking. In MDR-TB group, history of anti-TB treatment and evidence of chronic pulmonary disease such as calcified and fibrodestructed parenchyma, volume loss and pleural thickening were higher significantly. Cavities in MDR-TB were thickwall in the background of consolidation, while NTM cavities were more thin-walled with adjacent satellite nodules in same segment or lobe. Prevalence of bronchiectasis was similar in both groups, while bronchiectasis in MDR-TB group was in fibrobronchiectatic background in upper lobes, and in NTM group the distribution was more uniform with slightly middle lobes predominance. Prevalence and distribution of nodular infiltrations were similar more in Tree in Buds and scattered pattern. Calcified or non-calcified lymph nodes and also <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> were more frequent in MDR-TB but prevalence of lymphadenopathy was mildly higher in NTM.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} possible {{relations between}} respiratory health and past airborne exposure to refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs) and respirable dust in workers at six European factories, studied previously in 1987.  METHODS—The target population comprised all current workers associated with RCF production, plus {{others who had}} participated in 1987  "leavers". Information was collected on personal characteristics, chest radiographs, lung function, respiratory symptoms, smoking, and full occupational history. Regression analysis was used to study relations between indices of health of individual workers and of cumulative exposure to airborne dust and fibres, and likely past exposure to asbestos.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION— 774 workers participated (90 % of current workers, 37 % of leavers). Profusion of small opacities in exposed workers (51 % 0 / 1 +; 8 % 1 / 0 +) was similar to that among an unexposed control group but higher than in new readings of the 1987  study films (11 % 0 / 1 +, 2 % 1 / 0 +). The large difference between 1987  and recent films may be, at least in part, a reading artefact associated with film appearance. Small opacities of International Labour Organisation (ILO) category 1 / 0 + were not associated with exposure. An association of borderline significance overall between 0 / 1 + opacities and exposure to respirable fibres was found for some exposure periods only, the time related pattern being biologically implausible. <b>Pleural</b> <b>changes</b> were related to age and exposure to asbestos, and findings were consistent with an effect of time since first exposure to RCFs. Among men, forced expired volume in 1  second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were inversely related to exposure to fibres, in current smokers only. FEV 1 / FVC ratio and transfer factor (TLCO) were not related to exposures. The estimated restrictive effect was on average mild. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms was low.

40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{inhalation}} of glass fibers and amosite asbestos are currently under study in hamsters. The study includes 18 months of inhalation exposure followed by lifetime recovery. Syrian golden hamsters are exposed, nose only, for 6 hr/day, 5 day/week to size-selected test fibers: MMVF 10 a (Schuller 901 insulation glass); MMVF 33 (Schuller 475 durable glass); amosite asbestos (three doses); or to filtered air (controls). Here we report interim results on airborne fiber characterization, lung fiber burden, and pathology (preliminary) through 12 months. Aerosolized test fibers averaged 15 to 20 microns {{in length and}} 0. 5 to 1 micron in diameter. Target aerosol concentrations of World Health Organization (WHO) fibers (longer than 5 microns) were 250 fibers/cc for MMVF 10 a and MMVF 33, and 25, 125, or 250 fibers/cc for amosite. WHO fiber lung burdens showed time-dependent and (for amosite) dose-dependent increases. After a 12 -month exposure, lung burdens of fibers longer than 20 microns were greatest with amosite high and mid doses, similar for low-dose amosite and MMVF 33, and smaller for MMVF 10 a. Biological responses of animals exposed for 12 months to MMVF 10 a were limited to nonspecific pulmonary inflammation. However, exposures to MMVF 33 and each of three doses of amosite were associated with lung fibrosis and possible mesotheliomas (1 with MMVF 33 and 2, 3, and 1 with amosite low, mid, and high doses, respectively). Pulmonary and <b>pleural</b> <b>changes</b> associated with amosite were qualitatively and quantitatively more severe than those associated with MMVF 33. As of the 12 -month time point, this study demonstrates that two different fiber glass compositions with similar fiber dimensions but different durabilities can have distinctly different effects on the hamster lung and pleura after inhalation exposure. (Preliminary tumor data through 18 months of exposure and 6 weeks of postexposure recovery became available as this manuscript went to press: No tumors were observed in the control or MMVF 10 a groups, and no additional tumors were observed in the MMVF 33 group; however, a number of additional mesotheliomas were observed in the amosite groups...|$|R
40|$|Parapneumonic {{effusion}} is {{a common}} clinical problem, and those that go on to develop pleural infection have high morbidity and mortality. The process of pleural infection evolution involves <b>changes</b> in <b>pleural</b> physiology that are increasingly being elucidated and understood. The microbiology of <b>pleural</b> infection has <b>changed</b> over recent years, with clear differences emerging between hospital- and community-acquired infections. Using biochemical surrogates of infection, chest drainage can be undertaken rationally {{for those who do}} not respond to antibiotics alone. Recent data suggest that fibrinolytics do not influence outcomes in pleural infection. The optimal type and timing of surgery remain controversial...|$|R

40|$|The changes {{induced by}} {{exercise}} on {{the mechanics of}} breathing, {{as well as the}} simultaneous changes occurring in arterial blood gas tensions and in respiratory gas exchange were investigated in 6 healthy thoroughbred horses, performing a treadmill exercise of increasing intensity. Respiratory airflow and tidal volume (VT) were measured with ultrasonic flowmeters. <b>Pleural</b> pressure <b>changes</b> were measured by an oesophageal balloon catheter. Gas concentration of the expired air was analysed with a mass spectrometer; the oxygen consumption (VO 2) and the carbon dioxide output (VCO 2) were computed breath-by-breath. Arterial blood gas values were obtained by sampling from the carotid artery. Between rest and fast gallop VT, respiratory frequency, expired minute ventilation (VE), VO 2, VCO 2, total pulmonary resistance (RL), mechanical work of breathing (Wrm) and PaCO 2 increased significantly while PaO 2 decreased significantly. The Wrm. VO 2 (- 1) ratio in galloping horses increased exponentially with VE. This, together with the relationship between the changes in PaO 2 and in PaCO 2 and the increase in the ventilatory mechanics parameters, suggests that the mechanics of breathing {{may be one of the}} factors constraining further increase in ventilation in exercising healthy horses.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to understand better the mechanisms leading to the decrease in exercise capacity observed in horses suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Five COPD horses were submitted to a standardized submaximal treadmill exercise test while they were in clinical remission or in acute crisis. Respiratory airflow, O 2 and CO 2 fractions in the respired gas, <b>pleural</b> pressure <b>changes</b> and heart rate were recorded, and arterial and mixed venous blood were analyzed for gas tensions, hemoglobin, and plasma lactate concentrations. O 2 consumption, CO 2 production, expired minute ventilation, tidal volume, alveolar ventilation, cardiac output, total pulmonary resistance, and mechanical work of breathing were calculated. The results showed that, when submaximally exercised, COPD horses in crisis were significantly more hypoxemic and hypercapnic and that their total pulmonary resistance and mechanical work of breathing were significantly higher and their expired minute ventilation significantly lower than when they were in remission. However, their O 2 consumption remained unchanged, which was probably due to the occurrence of compensatory mechanisms, i. e., higher heart rate, cardiac output, and hemoglobin concentration. Last, their net anaerobic metabolism seemed to be more important. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the chest radiographs of 50 adult patients with histologically verified histiocytosis X, proposes a radiological classification, and examines {{the role of}} radiology in assessing the prognosis of the disease. Radiologically the lesions predominate {{in the middle and}} lower lung fields, usually sparing the costophrenic angles, and are typically micronodular, reticular, or cystic. These features are especially suggestive of histiocytosis X if lung volume is normal or increased, there is an associated pneumothorax, they occur in a young male and there are no other intrathoracic <b>changes</b> (<b>pleural</b> or mediastinal). The three evolutionary patterns of improvement, stabilisation, and worsening are analysed with respect to the initial radiological features; one which carries a good prognosis is sparing of both costophrenic angles...|$|R
