(“Zero pages” in DSC usually means “one page {{without the use of}} the PostScript ‘showpage’ operator.) The functional independence between pages, plus the disallowing of more PostScript operators in the pages section, form the basis for <b>page</b> <b>independence,</b> which allows pages to be reordered, and independently and randomly accessed.|$|E
2500|$|On the Russian-language social-networking site VK, Tsarnaev {{described}} his [...] "world view" [...] as [...] "Islam" [...] {{and his personal}} priorities as [...] "career and money". He posted links to Islamic websites, links to videos of fighters in the Syrian civil war, and links to <b>pages</b> advocating <b>independence</b> for Chechnya. Dzhokhar was also active on Twitter. According to The Economist, he seemed [...] "to {{have been much more}} concerned with sport and cheeseburgers than with religion, at least judging by his Twitter feed"; however, according to The Boston Globe, {{on the day of the}} 2012 Boston Marathon, a year before the bombings, a post on Tsarnaev's Twitter feed mentioned a Quran verse often used by radical Muslim clerics and propagandists.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present multivariate space-time {{fractional}} Poisson processes by considering common random time-changes of a (finite-dimensional) vector of independent classical (non-fractional) Poisson processes. In some cases we also consider compound processes. We obtain some equations {{in terms of}} some suitable fractional derivatives and fractional difference operators, which provides the extension of known equations for the univariate processes.

40|$|We {{consider}} quantum holonomy of some three-dimensional general covariant non-Abelian {{field theory}} in Landau gauge and confirm a previous result partially proven. We show that quantum holonomy retains metric independence after explicit gauge fixing and hence possesses the topological property of a link invariant. We examine the generalized quantum holonomy defined on a multi-component link and discuss {{its relation to}} a polynomial for the link. Comment: RevTex, 12 <b>pages.</b> The metric <b>independence</b> of path integral measure is justified and the case of multi-component link is discussed in detail.

5|$|Under the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly {{learns to}} control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are {{building}} the condenser, a portal {{that connects the}} world of the living with {{the world of the}} dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie (Ellen <b>Page)</b> seeks her <b>independence,</b> both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of clicking an ad in sponsored search. The accurate prediction of user's click on an ad {{plays an important role in}} sponsored search, because it is widely used in both ranking and pricing of the ads. Previous work on click prediction usually takes a single ad as input, and ignores its relationship to the other ads shown in the same <b>page.</b> This <b>independence</b> assumption here, however, might not be valid in the real scenario. In this paper, we first perform an analysis on this issue by looking at the click-through rates (CTR) of the same ad, in the same position and for the same query, but surrounded by different ads. We found that in most cases the CTR varies largely, which suggests that the relationship between ads is really an important factor in predicting click probability. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the more similar the surrounding ads are to an ad, the lower the CTR of the ad is. Based on this observation, we design a continuous conditional random fields (CRF) based model for click prediction, which considers both the features of an ad and its similarity to the surrounding ads. We show that the model can be effectively learned using maximum likelihood estimation, and can also be efficiently inferred due to its closed form solution. Our experimental results on the click-through log from a commercial search engine show that the proposed model can predict clicks more accurately than previous independent models. To our best knowledge this is the first work that predicts ad clicks by considering the relationship between ads. Copyright 2012 ACM.
