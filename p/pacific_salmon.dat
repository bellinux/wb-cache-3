5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon,</b> herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E

The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also {{supports}} seven species of <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> and trout (Oncorhynchus). There are also high, often localized levels of mollusc endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River.

2500|$|The six <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmons</b> of Oncorhynchus are {{anadromous}} (migratory) and semelparous (die after spawning). Migration can {{be affected}} by parasites.

25|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon.</b> As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In Japanese Chum Salmon, for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the harvesting of salmon populations. Salmon of larger body weight are more apt to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> a larger mean size at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> species. Today, it seems that population numbers of <b>Pacific</b> <b>salmon</b> are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|E
