500|$|Schwa's buzz, and customers, quickly returned. By May 2008, it was {{routine for}} the restaurant's voice mail to reach {{capacity}} {{because of the}} large number of <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> reservations (and the restaurant's lack of a receptionist). [...] Shortly after its relaunch, one food critic described Schwa as even better than before, saying it was an [...] "Oscar-worthy redemption story." ...|$|E

His movies are about <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer to themselves. He's the perfect match for a story about being 25, because that's all 25-year-olds are interested in.

50|$|Crushes {{often occur}} during {{religious}} pilgrimages and large entertainment events, as {{they tend to}} involve dense crowds, with people closely surrounded on all sides.

50|$|After the Curies {{discovered}} radium, many <b>people</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as much radium {{as possible}} {{to use it for}} medical purposes. However, it was not long until radium and radium salts were thought of as magical substances and were added to food, drinks, clothing, toys and more.

2500|$|During {{the filming}} of Amar Prem there was a scene {{that needed to be}} shot at Howrah Bridge with a boat {{carrying}} Khanna and Sharmila under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realised that if the public found out that the star would be there, it may create problems on the bridge and that it might collapse due to the amount of <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a glimpse of their favourite actor. Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers [...] "Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Venezuelans {{contend that}} the protests—seen as [...] "rich <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back lost {{economic}} perks"—have only served to unite the poor {{in defense of the}} revolution. [...] Analysts such as Steve Ellner, {{a political science professor at}} the University of the East in Puerto La Cruz, have expressed doubt over the protests' ultimate effectiveness if the opposition cannot create broader social mobilization. Eric Olson, associate director for Latin America at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said disruption caused by protestors had allowed Maduro to use the [...] "greedy economic class" [...] as a scapegoat, which has been an effective narrative for gaining support because people [...] "are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories of price gouging than the intricacies of underlining economic policies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared {{some of his}} {{memories}} of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as “jumping” with loads of <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a glimpse of the}} celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with “chicks and champagne everywhere.” Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. [...] It was absolutely crazy.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Without much {{experience}} as a live act, Foster the People were booked in October 2010 to play several club shows [...] "to help them get their sea legs". Booking the group proved difficult, as concert promoters were hesitant about an artist without previous touring experiences. Foster the People promoted these concerts by emailing fans who had downloaded [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] from their website about the shows. In early 2011, the band was booked to perform in a much sought-after tent at April's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Meanwhile, the group continued to grow its fanbase with a month-long residency of concerts in January at The Echo nightclub in Los Angeles. According to booking agent Tom Windish, by the group's third show at the venue, [...] "there were hundreds of <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in outside.... It was an obvious turning point that could be measured in numbers." [...] The residency also drew the attention of music supervisors in attendance who would later help the group license their music.|$|E

50|$|Rational {{decision}} making means {{what people do}} {{when they are not}} lacking what they need while making decisions. They are fully informed and can research their choices.

In The Origin of Species nature is seen as being at war, but also likened to a web of complex relations. Here, Darwin gave people a basis for urging humans not to take control of nature but to cooperate with it. In popular imagination, a scientific theory has a single fixed meaning, but in reality it becomes cultural property, and is usable by different interested parties.|$|R
