Beans treated with <b>pyrazon</b> developed various chlorotic and necrotic symptoms on the unifoliate leaves. Chlorosis and necrosis were observed {{first on the}} leaf margins. Beans treated with <b>pyrazon</b> under a complete dark regime developed symptoms much later than those under an alternating light and dark regime. <b>Pyrazon</b> treated pigweed displayed symptoms similar to those on beans. <b>Pyrazon</b> induced abnormal chloroplasts and graded cellular collapse in the unifoliate leaves of beans and cotyledons of pigweed. The severity and/or extent to which morphological and anatomical symptoms developed were dependent upon herbicide concentration, exposure and treatment regime...|$|E
40|$|Using Radioautography 14 C simazine, 14 C EPTC, 14 C 2, 4 -D, 1414 DCPA and 14 C <b>pyrazon</b> {{absorption}} by {{seeds of}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), squash (Cucurbita maxima), corn (Zea mays), onion (Allium cepa) and oat (Avena sativa) was studied. Simazine, EPTC, 2, 4 -D and <b>pyrazon</b> were absorbed through the seed coat of bean, squash, corn and onion, the amount increasing with time. Little DCPA was absorbed by seeds of bean, squash, onion and oat. Distribution and translocation of 14 C simazine, 14 C EPTC and 14 C <b>pyrazon</b> {{occurred in the}} young plants of bean, squash, corn and onion. Simazine and <b>pyrazon</b> accumulated in the leaf margins of bean, EPTC and <b>pyrazon</b> {{were found in the}} cotyledon margins of squash, and <b>pyrazon</b> was found in the coleoptile tips and leaf tips of corn. The translocation of 14 C 2, 4 -D in bean, onion and squash showed a characteristic fixation along the path of the translocation. Very little translocation or distribution of 14 C DCPA were found in bean, squash, onion or oat. In bean leaf, 14 C <b>pyrazon</b> was absorbed and moved acropetally in the apoplast. Basipetal movement of 14 C <b>pyrazon</b> was limited. Microadioautography was used to determine the tissues involved in the translocation of 14 C simazine, 14 C EPTC, 14 C 2, 4 -D and 14 C <b>pyrazon.</b> Simazine and EPTC were found in the vascular bundle tissues of bean leaf.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a greenhouse at Tucson, Arizona to determine the water••use efficiency of sugarbeets, when treated with soil-incorporated <b>pyrazon</b> and grown under a low and high soil-moisture regime. During the first two weeks, measurements were taken to determine if <b>pyrazon</b> had any significant effect on growth and development of sugarbeets from germination to the cotyledon stage. No significant differences were found among treatments for germination and emergence, but significant differences were found in survival of the seedlings among herbicide rates. <b>Pyrazon</b> did not significantly affect the water-use efficiency of sugarbeets; however, the quantity of soil moisture present was a significant factor in the water requirement of beets. The treatment with the best water-use efficiency for the total plant was the 1. 12 kg/ha rate of <b>pyrazon</b> under low soil-moisture. Plants receiving <b>pyrazon</b> treatments under low soil moisture transpired significantly less water than those receiving corresponding treatments under high soil-moisture; however, no significant difference was observed between controls for high and low soil-moisture. The 2. 24 kg/ha rate of <b>pyrazon</b> was the only treatment in which root and total dry weight were significantly higher under high soil-moisture than under low soil-moisture. Transpired water and dry weight production were correlated with top, root, and whole plant efficiency to determine if these factors significantly influence the water requirement of sugarbeets...|$|E

40|$|Sphingomonas sp. strain RW 1 {{synthesized}} a {{constitutive enzyme}} system that oxygenated dibenzofuran (DBF) to 2, 2 ', 3 -trihydroxybiphenyl (THB). We purified this dibenzofuran 4, 4 a-dioxygenase system (DBFDOS) {{and found it}} to consist of four components which catalyzed three activities. Two isofunctional, monomeric flavoproteins (components A 1 and A 2; M(r) of about 44, 000) transferred electrons from NADH to the second component (B; M(r) of about 12, 000), a ferredoxin, which transported electrons to the heteromultimeric (alpha 2 beta 2) oxygenase component (C; M(r) of alpha, 45, 000; M(r) of beta, 23, 000). DBFDOS consumed 1 mol each of NADH, O 2, and DBF, which was dioxygenated to about 1 mol of THB; no intermediate was observed. The reaction was thus the dioxygenation of DBF at the 4 and 4 a positions to give a diene-diol-hemiacetal which rearomatized by spontaneous loss of a phenolate group to form THB. Components A 1 and A 2 each reduced dichlorophenolindophenol but had negligible activity with cytochrome c; each lost the yellow color, observed to be flavin adenine dinucleotide, upon purification. Component B, which transported electrons to the oxygenase or cytochrome c, had an N-terminal amino acid sequence with high homology to the putidaredoxin of cytochrome P- 450 cam. The oxygenase had the UV spectrum of a Rieske iron-sulfur center. We presume DBFDOS to be a class IIA dioxygenase system (EC 1. 14. 12. -), functionally similar to <b>pyrazon</b> dioxygenase...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} five {{substituted}} pyridazinones (<b>pyrazon,</b> San 133 - 410 H, San 9774, norflurazon, and San 6706) on lipid metabolism in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) leaves was investigated under nonphotosynthetic conditions. In experiments with leaf disks, the uptake of $[1 -$$^{ 14 }C]$acetate, $[^{ 32 }P]$orthophosphate, and $[^{ 35 }S]$sulfate was significantly inhibited by these herbicides and {{the magnitude of}} inhibition varied, depending on the substituents. When the incorporation of these precursors into lipids was measured and expressed as percentage of total uptake, no effect was observed {{in the case of}} $[1 -$$^{ 14 }C]$acetate but there was significant inhibition in the incorporation of the other 2 precursors, suggesting that pyridazinones interfere with the metabolism of the phospholipids and the sulfolipid. None of these compounds affected the uptake of $[methyl-$$^{ 14 }C]$choline but all inhibited its incorporation into phosphatidylcholine indicating that phosphatidylcholine metabolism is vulnerable to pyridazinones. The fatty acid synthetase of isolated chloroplasts assayed in the absence of light was inhibited 20 - 50 % by the pyridazinones at 0. 1 - 0. 5 mM concentrations. San 9774 showed the most potent inhibition. In addition, the pyridazinone herbicides significantly inhibited sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase(s) in both chloroplast and microsomal fractions but showed no effect on phosphatidic acid phosphatase. The magnitude of inhibition of fatty acid synthetase and acyltransferase(s) is related {{to the nature of the}} substituent groups on the herbicide. Trifluorophenyl substitution at position 2 or amino substitution at position 5 of the pyridazinone mol. caused the maximum inhibitory effect...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{research}} has indicated several soil-applied herbicides are more effective by exposure to emerging shoots than from root uptake. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and growth chamber to investigate effects of herbicide placement in soil on toxicity to emerging seedlings. In these studies, an inch of treated soil was placed above the seed, below the seed, or both {{above and below the}} seed. The seed was placed {{in the middle of a}} 1 -inch layer of untreated soil. Each soil layer was brought to field capacity separately and the entire container was covered with a plastic bag. The use of this plastic bag avoided the need for irrigation and subsequent herbicide movement. By this method, numerous herbicides were active on oats (Avena sativa) primarily through shoot exposure, with root exposure having little or no effect on foliage growth. These herbicides included EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiocarbamate), dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile), trifluralin (α, α, α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine), nitralin (2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl- 4 -[methylsulphonyl] aniline), propachlor (2 -chloro-N-iso-propylacetanilide), DCPA (dimethyl 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorotereph-thalate), and CDEC (2 -chloroallyl diethyl dithiocarbamate). Sindone (isomers of 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 6 -diisopropylindanyl ethyl ketone) was more effective on sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) and annual rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum) through shoot exposure than root exposure. Some herbicides are more effective on oats through root exposure. These included bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -sec-butyl- 6 -methyluracil), R 11913,¹ Nia 11092 (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(3 -[N-tert-butylcarbamyloxy] phenyl) urea), <b>pyrazon</b> (5 -amino- 4 -chloro- 2 -phenyl- 3 [2 H]-pyridazinone), diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea), and atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropyl-amino-s-triazine). Dicamba (2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid) and 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were more effective on cucumber through root exposure than through shoot exposure. Some herbicides appear to be taken up differently by different plant species. R 11913 was more effective through shoot exposure on sugar beets and more effective through root exposure on oats. Atrazine proved more effective on oats through root exposure; however, with green foxtail (Setaria viridis) and annual ryegrass, shoot exposure was more important when an untreated buffer layer was present between the seed and the treated zone. The possibility existed that a reduction in transpiration, caused by the plastic bag could affect the mode of uptake. In studies without the use of the plastic bag, atrazine was still more effective on oats through root exposure and more effective on green foxtail through shoot exposure. Irrigation in this study was accomplished through straws extended into each layer to minimize herbicide movement. We noticed that green foxtail produced secondary roots as early as five days after planting or two days after emergence. This indicated that these newly-formed secondary roots, as well as the emerging shoot, could absorb atrazine placed in the shoot region. When the buffer layer was removed and atrazine-treated soil was placed adjacent to the seed, placement immediately below the seed showed the greatest toxicity to both oats and green foxtail. This indicates the variation in sensitivity of plants by exposure to different parts of the seedling. Studies were conducted on varying placement positions of the herbicide as well as concentrations. From these studies, proximity to the seed was a major factor in increasing toxicity to oat seedlings by atrazine and EPTC, and to annual ryegrass seedlings by diuron. Atrazine was also more effective to green foxtail and annual ryegrass seedlings with increased proximity to the seed. A narrow concentrated layer was more effective than a wider dilute layer with diuron, atrazine, and EPTC when placed either above or below the seed. With atrazine and diuron, placement of the dilute wider layer completely around the seed was just as effective as the concentrated layer adjacent to the seed. With EPTC, a concentrated layer adjacent to the seed was more effective than a dilute layer completely around the seed. The effects of a constant temperature regime (24 C) was compared with a temperature regime with a low night temperature (27 C/ 13 C) in relation to uptake of EPTC, expressed by toxic action on oats. The temperature regime with a low night temperature caused a slight increase in toxicity to oats through shoot exposure, as well as through root exposure. However, the increase in uptake of EPTC through root exposure was considerably greater than through shoot exposure. ¹No chemical name available, an experimental herbicide of Stauffer Chemical Company...|$|E
