40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} [`]oil'igopoly exploration of an exhaustible resource. Strategic exploration <b>and</b> <b>production</b> are jointly derived in a three period subgame perfect equilibrium. While the [`]oil'igopoly theory of exploration shares many features with non-strategic models of exploration <b>and</b> <b>production,</b> there is one important difference. The [`]oil'igopoly theory of exploration predicts that firms who exhaust their proved reserves before they can convert their unproved reserves into proved reserves {{have an incentive to}} over-explore, relative to the Nash equilibrium level of exploration. A simple empirical prediction is that firms holding smaller proved reserves should be observed doing more exploration. This prediction is consistent with country-level <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserve</b> data in the post-World War II era. ...|$|R

Alberta contains nearly all of Canada's oil sands and much of its conventional oil reserves. The balance is concentrated in several other provinces and territories. Saskatchewan and offshore areas of Newfoundland in particular have substantial oil <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserves.</b> Alberta has 39% of Canada's remaining conventional oil reserves, offshore Newfoundland 28% and Saskatchewan 27%, but if oil sands are included, Alberta's share is over 98%.|$|E
50|$|The {{outlook for}} the oil supply is complex (as of 2010) because of the trend of {{decreasing}} oil reserves and the sharp increase in international oil prices in 2008. The government was considering a variety of options to ensure an appropriate supply of energy for {{the nation as a}} whole. In 2003 important changes in oil policy were introduced that led to an increase in exploration, <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> of oil and gas. Among those changes is the separation of state roles: Ecopetrol assumed a role as an operator with greater autonomy and more ability to compete. The new National Hydrocarbons Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos, ANH) became a resource administrator. A contingency tax should give the government a share of profits when prices of oil are higher than a given threshold price. Compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and ethanol are also being promoted as options to increase the nation's domestic supply of energy resources.|$|E
50|$|Tellurium (Te) <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> {{estimates}} {{are subject to}} uncertainty and vary considerably. Tellurium is a rare, mildly toxic metalloid that is primarily used as a machining additive to steel. Te is almost exclusively obtained as a by-product of copper refining, with smaller amounts from lead and gold production. Only a small amount, estimated to be about 800 metric tons per year, is available. According to USGS, global production in 2007 was 135 metric tons. One gigawatt (GW) of CdTe PV modules would require about 93 metric tons (at current efficiencies and thicknesses). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling, the CdTe PV industry {{has the potential to}} fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. In the last decade, new supplies have been located, e.g., in Xinju, China as well as in Mexico and Sweden. In 1984 astrophysicists identified tellurium as the universe's most abundant element having an atomic number over 40. Certain undersea ridges are rich in tellurium.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{conflicts}} between timber <b>production</b> <b>and</b> environmental protection led some analysts to advocate land-use segregation, {{often referred to}} as forest management zoning. The objective of zoning is to create ecologically desirable non-fragmented forest <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> group timber <b>production</b> areas. We formulate an integer programming model of forest zoning that explicitly addresses clustering of spatial units allocated to timber <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserve</b> zones while also promoting separation of these zones. A tabu search algorithm is developed, implemented and tested using a case study. The case study results indicate that up to 5 % of the net financial return is sacrificed with a 'satisfactory' grouping of units within each zone. A 'good' separation between the <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> timber <b>production</b> zone is achieved at the cost of further decline of the net financial return up to 11 % relative to the unconstrained case. forest planning, integer programming, reserves, tabu search, timber production, zoning...|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic decline curve {{analysis}} (PDCA) {{methods have}} been developed to quantify uncertainty in <b>production</b> forecasts <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> estimates. However, the application of PDCA in shale gas reservoirs is relatively new. Limited work has been done on the performance of PDCA methods when the available production data are limited. In addition, PDCA methods have often been coupled with Arp?s equations, which might not be the optimum decline curve analysis model (DCA) to use, as new DCA models for shale reservoirs have been developed. Also, decline curve methods are based on <b>production</b> data only <b>and</b> do not by themselves incorporate other types of information, such as volumetric data. My research objective was to integrate volumetric information with PDCA methods and DCA models to reliably quantify the uncertainty in production forecasts from hydraulically fractured horizontal shale gas wells, regardless of the stage of depletion. In this work, hindcasts of multiple DCA models coupled to different probabilistic methods were performed to determine the reliability of the probabilistic DCA methods. In a hindcast, only a portion of the historical data is matched; predictions are made {{for the remainder of the}} historical period and compared to the actual historical production. Most of the DCA models were well calibrated visually when used with an appropriate probabilistic method, regardless of the amount of production data available to match. Volumetric assessments, used as prior information, were incorporated to further enhance the calibration of <b>production</b> forecasts <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> estimates when using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as the PDCA method and the logistic growth DCA model. The proposed combination of the MCMC PDCA method, the logistic growth DCA model, and use of volumetric data provides an integrated procedure to reliably quantify the uncertainty in <b>production</b> forecasts <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> estimates in shale gas reservoirs. Reliable quantification of uncertainty should yield more reliable expected values of reserves estimates, as well as more reliable assessment of upside and downside potential. This can be particularly valuable early in the development of a play, because decisions regarding continued development are based to a large degree on <b>production</b> forecasts <b>and</b> <b>reserves</b> estimates for early wells in the play...|$|R

5000|$|In 1962, Hubbert {{predicted}} that world oil production would peak {{at a rate}} of 12.5 billion barrels per year, around the year 2000.

However, a number of industry leaders and analysts believe that world oil production will peak between 2015 and 2030, with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020.
