5|$|The {{eggs and}} nymphs are {{under attack by}} parasitoids {{including}} blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers <b>parasitised</b> by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} {{only able to}} <b>parasitise</b> a single plant species, such as ivy {{broomrape}} Orobanche hederae, which is restricted to <b>parasitising</b> ivy; these species are often named after the plant they <b>parasitise.</b> Others can infect several genera, such as the lesser broomrape O. minor, which lives on clover and other related Fabaceae.|$|R

5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) kills Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} sporadically, {{and is the}} only natural predator of the adult cockatoo. Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally <b>parasitised</b> by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei. In captivity, it is also susceptible to nematodes of the genus Ascaris if it is in a cage with open dirt flooring.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are <b>parasitised</b> by {{tracheal}} mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus {{has been found to}} affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies; the falcon, which eats only insects, provides {{a degree of}} protection against larger predators, and the chough benefits {{in terms of a}} higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally <b>parasitised</b> by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E
50|$|All Bachinae are koinobiont endoparasites of Lepidoptera. The Glyptini <b>parasitise</b> Tortricoidea. Atrophini <b>parasitise</b> a {{wider range}} of small moths. Species of Lissonota have long ovipositors able to reach deep wood-boring Lepidoptera such as Cossidae. Banchinae and Campopleginae are the only subfamilies of Ichneumonidae known to have polydnaviruses.|$|R

5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that <b>parasitised</b> larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They {{lend support to}} this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found <b>parasitised</b> there.|$|E

5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood <b>parasitised</b> by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals <b>parasitised</b> include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are {{significantly}} more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are <b>parasitised</b> by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume {{them as part of}} a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies. Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is {{widespread}} with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous, their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is <b>parasitised</b> in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of <b>parasitised</b> pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been <b>parasitised</b> by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often <b>parasitised</b> by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
