50|$|<b>Ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Lepidochelys) are a genus of <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{comprising}} two species: Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and {{the olive}} <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lepidochelys kempii), or the Atlantic <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> is {{the rarest}} species of <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and is {{critically}} endangered. It {{is one of}} two living species in the genus Lepidochelys (the other one being L. olivacea, the olive <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle).</b>|$|R
50|$|Females may lay 1-8 {{clutches}} in {{a single}} season. Female <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> alternate between mating {{in the water and}} laying their eggs on land. Most <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> species nest individually. But <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> come ashore en masse, known as an arribada (arrival). With the Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> this occurs during the day.|$|R

50|$|Cheloniidae is {{a family}} of {{typically}} large marine turtles that are characterized by their common traits such as, having a flat streamlined wide and rounded shell that has have almost paddle-like flippers for their forelimbs 1.

5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> olive <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|R

50|$|The Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> were on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} in the 1960s with low numbers of 200 nesting individuals. Due to strict protection laws that protected their nesting sites in Mexico and altered fishing gear to avoid accidental capture of the Kemp's, the Kemp's ridley numbers have increased to estimated 7000-9000 nesting individuals today.The olive <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is considered to have the most abundant numbers today, estimated as 800,000 nesting individuals. The threats to their survival is loss of nesting habitat, direct harvest of the eggs and adults, and getting caught in fishing gear. Protection of the nesting beaches, changes to the fishing gear, and laws against harvesting the adults and eggs have helped the olive <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> numbers gradually increase.|$|R

50|$|A {{program to}} re-establish a nesting beach for Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> on Padre Island was begun in 1978. In 1992, {{the first two}} turtles from the program {{returned}} to Padre Island beach to lay their eggs. The number of Kemp's <b>ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> nests on Padre Island has increased ever since with 28 being found in 2005.

5000|$|Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> migrate in {{huge numbers}} from the {{beginning}} of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Odisha. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between one hundred to five hundred thousand, each year. there has been decline in the population of these turtles in the recent past due to mass mortality. Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> has found place in Schedule - I of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991).

The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for the <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation.|$|R
