5|$|Sorabji's isolation, and {{sometimes}} the resulting lack of interaction with the music world, have {{been the target of}} criticism even by his admirers. His writings have also been highly divisive, being described by some as profoundly <b>perceptive</b> and enlightening, and by others as misguided.|$|E
5|$|Although School Rumble {{focuses on}} Harima and Tenma, the series explores {{a number of}} {{supporting}} characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily <b>perceptive</b> girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Manning {{directed}} the Belvoir St Theatre {{production of a}} play, Black Cockatoos, {{about the relationship between}} a white woman and an Aboriginal man. The script (not by Manning) was criticised by reviewer Angela Bennie, who nevertheless described Manning's direction as delicate and <b>perceptive</b> in places, if also naive and self-conscious.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, <b>perceptive</b> interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} {{before he became a}} full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed a taste for country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of the}} 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a <b>perceptive</b> writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small augmented reality device that gives her special <b>perceptive</b> abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found {{at the foot of a}} sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical religious group calling themselves the Eclipse. They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E
5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and <b>perceptive.</b> The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy {{of the state and the}} Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars. He ridicules the monks as they come in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E

25|$|When these {{psychological}} tricks {{are used}} properly, the statements {{give the impression}} that the mentalist, or psychic scam artist, is intuitively <b>perceptive</b> and psychically gifted.

25|$|As to a {{sense of}} hearing, Frisch could not {{identify}} this <b>perceptive</b> faculty, but it was assumed that vibrations could be sensed and used for communication during the waggle dance.

25|$|Judith Loftus plays a {{small part}} in the novel— being the kind and <b>perceptive</b> woman whom Huck talks {{to in order to}} find out about the search for Jim— but many critics believe her to be the best drawn female {{character}} in the novel.|$|E
25|$|Douglas situates Overture in the {{historical}} moment that the beginnings of film share {{with the end of}} the novel, when Proust's faith in the tantalizing structures of his great predecessors, Balzac and Wagner, was being undermined by the <b>perceptive</b> discontinuities that film helped to bring about.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{numerous}} character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a <b>perceptive</b> observer of his times ("I saw further than most in some ways").

25|$|For cricket fans, {{we believe}} live scores matter {{way more than}} {{anything}} else while s/he surfs a cricket app. They are ecstatic even more if scores reach them easy and as fast as possible. At the same time, we believe a user is quite <b>perceptive</b> to data usage at all times while surfing apps.|$|E
25|$|But the {{significance}} of the case goes beyond its immediate and ultimate precedential effect. While the Second Circuit's decision set the precedent, the trial court opinion has been reproduced in all Random House printings of the novel, and {{is said to be the}} most widely distributed judicial opinion in history. The opinion has been recognized as a <b>perceptive</b> analysis of Joyce's work.|$|E
25|$|Gris {{claimed to}} {{manipulate}} flat abstract planar surfaces first, {{and only in}} subsequent stages of his painting process would he 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable. He worked 'deductively' on the global concept first, then consecrated on the <b>perceptive</b> details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.|$|E
25|$|The Roaring Nineties is Stiglitz' {{analysis}} of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a <b>perceptive</b> focus on US policies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{books of the}} Kitab al-'Ibar, he focuses {{especially}} {{on the history of}} the Berbers of the Maghrib.

As an official of the Hafsids, Ibn Khaldun experienced first hand the effects on the social structure of troubled regimes and the long term decline in the region's fortunes.|$|E
25|$|The magazine's criticism, {{edited by}} Floyd Dell, was cheekily titled (at {{least for a}} time) “Books that Are Interesting.” Dell’s <b>perceptive</b> reviews gave accolades {{to many of the}} most notable books of the time: An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, Spoon River Anthology, Theodore Dreiser’s novels, Carl Jung’s Psychology of the Unconscious, G. K. Chesterton’s works, Jack London’s memoirs, and many other {{prominent}} creations.|$|E
25|$|Pericutaneous space: The space {{just outside}} our bodies but {{which might be}} near to {{touching}} it. Visual-tactile <b>perceptive</b> fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual might see a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.|$|E
25|$|Ahmad Shboul {{mentions}} the rich blend of Greek philosophy, Persian literature, Indian mathematics {{and the rich}} heritage of the ancient cultures {{that went into the}} vigorous life of the day.

There was a natural association of scholarly minded people in this highly civilized atmosphere, and al-Mas‘udi very much took part in this energizing activity.|$|E
25|$|The Uzbek Gymnasium traces {{its origins}} {{to the fall}} of 1999 when Jumaboy Boboyev, a {{geography}} teacher, opened classes for <b>perceptive</b> students in Isfana Secondary School. Mavluda Qoʻldosheva, a teacher of the Russian language, was appointed Head of the Teaching Department. A total of 67 students were selected and divided into four classes. Initially, only twelve instructors taught the students. Over the years, both the number of classes {{and the number of}} instructors have increased.|$|E
25|$|It {{would seem}} that her father's ironic, sceptical temper so {{penetrated}} her sensibility {{that she could not}} regard any body of ideas as other than a starting point for argument. Although she was a militant feminist and active suffragette, and published a <b>perceptive</b> and admiring profile of Emmeline Pankhurst, West also criticized the tactics of Pankhurst's daughter, Christabel, and the sometimes doctrinaire aspects of the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, Carr {{informs us}} that Mommsen's multivolume work Römische Geschichte (Leipzig 1854–1856) may tell the <b>perceptive</b> modern {{historian}} much about mid-19th-century Germany, {{while it is}} presenting an account of ancient Rome. A major recent event in Germany was {{the failure of the}} 1848–1849 Revolution, while in Mommsen's Roman History his narration of the Republic draws to a close with the revolutionary emergence of a strong state executive in the figure of Julius Caesar. Carr conjectures as follows.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Reid was a {{successor}} to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow. While Reid's interests lay {{in the defense of}} common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the <b>perceptive</b> powers described by Aristotelians.|$|E
25|$|Medea's {{older brother}} and the Prime Minister of Avalon. He is fairly serious and is {{constantly}} frustrated by the King of Heaven always giving him the slip. Charon always does things by the book and is extremely <b>perceptive,</b> {{despite the fact that}} his king always manages to sneak away undetected until it is too late. Charon is deeply concerned with the King's recent activities, especially as the King still has not chosen a queen and worries the King may die before this occurs.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{observers}} {{believe that most}} bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small objects such as berries. However, bears are also capable of discerning faraway movements, helping them hunt prey. The Kodiak bear, {{when compared to other}} species, appears to have vision comparable to a human (not near-sighted). Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. With scientists still working to determine exactly how <b>perceptive</b> bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight.|$|E
25|$|The young O'Keefe was {{intelligent}} and <b>perceptive,</b> {{with a great}} sense of humour, although his school grades fluctuated due to his misbehaviour {{and the fact that he}} was easily distracted; Sydney radio personality Gary O'Callaghan, who was a classmate, later recalled that O'Keefe was often in trouble. During his time at high school Johnny joined the school cadets, where he made good progress learning trumpet, and he (reluctantly) sang solo in the school choir. He was also a keen swimmer, surfer and sailor and often sailed with the Vaucluse Juniors sailing club.|$|E
25|$|Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is the dim-witted, vain, and miserly anchorman of the Six O'Clock News. He {{frequently}} makes {{mistakes and}} is {{oblivious to the}} actual nature of the topics covered on the show, but considers himself to be the country's best news journalist. He is often criticized by others, especially Murray and Lou for his many shortcomings, but is never fired from his position. Initially a comic buffoon in the series, Ted's better nature is gradually revealed as the series unfolds, helped along by his sweet but sometimes <b>perceptive</b> girlfriend Georgette.|$|E
25|$|Ruth and Morty Moscovitz: Michael and Lilly's parents. They {{are both}} psychoanalysts. They {{separate}} in book seven, but begin to rekindle their relationship in book eight. As {{shown in the}} seventh installment, they tend to focus too much on {{their own lives and}} concerns. When they do broach sensitive subjects with their children, they usually psychoanalyze them as well, a habit that has a very bad effect on Lilly. Michael, who is more <b>perceptive,</b> avoids their attention by keeping more to himself. Lilly has inherited her intelligence and hobby of analyzing people from them.|$|E
