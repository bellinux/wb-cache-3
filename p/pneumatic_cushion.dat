5000|$|Confusion on the VHS's {{operating}} system was from several {{changes to the}} type of system used through its development. The first models used a Kalashnikov-style long-stroke piston, which was changed in 1999 to a lever delayed blowback system from the FAMAS. The next year, it was changed to a direct gas impingement system with a forced ventilation feature that formed a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cushion</b> behind the bolt. The VHS was patented in that form in 2000 giving the impression of a [...] "gas cushion" [...] feature. That model was publicly known up to 2005. In 2004, the final and current {{operating system}} of the VHS was changed to a gas-operated, short-stroke piston system.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide an {{overview}} of ETFE foil, as it applies to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cushion</b> cladding, with a focus on creep behavior of the material. Characteristics of ETFE, including weight, optics, insulation, flexibility, environmental properties, fire performance, cushion span and other features are discussed, and, where possible, are compared to the characteristics of glass panels used in similar applications. Relevant chemical and mechanical properties of ETFE are given. Load carrying concepts of tension structures and inflated cushions are discussed, as well as structural design methods for ETFE cushions. Several prominent structures constructed using ETFE foil are introduced and benefits and design issues associated with these structures are reviewed. When used in cushion applications, ETFE films are placed in constant tension, and are therefore subject to creep. Quantifying this creep is desirable {{so that it can be}} predicted during the design phase. Therefore, this thesis summarizes the findings of other researchers in the area of creep of ETFE as well as the general mechanical behavior of the material, and presents the results of uniaxial creep tests done for the {{purpose of this}} study. These tests included 24 hour uniaxial creep tests done at four stress levels on both the transverse and longitudinal directions of three different brands of film. Two thicknesses of the third film were acquired and both were tested. The stress levels were chosen to coincide with typical design tensile stresses for ETFE film, and to be similar to the levels tested by other researchers. The effects of the different stresses, brands, directions and thicknesses are evaluated and discussed. Three seven day creep tests were also done on one of the films, each at a different stress level. Constitutive viscoelastic and viscoplastic models were developed to represent the 24 -hour creep data. The viscoelastic models were based on a four-element Kelvin model and the viscoplastic models were based on a power-law model. The model parameters were determined from the data using linear least squares fitting. Models were also developed for the seven day creep data. Several of these models were based only upon the first 24 hours of data, and were used to determine the applicability of the 24 -hour creep models to long-term behavior. It was found that while a viscoelastic model appears to fit long-term creep most closely, the 24 -hour models are inadequate for modeling longer time frames. Another method is required for predicting long-term creep. Nonlinear fitting of the parameters is recommended as a possible alternative for creating more accurate models. Longer-term creep tests are also recommended. Tensile tests were also done on the films to confirm mechanical properties supplied by the film manufacturers. Good agreement to the given values was found in the test data...|$|E

High wind loads due to the exposed location were expected. The larger of the two structures is 15 m high and 60 m long.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade textile {{architecture}} has become increasingly popular: fabrics and foils {{are more and more}} used as skins for permanent and enclosed buildings. The thermal-physical behavior of air-supported membrane structures, characterized by low thermal inertia and poor insulation, is definitely different from the traditional architectures, although required comfort levels are often similar. While the thermal behavior of the wider spread ETFE foil cushion system is still investigated, a quantitative assessment of the double-layered fabric skin energy performance is still lacking. This paper studies the latter membrane system, focusing on the evolution of air-supported envelopes for sports halls, from single layer to double layer membranes, either based on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cushions</b> or on continuous air gaps. By performing measurements on running sports halls and dynamic simulations, the winter energy performance, the comfort conditions and the internal surfaces condensation risk of a typical sport hall in Northern Italy are evaluated. An insight is given into the envelopes dynamic behavior and energy balance. Double layers envelopes allow saving from 11 % to 18 % of the heating energy compared to single layer. Moreover, further energy saving strategies are proposed and quantified, considering low-emissivity coatings, reduction of the cracks areas, modifying indoor air set points...|$|R
40|$|ETFE {{is one of}} {{the most}} stable {{chemical}} compounds and its films are largely employed in the building industry due to the very good long-term stability, resistance to soiling and high light transmittance. The mechanical strength is relatively good, especially considering that the material is not reinforced by a woven support, and make ETFE foils suitable for load bearing envelopes characterised by small spans or supported by cables [1]. ETFE foils are traditionally used for multilayer <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cushions,</b> however, in recent projects the application of single skin ETFE foils has been successfully investigated. This innovative application opens new areas of interest in the area of the building envelope, such as a protective secondary facade. In addition, the growing demand for reducing the heating costs has recently increased the demand for ETFE foils with pigments or surface treatments able to improve the environmental performance of lightweight envelopes based on ETFE foils [2]. This research paper describes the thermal performance of an existing ETFE roof in Verona and the subsequent retrofitting of the structure in order to meet the targets of solar shading specified by the client. The paper includes the data obtained through the monitoring of the structure before and after the installation of a new set of cushions manufactured with a bespoke silver ETFE designed in order to reduce the solar gains and improve the overall level of comfort during the warm season...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> clear foil <b>cushion</b> systems, notably as ETFE foil {{cushions}} {{have been}} developed as an alternative technology to large-scale glass glazing systems for wide-span buildings. The systems display better thermal performance and have advantages of extremely low dead-weight constructions compared to conventional glazing systems, and thereby the increasing popularity of foil cushion cladding systems have been witnessed in the last decades. However due to their lightweight and thinness, the thermal behaviour of architectural foil membranes exhibits a high responsiveness to variations in external conditions. For this reason, {{it is argued that}} the reliable prediction of the thermal environment experienced in a space enclosed by a tensile membrane skin construction would require a bespoke modelling of the dynamic thermal behaviour of such a construction at first. Building envelopes clad with such cushions, such as the famous Eden project in the UK, need a dynamic system to control overheating in summer. A cooling liquid layer constructed within a clear multi-layer toil cushion envelope is proposed in this thesis. It enables rapid cooling effects on the building envelope. The system is based on an evaporative cooling mechanism and is integrated with the inflated cushion to provide desired cooling effect eco-friendly. The implications of the forms and configurations of clear foil cushion constructions with and without a cooling liquid layer in the overheating control were evaluated in this research project. Data were collected from a series of experiments to ascertain the effects of the additional cooling water layer on heat transfer processes within the foil skin construction. The results demonstrated that the thermal behaviour of a foil penal depended mainly on surface convection and radiation heat transfer and the cooling performance of the water layer within the foil skin constructions was evident. The initial experimental outcomes were valuable for the design of such novel dynamic cooling systems. In order to assess the effect that different pneumatic foil skin constructions with a water layer might have on thermal conditions inside the enclosed space, the thermal behaviour of full-scale indoor double-layer foil cushion enclosure and triple-layer foil skin construction, with varying evaporative cooling integrative ways and foil skin constructions, were tested {{during the course of this}} research. The test datasets were compared according to the research objectives and with the environmental control strategy proposed at the initial design stages. The investigated thermal behaviour of the foil skin constructions incorporating a water layer serves as a reference basis for the analytic modelling of the tested double and triple-layer foil skin constructions in order to predict their surface temperatures and the solar radiation directed into the space they enclose. The approach is based on a detailed modelling of the radiative and convective heat transfer processes affecting the membrane surfaces. These prediction results derived from the model were compared against the environmental data obtained on the test rigs. The developed analytical model is only tentative, as some thermal transfer processes, such as long wave radiation exchanges between the foil sheets, have not been accounted for in this model. Further work is required to develop this model in order to appreciate the thermal performance of such novel foil cushion constructions more precisely and extend their building applications.
