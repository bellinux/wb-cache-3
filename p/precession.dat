5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the <b>precession</b> rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the <b>precession</b> motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the <b>precession</b> of the spin and <b>precession</b> of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} the Earth's {{gravitational}} field slightly deviates from being spherically symmetrical also affects the orbits of satellites through secular orbital <b>precessions.</b> They depend on {{the orientation of the}} Earth's symmetry axis in the inertial space, and, in the general case, affect all the Keplerian orbital elements {{with the exception of the}} semimajor axis.

5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar <b>precession,</b> as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary <b>precession.</b> The combined action of these two motions is called general <b>precession,</b> and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we explore}} a novel {{approach}} {{in order to try}} to measure the post-Newtonian 1 /c^ 2 Lense-Thirring secular effect induced by the gravitomagnetic field of the Sun on the planetary orbital motion. Due to the relative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the planetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic <b>precessions,</b> which affect the nodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^ 3, are of the order of 10 ^- 3 arcseconds per century only for, e. g., Mercury. This value lies just at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing the planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and BepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main sources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical <b>precessions</b> induced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and the classical secular N-body <b>precessions</b> which are of the same order of magnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring <b>precessions</b> of interest. This definitely rules out the possibility of analyzing only one orbital element of, e. g., Mercury. In order to circumvent these problems, we propose a suitable linear combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of Mercury, Venus and Mars which is, by construction, independent of such classical secular <b>precessions.</b> A 1 -sigma reasonable estimate of the obtainable accuracy yields a 36 % error. Since the major role in the proposed combination is played by the Mercury's node, it could happen that the new, more accurate ephemerides available in future thanks to the Messenger and BepiColombo missions will offer an opportunity to improve the present unfavorable situation.

5|$|Newton's theorem of {{revolving}} orbits was {{his first}} attempt to understand apsidal <b>precession</b> quantitatively. According to this theorem, {{the addition of a}} particular type of central force—the inverse-cube force—can produce a rotating orbit; the angular speed is multiplied by a factor k, whereas the radial motion is left unchanged. However, this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant; several perturbing inverse-square interactions (such as those of other planets) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse-cube force. To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces, Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force F(r) to an inverse-cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits, that is, elliptical orbits of low eccentricity, as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System. To find this approximation, Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the Taylor expansion. This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of <b>precession</b> for arbitrary central forces. Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal <b>precession</b> of the Moon's orbit. However, the problem of the Moon's motion is dauntingly complex, and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon's apsidal <b>precession.</b> After a more accurate model by Clairaut in 1747, analytical models of the Moon's motion were developed in the late 19th century by Hill, Brown, and Delaunay.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of {{perihelion}} of anti-aligned objects to librate, or oscillate within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's perihelion and Planet Nine's (delta longitude of perihelion on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the eccentricity of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its perihelion to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's eccentricity is declining its <b>precession</b> rate is slowing. Once the object's <b>precession</b> rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta longitude of perihelion begins to descend. After delta longitude of perihelion drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its eccentricity grows and perihelion falls. When the object's eccentricity is again large, its <b>precession</b> rate increases, causing delta longitude of perihelion to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact on}} the orbital motions of the outer planets of the solar system from Jupiter to Pluto of some velocity-dependent forces {{recently}} proposed to phenomenologically explain the Pioneer anomaly, and compare their predictions (secular variations of the longitude of perihelion or of the semimajor axis a and the eccentricity e) with the latest observational determinations by E.
