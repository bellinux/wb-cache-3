40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a thirty-month case study of how one busi-ness writer made decisions concerning audience. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine if audience theory adequately describes the writing that takes place in non-academic settings. Findings suggest that audience theory does not adequately describe the cognitive and social decisions that writers make in real-world professional contexts. Findings suggest that assumptions about the needs of the <b>primary</b> <b>reader</b> being most important and the needs of the external client who is paying for the report being more important than the needs of the internal audience do not necessarily approximate what takes place when professionals write. Professionals who write do not necessarily view the needs of the <b>primary</b> <b>reader</b> as most important. Intrinsic internal factors such as a writer’s sense of his/her own and the firm’s credibility, financial rewards, and promotions may affect decisions concerning audience more than the external client’s specific need for the report. hile it has been widely recognized that effective writers consider the needs of their readers, until recently little research has focused specifically on how professionals who write obtain and use infor-mation concerning audience.

40|$|Tropical deep-water {{snappers}} (Etelinae) support valuable fisheries {{across the}} Indo-Pacific, with stock assessments reliant on age-based {{information in the}} absence of reliable catch and effort statistics. These long-lived species have been considered notoriously difficult to age. However, nascent developments in ageing protocols, particularly thinner transverse sections of otoliths (∼ 180 – 200 µm), are providing improvements in growth zone clarity, interpretation and repeatability of annuli counts. At a recent international workshop, thin sectioned otoliths from three deep-water snappers were read under reflected light by eight fisheries scientists from across the Indo-Pacific, with various levels of fish-ageing experience. Precision and bias were assessed using traditional ageing precision metrics (index of average percent error, IAPE; and coefficient of variation, CV), and a novel approach using multivariate analyses (metric multidimensional scaling, mMDS) based on Euclidean dissimilarity among readers’ counts and subsequent von Bertalanffy (vB) growth parameter estimates. Annuli counts between the <b>primary</b> <b>reader</b> and all other readers were within two for 80 % of estimates, with uniform variation across a wide age range for Etelis carbunculus (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0. 924, n[*]=[*] 20, 3 – 25 annuli) and Etelis sp. (ICC = 0. 933, n[*]=[*] 15, 2 – 27 annuli). In contrast, annuli counts for Pristipomoides filamentosus (n[*]=[*] 14, 4 – 49) were less precise (i. e. ICC = 0. 835, 66 % of counts within two of <b>primary</b> <b>reader)</b> with a bias toward greater variation in younger, pre-maturational life stages (≤ 5 annuli). Traditionally accepted ageing precision (IAPE ≤ 5. 5 %, CV[*]≤[*] 7. 6 %) was achieved for each species, but was commensurate with reader experience. The multivariate mMDS ordination was more informative in identifying both distance (i. e. dissimilarity) and direction (i. e. form) of variations in annuli counts and vB growth parameter estimates among readers. The acceptable level of ageing precision and bias achieved among most readers indicated that deep-water snappers can be aged precisely when appropriate otolith preparation methods are used. This study contributes towards ageing protocols {{that can be used to}} (i) interrogate bias and precision of age data for stock assessments, and (ii) standardise comparisons of age-based life history characteristics across a species range...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} yields of a radiologist and trained technologists in {{the detection of}} advanced neoplasia within a population-based computed tomographic (CT) colonography screening program. Materials and Methods: Ethical approval {{was obtained from the}} Dutch Health Council, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Nine hundred eighty-two participants (507 men, 475 women) underwent low-dose CT colonography after noncathartic bowel preparation (iodine tagging) between July 13, 2009, and January 21, 2011. Each scan was evaluated by one of three experienced radiologists (>= 800 examinations) by using primary two-dimensional (2 D) reading followed by secondary computer-aided detection (CAD) and by two of four trained technologists (>= 200 examinations, with colonoscopic verification) by using primary 2 D reading followed by three-dimensional analysis and CAD. Immediate colonoscopy was recommended for participants with lesions measuring at least 10 mm, and surveillance was recommended for participants with lesions measuring 6 - 9 mm. Consensus between technologists was achieved in case of discordant recommendations. Detection of advanced neoplasia (classified by a pathologist) was defined as a true-positive (TP) finding. Relative TP and false-positive (FP) fractions were calculated along with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Overall, 96 of the 982 participants were referred for colonoscopy and 104 were scheduled for surveillance. Sixty of 84 participants (71 %) referred for colonoscopy by the radiologist had advanced neoplasia, compared with 55 of 64 participants (86 %) referred by two technologists. Both the radiologist and technologists detected all colorectal cancers (n = 5). The relative TP fraction (for technologists vs radiologist) for advanced neoplasia was 0. 92 (95 % CI: 0. 78, 1. 07), and the relative FP fraction was 0. 38 (95 % CI: 0. 21, 0. 67). Conclusion: Two technologists serving as a <b>primary</b> <b>reader</b> of CT colonographic images can achieve a comparable sensitivity to that of a radiologist for the detection of advanced neoplasia, with far fewer FP referrals for colonoscopy.

40|$|For {{years the}} quality of Ethiopian {{education}} has been lamented over and some have warned of the crises of running an inefficient educational system and its detrimental effects on nation building (Tekeste 1990 : 84). One of the factors in the students’ inability to benefit from their lessons is their lack of reading skills. The Ethiopian Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) is calling for the introduction of supplementary readers to reinforce the learning of English at primary level. In response, many organisations such as The British Council, CODE, Emmanuel Home and PLAN International are providing <b>primary</b> schools with <b>readers.</b> A {{case in point is}} the <b>Primary</b> <b>Readers</b> Scheme of the British Council. This thesis examines if there is any tangible effect on the students’ reading skills by conducting a comparative study between two government schools that received a donation of <b>primary</b> <b>readers</b> and two schools that did not. To begin with a short review of the suitability of the readers selected by the teachers after an initial pilot scheme is made. Then 454 students were tested in this evaluation to check {{if there had been a}} significant improvement in the reading skills of the students in the school that received donations of supplementary readers. It was found that there has been no significant increase in the students’ reading abilities. This is not because there is a weakness in modern theories that preach the usefulness of supplementary readers but because government schools lack the capacity to utilise supplementary readers. Most of the librarians are not qualified, while the teachers, though qualified, lack training in how to use supplementary readers and also tend to be demotivated. Moreover, the administration and running of most of the schools libraries do not allow first cycle students (Grade 1 - 4) to use the libraries and prohibit second cycle students (Grades 5 - 8) from borrowing books, thereby limiting the books’ accessibility. It is also very likely that the country’s socio-economic situation in general and the children’s backgrounds do not encourage the habit of reading for pleasure. Consequently, the Education Sector Development Program will have to make some modifications to maximise the benefits of extensive reading in the future, such as training teachers and librarians as well as encouraging supplementary reading amongst the students. The study concludes that though extensive reading schemes produce impressive results in experimental situations, care should be taken in actual implementation of such schemes in real life. Efforts must be made to ensure the actual delivery of appropriate supplementary readers selected by the students themselves to the schools. Moreover, other important and related aspects including good school administration of libraries, training of teachers, a sustainable supply of books and most of all project monitoring and evaluation should be given due consideration.
