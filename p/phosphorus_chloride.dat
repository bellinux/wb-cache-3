40|$|Chemical burns {{can cause}} severe local pain and tissue damage which require {{specialized}} treatment. They account for one patient in six {{admitted to a}} bums unit after an industrial accident (Herbert & Lawrence, 1989). Strong acids and alkalis are the commonest cause. The initial treatment of nearly all such burns is to drench the affected area with water, remove contaminated clothing and continue dre-nching. There is however a theoretical danger of explosion if water is used to remove certain alkali metals (sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium) because they liberate hydrogen gas and heat. Strong acids and alkalis also evolve heat when water is added, but the heat is dissipated rapidly if sufficient water is used. The local effects of chemical tissue destruction can be very severe and may distract attention from the dangers of systemic toxicity, which are greatest for burns due to yellow (white) phosphorus, hydrofluoric acid and phenols.

The activities of cellulase have a relationship to the concentrations of Zn and Mn at 0. 95 levels respectively, Zn and Mn stimulate many enzyme activities. The relationship between protease and available phosphorus was nearly distinctive at 0. 95 levels, relating with the use of nitrogen fertiliser in the farmlands. Local organic manures and urea fertilisers did not change the soil characteristics to a great extent. However, the soils showed moderate and moderate-to-strong contamination by Mn and Zn in the study areas. Wastewater and groundwater irrigation, pesticides-fungicides, and fertiliser may be responsible for the elevated concentrations of Zn and Mn in the soil samples...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of this {{doctoral}} work, a series of organophosphorus derivatives were synthesised in order to deepen our understanding of the influence of the environment around the phosphorus on the flame retardant mechanism. The Friedel-Crafts reaction of PCl 3 with 2 -hydroxybiphenyl, 2, 2 -dimethylpropane- 1, 3 -diol and 2 -aminobiphenyl yielded the <b>phosphorus</b> <b>chloride</b> precursor of 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO), 5, 5 -dimethyl-[1, 3, 2]-dioxaphosphorinane- 2 -oxide (DDPO) and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -aza- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene 10 -oxide(DAPO) respectively. The <b>phosphorus</b> <b>chloride</b> derivatives were then either hydrolised, oxidised, or thionised to yield a series of molecules where the environment around the phosphorus atom varied. The synthesized molecules were chemically incorporated(preformulation) in phenol epoxy novolac (DEN 438) with different phosphorus concentrations. According to standard EE processes, the modified resins were then cured using DICY as hardener and Fenuron as accelerator. The influence of the chemical modification of the epoxy phenol novolac resin, on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the cured material, was investigated using DSC. As a result of the decreasing number of epoxy functional group available for cross-linking, the Tg decreased with increasing phosphorus loading. This effect was enhanced when sulphur containing molecules were used. However, chemical modification with DAPO only resulted in a negligible impact on Tg as the amine functionality could contribute to the cross-linking. The flame retardant efficiency of the modified resin with different phosphorus loading was evualted using the UL- 94 test, in accordance with the DIN IEC 60695 - 11 - 10. All phosphorus derivatives improved the flame retardancy of phenol epoxy novolac resin with comparable phosphorus loading to DOPO. However, 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -sulfide (DOPS) imparted UL- 94 V 0 rating with only 1. 0 % phosphorus loading. In order to further understand the role of the PO and PS radicals in the mode of flame retardancy of DOPS, Limiting Oxygen Test (LOI) and thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TD-MS) were carried out. TD-MS experiments revealed that PS and PO radicals are released sequentially in the gas which can rationalise the better efficiency of DOPS in comparison to DOPO. LOI experiments showed that the intumescent mechanism of DDPO was reduced when sulphur replaced oxygen in 5, 5 -dimethyl-[1, 3, 2]-dioxaphosphorinane- 2 -sulfide (DDPS). Finally, a part of a cooperation with Prof. G. Camino (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), a DOPO modified resin was cured in the presence of an organically modified montmorrillonite nanoclay (Cloisite 30 B), in an effort to understand the interactions between DOPO and nanoclays and their impact on the flame retardancy of epoxy phenol novolac. The flammability of cured materials was tested using UL- 94 test, LOI and cone calorimetry. The cone calorimeter enables to measure the heat released by the polymeric material under controlled conditions, as well as the gases evolving from the combustion process...|$|E

Blood samples were taken at the same hour (9 am) from the external jugular vein, and then centrifuged and stored until analyses. By means of an UV spectrophotometer, the following blood parameters were assessed for each subject: total protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), urea, creatinine, cholinesterase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutirate, glutamate pyruvate transaminases (GPT), glutamate oxalacetate transaminases (GOT), direct and total bilirubin, magnesium, iron, potassium, <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium.

A correlation among individual values for postnatal age (days of life) and heart rate in calves during the first month of life was observed. In conclusion, modifications of studied parameters could be attributed to functional development of calves in neonatal period and contribute to the knowledge of adaptation processes in calf during the first week and the first month of life resulting useful for the diagnosis and treatment of any neonatal diseases...|$|E

The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine the electrolyte concentrations of prepartum mammary secretions of gravid cows and to investigate retrospectively the possible predictive relationships between these concentrations and the time of parturition. Twenty-three cows were sampled once daily for 3 to 12 d before they calved. The concentrations of calcium, inorganic <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>chloride,</b> magnesium, sodium, and potassium were determined by photometric methods. In addition, the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus were determined using rapid test kits. The correlation between the photometrically measured electrolyte concentrations and the time of parturition was highest for inorganic phosphorus (r = 0. 74). The inorganic phosphorus concentration was 11. 8 to 26. 5 mmol/L in cows that calved within 24 h of sample collection. When 11. 8 mmol/L was used as a cutoff concentration for inorganic phosphorus, 21. 7, 47. 8, and 87. 0 % of cows calved within 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Within 12 d prepartum, the time of parturition can be estimated, with an error of +/- 32. 4 h, by using the results of simultaneous determination of inorganic phosphorus and sodium concentrations in mammary secretions and a formula derived from a multiple regression analysis.

40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure, {{oxygen bomb}} combustion ion chromatography (IC), {{was developed for}} the elemental analysis of heteroatoms in fuel and organic wastes. The use of oxygen bomb combustion under elevated oxygen pressure (25 atm) was shown to produce nitrate upon oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen. As the nitrate formed could affect bromide determination, three methods for removing atmospheric nitrogen using evacuation, rinsing and purging procedures were investigated and the best method found is the purging of air by passing oxygen gas at ambient pressure {{at a rate of}} 420 ml/min for 5 min which was shown to be able to remove 95 % of the nitrates. The use of the more sensitive indirect photometric detection method was investigated for non-suppressed IC determination of anions using the phthalate mobile phase system. Good separation and satisfactory sensitivities were obtained for all the heteroatoms studied. In general, the oxygen bomb IC procedure was shown to give satisfactory results for heteroatom determination except nitrogen which show low recovery (40 % R. S.

Under the optimised conditions, linear working ranges up to 3 orders of magnitude, good repeatability of less than 2 %, low detection limits at sub-μg/ml level, satisfactory retention times up to 16 min and good recoveries of more than 95 % were obtained for the heteroatoms investigated.
