Identifying an instability, and hence the initial formation of a coherent structure, requires the knowledge of initial conditions of the flow structure. Hence, documentation of the initial condition is essential for capturing the evolution and interactions of coherent structures, since initial conditions are quite variable. Overlooking the initial conditions was common in early studies due to researchers overlooking their significance. Initial conditions include the mean velocity <b>profile,</b> <b>thickness,</b> shape, the probability densities of velocity and momentum, the spectrum of Reynolds stress values, etc. These measures of initial flow conditions can be organized and grouped into three broad categories: [...] laminar, highly disturbed, and fully turbulent.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, for an {{aerodynamic}} profile {{the reference}} length {{depends on the}} analysis. In fact, the profile chord is usually chosen as the reference length also for aerodynamic coefficient for wing sections and thin profiles in which the primary target is to maximize the lift coefficient or the lift/drag ratio (i.e. as usual in thin airfoil theory, one would employ the chord Reynolds as the flow speed parameter for comparing different profiles). On the other hand, for fairings and struts the given parameter is usually the dimension of internal structure to be streamlined (let us think for simplicity it is a beam with circular section), and the main target is to minimize the drag coefficient or the drag/lift ratio. The main design parameter which becomes naturally also a reference length is therefore the <b>profile</b> <b>thickness</b> (the profile dimension or area perpendicular to the flow direction), rather than the profile chord.|$|E
50|$|For common flows (the ones {{which can}} usually be {{considered}} as incompressible or isothermal), the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time, {{so there is no}} choice on the viscosity parameter, which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered. On the other hand, the reference length is always an arbitrary parameter, so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels of different shapes: the global Reynolds numbers should be referred to the same reference length. This is actually the reason for which most precise sources for airfoil and channel flow data specify the reference length at a pedix to the Reynolds number. The reference length can vary depending on the analysis to be performed: for body with circle sections such as circular cylinders or spheres, one usually chooses the diameter; for an airfoil, a generic non-circular cylinder or a bluff body or a revolution body like a fuselage or a submarine, it is usually the profile chord or the <b>profile</b> <b>thickness,</b> or some other given widths that are in fact stable design inputs; for flow channels usually the hydraulic diameter) about which the fluid is flowing.|$|E

Minimizing the weight of such components can help reduce the overall payload in aerospace industry. For this purpose, a rotating functionally graded (FG) disk with variable thickness under a steady temperature field is considered in this paper. Thermo elastic solutions {{and the weight of}} the disk are related to the material grading index and the geometry of the disk. It is found that a disk with parabolic or hyperbolic convergent <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> has smaller stresses and displacements compared to a uniform thickness disk. Maximum radial stress due to centrifugal load in the solid disk with parabolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> may not be at the center unlike uniform thickness disk. Functionally graded disk with variable thickness has smaller stresses due to thermal load compared to those with uniform thickness. It is seen that for a given value of grading index, the FG disk having concave <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the lightest in weight whereas the FG disk with uniform <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the heaviest. Also for any given <b>thickness</b> <b>profile,</b> the weight of the FG disk lies in between the weights of the all-metal and the all-ceramic disks...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} the epithelial, stromal, and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> {{in a population}} of eyes with keratoconus. Methods: Epithelial, stromal, and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured in vivo by Artemis very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound scanning (ArcScan) across the central 6 - to 10 -mm diameter of the cornea on 54 keratoconic eyes. Maps of the average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range of epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thickness were plotted. The average location of the thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were found. The crosssectional semi-meridional stromal and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were calculated using annular averaging. The absolute stromal and total corneal thickness progressions relative to the thinnest point were calculated using annular averaging {{as well as for}} 8 semi-meridians individually. Results: The mean corneal vertex epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thicknesses were 45. 7 ± 5. 9 μm, 426. 4 ± 38. 5 μm and 472. 2 ± 41. 4 μm respectively. The average epithelial <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> showed an epithelial doughnut pattern characterized by localized central thinning surrounded by an annulus of thick epithelium. The thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were displaced on average by 0. 48 ± 0. 66 mm temporally and 0. 32 ± 0. 67 mm inferiorly, 0. 31 ± 0. 45 mm temporally and 0. 54 ± 0. 37 mm inferiorly, and 0. 31 ± 0. 43 mm temporally and 0. 50 ± 0. 35 mm inferiorly, respectively, with reference to the corneal vertex.

The SiCp content in the disc is assumed to decrease from the inner to outer radius. The creep behavior of the disc material is described by threshold stress based law with a stress exponent of 5. The stresses and strain rates in the disc are estimated by solving creep constitutive equations along with the equilibrium equation for a rotating disc.
