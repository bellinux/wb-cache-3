40|$|The {{intention}} {{with this}} thesis was to evaluate how much pickling {{that have been}} achieved on aluminium details in the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath</b> before the anodization in an anodization process. As there were no earlier studies to use around pickling before anodization, statistical experimental design was chosen as planning tool. Statistical experimental design was used to plan the experiments in an organized way and to evaluate how the pickling process works together with the main effects and the interaction effects. Detailed scientific studies were performed on how aluminium is prepared and how the anodization process works. The studies were performed in reference books. Three different methods were designed. The first method, method 1, {{was based on a}} fractional factorial design with four design variables, temperature, sodium hydroxide and aluminium concentrations and the time the details was submerged into the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath.</b> The aluminium details was made from a square profile pipe. There was nine experiments performed in method 1. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the pickled surface and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the square profile pipes. The control showed that the standard deviation was 11 µm. Method 2 was based on a complete factorial design where the design variables was temperature and the time the details was submerged into the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath.</b> All aluminium details were homogenous. There were seven experiments performed in method 2. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the pickled surface and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the homogenous details. The control showed that the standard deviation was 14 µm. Method 3 was designed in a different way than method 1 and 2. In method 3 one experiment was performed and the design variable which was changed was the time when the details was submerged into the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath.</b> The aluminium details had the form of homogenous cubes. The measurements on the pickling was performed by measuring the weight of the details on an analytical scale before and after the pickling, and then calculate the pickling in µm in two different ways. The first way was to use the atomic radius of aluminium and the second way was to use the size of the unit cell of aluminium. The two first methods gave very different results than the third method. The result for method 1 showed very random values with great dispersion which resulted in a non-detectable pickling. The result for method 2 was very similar to the result from method 1, very random values with great dispersion and no pickling was detectable with any confidence. The result from method 3 gave a theoretical calculated result for the pickling, when the aluminium details was submerged in the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath</b> for 1 minute, and based on the atomic radius of aluminium, of 1, 52 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 1, 62 µm. When the aluminium details were submerged in the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath</b> for 3 minutes, the theoretical calculation with the atomic radius of aluminium gave that the pickling was 4, 51 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 4, 79 µm...|$|E

30|$|Cu and Zn {{are among}} the most toxic metals {{affecting}} the environment. The primary sources of Cu in industrial wastewater are metal-process <b>pickling</b> <b>baths</b> and plating baths. Cu may also be present in wastewater from a variety of chemical manufacturing processes employing Cu salts or a Cu catalyst (Eckenfelder 2000). Many studies have shown that these metals are toxic even at very low concentrations. However, these metals have many applications in the industry. For example, Cu is known as an excellent conductor of electricity, widely used in the electrical industry in all gauges of wires for circuitry. Cu is also utilized in analytical reagents, in paints for ship keels and in electroplating. Cu acts as an irritant to the skin causing itching and dermatitis, and may cause keratinization of the hands and soles of the feet (Sitting 1981). Zn is often found in effluents discharged from industries involved in acid mine drainage, galvanizing plants, natural ores and municipal wastewater treatment plants and is not biodegradable and travels through the food chain via bioaccumulation (King et al. 2008). Therefore, a systematic study of the removal of Cu and Zn from wastewater is of considerable significance from an environmental point of view.|$|R

Hydrogen accumulation in the material structure can induce the adverse changes in mechanical/metallurgical properties, i. e. cause hydrogen blistering or even hydrogen embrittlement.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of aeronautic engines aims at continuously improving performances and efficiency, reducing {{at the same time}} emissions. However, increasing this temperature severely stresses the turbine constitutive materials, which must be improved. This thesis work was developed in the framework of a Clean Sky European Project coordinated by INSTM-Local Research Unit (LRU) of Politecnico di Torino (I) with the final purpose of producing two turbine casings via Near Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (NNSHIP) using Astroloy as constitutive alloy. Further to coordination the Politecnico di Torino Local Research Unit was heavily involved in the research on the HIP structure analysis, the set up of the heat treatment and the study of the interface generated between the capsule and the consolidated Astroloy. Another LRU of INSTM, based at Politecnico di Milano (I), was involved in the project for their unique expertise on Fstigue Crack Growth tests and analysis. The Aubert & Duval (Fr) company was the other major partner of the project and provided the HIP process, methods and optimization as well as the industrial facilities for Heat Treatment and the production of the two big size casing demonstrators produced within the project. Finally AVIO AERO (I) supervised the project, having the role of Topic Manager and provided the industrial requirements and assessment of the whole project. Current casing constitutive materials are designed to work at ca. 650 ° C and superalloys like Inconel 718 or Waspaloy are typically used. Different aeronautic propulsion producers have various strategies to increase the efficiency of turbines, but they are all trying to find materials and manufacturing routes capable to provide casings which can readily operate at 700 to 800 °C. Besides the requirement on maximum operating temperature casing constitutive materials are also requested to have high stiffness, so as to guarantee the maintenance of accurate clearances between the rotatory and stationary parts of turbines. Materials capable to provide such characteristics are indeed available on the market, but with major problems in terms of workability. Astroloy, the material studied within this thesis work, is characterized by an higher amount of Ti + Al alloying elements with respect to Waspaloy and the increased content of these elements gives the possibility to develop a higher fraction of gamma prime precipitates which are responsible for the improved properties at high temperature. At the same time increased Ti and Al additions provide poor forgeability which can highly limit the feasibility of a casing production cycle with such material. Therefore, although appealing service performances can be achieved by designing with Astroloy, there is of course a strong industrial interest to apply alternative near net shape processing routes (such as Hot Isostatic Pressing) to form such an alloy, so as to increase cost efficiency of manufacturing and reduce the environmental impact of the overall component processing. The aim of this thesis work was manifold: 1) a deep study of the structure achieved in Astroloy Ni superalloy when fabricated via Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPping); 2) the optimization of the heat treatment of HIPped Astroloy, so as to maximize especially its creep and high temperature tensile properties; 3) the evaluation of microstructural and mechanical properties evolution after high temperature over-aging; 4) the study of the HIP capsule-consolidated Astroloy interface, with a consequent definition of the actual overstock to be considered in the fabrication via HIP of Astroloy components. HIPping parameters have already been optimized thus, great efforts were exerted to improve heat treatment; sub- and super- solvus recipes were investigated paying attention also to the cooling rate to be used. The aim was to obtain the best precipitates morphology and distribution preserving serrated grain boundaries and sufficiently small grains. Also the ageing treatment was optimized in order to enhance mechanical properties, avoiding overageing and indicating the best combination of time and temperature to be used to maximize γ' precipitation. Three optimized recipes were obtained which were verified through tensile and creep tests giving very similar properties one to each other. According to all the microstructural features belonging to these recipes, and studying their thermal stability after a high temperature overageing test, one of these recipes was selected as the most promising heat treatment and thus was further investigated with a more extended campaign of experiments. From tensile experiments, it was observed a ductile behavior which is, indeed, altered in some extent, by certain brittle microstructural features occurring only at 760 °C, thus indicating the possible presence of a well-known phenomenon for superalloy, called intermediate temperature brittleness. Actually, 760 °C is indicated as a threshold temperature, above which creep mechanism is contemporary present. From Creep tests, it was derived that, also in Astroloy, the damage is preferentially located at grain boundaries and then it extends to the entire fracture surface. In this case, it was also evidenced how carbides located at grain boundaries are negative features, since they prevent dislocation motion, causing brittleness and easier grains detachment. From fatigue tests, it was observed how surface defects were less tolerable in respect to those located below the surface. Actually samples with surface defects exhibited a failure in less than 106 cycles, while those with sub-superficial defects provided a failure after higher cycles numbers. Fatigue Crack growth test were performed in order to verify the Astroloy capability to withstand the presence of defects, such as PPBs. Results are in good agreement with literature and in some cases (as for higher temperature) even higher. At the end of the work, also a technological issue was tackled. Actually, once the mechanical properties of HIPped Astroloy were demonstrated to be comparable or even higher than those of concurrent materials fabricated via traditional manufacturing route, it was necessary to deal with real components fabrication issues. In particular the topic of the minimum allowable overstock material was analysed and discussed. To achieve HIPping a steel capsule is filled with Astroloy powders and subjected to high temperature and pressure regime. HIP capsule in these operating conditions isotropically collapses for creep effects and transmits the pressure to the powder mass, which as a consequence of pressure and temperature is sintered to a zero level of porosity. It is not surprising that a number of transformation and reaction take place at the interface between the capsule and the consolidated powder mass. As a consequence altered superficial and sub-superficial Astroloy layers are formed close to this interface. These layers have to be removed via acid leaching or machining. Therefore to achieve the optimal raw material usage and to guarantee reliable service performances of HIPped components it is vital to exactly predict the amount of minimum allowable overstock to be provided in part design. To this purpose, a complete analysis of the interface between the capsule and Astroloy was performed and then, a procedure to dissolve the HIPping mold was prepared. First of all, the <b>pickling</b> <b>bath</b> composition was optimized {{in such a way that}} corrosion rate was very high but, at the same time, superalloy underwent only little chemical corrosion. Then a series of tests were performed in order to deeply understand the amount of material to be removed from the mold-Astroloy interface to obtain the optimal mechanical properties. In the end, it was established that a typical 500 μm overstock has to be prescribed. This overstock level makes HIPping a real Net-shape process...|$|E

Several stripping solutions containing different concentrations of zinc and iron in acid media obtained previously by the treatment of SPB by MBSX, were subjected to electrowinning to assess the efficiency and selectivity of zinc electrodeposition over iron under different operation conditions. At similar values of the zinc concentration in the stripping solution, {{the influence of the}} Zn/Fe molar ratio on the zinc electrodeposition process was negligible. On the other hand, although the variation of the initial concentration of zinc in the stripping solution neither affected the efficiency of zinc electrowinning, it increased the minimum value of zinc concentration in solution beyond which iron co-deposition started. Finally, the increase in the applied current, promoted the increase in zinc fractional conversion and in the zinc space–time yield, while the zinc current efficiency was reduced due to the stronger effect of secondary reactions. Although the change in the stripping characteristics seems not to strongly affect the zinc electrodeposition process, the use of a pretreatment step based on MBSX technology improved the results in terms of zinc percentage recovered and the rest of figures of merit, in comparison with those obtained by the direct electrowinning of SPB...|$|R

Metal hydroxide sludge mainly contains metal hydroxides, calcium, fluoride {{and water and}} has up until now been deposited in landfills in Sweden. This thesis shows that hydroxide sludge is fully possible to recycle back into the AOD converter during slag reduction stage. Its calcium fluoride contents are utilized as flux. Prior to reintroduction, the hydroxide sludge is dried and calcined to drive off all water, included chemically bonded water. Calcined metal hydroxide sludge is called hydroflux. Metal content in hydroflux is present as metal oxides. In a bench-scale AOD converter seven successful reduction tests, with three different varieties of hydrofluxes, type A, B and C were performed. The reduction tests are conducted with same basicity and CaO/CaF 2 ratio as a full scale AOD converter. Chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis show that near identical final slag chemistry is achieved as planned. Some differences in metal retrieval, depending on hydroflux type used, are noticed. Briquetting as agglomeration method is performed on one hydroflux. Three types of strength tests are performed on the hydrofluxes and results are compared to toughness of mineral fluorspar.
