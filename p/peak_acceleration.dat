25|$|Peak {{accelerations}} can {{be increased}} by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by {{a reduction in the}} fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time.

40|$|The {{demand to}} sail at high forward speeds in both calm water {{and in a}} seaway remains high. For various patrol, search and rescue or {{military}} operations attaining high forward speeds is essential. In head and bow quartering seas, the main factor for voluntary speed reduction is the occurrence of large vertical <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The occurrence of large vertical <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> imposes limits to the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. A challenge for designers of fast monohulls is to explore different possibilities to increase the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. To achieve this a reduction of the vertical accelerations is required. The operability can be considered improved if the level of accelerations can be reduced compared to a trip at an equal but constant forward speed. This implies {{that it is possible}} to sail at a higher speed without increasing the discomfort on board. A solution for increasing the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas has been found in proactive control. Vertical <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> have a very short duration. Unacceptably large vertical <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> have a low frequency of occurrence. These two aspects are the incentive for a proactive control system. What makes proactive control unique is the fact that the control is based on predicted vertical <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The response of the ship for the next few seconds needs to be simulated real-time while sailing. These predictions should be carried much faster than real-time, since there is little to effectuate control because of the high relative velocity between ship and incoming waves. In this dissertation proactive control of the forward speed, also termed automated proactive thrust control, has been presented. The purpose of this study is to show the level of reduction of the vertical accelerations possible with automated proactive thrust control.

40|$|Several {{physical}} parameters {{may contribute}} to control the amount of high frequency energy in the spectrum of strong ground motions. These phenomena include {{the total amount of}} geological slip on the fault causing the earthquake, the slip rate (or repeat time) of earthquakes on the fault, dynamics of fault rupture, lithology of the fault zone, whether the fault is in an extensional or compressional environment, and geometrical factors including whether or not the rupture reaches the surface. In this paper, we review evidence that points towards the significance of these parameters, and present examples where they may play a role. These considerations are particularly relevant when considering the significance of ground motions from the three largest earthquakes that are well-recorded on strong motion accelerographs, and for all of which the <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> were surprisingly low. The first was the Michoacan, Mexico earthquake of Sept. 19, 1985 (Mw= 8. 0), where <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> at four stations on rock directly above the fault had <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> of 13 - 17 percent of gravity.

Raw and 25 - 16  Hz filtering frequencies significantly overestimated and 6  Hz underestimated motion analysis <b>peak</b> <b>accelerations</b> (P < 0. 007).
