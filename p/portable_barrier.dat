2500|$|... 1978– August 7: Hamilton held a {{round of}} the Formula Atlantic Championship. The {{insurance}} company demanded that the metal containers that formed part of the <b>portable</b> <b>barrier</b> system be filled with sand. In the haste {{to get this done}} in time, sand was dumped all over the road. The resulting delay led to the whole event being run in just half a day. Following 30 minutes of practice, a shortened qualifying session was held for 48 minutes, although there was basically only one line because the sand still lying on the circuit. The race was finally started at 8pm. The race was originally scheduled for 70 laps. There was a safety car period after an early three-car incident. The race was eventually red flagged after 39 laps due to darkness. Keke Rosberg (1982's Formula One World Champion) won the race.|$|E

After field investigations, a total of 2455 barrier collisions were collected in 12 freeways during 2009 to 2011 from police reports and maintenance records. In the data collection area, 9 freeways’ barriers installed in roadsides or medians were consistent with M. O. T Specification for Design and Construction of Expressway Safety Appurtenance (JTJ 074 - 94), and 3 freeways’ barriers satisfied the requirements of M. O. T Specification for Design of Highway Safety Facilities (JTG D 81 - 2006). Their collision performance was assessed in terms of collision severe grade, occupant injury, and vehicles pass through barrier or not. The investigation data indicate that the performance of concrete barriers {{is better than the}} W-beam barriers, and the performance of roadside W-beam barriers is better than median W-beam barriers. The outcome of buses and trucks impacting with the W-beam barriers was more serious. Impacts at <b>portable</b> <b>barriers</b> installed in median opening often resulted in serious consequence. The data suggest {{that there is a need}} to enhance crashworthy level for W-beam barriers, and develop crashworthy <b>portable</b> <b>barriers,</b> in order to prevent vehicles form passing through the system and decrease severe injuries or fatalities of vehicle occupants...|$|R

Ideally, a PWFB system is expected to protect persons and objects behind it and redirect the errant vehicle. The performance criteria of a road safety barrier system are (i) redirection of the vehicle after impact and (ii) lateral deflection within allowable limits.

40|$|Often, road {{construction}} causes {{the need to}} create a work zone. In these scenarios, <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barriers</b> (PCBs) are typically installed to shield workers and equipment from errant vehicles as well as prevent motorists from striking other roadside hazards. For an existing W-beam guardrail system installed adjacent to the roadway and near the work zone, guardrail sections are removed in order to place the <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barrier</b> system. The focus of this research study was to develop a proper stiffness transition between W-beam guardrail and <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barrier</b> systems. This research effort was accomplished through development and refinement of design concepts using computer simulation with LS-DYNA. Several design concepts were simulated, and design metrics were used to evaluate and refine each concept. These concepts were then analyzed and ranked based on feasibility, likelihood of success, and ease of installation. The rankings were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for selection of a preferred design alternative. Next, a Critical Impact Point (CIP) study was conducted, while additional analyses were performed to determine the critical attachment location and a reduced installation length for the <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barriers.</b> Finally, an additional simulation effort was conducted in order to evaluate the safety performance of the transition system under reverse-direction impact scenarios as well as to select the CIP.

Most highway work zones are restricted in terms of available lateral space for accommodating traffic and the work activity. Consequently, it is desirable to minimize the deflection of work zone barriers {{in order to minimize}} the required buffer distance between the barrier and work activity area and, thereby, maximize the space and number of lanes available for traffic. Under this study, a new connection designed to reduce the dynamic deflection of <b>portable</b> concrete traffic <b>barriers</b> was developed through a program of finite element simulation and full-scale crash testing. The new cross-bolted (or X-bolt) connection utilizes two threaded rods in different horizontal planes across the barrier joint to form a tight, moment connection. It achieves the objective of low dynamic barrier design deflection without sacrificing constructability. In addition to being easy to install, the new barrier system is also perceived to be easy to inspect, and repair. Crashworthiness and design deflection of the barrier connection were verified through full-scale crash testing using segment lengths of 10 ft and 30 ft.

Freeway diverges represent particularly difficult work zones areas. This thesis investigates current methods of delineating diverges in freeway work zones to determine important characteristics of these methods for future research. A virtual environment was constructed with two ramp geometries: a freeway continuing straight and one curving left. Still images of work zones on these geometries were created using drums spaced 10 ft apart, drums spaced 40 ft apart, drums spaced 40 ± 2 ft apart, and <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barriers.</b> These alternatives were used to construct temporary ramps that were either open or closed. 39 {{participants were asked to}} identify whether the ramp was open or closed and their responses were recorded to evaluate the performance of each alternative.

40|$|<b>Portable</b> water-filled <b>barriers</b> (PWFBs) are {{roadside}} appurtenances {{that prevent}} vehicles from penetrating into temporary construction zones on roadways.

The joint mechanism hence plays {{a crucial role in the}} performance of a PWFB system at high speed impacts. This paper investigates the desired features of the joint mechanism in a PWFB system that can re-direct vehicles at high speeds, while limiting the lateral displacement to acceptable limits. A rectangular “wall” representative of a 30 m long barrier system was modeled and a novel method of joining adjacent road barriers was introduced through appropriate pin-joint connections. The impact response of the barrier “wall” and the vehicle was obtained and the results show that a rotational stiffness of 3000 kNm/rad at the joints seems to provide the desired features of the PWFB system to re-direct impacting vehicles and restrict the lateral deflection.

40|$|Road safety {{barriers}} {{are used to}} redirect traffic at roadside work-zones. When filled with water, these barriers are able to withstand low to moderate impact speeds up to 50 kmh- 1. Despite this feature, <b>Portable</b> Water-filled <b>barriers</b> (PWFB) face challenges such as large lateral displacements, tearing and breakage during impact; especially at higher speeds. This study explores the use of composite action to enhance the crashworthiness of PWFBs and enable their usage at higher speeds. Initially, energy absorption capability of water in PWFB is investigated. Then, composite action of the PWFB {{with the introduction of}} steel frame is considered to evaluate its enhanced impact performance. Findings of the study show that the initial height of the impact must be lower than the free surface level of water in a PWFB in order for the water to provide significant crash energy absorption. In general, an impact of a road barrier with 80 % filled is a good estimation. Furthermore, the addition of a composite structure greatly reduces the probability of tearing by decreasing the strain and impact energy transferred to the shell container. This allows the water to remain longer in the barrier to absorb energy via inertial displacements and sloshing response.

LS-DYNA code is as highly dynamic, non-linear numerical solver which is commonly used in the automotive and road safety industries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Roadside safety {{barriers}} designs are tested with passenger cars in Europe using standard EN 1317 {{in which the}} impact angle for normal, high and very high containment level tests is 20 °. In comparison to EN 1317, the US standard MASH has higher impact angles for cars and pickups (25 °) and different vehicle masses. Studies in Europe (RISER) and the US have shown values for the 90 th percentile impact angle of 30 °– 34 °. Thus, the limited evidence available suggests that the 20 ° angle applied in EN 1317 may be too low. The first goal {{of this paper is}} to use the US NCHRP database (Project NCHRP 17 – 22) to assess the distribution of impact angle and collision speed in recent ROR accidents. Second, based on the findings of the statistical analysis and on analysis of impact angles and speeds in the literature, an LS-DYNA finite element analysis was carried out to evaluate the normal containment level of concrete barriers in non-standard collisions. The FE model was validated against a crash test of a <b>portable</b> concrete <b>barrier</b> carried out at the UK Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). The accident data analysis for run-off road accidents indicates that a substantial proportion of accidents have an impact angle in excess of 20 °. The baseline LS-DYNA model showed good comparison with experimental acceleration severity index (ASI) data and the parametric analysis indicates a very significant influence of impact angle on ASI. Accordingly, a review of European run-off road accidents and the configuration of EN 1317 should be performed...|$|R

The objective of this research is to validate the Finite Element (FE) model of a Ford F 800 Single Unit Truck (SUT). The FE Model of the SUT was developed at the FHWA/NHTSA National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) at the George Washington University.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of GPGPU programming, there is not yet a <b>portable</b> and formally-specified <b>barrier</b> that one can use to synchronise across workgroups. Moreover, the occupancy-bound execution model of GPUs breaks assumptions inherent in traditional software execution barriers, exposing them to deadlock. We present an occupancy discovery protocol that dynamically discovers a safe estimate of the occupancy for a given GPU and kernel, allowing for a starvation-free (and hence, deadlock-free) interworkgroup barrier by restricting the number of workgroups according to this estimate. We implement this idea by adapting an existing, previously non-portable, GPU interworkgroup barrier to use OpenCL 2. 0 atomic operations, and prove that the barrier meets its natural specification in terms of synchronisation. We assess the portability of our approach over eight GPUs spanning four vendors, comparing the performance of our method against alternative methods.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, the Low-Profile <b>Portable</b> Concrete <b>Barrier</b> (PCB) system, {{including}} both the sloped Low-Profile PCB segment and Low-Profile PCB end treatment, were developed. The original Low-Profile PCB end treatment was designed with steel pins inserted along the barrier centerline, through precast holes, and {{anchored to the}} pavement or subgrade. The purpose of these pins was to reduce lateral deflection of the end treatment during an impact. For various reasons, users of the Low-Profile PCB system have stated that the system would be more easily deployed if the vertical pins were not used in situations where lateral deflections can be permitted. The primary objective of the research presented herein {{was to determine the}} feasibility of removing the vertical, steel pins from the Low-Profile PCB end treatment in certain applications and if necessary make modifications. The secondary objective of the research presented herein was to demonstrate the applicability of the finite element analysis (FEA) to unpinned barrier systems. The research objectives were achieved through the use of sound engineering judgment, FEA, and a full-scale crash test. Based on sound engineering judgment and approximate strength analyses of the original Low-Profile PCB design, the author determined the system would most likely function acceptably but would have large lateral deflections. In order to increase connection rigidity and thus control lateral displacement, a plate washer was added to the barrier connection. The modified non-pinned Low-Profile PCB system was tested for strength in a full-scale crash test under Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) test 2 - 35. Additionally, the recommended system was analyzed under similar test conditions with LS-DYNA, a finite element code. The recommended system passed the MASH test 2 - 35, in both a full-scale crash test and FEA. While this does not replace the original barrier, it does provide another option for use of the Low-Profile PCB in situations where sufficient room for deflection outside of the length of need exists.
