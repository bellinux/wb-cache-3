5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since <b>penetrance</b> of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete <b>penetrance.</b> Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high <b>penetrance.</b> A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
50|$|The {{susceptibility}} to IDDM is polygenic and environment exerts a strong effect on gene <b>penetrances.</b> Environment including housing conditions, health status, and diet all affect development of diabetes in the mice. For instance, NOD mice maintained in different laboratories can have {{different levels of}} incidence. The incidence of disease is linked to Microbiome.|$|R
40|$|<b>Penetrances</b> of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 {{mutations}} {{have been}} derived from retrospective studies, implying {{the possibility of}} ascertainment biases to influence the results. We have followed women at risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer for two decades, and report the prospectively observed age-related annual incidence rates to contract breast or ovarian cancer for women with deleterious BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations based on 4830 observation years. Patients were grouped according to mutation, age and having/not having had previous cancer. In women not having had previous cancer and aged 40 - 59 years, the annual incidence rate to contract breast or ovarian cancer in those having the most frequent BRCA 1 founder mutations was 4. 0 %, for women {{in this age group}} and with less frequent BRCA 1 mutations annual incidence rate was 5. 9 %, and for women with BRCA 2 mutations 3. 5 %. The observed figures may be used for genetic counseling of healthy mutation carriers in the respective age groups. The results may indicate that less frequent BRCA 1 mutations have higher <b>penetrances</b> than BRCA 1 founder mutations...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{haplotype}} {{information in}} case–control studies {{is an area}} of focus for the research on the association between phenotypes and genetic polymorphisms. We examined the validity of the application of the likelihood-based algorithm, which was originally developed to analyze the data from cohort studies or clinical trials, to the data from case–control studies. This algorithm was implemented in a computer program called PENHAPLO. In this program, haplotype frequencies and <b>penetrances</b> are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm, and the haplotype–phenotype association is tested using the generalized likelihood ratio. We show that this algorithm was useful not only for cohort studies but also for case–control studies. Simulations under the null hypothesis (no association between haplotypes and phenotypes) have shown that the type I error rates were accurately estimated. The simulations under alternative hypotheses showed that PENHAPLO is a robust method for the analysis of the data from case–control studies even when the haplotypes were not in HWE, although real <b>penetrances</b> cannot be estimated. The power of PENHAPLO was higher than that of other methods using the likelihood-ratio test for the comparison of haplotype frequencies. Results of the analysis of real data indicated that a significant association between haplotypes in the SAA 1 gene and AA-amyloidosis phenotype was observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, thereby suggesting the validity of the application of PENHAPLO for case–control data...|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full <b>penetrance</b> and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant {{inheritance}} and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk {{factor is the}} inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele {{increases the risk of}} the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete <b>penetrance.</b> For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.|$|E
25|$|Males {{with a full}} {{mutation}} display virtually complete <b>penetrance</b> {{and will}} therefore almost always display symptoms of FXS, while females with a full mutation generally display a <b>penetrance</b> of about 50% {{as a result of}} having a second, normal X chromosome. Females with FXS may have symptoms ranging from mild to severe, although they are generally less affected than males.|$|E
40|$|Suppose that {{we wish to}} {{classify}} families with multiple cases of disease into one of three categories: those that segregate mutations of a gene of interest, those which segregate mutations of other genes, and those whose disease is due to nonhereditary factors or chance. Among families {{in the first two}} categories (the hereditary families), we wish to estimate the proportion, p, of families that segregate mutations of the gene of interest. Although this proportion is a commonly accepted concept, it is well defined only with an unambiguous definition of “family. ” Even then, extraneous factors such as family sizes and structures can cause p to vary across different populations and, within a population, to be estimated differently by different studies. Restrictive assumptions about the disease are needed, in order to avoid this undesirable variation. The assumptions require that mutations of all disease-causing genes (i) have no effect on family size, (ii) have very low frequencies, and (iii) have <b>penetrances</b> that satisfy certain constraints. Despite the unverifiability of these assumptions, linkage studies often invoke them to estimate p, using the admixture likelihood introduced by Smith and discussed by Ott. We argue against this common practice, because (1) it also requires the stronger assumption of equal <b>penetrances</b> for all etiologically relevant genes; (2) even if all assumptions are met, estimates of p are sensitive to misspecification of the unknown phenocopy rate; (3) even if all the necessary assumptions are met and the phenocopy rate is correctly specified, estimates of p that are obtained by linkage programs such as HOMOG and GENEHUNTER are based on the wrong likelihood and therefore are biased in the presence of phenocopies. We show how to correct these estimates; but, nevertheless, we do not recommend the use of parametric heterogeneity models in linkage analysis, even merely as a tool for increasing the statistical power to detect linkage. This is because the assumptions required by these models cannot be verified, and their violation could actually decrease power. Instead, we suggest that estimation of p be postponed until the relevant genes have been identified. Then their frequencies and <b>penetrances</b> can be estimated on the basis of population-based samples and can be used to obtain more-robust estimates of p for specific populations...|$|R
40|$|An {{extension}} of the usual mixture model of heterogeneity (two family types, one with and one without linkage) is proposed by introducing age at onset as a covariate. The extended model defines age-dependent <b>penetrances</b> where the exact parametrization of age-at-onset distributions depends on the given genotype and family type (linked or unlinked). This extension was applied to breast cancer families. We postulated that the mean age at onset in individuals affected by the linked gene was lower than the mean age at onset in all other affected individuals. Linkage heterogeneity for breast cancer families was detected at a significance level of. 003...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with estimating parameters associated with HLA-linked diseases. We consider a single disease locus closely linked to HLA, allowing a disease and a normal allele. The parameters to be estimated are the <b>penetrances</b> of the genotypes at the disease locus, the population frequency of the disease allele, and {{the distance of the}} disease locus from HLA. The presently used method of estimation uses HLA-sharing information from affected sib-pairs. The method proposed here generalizes the previous approach, using data from all sibs (affected or unaffected) in a family of any size. It allows immediate generalizations to the use of information on parental affectedness status and population prevalence...|$|R

This {{has been reported in}} some cases of iminoglycinuria. Here, system IMINO is thought {{to play a role in}} reduced <b>penetrance</b> of iminoglycinuria by compensating for imino acid malabsorption related specifically to mutations of PAT2. Conversely, SIT1 mutations are believed to result in full expression of iminoglycinuria in some cases where heterozygous mutations of PAT2 would otherwise have only been sufficient to cause hyperglycinuria.|$|E

For a sample of pedigrees containing a particular configuration of affecteds, e. g., pairs of siblings together with a first cousin, we use a likelihood analysis to find 1 -df statistics that are very efficient over a broad range of <b>penetrances</b> and allele frequencies. We identify configurations of affecteds that are particularly powerful for detecting linkage, and we show how pedigrees containing different numbers and configurations of affecteds can be efficiently combined in an overall test statistic...|$|R
40|$|Under {{complete}} {{linkage disequilibrium}} (LD), robust tests often have greater power than Pearson's chi-square test and trend tests {{for the analysis}} of case-control genetic association studies.

We consider here a more general incomplete LD model, and examine the impact of <b>penetrances</b> at the marker locus when the genetic models are defined at the disease locus. Robust statistics are then reviewed and their efficiency and robustness are compared through simulations in GWAS of 300, 000 markers under the incomplete LD model.

40|$|Several {{different}} methods for linkage analysis are shown to arise {{from a single}} likelihood function L for the observed allele-sharing data at multiple markers in a chromosomal region.

40|$|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has {{recently}} gained {{use as a}} method of estimating required probability and likelihood functions in pedigree analysis, when exact computation is impractical. However, when a multiallelic locus is involved, irreducibility of the constructed Markov chain, an essential requirement of the MCMC method, may fail. Solutions proposed by several researchers, which do not identify all the noncommunicating sets of genotypic configurations, are inefficient with highly polymorphic loci. This is a particularly serious problem in linkage analysis, because highly polymorphic markers are much more informative and thus are preferred. In the present paper, we describe an algorithm that finds all the noncommunicating classes of genotypic configurations on any pedigree. This leads to a more efficient method of defining an irreducible Markov chain. Examples, including a pedigree from a genetic study of familial Alzheimer disease, are used to illustrate how the algorithm works and how <b>penetrances</b> are modified for specific individuals to ensure irreducibility...|$|R

25|$|For some genetic diseases, {{environmental}} cofactors are {{an important}} determinant of variation and outcome. In the case of hemochromatosis, <b>penetrance</b> is incomplete, even for the classic HFE mutation, and is affected by gender, diet, and behaviors such as alcohol consumption. Compound heterozygotes are often observed only through subclinical symptoms such as excess iron. Disease is rarely observed in such compound heterozygotes unless other causal factors (such as alcoholism) are present. As a result, compound heterozygosity for hemochromatosis may be more common than diagnosis based on pathology would suggest.|$|E
25|$|These {{disorders}} are often best known in some classic form, {{such as the}} homozygous recessive case of a particular mutation that is widespread in some population. In its compound heterozygous forms, the disease may have lower <b>penetrance,</b> because the mutations involved are often less deleterious in combination than for a homozygous individual with the classic symptoms of the disease. As a result, compound heterozygotes often become ill later in life, with less severe symptoms. Although compound heterozygosity {{as a cause of}} genetic disease had been suspected much earlier, widespread confirmation of the phenomenon was not feasible until the 1980s, when polymerase chain reaction techniques for amplification of DNA made it cost-effective to sequence genes and identify polymorphic alleles.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{may also}} be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated {{with the effects of}} multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, {{they do not have a}} clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person’s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat, because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies which aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype-phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, <b>penetrance,</b> and expressivity.|$|E

The constraints that allele frequencies and <b>penetrances</b> {{lie in the}} interval 0 - 1 impose limits on recurrence risks, KR, in relatives of an affected proband for a given population prevalence, KP. We have investigated these limits for KR in three classes of relatives (MZ co-twin, sibling, and parent/offspring) for the general single-locus model and for two types of multilocus models: heterogeneity and multiplicative. In our models we have assumed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, an all-or-none trait, absence of nongenetic resemblance between relatives, and negligible mutation at the disease loci. Although the true values of KP and the KR's are only approximately known, observed population and family data for bipolar disorder are inconsistent with a single-locus model or with any heterogeneity model. In contrast, multiplicative models involving three or more loci are consistent with observed data and, thus, represent plausible models for the inheritance of bipolar disorders.
