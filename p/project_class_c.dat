40|$|Nowadays the International Patent Classification (IPC) {{has become}} the main information-retrieval system {{in the field of}} patent information. The {{efficiency}} in using the IPC for patent search depends to a great extent on the consistency of classifying in Patent Offices of different countries. Insufficient consistency may be explained by errors in classifying, by peculiarities of patent laws influencing the wording of a patent document, {{as well as by the}} complexity of identifying the subject of an invention which should be classified. To provide the desired completeness and accuracy of classifying it is reasonable to use aspect analysis of document contents in order to reveal all relevant aspects from which the subject of an invention should be considered. The creation in different patent offices of common search files based on the IPC would also contribute to the efficient use of the IPC. An example thereof is the documentation file prepared under the <b>project</b> on <b>class</b> <b>C</b> 12. ...|$|R

2500|$|Four Seasons {{has also}} held {{a number of}} <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> {{basketball}} tourneys. In Montana, <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> athletics have a complex structure due to {{the large number of}} schools and the extensive geographic distances involved. <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> play is organized into divisions, with each division having two or more districts: Eastern Division (districts 2 and 3), Southern Division (districts 4 and 6), Northern Division (districts 7, 8, 9, and 10), and Western Division (districts 11/12, 13, and 14). Each district (which contains six to 11 schools) holds a district tournament, sending two or four winners (depending on the number of schools in the district) to the divisional tournament. [...] Each division holds a divisional tournament, sending two teams to the state tourney. Great Falls is located geographically in the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> Northern Division. Four Seasons Arena hosted the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> state boys' basketball tournament in 1999. In 2005, it hosted the first-ever combined Northern Division <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> boys' basketball tournament in Montana history (in which all four Northern Division district tourneys were held simultaneously). It hosted the combined Northern <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> boys' and girls' basketball tournaments in 2008 and again in 2009. In 2010, Four Seasons was the site of the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> girls' state basketball tournament—the first time the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> state tourney had been held in the city. The arena will host the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> girls' state tournament again in 2012, as well as the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> boys' Northern Division combined district basketball playoffs.|$|R
