25|$|Healthcare workers {{exposed to}} antineoplastic agents take {{precautions}} {{to keep their}} exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists who prepare these drugs or nurses who may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest <b>potential</b> <b>exposure</b> to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have <b>potential</b> <b>exposure</b> to these drugs {{during the course of}} their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs. Routes of entry into the worker's body are skin absorption, inhalation, and ingestion via hand-to-mouth. The long-term effects of exposure include chromosomal abnormalities and infertility.|$|E

40|$|The National Occupational Health Survey of Mining (NOHSM) was {{conducted}} at 491 mines during 1984 through 1989. There were 60 coal mines and 431 metal and nonmetal mines. The mines employed 59, 734 miners, representing 66 mineral commodities. The survey at each mine included questionnaires, chemical inventories, and worksite visits. Questionnaire data included information on medical services, industrial hygiene practices, and general facility information. An inventory was made of chemical substances and trade name products on the mine property and their annual usage. <b>Potential</b> <b>exposures</b> at the mines were determined, based on observations and worker interviews. The projected numbers of <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> across the entire mining industry were estimated, based on the representative sample of mines in each mineral commodity. Because workers were often potentially exposed {{to more than one}} agent, the numbers of <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> may be greater than the total number of workers. It was estimated that in the entire mining industry, there were over 365, 000 <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> to physical agents; over 710, 000 <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> to musculoskeletal overload conditions; and over 188, 000 <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> to welding, brazing, and soldering agents.

25|$|Modeling dietary {{exposure}} {{is important to}} support dietary risk assessments. Validated {{dietary exposure}} models {{can be used in}} total ingestion studies which focus on the level of exposure to a contaminant from all food sources and they can also be used in aggregate exposure models which may include exposure to a chemical or contaminant through additional means of exposure such as inhalation and dermal or skin contact exposure. In addition, dietary exposure models are useful for identifying at risk populations and <b>potential</b> <b>exposure</b> “hot-spots”. For government agencies, modeling dietary exposure is especially useful in estimating possible exposure to a chemical during a pre-market review. An example of such review would the evaluation of a new pesticide by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine if it is safe for use or to determine regulations to control such use.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy {{published}} {{projections of}} the radiation risks {{over the next year}} (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. <b>Potential</b> <b>exposure</b> could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. However, natural radiation levels are higher {{in some parts of the}} world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Paula Jefferson, head of Beachcroft LLP's Disease Group, said: [...] "Any {{organisation}} {{involved in}} any activity in the future, where there {{is the potential for}} release of harmful substances in to the atmosphere, should ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to identify the potential contamination and to then ensure that they either employ, or have themselves the necessary skills, to deal with that contamination. The principles in the judgment apply not just when there is demolition in progress, but to any activity where there is potential for exposure in to the atmosphere. Where there is any known potential for such exposure, then regard should be had to not just the onsite workforce but also to those living and working in the surrounding area. In the Corby case the area of risk was 4km from the demolition site. The area for <b>potential</b> <b>exposure</b> will clearly vary depending on the circumstances of each case.

40|$|Finding {{feasible}} {{strategies to}} distribute antibiotics {{quickly to the}} general public in response to an anthrax attack remains a difficult challenge. Among the proposed strategies is the pre-event placement of pharmaceuticals in individual households for use only as directed by public health authorities. These medications (known as “MedKits”) would allow many exposed persons to begin treatment quickly while reducing the number who visit on points of dispensing, the primary distribution strategy. This paper describes a model that estimates the expected number of deaths in an anthrax attack by modeling the logistics of the response and the use of MedKits. The results show that increasing the number of MedKits distributed can reduce the expected number of deaths. When the population has more <b>potential</b> <b>exposures,</b> deploying MedKits is more effective. The MedKits reduce the number of <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> who seek prophylaxis, which allows those truly exposed (but without MedKits) to receive medication sooner, which saves lives. Beyond the scenarios considered here, the ability to predict this benefit in other scenarios will be valuable to public health officials who are considering this option...|$|R
40|$|The {{demolition}} of a facility historically used for processing and handling transuranic materials is considered. Residual alpha emitting radionuclide contamination poses an exposure hazard if {{released to the}} local environment during the demolition. The process of planning for the {{demolition of}} this highly alpha contaminated building, 232 -Z, included a predemolition modeling analysis of <b>potential</b> <b>exposures.</b> Estimated emission rates were used as input to an air dispersion model to estimate frequencies of occurrence of peak air and surface exposures. Postdemolition modeling was also conducted, based on the actual demolition schedule and conditions. The modeling results indicated that downwind deposition is the main operational limitation for demolition of a highly alpha-contaminated building. During the demolition of 232 -Z, airborne radiation and surface contamination were monitored. The resultant non-detect monitoring results indicate a significant level of conservatism in the modeled results. This comparison supports the use of more realistic assumption in the estimating emission rates. The resultant reduction in modeled levels of <b>potential</b> <b>exposures</b> has significant implications {{in terms of the}} projected costs of demolition of such structures...|$|R
