5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow <b>pressed</b> <b>glass.</b> Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and <b>pressed</b> <b>glass</b> beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} cut glass is expensive, {{and the reason}} is that cutting it is a slow process. Four wheels have to be used in succession, iron, sandstone, wood, and cork. Sand is thrown upon these wheels {{in such a way that}} the glass is finely and delicately cut. But this is imitated in <b>pressed</b> <b>glass,</b> which is blown in a mould inside of which the design is cut. This is much cheaper than the cut glass.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} that sets apart three-mold ware from <b>pressed</b> <b>glass</b> {{is that the}} inverse of the pattern of three-mold glass can be felt {{on the inside of}} the object. <b>Pressed</b> <b>glass</b> is patterned only on the exterior and smooth inside. [...] <b>Pressed</b> <b>glass,</b> termed “mold-pressed,” has an interior form independent of the exterior, in contrast to mold-blown glass, whose interior corresponds to the outer form. [...] Plates, lamp bases and door knobs were usually made of <b>pressed</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The glass {{molding process}} (GMP) can <b>press</b> <b>glass</b> perform into {{a shape of}} {{finished}} lens under {{high pressure and temperature}} conditions, and it is easy to achieve mass production. So, it has emerged as a promising alternative way to produce complex shapes lens. It is well known that viscoelastic is one important properties of glass at high temperature. In this study, A 4 -pair generalized maxwell model was used to express viscoelastic of glass, and model parameters were obtained by fitting the relaxation curve obtained from experiment. The finite element models were established by MSC. MARC, the correctness of the FEM models and its used model parameters were verified by the cylindrical compression experiments. Finally, the simulations of glass lens forming stage were performed under different conditions. Stresses distribution were predicted by FEM, {{it was found that the}} maximum stress at the edge of lens, which make lens rupture easily at this zone. It was also discovered that the molding temperature is higher, the less stress, and the molding velocity is higher, the higher stress...|$|R
