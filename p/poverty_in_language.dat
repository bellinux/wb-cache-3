40|$|This {{research}} utilized {{data from}} the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress {{to examine the relationship}} between demographic variables and academic achievement. Previous studies have demonstrated the influences of race, poverty, English language proficiency, and school racial composition on academic performance, and this research sought to understand these relationships in students from racial minority groups, particularly Native American students. Additionally, the relationship between attendance in public versus Bureau of Indian Education schools and test scores was examined. Results highlighted the achievement gap between White students and those from racial minority groups, including Native American students, and revealed negative relationships between the demographic variables and academic performance. Students <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> English <b>language</b> learners, those who attended schools with higher proportions of minority students, and those who attended BIE schools scored lower than their counterparts in all grade levels and subjects. Implications for improving Native American student performance are discussed, including the need for culturally relevant curricula, the possibility of instruction <b>in</b> Native <b>languages,</b> and further examination into factors that facilitate academic achievement in BIE schools. Future directions for research also are discussed, including the use of survey research methods with and the use of qualitative research to understand the educational experiences of Native American students.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} {{and explain the}} ways we negotiated these same epistemological tensions and structural realities as we implemented the iPad loan component of the project reported in this book (hereafter: “iPad loan program”). Children {{who participated in the}} iPad loan program were able to take home one of the project iPads used in their preschool centre, much as they were able to take home books and puzzles. This component was one reflection of the ethos of “digital inclusion” that infused the project. As we noted in the introduction to this book, there is international recognition of the role that schools can play in ensuring all communities can participate in digital culture and the digital economy (e. g., European Commission, 2014; United States Government, 2013). Accordingly, we conducted the project in preschool centres where at least some groups of children were thought to enjoy less access to learning on digital platforms than others. Our goal was to put the iPad into the hands of children who might not otherwise have had access to it, while supporting teachers and parents in capitalising on the learning potential of the device for all the children. Centres nominated for the project by administrators in the preschool system all served communities that were either affected by <b>poverty</b> and/or diverse <b>in</b> <b>language</b> and culture...|$|R
