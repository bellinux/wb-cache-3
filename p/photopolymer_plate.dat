It is used by many small presses that produce fine, handmade, limited-edition books, artists' books, and high-end ephemera such as greeting cards and broadsides.

50|$|<b>Photopolymer</b> <b>plates</b> {{are light}} sensitive. On one side {{the surface is}} cured when it is exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light and other side is a metal or plastic backing that can be mounted on a base. The relief printing surface is created by placing a negative of the piece to be printed on the photosensitive side of the plate; the light passing through the clear regions of the negative causes the photopolymer to harden. The unexposed areas remain soft and can be washed away with water.|$|R
50|$|With {{this process}} the {{electronically}} generated image is scanned at speed to a <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plate</b> material that carries a thin black mask layer on the surface. The infrared laser-imaging head, which runs {{parallel to the}} drum axis, ablates the integral mask to reveal the uncured polymer underneath. A main ultraviolet exposure follows to form the image through the mask. The remaining black layer absorbs the ultraviolet radiation, which polymerizes the underlying photopolymer where the black layer has been removed. The exposed digital plate {{still needs to be}} processed like a conventional flexo plate. That is, using solvent-based washout with the necessary waste recovery techniques, although some water-washable digital plates are in development. This technology has been used since 1995 and is only now becoming more widely used around the world as more affordable equipment becomes available. Trade sources say there are around 650 digital platesetters installed in label, packaging and trade platemaking houses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Printing {{offers the}} {{possibility}} of producing mass quantities {{of a wide variety}} of electronic components and devices quickly and at lower cost. Flexography is mainly used for packaging applications, but is also a potential method for the micro manufacture of electronic devices, smart packaging and RFID. Fine solid lines of high quality are essential to enable printing of ink tracks for electronic applications. Plate characteristics are among a number of process parameters that will influence print line quality, which will affect the electrical performance of printed tracks. Deformation of the <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plate</b> is an important factor in determining the line quality. Therefore, an investigation into plate deformation is vital. A numerical model of close multiple lines has been developed and used to examine its deformation under a range of printing conditions. An Ogden constitutive model was used to describe the response of the <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plate</b> material. A series of uniaxial tension and pure shear experiments was carried out to provide mechanical properties of the photopolymer. In validation of the material model, numerical results agree well with the experimental data in both simple tension and pure shear. Numerical models were then used to determine the change in line profile, as the deformations occur on a microscopic level and cannot be assessed experimentally. The simulations yield information on line width increase due to plate deformation. However, the predicted line width is smaller than that of printed line measured using image analysis. The difference in line width is due to ink spreading and by relating the numerical results with those from the printed copy; the proportion of increase in line width due to the deformation of the printing plate has been quantified at 53 to 69 %.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{changes in}} flexography printing {{in recent years}} concerning the printing quality achievable cannot generally be ascribed to a single revolutionary invention, but {{are the result of}} continuous developments to the complete system. Thus the direct drive technology in all machine types and its associated advantages in terms of printing length corrections has become established since drupa 2000. The race for ever finer raster rolls has also been completed to the benefit of improvements in bowl geometry and in ceramic surfaces. Clearly improved colour transfer behaviour has become feasible as a result. In a closely intermeshed system such as flexography printing this naturally has to {{have an effect on the}} printing colours used. Further improvements in bonding agents and pigment concentrations now allow users to print ever thinner colour layers while maintaining all of the required authenticities. Furthermore, it has become possible to reduce additional disturbing characteristics in the UV colour area, such as the unpleasant odour. While the digital imaging of printing plates has primarily been improved in terms of economic efficiency by the use of up to eight parallel laser beams, extreme improvements in the system are noticeable especially in the area of directly engraved printing moulds. Whereas many still dismissed directly engraved polymer plates at the last drupa as a laboratory system, the first installation was recently placed on the market a mere three years later. A further noteworthy innovation of recent years that has reached market maturity is thin sleeve technology, which combines the advantages of a <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plate</b> with a round imaged printing mould. There are no high sleeve costs for each printing mould, except for one-off cost for an adapter sleeve. To conclude, it can be said that although flexography printing has experienced many new features in the time between drupa 2000 and today, it still has enormous potential for further development...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{development}} {{which has}} sparked flexography {{is the introduction}} and use of <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plates.</b> These plates have simplified flexographic printing by {{reducing the amount of}} time and effort needed to prepare plates for press and makeready. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of commonly used solvent mixtures on flexographic plates. The plates tested include those using natural rubber, Buna N, and various photopolymers. The experiment specifically studied change in hardness of these plate materials due to immersion in different solvent mixtures over time. Noticeable differances in the degree of softening of plates was observed after 24 hours of immersion. Differences in the degree of softening were found in the plates after soaking in different percents of solvents. It was also discovered what percents of different lactol spirits and normal propyl acetate added to alcohol would affect the plates the most. Further, these differences were detectable at different periods of time. Most plates softened with time. One plate softened to such a degree with the solvent of this experiment that it was difficult to determine which solvents had a significant effect. This, of course, {{is due to the fact}} that solvents compatible with this plate were not used in this experiment. All <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plates</b> performed poorly in acetates, but it would be possible to use acetates with these plates over short periods of time on small press runs. When using flexographic plates of the composition tested in this experiment it is recommended that the practitioner use less than five percent of lactol or ten percent normal propyl acetate for a minimum affect on these plates over a short period of time...|$|R

40|$|Dark {{reaction}} {{is a condition}} in which the plate acts as if it is exposed to a low level of active light, even though it is being stored in the dark. The Stouffer scale or the sensitivity guide is used to measure this dark reaction which takes place also as a result of high temperature and relative humidity. If there is much dark reaction taking place, more solid steps will show up on a negative working plate. For the purpose of this experiment diazo and photopolymer presensitised, negative working, lithographic plates were chosen. These plates were cut into small sections to eliminate plate variables. They were then subjected to different levels of temperature and relative humidity in a temperature controllable oven. The relative humidity being controlled by using various super- saturated salt solutions. A light integrator was used to expose the plates to the same amount of light energy, with a sensitivity guide. The plates were then developed by hand and the critical or solid step determined visually to measure the dark reaction undergone by the plates due to variations in temperature, relative humidity, and time. With the results obtained curves were drawn to study the relationship between dark reaction and temperature, dark reaction and relative humidity, and dark reaction and time. The curves show an increase in dark reaction with an increase in temperature, relative humidity, and time in the case of diazo <b>plates.</b> The <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plates,</b> on the other hand, seemed to be more stable at higher temperatures, but a high relative humidity destroys the plate coating.

50|$|Letterpress is {{considered}} a craft as it involves using a skill and is done by hand. Fine letterpress work is crisper than offset litho because of its impression into the paper, giving greater visual definition to the type and artwork, {{although it is not}} what letterpress traditionally was meant for. Today, many of these small letterpress shops survive by printing fine editions of books or by printing upscale invitations, stationery, and greeting cards. These methods often use presses that require the press operator to feed paper one sheet at a time by hand. Today, the juxtaposition of this technique and offbeat humor for greeting cards has been proven by letterpress shops to be marketable to independent boutiques and gift shops.

50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plates.</b> After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals.

Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press.

However, flexography has print characteristics that can be problematic for printed electronics such as high image (feature) gain and the ability to hold fine images (features) in the (relief) printing plate. This study used a “banded” anilox roll, which has multiple volumes and cell counts separated into bands, conductive nano-silver, water-based ink, and a PET substrate and printed on a commercial flexo narrow- web press. The process parameters studied included types of sticky back, anilox cell count/volume, plate imaging, and plate surface morphology. The printed transparent grid patterns were evaluated for conductivity, which was measured with a Digital Multimeter; and transparency, which was measured with a transmission densitometer. The results of the study showed that when the <b>photopolymer</b> <b>plates</b> were imaged at a resolution of 000 dpi and with a “flat top dot” (1 : 1 file - image) exposure technique, the flexo plate was able to hold a minimum of 6. 35 microns line width.

Results have shown that most thermal transitions that are characteristic for PLA and PCL do not take place in the area of temperatures applicable in the printing process.
