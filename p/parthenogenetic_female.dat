5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>female</b> is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{roles of}} male and food density in {{regulating}} female performance were investigated in the brackish cladoceran, Daphniopsis australis. <b>Parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> and ephippial females were tested using a 2 × 4 factorial experiment involving the presence {{and the absence of}} a male cross-classified with nil, low, medium and high food densities. For <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females,</b> the male presence and food density failed to trigger the switch from asexual to sexual reproduction, but the presence of male negatively affected parthenogenesis through egg abortion. Food density affected the animal longevity but depended on the male presence. The reproductive output was favoured by increasing food densities, but the male presence increased egg abortion, suggesting male being an added stress factor to <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females.</b> For ephippial females, food densities affected the frequency of switch from sexual to asexual modes in the absence and the presence of a male. However, the male enhanced switch frequency under low and high food densities. Longevity was increased with the male presence but was unaffected by food density. The ephippial females successfully produced diapausing eggs with the male presence. Although, ephippial females could switch to parthenogenesis but the reproductive output of switched ephippial females was inferior to that of <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> since birth. The results reveal that the male presence and food density can impact the performance of female D. australis. Hence, this study provides an insight into the understanding of the reproductive biology of cladocerans and a possible alternative explanation for population dynamic of this species and other cladocerans in the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{photoperiodic}} {{response of}} 56 parthenogenetic lineages of Aphis gossypii Glover was examined by rearing the aphids for three generations under short day conditions (SD, L 10 : 13 14) and 17 degrees C. The lineages {{were derived from}} aphid samples collected in central and northern Greece from various crops and uncultivated plants of the families Asteraceae [chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum sp., smooth sow-thistle Sonchus oleraceus L. and dahlia Dahlia variabilis (Willd.) ], Cucurbitaceac [watermelon Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) and zucchini Cucurbita pepo L. ] and Malvaceae [cotton Gossypium hirsutum L., okra Abelmoschus esculentus (L.), and rose of Sharon Hibiscus syriacus L. ]. The {{results showed that the}} predominant life cycle category in both central and northern Greece (despite possible differences in winter severity among regions) was obligate parthenogenetic (anholocyclic) as 55 out of the 56 lineages belonged to this category. These lineages produced mostly wingless <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> at percentages 59 - 83 % and 48 - 86 % in the first and late born progeny of the second generation under SD, respectively. The remaining percentages refer to winged <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females.</b> The only lineage capable of sexual reproduction was an 'intermediate' one which was sampled on cotton in northern Greece. Most of its progeny in the second generation under SD were wingless <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> (65 %). The percentage of winged <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females,</b> males and 'intermediate' <b>females</b> (produce wingless <b>parthenogenetic</b> and a few sexual females) were 8, 22, and 5 %, respectively. The results reported here are considered as the first for southern European populations and support the general belief that A. gossypii is mostly anholocyclic in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Aphids, the {{destructive}} insect pests in the agriculture, horticulture and forestry, {{are capable of}} reproducing asexually and sexually upon environmental change. However, the molecular basis of aphid reproductive mode switch remains an enigma. Here we report a comparative analysis of differential gene expression profiling among <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females,</b> gynoparae and sexual females of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii, using the RNA-seq approach with next-generation sequencing platforms, followed by RT-qPCR. At the cutoff criteria of fold change $ 2 and P, 0. 01, we identified 741 up- and 879 down-regulated genes in gynoparae versus <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females,</b> 2, 101 up- and 2, 210 down-regulated genes in sexual females compared to gynoparae, and 1, 614 up- and 2, 238 down-regulated genes in sexual <b>females</b> relative to <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females.</b> Gene ontology category and KEGG pathway analysis suggest the involvement of differentially expressed genes in multiple cellular signaling pathways into the reproductive mode transition, including phototransduction, cuticle composition, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and endocrine regulation. This study forms a basis for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the shift from asexual to sexual reproduction in the cotton aphid. It also provides valuable resources {{for future studies on}} this host-alternating aphid species, and the insight into the understanding of reproductive mode plasticity in different aphid species...|$|R
30|$|Ovoviviparity {{seems to}} be an {{important}} factor for successful invasions. With this type of reproductive strategy (Winterbourn [1970]; Ponder [1988]), P. antipodarum females brood embryos in a brood pouch and release from 20 to 120 free crawling juveniles (Cheng and LeClair [2011]). Native P. antipodarum populations contain both abundant <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> and sexual females and males at a relatively lower proportion (Winterbourn [1970]). However, non-native populations mostly consist of <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females,</b> males being rare or absent (Gangloff [1998]; Butkus et al. [2012]). Thus, colonization may have occurred from the introduction of a single female (Proctor et al. [2007]; Cheng and LeClair [2011]; Poirier [2013]). Like P. antipodarum, the exotic ovoviviparous snail Sinotaia quadrata (Benson 1842) (Viviparidae Gray, 1847) was also introduced into South America and is now established in Argentina (Ovando and Cuezzo [2012]).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Two {{distinctive}} {{forms of}} cercopagids, first detected in 1998 and identified as Cercopagis pengoi and C. ossiani using taxonomic keys, were observed to co-occur in Lake Ontario. C. ossiani was the predominant form in western Lake Ontario in mid-June 1999 but was then replaced by C. pengoi-like animals {{over the rest}} of the season. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that these forms were geneti-cally identical at the ND 5 gene and that they are morphologically distinctive forms of C. pengoi. In 1999, Cercopagis reached a maximum abundance of 1, 759 individuals/m 3 (average abundance = 281 individu-als/m 3, average biomass = 5. 2 mg/m 3). In August, Cercopagis biomass was lowest at nearshore and embayment sites and highest at offshore sites. Body length of <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> was lower at nearshore (1. 16 mm) and embayment (1. 19 mm) sites relative to offshore (1. 32 mm) ones. Maximal clutch size of <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> was 24 embryos per individual. Cercopagis has already spread to Lake Michigan and five Finger Lakes.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the genetic}} structure of three populations of Heterocypris from temporary ponds {{on the island}} of Lampedusa (Italy) where both unisexual (all females) and bisexual populations were found. Population from Cavallo Bianco is made up of females only with typical morphological feature of H. incongruens. In the bisexual population from Aria Rossa adult females present a lobe-like expansion (lamella hyalina) on the posterior margin of the left valve. This is a typical morphological feature of H. barbara. In bisexual population from Vallone della Forbice both female morphotypes are syntopic. Isoenzymatic analysis shows that adult females without lamella hyalina are apomictic, whereas females with this feature are amphimictic. To evaluate the taxonomic status and the phylogenetic relationships in Heterocypris complex from Lampedusa, we used sequences of the mtDNA 16 S ribosomal subunit and sequences of the Elongation factor- 1  nuclear gene. In addition, karyotype analysis was performed with Giemsa, fluorocromes and C-banding. For comparison, we analysed a clonal lineage from a parthenogenetic population from a northern Italian rice-field, individuals from a Spanish amphimictic population of H. incongruens (temporary pond of Laguna Espolla) and individuals from a Spanish bisexual population of H. barbara. Heterocypris populations from Lampedusa can be grouped into two main groups: a cluster including <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> without lamella from Cavallo Bianco (20 chromosomes two of which unpaired), the parthenogenetic lineage of H. incongruens from northern Italy and H. incongruens from bisexual population from Spain (female 2 n = 10 A+ 10 X; male 2 n = 10 A+ 5 X). A second cluster including amphimictic females with lamella from Aria Rossa (female 2 n = 10 A+ 10 X; male 2 n = 10 A+ 5 X), <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> without lamella and amphimictic females with lamella from Vallone della Forbice and H. barbara bisexual population from Spain. This result confirms that two species of Heterocypris coexist on Lampedusa Island: H. incongruens and H. barbara. Heterocypris incongruens <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> from Cavallo Bianco show the typical morphological feature of the species. Within the H. barbara group, two female lineages are distinguishable according to their morphotypes and reproductive modes: amphimictic females with lamella and <b>parthenogenetic</b> <b>females</b> without lamella. These lineages are syntopic in Vallone della Forbice. Our data support the hypothesis of inter-specific hybridisation between coexisting syngamic and clonal lineages of Heterocypris. The close taxonomic association of asexual and sexual females within H. barbara cluster imply a recent origin for asexual lineages...|$|R
