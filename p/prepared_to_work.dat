5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E

Lenders would become Proprietors of the Navigation, and the work was to begin at Thrapston and extend the navigable section towards Northampton. It took the Commissioners two years to agree who should carry out the work, but on 22 June 1758, John Smith jnr from Attercliffe, Yorkshire was contracted to construct 20 pound locks, 20 horse haling bridges and various other works {{at a cost of}} £14,070. The river opened to navigation in stages over the next three years, with a great celebration being held at Northampton on 7 August 1761 when the work was completed.|$|E

I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 2010, Rodríguez was {{involved}} in an incident where a pickup truck was partially damaged. He and a companion were burned, being initially attended {{at a hospital in}} Vega Baja, before both were transferred to the specialized burn care unit of Centro Médico in San Juan, where he was placed in preventive intubation to ease the stress on his lungs. Rodríguez suffered second degree burns in approximately 66% of his body, most of the damage focusing in his back and legs. Due to the incident, Rodríguez was removed from a scheduled dual, but was kept among the recipients of a grant issued by the COPUR. By late December he was already training two to three days per week, while admitted in the burn unit and still wearing bandages around one of his arms and both legs. His trainer, Orlando Rodríguez, noted that {{this was the first time}} that he worked with a pugilist while still recovering in a hospital. Consequently, a special regime was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on his footwork, speed and strength, while including other standard practices such as shadow boxing and pads. In his first interview since the incident, Rodríguez noted that he intended to focus on his career and education from that point onwards, severing ties with any negative influence. The following week, the possibility of infection was dismissed by the medical personnel, who allowed more contact with external items, including haircutting tools. Upon being released, the original plan was to participate in the qualification of the 2011 Pan American Games, but he received a negative report from Enrique Amy, chief doctor of the COPUR's Anti-Doping Commission. The amateur boxing federation followed the recommendation. Consequently, Rodríguez spent several months of additional recovery, focused on treatment to avoid re-injuring or infecting the scar tissue in his left arm.|$|E

Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About {{a third of the}} plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland. The plates were polished to 98percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks. Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442linear feet (744m) of welded seams. Welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns. The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Edna {{announced}} that she was leaving Skelton but would continue to manage his career and write material for him. He did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC. They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm. The couple did not discuss {{the reasons for their}} divorce and Edna initially <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as a script writer for other radio programs. [...] When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity. [...] Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets. She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.|$|E
500|$|According to Gordon Berg of Computer Gaming World, {{the legal}} and {{logistical}} problems of keeping [...] "a portion of Looking Glass [...] intact" [...] to finish the game had been [...] "hurdled". Further, because of the game's type of funding, the continued development of Jane's Attack Squadron {{would have been at}} little cost to Electronic Arts. Fans petitioned the publisher to let development continue, and Looking Glass employee Rich Carlson said that Hantzopoulos and others from the Flight series, roughly twenty in all, were <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the game again. The petition reached 2,000 signatures by May 30 and 5,000 by June 1. However, Electronic Arts dropped the game. The publisher's Jeff Brown said that the decision [...] "was based on our deep uncertainty that the project could meet any schedule given the changes in senior management and a history of missing deadlines." [...] Brown told the website Combatsim that Electronic Arts had [...] "worked diligently" [...] with Looking Glass for more than two years, and that, although the game had missed its planned October 1999 release, they had been willing to delay the project into 2000. He blamed the developer's closure for the decision to cancel the game. Rumors circulated that the decision was part of the publisher's larger plan to abandon the flight simulator genre, and Computer Gaming Worlds Denny Atkin later summarized that the company [...] "ran screaming from the simulation market" [...] after Looking Glass's bankruptcy. Electronic Arts soon dropped the Jane's Information Group license.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} selected factors associated with preparing elementary teachers in north Mississippi public schools <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with limited English proficient (LEP) students. The objectives of this research were (a) to determine the awareness of elementary teachers in north Mississippi public schools concerning the legal aspects of teaching limited English proficient students, (b) to ascertain if a need exists <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> teachers in north Mississippi public schools <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with limited English proficient students, and (c) to identify types of instruction that teachers in north Mississippi public schools would participate in when <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with limited English proficient students. The subjects in this study were elementary teachers from 17 school districts in north Mississippi public schools with an identified LEP student population. A random sample of 344 elementary teachers was chosen to participate in the study in the spring of 1997. The instrument used to gather the data for this study was a questionnaire constructed by the researcher. The questions on the questionnaire were categorized according to demographics, the legal aspects of teaching LEP students, the need <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> teachers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with LEP students, types of instruction for <b>preparing</b> teachers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with LEP students, and a general question related to teaching LEP students. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using the SPSS 6. 1 for Windows Student Version (1994) software package. Tables were used to present the data. Statistical analysis involved measuring frequency and percentage of responses. The following conclusions were reached based on the results of the statistical analysis of the data for this study: (a) teachers in north Mississippi public schools are not aware of the legal mandates that pertain to LEP students; (b) there is a need <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> teachers in north Mississippi public schools <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with LEP students; and (c) teachers in north Mississippi public schools have preferences concerning the types of instruction they would participate in when <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with LEP students...|$|R
