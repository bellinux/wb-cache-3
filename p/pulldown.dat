40|$|AbstractHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) virions {{contain a}} {{proteinaceous}} layer termed the tegument that lies between the nucleocapsid and viral envelope. The mechanisms underlying tegumentation remain largely undefined for all herpesviruses. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) <b>pulldowns</b> and coimmunoprecipitation studies, {{we have identified}} a domain of the tegument protein VP 22 that facilitates interaction with VP 16. This region of VP 22 (residues 165 – 225) overlaps the glycoprotein E (gE) binding domain of VP 22 (residues 165 – 270), which is sufficient to mediate VP 22 packaging into assembling virus particles. To ascertain {{the contribution of the}} VP 16 and gE binding activities of VP 22 to its virion incorporation, a transfection/infection based virion incorporation assay, using point mutants that discern between the two binding activities, was utilized. Our results suggest that interaction with VP 16 is not required for incorporation of VP 22 into virus particles and that binding to the cytoplasmic tail of gE is sufficient to facilitate packaging...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{isolated the}} SKN 7 gene in a screen designed to isolate new {{components of the}} G 1 -S cell cycle transcription machinery in budding yeast. We have now found that Skn 7 associates with Mbp 1, the DNA-binding component of the G 1 -S transcription factor DSC 1 /MBF. SKN 7 and MBP 1 show several genetic interactions. Skn 7 overexpression is lethal and is suppressed by a mutation in MBP 1. Similarly, high overexpression of Mbp 1 is lethal and can be suppressed by skn 7 mutations. SKN 7 is also required for MBP 1 function in a mutant compromised for G 1 -specific transcription. Gel-retardation assays indicate that Skn 7 is not {{an integral part of}} MBF. However, a physical interaction between Skn 7 and Mbp 1 was detected using two-hybrid assays and GST <b>pulldowns.</b> Thus, Skn 7 and Mbp 1 seem to form a transcription factor independent of MBF.

40|$|We {{identified}} a direct {{interaction between the}} neuronal transmembrane protein calsyntenin- 1 and the light chain of Kinesin- 1 (KLC 1). GST <b>pulldowns</b> demonstrated that two highly conserved segments in the cytoplasmic domain of calsyntenin- 1 mediate binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of KLC 1. A complex containing calsyntenin- 1 and the Kinesin- 1 motor was isolated from developing mouse brain and immunoelectron microscopy located calsyntenin- 1 in association with tubulovesicular organelles in axonal fiber tracts. In primary neuronal cultures, calsyntenin- 1 –containing organelles were aligned along microtubules and partially colocalized with Kinesin- 1. Using live imaging, we showed that these organelles are transported along axons with a velocity and processivity typical for fast axonal transport. Point mutations in the two kinesin-binding segments of calsyntenin- 1 significantly reduced binding to KLC 1 in vitro, and vesicles bearing mutated calsyntenin- 1 exhibited a markedly altered anterograde axonal transport. In summary, our results indicate that calsyntenin- 1 links {{a certain type of}} vesicular and tubulovesicular organelles to the Kinesin- 1 motor.

50|$|Also {{because the}} 2:3:3:2 <b>pulldown</b> scheme was devised {{in order to}} make <b>pulldown</b> removal for editing in native 24p more efficient, the <b>pulldown</b> {{arrangement}} is not ideal for watching footage. There can be exaggerated stutters in motion, because the frames which are split into three fields are not only onscreen for 50% longer than the other frames, they are back-to-back.

40|$|Chk 2 is a {{key player}} of the DNA damage {{signalling}} pathway. To identify new regulators of this kinase, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found that Chk 2 associated with the B' regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase PP 2 A. In vitro GST-Chk 2 <b>pulldowns</b> demonstrated that B'gamma isoforms bound to Chk 2 with the strongest apparent affinity. This was confirmed in cellulo by co-immunoprecipitation after overexpression of the respective partners in HEK 293 cells. The A and C subunits of PP 2 A {{were present in the}} complexes, suggesting that Chk 2 was associated with a functionnal PP 2 A. In vitro kinase assays showed that B'gamma 3 was a potent Chk 2 substrate. This phosphorylation increased the catalytic phosphatase activity of PP 2 A measured on MAP kinase-phosphorylated myelin basic protein as well as on autophosphorylated Chk 2. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpressing B'gamma 3 in HEK 293 suppressed the phosphorylation of Chk 2 induced by a genotoxic treatment, suggesting that PP 2 A may counteract the action of the checkpoint kinase in living cells...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of pedals on a pipe organ {{grew out of the}} need to hold bass drone notes, to support the {{polyphonic}} musical styles that predominated in the Renaissance. Indeed, the term pedal point, which refers to a prolonged bass tone under changing upper harmonies, derives from the use of the organ pedalboard to hold sustained bass notes. These earliest pedals were wooden stubs nicknamed [...] "mushrooms" [...] which were placed {{at the height of the}} feet. These pedals, which used simple <b>pulldowns</b> connected directly to the manual keys, are found in organs dating to the 13th century. The pedals on French organs were composed of short stubs of wood projecting out of the floor which were mounted in pedalboards that could be either flat or tilted. Organists were unable to play anything but simple bass lines or slow-moving plainsong melodies on these short stub-type pedals. Organist E. Power Biggs, in the liner notes for his album Organs of Spain noted that [...] "One can learn to play them, but fluent pedal work is impossible".|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} GST <b>pulldowns</b> from A 431 cell cytosol to {{identify}} three new binding partners for the γ-adaptin appendage: Snx 9, ARF GAP 1, and a novel ENTH domain-containing protein, epsinR. EpsinR {{is a highly}} conserved protein that colocalizes with AP- 1 and is enriched in purified clathrin-coated vesicles. However, {{it does not require}} AP- 1 to get onto membranes and remains membrane-associated in AP- 1 –deficient cells. Moreover, although epsinR binds AP- 1 via its COOH-terminal domain, its NH 2 -terminal ENTH domain can be independently recruited onto membranes, both in vivo and in vitro. Brefeldin A causes epsinR to redistribute into the cytosol, and recruitment of the ENTH domain requires GTPγS, indicating that membrane association is ARF dependent. In protein-lipid overlay assays, the epsinR ENTH domain binds to PtdIns(4) P, suggesting a possible mechanism for ARF-dependent recruitment onto TGN membranes. When epsinR is depleted from cells by RNAi, cathepsin D is still correctly processed intracellularly to the mature form. This indicates that although epsinR is likely to be {{an important component of the}} AP- 1 network, it is not necessary for the sorting of lysosomal enzymes...|$|R

We have shown that inclusion of specific DNA sequences in plasmid constructs mediates nuclear import both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we use plasmid affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and live-cell <b>pulldowns</b> of transfected plasmid constructs to identify protein cofactors that interact in a sequence-specific manner with these DNA nuclear targeting sequences (DTSs). Importin β 1, importin 7, and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran all demonstrate DTS-specific interaction in both MS and pull-down assays, consistent with our model of plasmid nuclear import. In addition, knockdown of importin β 1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogates plasmid nuclear import, indicating that it is a necessary cofactor.

40|$|Medulloblastoma is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} brain tumor in children. Therapeutic approaches to medulloblastoma (combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have led to significant improvements, but these are achieved at a high cost to quality of life. Alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. Genetic mutations leading to the activation of the Hedgehog pathway drive tumorigenesis in ~ 30 % of medulloblastoma. In a yeast two-hybrid proteomic screen, we discovered a novel interaction between GLI 1, a key transcription factor for the mediation of Hedgehog signals, and PIN 1, a peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase that regulates the postphosphorylation fate of its targets. The GLI 1 /PIN 1 interaction was validated by reciprocal <b>pulldowns</b> using epitope-tagged proteins in HEK 293 T cells as well as by co-immunoprecipiations of the endogenous proteins in a medulloblastoma cell line. Our results support a molecular model in which PIN 1 promotes GLI 1 protein abundance, thus contributing to the positive regulation of Hedgehog signals. Most importantly, in vivo functional analyses of Pin 1 in the GFAP-tTA;TRE-SmoA 1 mouse model of Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma demonstrate that the loss of Pin 1 impairs tumor development and dramatically increases survival. In summary, the discovery of the GLI 1 /PIN 1 interaction uncovers PIN 1 as a novel therapeutic target in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma tumorigenesis...|$|R
