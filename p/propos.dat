25|$|Duteurtre's first novel, Sommeil Perdu, {{is about}} a {{depressed}} young man leaving his hometown to live in Paris. It was published in 1985, when Duteurtre was a journalist writing for several French newspapers. In 1987, he published his second novel, Les Vaches (completed and renamed A <b>propos</b> des vaches in 2000), which presents {{the life of a}} boy growing between his school year in Le Havre and his holidays in the French mountains. The magazine L'infini also published some of his short stories.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à <b>propos</b> of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

He also gave vent to his fierce love of snobbish genealogizing and vitriolic well-documented gossip, writing about famous people of his time such as André Gide, Henry de Montherlant, Jean Cocteau, Jean Genet, Marcel Jouhandeau, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Gaston Gallimard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Charles de Gaulle, and Georges Pompidou, among many others. Claiming he had reliable sources within the Vatican's [...] "black aristocracy", once again he stated that three recent popes of the 20th century were homosexuals. He particularly loved to expose the hypocrisy and vanity of prominent people, to denounce fake aristocrats and to out closeted homosexuals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} whether a given {{equation}} holds in every Heyting algebra was shown to be decidable by S. Kripke in 1965. The precise computational complexity {{of the problem was}} established by R. Statman in 1979, who showed it was PSPACE-complete and hence at least as hard as deciding equations of Boolean algebra (shown NP-complete in 1971 by S. Cook) and conjectured to be considerably harder. [...] The elementary or first-order theory of Heyting algebras is undecidable. It remains open whether the universal Horn theory of Heyting algebras, or word problem, is decidable. [...] À <b>propos</b> of the word problem it is known that Heyting algebras are not locally finite (no Heyting algebra generated by a finite nonempty set is finite), in contrast to Boolean algebras which are locally finite and whose word problem is decidable. [...] It is unknown whether free complete Heyting algebras exist except {{in the case of a}} single generator where the free Heyting algebra on one generator is trivially completable by adjoining a new top.|$|E
