5000|$|The first <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> {{devices were}} {{developed}} in the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air. In 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water. The initial type of passive sampler developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device (SMPD). SPMD samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Kow) ranging from 4-8. As the global emission of bioconcentratable persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was shown to result in adverse ecological effects, industry developed {{a wide range of}} increasing water-soluble, polar hydrophilic organic compounds (HpOCs) to replace them. These compounds generally have lower bioconcentration factors. However, there is evidence that large fluxes of these HpOCs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms, such as altered behavior, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and impaired reproduction. In the late 1990s research was underway to develop a new passive sampler in order to monitor HpOCs with a log Kow value of less than 3. [...] In 1999 the POCIS sampler was under development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. It gathered more support in the early 2000s as concern increased regarding the effects of pharmaceutical and personal care products in surface waters. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been heavily involved in the development of passive samplers and has articles in their database regarding the development of POCIS as early as 2000. The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a self-proclaimed international leader in the field of <b>passive</b> <b>sampling.</b> There have been recent efforts by the USGS to connect people who have an interest in <b>passive</b> <b>sampling.</b> An international workshop and symposium on <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> was held by the USGS in 2013 to connect developers, policy makers and end users in order to discuss ways of monitoring environmental pollution.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} ability of the Wagner-Leith <b>passive</b> aerosol <b>sampler</b> to measure indoor exposures over periods of 24 hours to 2 weeks. An automated analysis technique was developed so that lower aerosol concentrations could be sampled over shorter time periods. A test of the new analytical method against a manual method showed good agreement. The <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> was tested alongside three pump-operated, sizeselective samplers in indoor environments. Generally, good correlation with the active samplers was observed. Correlation with a personal impactor with uncoated substrates was not statistically significant, but the cyclone, MS&T impactor, and overall correlations had R 2 values of 0. 73 – 0. 88. Combining these data with a previous study produced an R 2 of 0. 96 between passive and active results. Large discrepancies (up to 147 %) between passive and personal impactor results were observed and were attributed to particle bounce in the impactor, <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> imprecision due to few collected fine particles, and problems with detection of organic particles in the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler.</b> The Wagner-Leith sampler has now been tested over five orders of magnitude in mass concentration, in which it has proved useful for obtaining aerosol size distributions, mass fractions, qualitative elemental analysis, and morphology of individual particles.

50|$|The POCIS {{device was}} {{developed}} and patented by Jimmie D. Petty, James N. Huckins, and David A. Alvarez, of the Columbia Environmental Research Center. Integrative passive samplers are {{an effective way to}} monitor the concentration of organic contaminants in aquatic systems over time. Most aquatic monitoring programs rely on collecting individual samples, often called grab samples, at a specific time. The grab sampling method is associated with many disadvantages that can be resolved by <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> techniques. When contaminants are present in trace amounts, grab sampling may require the collection of large volumes of water. Also, lab analysis of the sample can only provide a snapshot of contaminant levels at the time of collection. This approach therefore has drawbacks when monitoring in environments where water contamination varies over time and episodic contamination events occur. <b>Passive</b> <b>sampling</b> techniques have been able to provide a time-integrated sample of water contamination with low detection limits and in situ extraction of analytes.|$|E

Most monitoring programmes involve the periodic collection of low volume spot samples (bottle or grab) of water, which is challenging, particularly where levels fluctuate over time and when chemicals are only present at trace, yet toxicologically relevant concentrations. The Chemcatcher® <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> device is currently being used throughout the world to measure time-weighted average (TWA) or equilibrium concentrations {{of a wide range of}} pollutants in water. This allows the end user to obtain a more representative picture of the chemicals that may be present in the aquatic environment.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to estimate average concentra-tions and size distributions with a miniature passive aerosol sam-pler. To use the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler,</b> one exposes it to an environment {{for a period of}} hours to weeks. The <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> is intended to monitor ambient, indoor, or occupational aerosols and has poten-tial utility as a personal sampler. The sampler is inexpensive and easy to operate and is capable of taking long-term samples to in-vestigate chronic exposures. After <b>sampling,</b> the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> is covered and brought to the lab. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and automated image analysis are used to count and size collected particles with d p> 0. 1 m. Alternatively, more advanced microscopy techniques can be used for ambient-pressure analysis or elemental characterization. Image analysis is used in conjunction with particle density and shape factors to obtain the mass ux as a function of aerodynamic diameter. The ux and a deposition veloc-ity model are then used to estimate the average mass concentration and size distribution over the sampling period. The deposition ve-locity model consists of a theoretical component and an empirical component.

50|$|The use of <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> devices, {{such as the}} Chemcatcher®, and {{the polar}} organic {{chemical}} integrative sampler (POCIS), {{have a number of}} advantages over the use of spot or bottle sampling for monitoring pollutants in the aquatic environment.

Passive samplers, depending on their mode of use can give either the TWA or equilibrium concentration of the pollutant over the deployment period. The measurement of TWA concentrations give a better indication of the long-term environmental conditions and enables improved risk assessment. Such devices have potential roles in monitoring programmes such as those underpinning the European Union’s Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

50|$|The use of quality-controlled, commercially {{available}} receiving phases allow high reproducibility {{as compared to}} some other <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> devices. The bound receiving phase also ensures that the active sampling area of the device remains constant during laboratory or field calibration uptake experiments and in field deployments. By altering the combination of receiving phase and diffusion-limiting membrane (low-density polyethylene, polyethersulphone or cellulose acetate), you can monitor potable, surface , coastal and marine environment. The sampler can be deployed {{in the field for}} extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks. The specific pollutants of interest are sequestered by the samplers and these are retained on the receiving phase disk. After retrieval from the environment the pollutants are eluted from the disk and analysed in the laboratory using conventional instrumental methods. In order to obtain TWA concentrations the sampler must first be calibrated in the laboratory so as to ascertain the uptake rate (usually measured as the volume of water cleared per unit time i.e. L/h for the analyte) of the pollutant of interest. The Chemcatcher® has been used in a range of aquatic environments; however, most work to date has been in monitoring the TWA concentrations of priority and emerging pollutants surface waters.|$|E
