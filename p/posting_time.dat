30|$|For convenience, we {{will call}} {{a person who}} authors or retransmits an MBP a sender.

30|$|The discretized k-partite {{network is}} built {{following}} the procedure explained in “Discrete analysis” section. In this particular example, we first split the original layer of messages using their hashtags {{as an indication}} of the topic, then we further discretize based on the week when messages are posted. The second discretization uses the <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> to create hashtag-week-specific layers.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to returning the MBPs, the Microblog Processing Toolkit also returns {{a number of}} statistical results of these MBPs, including the proportion of genders, the provinces of the senders, {{the sources of the}} MBPs, and the distribution of the <b>posting</b> <b>time.</b> Moreover, hot words (i.e., words with high frequencies) are generated while returning the MBPs.|$|E

With marketing efforts extending to social media platforms, the crossing of cultural boundaries can happen in an instant. In this paper we examine how culture influences the popularity of marketing messages in social media platforms. Text mining, automated translation and sentiment analysis contribute largely to our research. From our analysis of 400 posts on the localized Google+ pages of German car brands in Germany and the US, we conclude that <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> and emotions are important predictors for reshare counts. ...|$|E

30|$|We need to {{customize}} our own statistical features. As mentioned earlier, for each MBP, we {{include in the}} index its sender’s location, gender, and <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> in one string. We set this string as the key of the MBP. This means that for two MBPs posted during the same hour, at the same location, and by the senders of the same gender, they will share the same key. When indexing the MBP, we include this key in the index. When searching for the data, we first carry out the group search by the key. After obtaining the groups with the same key, we traverse each group and perform the statistical analysis in the group (details of statistical analysis {{are not included in}} this paper).|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on geotagged tweets posted on the Twitter site. These geotagged tweets are {{referred}} to as georeferenced documents because they usually include not only a short text message, but also the documents’ <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> and location. Users on the Twitter site {{are referred to as}} social sensors and geotagged tweets as sensor data observed by the social sensors. Some of studies that focused on these geotagged tweets are as follows. Sakaki et al. (2010) focused on tweets regarding typhoons and earthquakes using associated geographic information to estimate typhoon trajectories and earthquake epicenters using dense regions. Ozdikis et al. (2013) also proposed a method that estimated the geographical location of events in the case of earthquakes reported on Twitter.|$|E

A quantitative self-report {{has been used to}} collect data. The results show there are some associations between personality and Facebook usage. The research also compares respondents’ differences in intimacy level, self-disclosure level, and preference in conflict resolution styles between face-to-face communication and Facebook communication.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{fine-grained}} tweet geolocation {{is to link}} tweets to their posting venues. We solve this in a learning to rank framework by ranking candidate venues given a test tweet. The problem is challenging as tweets are short {{and the vast majority}} are non-geocoded, meaning information is sparse for building models. Nonetheless, although {{only a small fraction of}} tweets are geocoded, we find that they are posted by a substantial proportion of users. Essentially, such users have location history data. Along with tweet <b>posting</b> <b>time,</b> these serve as additional contextual information for geolocation. In designing our geolocation models, we also utilize the properties of (1) spatial focus where users are more likely to visit venues near each other and (2) spatial homophily where venues near each other tend to share more similar tweet content, compared to venues further apart. Our proposed model significantly outperforms the content-only approaches...|$|E
40|$|Much {{research}} concerning asynchronous online discussion reports {{quantitative data}} such as frequency of <b>posting,</b> <b>time</b> online, {{and number of}} characters or words. To effectively understand online discourse within education environments {{we need to go}} beyond such measures and study the interactions between messages and how these interactions contribute to the construction of collective knowledge. Complexity science suggests that the emergence of new group understandings requires both redundancy (agreement) and divergence (disagreement) in the interactions between contributed ideas. Studies, focusing on graduate course asynchronous discussions spaced almost 20 years apart, and employing a coding system developed from Fisher’s interact system model (ISM) have shown a lack of messages expressing explicit disagreement. Online discussions, with their limited channels for mutual social support, appear to encourage a student tendency towards being “too nice”. Course participants camouflage disagreements in ambiguous postings that, while avoiding potential offence, do not effectively contribute to the progress of debate. Elluminat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{a game of}} timing between advertisers, or other content creators, who compete for position and exposure over a shared publication medium such as an on-line classified list. Posted items (such as ads, messages, multimedia, or comments) are ordered according to their posting times, with recent posts displayed at the top positions. The effectiveness of each item depends on its current display position, {{as well as on}} a time-dependent exposure function which represents the collective exposure of the medium. It is assumed that each of a Poisson-distributed number of advertiser may choose the <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> of his item within a finite time interval, with the goal of maximizing the total exposure of this item. We formulate and the problem as a non-cooperative game between advertisers, and analyze the Nash equilibrium profile of this game in terms of existence, uniqueness, computation and efficiency. Explicit expressions are derived for the case where the relative importance of the posting positions are geometrically decreasing...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, social networks, microblogs, {{and short}} message service have deeply {{penetrated}} peoples lives, and thus, chat-style text is a common phenom-enon. This chat-style text has many unknown features for linguists, which can be discovered by analyzing a chat-style corpus. The process of constructing a corpus conforms to specific corpus criteria, such as representativeness, sampling, variety, and chronology. Up to now, literature does not provide specific corpus criteria for creating a chat-style-text corpus. In contrast to related work, corpus criteria for creating a chat-style corpus are provided. An exhaustive and reliable Malay chat-style text corpus is still lacking. Thus, the provided criteria are used to demonstrate the process of constructing a Twitter corpus known as the Malay Chat-style Corpus (MCC). The MCC, which has 1 million twitter messages, consists of 14, 484, 384 word instances, 646, 807 terms and metadata, such as <b>posting</b> <b>time,</b> used twitter client application, and type of Twitter message (simple Tweet, Retweet, Reply).

Using a difference-in-difference method and comparing the citation profiles of the articles before and after the <b>posting</b> <b>time</b> on SSRN against a group of control articles with similar characteristics, I estimated the effect of the SSRN posting on citation counts to be 10 - 20 % of total citations...|$|E

We are given a product p {{and a set of}} reviews Rp written about p. Typically, Rp is the set of reviews extracted from a landing page about p in an e-commerce site. Thus, the target entity e is assumed to always be p and we decide to omit this element from the representation of opinions. Furthermore, due to its informative nature, we opt to include the sentiment words in the opinion representation. Hence, from this point on, opinions are represented by a quintuple o=〈a,w,s,h,t〉, where a, s, h, and t are the same as above, and w corresponds to the sentiment words of the opinion.|$|E
