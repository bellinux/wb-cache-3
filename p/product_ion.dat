The precursor and <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> are then detected and counted by a downstream quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantification of particular trace gases is thus achieved from {{the ratio of the}} total count rate of the <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> to that for the precursor ions. However, it is important to appreciate that in this ion chemistry the light precursor ions (usually H 3 O+ ions) are invariably converted to heavier <b>product</b> <b>ions.</b> Hence, the <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> diffuse to the flow tube walls more slowly and thus they are more efficiently transported to the downstream mass spectrometer sampling orifice. This phenomenon we refer to as diffusion enhancement. Further, it is a well-known fact that discrimination can occur against ions of large mass-to-charge ratio, (m/z), in quadrupole mass spectrometers. If not accounted for, diffusion enhancement usually results in erroneously high trace gas concentrations and mass discrimination results in erroneously low concentrations. In this experimental investigation, we show how both these counteracting effects can be accounted for to increase the accuracy of SIFT-MS quantification. This is achieved by relating the currents of ions of various m/z that arrive at the downstream mass spectrometer sampling orifice disc to their count rates at the ion detector after mass analysis. Thus, both diffusion enhancement and mass discrimination are parameterized as a function of m/z and these are combined to provide an overall discrimination factor for the particular analytical instrument...|$|R

The goal is to identify the common tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) behavior of 13 novel curcumin analogues. Such knowledge is critical for their biological assessment, including metabolite identification and pharmacokinetic evaluation. METHODS: Both detection of the protonated molecules [M[*]+[*]H](+) of the synthesized compounds and determination of their exact molecular masses were achieved with hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOF-MS). Low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) -MS/MS analysis was performed using triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (QqLIT-MS). Both instruments were equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. MS(3) and neutral loss experiments were performed using QqLIT-MS to confirm the genesis of the observed <b>product</b> <b>ions.</b> RESULTS: Abundant [M[*]+[*]H](+) molecules were formed using the QqTOF-MS hybrid instrument with mass accuracies below 6 ppm. CID-MS/MS dissociation studies were centered on the piperidone ring of curcumin analogues; twelve common <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> have been identified from the fission of the various bonds within the piperidone moiety.

D.), Department of Chemistry, Washington State UniversityIon {{mobility}} spectrometry (IMS) {{coupled to}} {{different types of}} mass spectrometry (MS), which create a powerful analytical tool called ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMMS), were employed to evaluate the isomeric heterogeneity of carbohydrates. Isomer separation was achieved on millisecond timescale {{for a wide variety}} of carbohydrate compounds including monosaccharide methyl glycosides, disaccharides, oligosaccharide-alditols isolated from glycoprotein and glycopeptides from glycoprotein digests using drift tube IMS or/and traveling wave IMS coupled to time of flight MS. With IMS coupled to tandem MS, fragmentation patterns for the individual resolved isomeric mobility peaks can be obtained, providing evidence for multiple isomeric precursors as mobility-separated species. The special design of Synapt G 2 high definition MS, where a collision dissociation cell is located in front of and after traveling wave IMS, respectively, enables both mobility-resolved precursor ions to be fragmented and mobility-separated <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> to be dissociated. Many isomeric <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> were observed for parent disaccharides and higher oligosaccharide-alditols. And mobility-resolved <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> from mass-selected oligosaccharide-alditol precursors yielded different characteristic mass spectra. A hybrid tandem IMMS instrument, IMMS-IMMS, dual gate drift tube IMS coupled to Synapt G 2 MS was established. In addition to its capability in evaluating the structural complexity of precursor ions, ion mobility identity of <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> derived from individual mobility- and mass-selected precursor ions from a mixture of isomers were able to be measured for the first time. This provides a valuable tool to establish a direct precursor-product relationship between mobility-selected precursor ions and specific sets of <b>product</b> <b>ions</b> having unique mobilities. N-linked glycoprotein digests, without deglycosylation, were subjected to IMMS analysis directly. Mixtures of peptides and glycosylated peptides with different charge states were separated on different ion mobility-mass correlation trend lines.

IMMS analysis is fast, sensitive, universal, is capable of resolving isomers and is able to provide unique mobility identities and valuable MSn data on the basis of mobility resolved species including precursor and <b>product</b> <b>ions.</b> Ultimately, IMMS could serve as a novel tool for high throughput identification of glycoprotein.
