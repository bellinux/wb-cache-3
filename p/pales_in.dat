5|$|Since the 2000s, the New York City Subway has {{undergone}} its biggest expansion program {{since the late}} 1960s, with five stations opened since 2009. There are up to 15 more subway stations definitively planned. Still, the 21st-century expansion plan <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison {{to some of the}} subway system's other previous plans, {{as well as to the}} ambitious expansion of the subway in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} Australia's finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was {{lean and}} {{relatively}} tall for a wicket-keeper, standing 180cm. Tallon's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style, rather than raw statistics. In 21 Tests, Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings, making 58 dismissals {{at an average of}} 1.41 per innings. Modern Australian glovemen such as Rod Marsh and Ian Healy, both of whom held the Test world record for dismissals, averaged closer to two. Tallon's Test batting average of 17.13 <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to that of contemporary wicket-keepers such as Australia's Adam Gilchrist and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, both of whom have made a double century and more than ten centuries. English wicket-keepers from two decades after World War II such as Godfrey Evans and Jim Parks scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon.|$|E

5|$|When a film {{is highly}} exploitable as a {{commercial}} property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the $6 billion earned at box offices around {{the world by the}} stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.|$|E

25|$|Though {{this period}} of Bourgeoys' life in New France <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> {{comparison}} to her later years in terms of expansionary scope and influence, it is often seen as much more intimate. Bourgeoys would have known practically everyone in the colony. However, she also faced difficult struggles during her first years there. There were no children to teach due to {{the high levels of}} infant mortality, which frustrated her plan to provide education. Despite this, she took it upon herself to help the community in any way she could, often working alongside the settlers.|$|E

25|$|This {{complex concept}} is {{reflected}} in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae, which places the Di Consentes Penates in region I with the Favores Opertanei; Ceres and Genius in region V; <b>Pales</b> <b>in</b> region VI; Favor and Genius (again) in region VII; Secundanus Pales, Fortuna and Favor Pastor in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations {{may be due to}} the fact that Penates belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. Favor(es) may be the Etruscan masculine equivalent of Fortuna.|$|E
25|$|Black candles are {{presented}} to Santa Muerte's altars that drug traffickers used to ensure protection from violence of rival gangs {{as well as}} ensure harm to their enemies in gangs and law enforcement. As the drug war in Mexico escalates, Santa Muerte's veneration by drug bosses increases and her image is seen {{again and again in}} various drug houses. Ironically, the military and police officers that are employed to dismantle the White Lady's shrines make up a large portion of her devotees. Furthermore, even though her presence in the drug world is becoming routine, the sale of black candles <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to top selling white, red, and gold candles.|$|E
25|$|While UMass' {{rivalry with}} Penn State <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> {{comparison}} to the one with URI, it has nevertheless been a consistent presence throughout Minutemen program history as PSU, like UMass and URI, was {{a founding member of}} the ECWHL and has been in the league for all but two of its 14 seasons. The teams have met four times at the ECWHL playoffs (a scheduled fifth was nixed by a 2010 snowstorm), with UMass enjoying a 3–1–0 advantage in those games. None were better than the contest that took place on February 28, 2004 at Rhode Island's Brad Boss Arena. The wild affair saw Aleta Mills and Samantha Louras each score four times - yet it wasn't quite enough, as the Lady Icers' Katie King scored four of her own on the way to an 8–8 tie after regulation, where neither team ever led by more than two and with only three stretches of more than 5:00 without a goal being scored. In the second overtime, Mills' fifth tally sent the Minutemen to the first-ever league championship game.|$|E

25|$|On January 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} case, sentenced Ghailani, believed to be 36 {{years old at the}} time, to life in prison for the bombing, stating that any suffering Ghailani experienced {{at the hands of the}} CIA or other agencies while in custody at Guantanamo Bay <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the monumental tragedy of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and left thousands injured or otherwise impacted by the crimes. The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{offered a}} mixed opinion of 5.9 out of 10, stating that {{on its own}} the album is good, but it <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> {{comparison}} to an album like High on Fire's Snakes for the Divine. PopMatters scored the record 5 out of 10 stars and wondered if RCA's instincts were right {{in regards to the}} album's lack of [...] "catchier" [...] material, as Adrien Begrand said that Heppner's vocals were in general weaker on this album as compared to the band's previous record. Nonetheless, he did compliment Vince Nudo for his vocals on [...] "Lunar", which he favorably compared to Black Sabbath, and also compared [...] "Lady Killer" [...] to Judas Priest. The Boston Phoenix reviewer Mikael Wood gave the album a star and a half out of four, and wrote that despite the cleverness behind the album's title, the songs within were empty, and while fans of the style would be comfortable with it, [...] "Everybody else should seek out Hello Master." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover has {{received}} acclaim from international critics. The Calgary Sun stated: [...] " [...] is undoubtedly {{the highlight of}} her English-language recording career.

[...] Toronto's Eye Weekly said Steinman's [...] "fatal absence from the last Meat Loaf record is finally justified here," [...] and The Miami Herald said [...] "Dion knocks a couple out of the ballpark... features seven minutes of Wagnerian bombast, thunderclap piano chords and emoting that would wither an opera diva.

500|$|Aurora was Disney's last princess created before Walt Disney's {{death in}} 1966. When Sleeping Beauty was first {{released}} in 1959, the film performed poorly {{at the box}} office while failing to impress critics. According to TheRichest, Aurora was partially responsible for Disney’s only overall loss that decade, thus the studio decided to avoid adapting fairy tales into feature-length animated films for several years; Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted in 1989, 30 years later. Mic's Melissa Hugel believes that the negative reception spawned by Aurora's passive role as a woman in Sleeping Beauty also contributed to this hiatus, earning the character {{a reputation as one of}} Disney's worst princesses. Meanwhile, David Nusair of About.com attributes the film's failure with [...] "the familiarity of its storyline, as the film boasts many of the elements contained within both of its predecessors – including the revelation that Princess Aurora can only be awoken from her deep slumber by a kiss from her one true love" [...] similar to Snow White. Hollywood.com ranked Sleeping Beauty Disney's worst princess film because its main character remains asleep for the majority of it. However, Aurora has since established herself as a popular character nonetheless due to her singing voice and beauty. At one point, the name [...] "Aurora" [...] became a popular baby name, with parents often naming their daughters after the character. However, despite being featured prominently in Disney merchandise, [...] "Aurora has become an oft-forgotten princess", and her popularity <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison to those of Cinderella and Snow White. While creating the Disney Princess franchise, Disney Consumer Products decided that Aurora should be marketed wearing the pink version of her dress in order to further distinguish her from Cinderella, who also wears blue. BuzzFeed readers voted Aurora their sixth favorite Disney Princess, who garnered 7% of the 9,554 votes. Time reported that Aurora was the seventh best-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2014, having sold $215,856 in merchandise.|$|E

500|$|Street Fighter X Mega Man {{has been}} met with mostly mixed to {{positive}} reviews. [...] Cheat Code Central gave the game a 4.1 out of 5, praising the nostalgic feel the game has, but criticized {{the lack of}} a save feature.

[...] Inside Gaming Daily gave the game an 8 out of 10, stating, [...] "Though it’s short and strays away a bit from traditional Mega Man games, Street Fighter X Mega Man is a great play that you honestly have little reason not to experience." [...] IGN gave the game a 7 out of 10, noting that [...] "The end result is a fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday." [...] Destructoid echoed similar opinions stating, [...] "Street Fighter X Mega Man is not the best or most polished Mega Man game around, but it's a solid effort by a very dedicated fan." [...] Game Industry News gave it a 3.5 out of 5 with mixed review stating, [...] "It combines two of Capcom's greatest games in history into one nostalgic mash up that is sure to take fans on a trip down memory lane while still feeling fresh. Unfortunately though, the lack of challenge or the ability to continue progress after shutting down the game only hinders Street Fighter X Mega Man from being the perfect jewel it could have been."

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{representation of}} the [...] "common branch" [...] is Béroul's Le Roman de Tristan, {{the first part of}} which is generally dated between 1150 and 1170, and the latter part between 1181 and 1190. The branch is so named due to its representation of an earlier non-chivalric, non-courtly, tradition of story-telling, making it more reflective of the Dark Ages than of the refined High Middle Ages. In this respect, they are similar to Layamon's Brut and the Perlesvaus. As with Thomas' works, knowledge of Béroul's is limited. There were a few substantial fragments of his works discovered in the nineteenth century, and the rest was reconstructed from later versions. The more substantial illustration of the common branch is the German version by Eilhart von Oberge. Eilhart's version was popular, but <b>pales</b> <b>in</b> comparison with the later Gottfried.|$|E
