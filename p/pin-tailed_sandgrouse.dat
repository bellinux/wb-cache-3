5|$|Sandgrouse is {{the common}} name for Pteroclididae, a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied sandgrouse and the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E
500|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} reaches {{a length of}} about [...] The male has a small reddish-brown nape surrounded by a band of pale grey that extends to the bill and round the neck in a collar. The chin, neck and throat are orange and the breast grey. The upper parts are pinkish-grey with dark flight feathers and dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The primaries are pale with dark trailing edges, a fact that distinguishes this species from the crowned sandgrouse (Pterocles coronatus) which has completely dark primaries. The female also has an orange throat region but is generally duller in plumage than the male. The body colour is greyish-brown liberally spotted with small dark markings and with dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The central tail feathers in both sexes are elongated {{but not to the}} extent that they are in the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles alchata). When flying overhead, a dark belly stripe is visible.|$|E
50|$|The little {{rainfall}} {{that occurs}} is usually torrential, {{so that the}} ground, consisting of marls and sandstone with little vegetation, is unable to retain moisture. Instead, the rain causes erosion, forming the characteristic landscape of badlands. Arroyos formed by torrential rain harbor the scarce vegetation and fauna such as swifts, hedgehogs, jackdaws, <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouses,</b> blue rock thrushes, stone curlews, trumpeter finches, and crested larks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> is a robust, {{medium-sized}} bird about 31 to 39 cm in length. The general colouring is cryptic, a {{blend of}} barred and flecked olive green, brown, buff, yellow, grey and black. The underparts and the feathered legs are dull white.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> breeds in North Africa and the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Kazakhstan. In Europe it breeds in Spain, Portugal and the {{southern}} part of France. Eastern populations, particularly those from Kazakhstan, migrate to Pakistan and parts of northern India in winter.|$|E
50|$|This {{gregarious species}} breeds on dry open plains and similar habitats, {{but unlike the}} <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse,</b> it avoids areas {{completely}} lacking in vegetation. Its nest is a ground scrape into which three greenish eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Both sexes incubate, but only the male brings water.|$|E
5000|$|In flight, the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> can be {{identified}} by its bright, white underparts and under-wing coverts, and the long feathers in the centre part of its tail. It is usually silent when on the ground but in the air communicates with other birds with a frequently uttered, loud [...] "kattar-kattar", a nasal [...] "ga-ga-ga" [...] and a low-pitched [...] "gang gang".|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> inhabits open {{areas of}} stony land, semi arid areas {{at the edge}} of deserts, {{treeless}} plains and occasionally dried-out mud flats. In winter it may visit ploughed or fallow land but prefers sandy soils and is much less reliant on vegetation cover than the black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) which has a similar range. It does not occur at elevations above about 1000 m.|$|E

This gregarious species breeds on dry open treeless plains and similar habitats. Its nest is a ground scrape into which two or three cream-coloured eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Both sexes incubate the eggs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> often feeds {{in groups}} and gathers {{regularly}} {{in large numbers}} at waterholes, to which the birds fly soon after dawn.

They favour leguminous seeds and also eat seeds of knotweed (Polygonum), buckwheat (Fagopyrum), Salicornia, Artemisia, camelthorn (Alhagi), rock rose (Helianthemum) and asphodel (Asphodelus). In cultivated areas they take grain and the seeds of leguminous crops. Beetles and other small invertebrates are sometimes eaten and grit is consumed to help grind up the contents of the crop.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> {{is about}} 35 cm long. Its head and upperparts are yellowish-green. The underparts are white with a {{chestnut}} breast band separating the belly {{from the green}} neck. Sexes are somewhat similar, but the female is better camouflaged and has a shorter tail than the male. There are two subspecies; P. a. alchata breeds in southern Europe and P. a. caudacutus breeds in northwestern Africa, the Middle East and southeastern Asia. It is a partial migrant, with some Asian birds moving to the Middle East and northern Pakistan in winter. Males of the eastern race have duller underparts than the European birds, and the females have white, rather than yellow, wing coverts.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> {{is rated}} as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] by BirdLife International. This {{is because it}} has a large range and the population, {{estimated}} to be somewhere between 130,000 and 1,500,000 individuals, is believed to be stable. The range may be expanding in south eastern Turkey, possibly as a result of changes in climate. However, the populations in parts of Europe are decreasing due to changes in agricultural production. The bird remains common in Spain but in the only remaining locality in southern France where it is found, at La Crau, only about 170 pairs remained in 2002, while there were fewer than 100 pairs of birds breeding in Portugal in the same year.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> nests in {{a slight}} {{depression}} {{on the ground}} in the open. Two or three eggs are laid at intervals of two days, creamy-brown spotted with darker brown, reddish-brown and grey. Both parents share the task of incubation which lasts from nineteen to twenty five days. The male starts his shift about an hour before sunset and the female takes over after she has been to the waterhole in the morning. The young are precocial and leave the nest soon after they have hatched. Both parents care for them but only the male is involved in bringing them water, absorbed by the feathers on his breast. The chicks are able to feed themselves by the age of a week and can fly by the time they are four weeks old. They are dependent on their parents for two months and attain their adult plumage at about four months. There is normally a single brood each year but if the eggs are destroyed or removed, more eggs may be laid.|$|E
40|$|Predictive species' {{distribution}} models may answer ecological {{questions about}} habitat selection, co-occurrence of species and competition between them. We studied the habitat preferences and segregation of two sympatric species of declining sandgrouse, the black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) and the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles alchata), during the breeding season. We developed predictive models that related sandgrouse presence to environmental variables at three different spatial levels: large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. At the large geographical scale, differences between sandgrouse distributions, in the Iberian Peninsula, {{seem to be}} explained mainly in terms of bioclimatology: <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> {{appear to be a}} more thermophilous species and occupy warmer sites usually located in flatter areas. At the landscape spatial level, in those areas that exhibit environmental conditions allowing for both species' co-existence at a large geographical scale, black-bellied sandgrouse appear to be more tolerant to environmental variation than <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse.</b> At the microhabitat level, however, differences between species could be related to different flocking behaviour as a consequence of different sensitivities to vegetation structure and predators. Thus, the observed spatial distribution patterns are the result of different ecological factors that operate at different spatial levels. Conservation guidelines for these species should therefore consider their habitat preferences at large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Ascertaining which niche {{processes}} allow coexistence between {{closely related}} species is of special interest in ecology. We quantified variations in the environmental niches and densities of two congeneric species, the pin-tailed and the black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata and Pterocles orientalis) in allopatry and sympatry under similar abiotic, habitat and dispersal contexts to understand their coexistence. Using principal component analysis, we defined environmental gradients (niche dimensions) including abiotic, habitat and anthropogenic variables, and calculated niche breadth, position and overlap of both species in sympatry and allopatry. Additionally, sandgrouse density was modelled {{as a function of}} the niche dimensions and the density of the other species. We found evidence that each species occupies distinct environmental niches in sympatry and in allopatry. The black-bellied sandgrouse exploits a broader range of environmental conditions (wider niche breadth) while the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> reaches high densities where conditions seem to match its optimum. In sympatry, both species shift their niches to intermediate positions, indicating the importance of abiotic factors in setting coexistence areas. Environmental conditions determine regional densities of <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> whereas biotic interactions explain the density of the black-bellied sandgrouse in areas with abiotic conditions similarly conducive for both species. Highly suitable areas for the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> fall beyond the upper thermal limit of the black-bellied sandgrouse, leading to niche segregation and low densities for the latter. Finally, local niche shift and expansion plus possible heterospecific aggregation allow the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> to thrive in a priori less favourable environments. This work provides insight into how different mechanisms allow species coexistence and how species densities vary in sympatry compared to allopatry as a result of environmental filtering and biotic interactions.

40|$|Positive {{interactions}} between species can have important conservation implications, {{especially when the}} species associating are both vulnerable. We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses Pterocles alchata and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65 % of <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred stubble fields and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used stubble fields significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (stubble fields) {{that would otherwise be}} too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species.

Here we report, for the first time, the observation of an aberrantly colored <b>Pin-tailed</b> <b>Sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles alchata), a threatened steppe bird with cryptic plumage and behavior. The bird displayed a continuous white patch on its back that was not bilaterally symmetrical (i. e., {{not far from the}} neural crest), thus discarding leucism as an explanation. Plausible explanations are progressive graying and, most likely, an injury that damaged feather follicles affecting the pigment cells in that area.

40|$|Sandgrouse are {{birds of}} arid environments adapted {{to cope with}} extreme {{temperature}} variations. We used temperature data-loggers to remotely study incubation rhythms by pin-tailed and black-bellied sandgrouse in Spain. In both species, mates switched incubation roles twice a day, between 08 : 00 and 10 : 00 and between 19 : 30 and 21 : 30, when the nest and ambient temperature were most similar. During mate switches, sandgrouse preferred to risk a cooling rather than a warming of eggs. In the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse,</b> the timing of morning switches was consistent within-pairs, while the timing of evening switches was more related to sunset time. Absences lasted longer following a disturbance than during a mate switch. During disturbances, changes in nest temperatures depended on the changes in outside temperature, and negatively correlated with absence duration. Absences following a disturbance were shorter when the outside temperature was higher. Nesting success was low (19 %), with no noticeable effect of data-loggers. Our study highlights some of the constraints that birds breeding in arid environments, such as sandgrouse, face during incubation. It also stresses out the importance of evaluating the consequences of disturbances during incubation, in particular nest visits. Temperature data-loggers can provide an easy and effective way of monitoring nests, without the need of repeated nest visits.

40|$|Survival and the {{underlying}} causes of mortality are key demographic parameters for understanding animal population dynamics and identifying conservation needs. Here we use a large data set of tagged wild <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (. Pterocles alchata) to examine the influence of individual traits (age, sex, size, movements and reproduction), and of temporal and spatial variations on the survival of this steppe-bird of conservation concern in Europe. Annual survival for adults and juveniles was estimated at 0. 60 and 0. 61, respectively. Survival rate tended to be lower towards the northern margin of the European distribution. In the core distribution area (central Spain) mortality was more frequent during the non-breeding season due to higher predation rates. Survival rate was slightly higher in males than females, which may explain male skewed population sex-ratios. Sedentary birds had lower survival than birds using different areas for breeding and wintering, indicating that high mobility, as a possible behavioural response to varying conditions, could eventually increase fitness. Predation was the main cause of mortality, but illegal hunting was also recorded, indicating a need for stricter law enforcement and regulation plans. Sandgrouse can be characterized by a relatively slow life history (medium-high adult survival and low reproductive rate), with lower survival rates than other sympatric steppe birds of larger size. Management and conservation efforts should focus on maintaining a high adult survival within protected areas. Sandgrouse mobility, which positively influenced survival, should also be taken into account in conservation plans, especially when considering the size and connectivity of protected areas. A.

40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1978 and 1979 and completes {{a period of}} 30 years of {{observations}} by a contingent of resident and visiting ornithologists in the Rhône delta and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. It presents not only observations of rare species or unusual numbers of birds, but also indicates the results of several long term monitoring programmes concerning in particular, waterfowl and allied species. A climatological report summarizes the most important meteorological phenomena of the two years, the most striking of which were the very wet spring of 1978 and the dry summer of 1979. The winter of 1978 - 1979 must surely be remembered in northern and central Europe {{as one of the}} most severe this century. In the Mediterranean, however, it was much less severe and, fortunately, had none of the disastrous effects of the previous hard winters of 1956 and 1962 - 1963. "La Crau", a unique stony desert area and former delta of the River Durance, is suffering seriously from the spread of industry and from agricultural reclamation. Some of the first census work to be carried out here shows just how important the area is for breeding Stone Curlews, Little Bustards and <b>Pin-tailed</b> <b>Sandgrouse</b> in particular. The sandgrouse population is an isolated one, the species occurring elsewhere in Europe only in parts of Spain. Observations of sea birds are not carried out systematically and more thorough sea-watching would probably show that many of the species mentioned here are regularly wintering in the "Golfe du Lion". Unusually high numbers of Black-necked Grebes appear each autumn in the saline "Etang de Lavalduc" (up to 4, 500), which makes it an internationally important site for this species. Whilst the herons as a group maintain their numbers, several notable changes have taken place in recent years. The reed-nesting Grey Heron continues to increase whilst the Purple clearly shows the opposite trend. The Cattle Egret, occuring only as an accidentai visitor less than 15 years ago, appears now to have reached the peak of colonisation with the numbers of breeding pairs levelling off. Autumn roost counts show the total of individuals at close to 2, 000. The first indications of roughly how many Bitterns breed in the Camargue are given whilst the second only record of White Storks breeding in the delta involved one semi-captive male and a wild female carrying a ring. This was a chick transplanted from Morocco to a nest in Alsace as part of a reintroduction programme in 1975. The flamingos again had two successful breeding seasons and the summer population for the south coast of France peaked at over 35, 000 birds both years. Particularly interesting data are being gatbered from the sightings of "Darvic-ringed" birds, 1858 of which have thus been marked over the past three years. 24 % of these have already been read outside France. Amongst the Anseriiformes, the wintering Bewick's Swan population was the highest yet recorded with a maximum of 85 in January 1979. During this same period four species of geese were present with Greylags and Bean's bath reaching one hundred or more individuals. Counts of Shelducks have shawn how important the salines are bath as a breeding area and winter quarters, and a ringing programme has thrown some light on their movements. For other ducks the overall wintering population has been quite high with a peak of 122, 000 in January 1979. In general the number of diving ducks was below average but this was compensated for by several of the surface feeders being present in large numbers, in particular Teal, Gadwall and Shoveler. The list of raptor observations is as impressive as ever and includes a second estimate of the breeding Marsh Harrier population with results slightly superior to those obtained ten years earlier. The eighth complete census of breeding Lara-limicoles was carried out in the brackish and salt water zone of the greater Camargue area. All species are maintaining their numbers and attention is drawn to the increasing populations of Mediterranean and Slender-billed Gulls. Nearctic waders already observed in the delta included sightings of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and Wilson's Phalarope whilst the Pectoral was only the second reported. Eagle Owls in "Les Alpilles" appear to be increasing with 30 pairs recorded. Passerines have not been ignored entirely; the continued increase of breeding Stonechats is encouraging whilst the successful nesting of a pair of Red-billed Quelea in the Camargue adds an exotic flavour to this repor...|$|E
