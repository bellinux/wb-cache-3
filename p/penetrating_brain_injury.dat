40|$|<b>Penetrating</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (PBI), {{though less}} {{prevalent}} than closed head trauma, carries a worse prognosis. The publication of Guidelines for the Management of <b>Penetrating</b> <b>Brain</b> <b>Injury</b> in 2001, attempted to standardize {{the management of}} PBI. This paper provides a precise and updated account of the medical and surgical management of these unique injuries which still present a significant challenge to practicing neurosurgeons worldwide. The management algorithms presented in this document are based on Guidelines for the Management of <b>Penetrating</b> <b>Brain</b> <b>Injury</b> and the recommendations are from literature published after 2001. Optimum management of PBI requires adequate comprehension of mechanism and pathophysiology of injury. Based on current evidence, we recommend computed tomography scanning as the neuroradiologic modality of choice for PBI patients. Cerebral angiography is recommended in patients with PBI, {{where there is a}} high suspicion of vascular injury. It is still debatable whether craniectomy or craniotomy is the best approach in PBI patients. The recent trend is toward a less aggressive debridement of deep-seated bone and missile fragments and a more aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis in an effort to improve outcomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are common in PBI patients and surgical correction is recommended for those which do not close spontaneously or are refractory to CSF diversion through a ventricular or lumbar drain. The risk of post-traumatic epilepsy after PBI is high, and therefore, the use of prophylactic anticonvulsants is recommended. Advanced age, suicide attempts, associated coagulopathy, Glasgow coma scale score of 3 with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, and high initial intracranial pressure have been correlated with worse outcomes in PBI patients...|$|E

Although <b>penetrating</b> traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (TBI) is fre-quently associated with these wounds, the epidemiology of penetrating TBI from these conflicts has not been well described. METHODS: The Joint Theater Trauma Registry was queried for January 2003 through December 2010 to identify all patients with moderate-to-severe <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> with a maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head of 3 or greater and a diagnosis of penetrating or closed TBI in accordance with the Department of Defense Traumatic <b>Brain</b> <b>Injury</b> Surveillance definition.

Among TBI, <b>penetrating</b> traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> (PTBI) have the worst prognosis and represent the leading cause of TBI-related morbidity and death. However, there are no specific drugs/interventions due to unclear pathophysiology. To gain insights we looked at cerebral metabolism in a PTBI rat model: <b>penetrating</b> ballistic-like <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (PBBI). Early after injury, regional cerebral oxygen tension and consumption significantly decreased in the ipsilateral cortex in the PBBI group compared with the control group. At the same time point, glucose uptake was significantly reduced globally in the PBBI group compared with the control group. Examination of Fluorojade B-stained brain sections at 24 hours after PBBI revealed an incomplete overlap of metabolic impairment and neurodegeneration. As expected, the injury core had the most severe metabolic impairment and highest neurodegeneration. However, in the peri-lesional area, despite similar metabolic impairment, there was lesser neurodegeneration. Given our findings, the data suggest the presence of two distinct zones of primary injury, of which only one recovers.

Importantly, we discovered that one protein, endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II precursor (p 43 /pro-EMAPII), was differentially expressed between these two types of <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Among other functions, p 43 /pro-EMAPII is a known pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the progression of apoptotic cell death. Our current objective was to verify the changes in p 43 /pro-EMAPII expression, and to evaluate the potentially important implications that the differential regulation of this protein has on injury development. At multiple time points following either a <b>penetrating</b> ballistic-like <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (PBBI), or a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> tissue samples (6 â€“ 72 [*]h), CSF samples (24 [*]h), and blood samples (24 [*]h) were collected from rats for analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background Inflammatory cytokines play {{a crucial}} role in the {{pathophysiology}} of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (TBI), exerting either deleterious effects on the progression of tissue damage or beneficial roles during recovery and repair. NNZ- 2566, a synthetic analogue of the neuroprotective tripeptide Glypromate Â®, has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> The goal of this study was to determine the effects of NNZ- 2566 on inflammatory cytokine expression and neuroinflammation induced by <b>penetrating</b> ballistic-like <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (PBBI) in rats. Methods NNZ- 2566 or vehicle (saline) was administered intravenously as a bolus injection (10 mg/kg) at 30 min post-injury, immediately followed by a continuous infusion of NNZ- 2566 (3 mg/kg/h), or equal volume of vehicle, for various durations. Inflammatory cytokine gene expression from the brain tissue of rats exposed to PBBI was evaluated using microarray, quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) array. Histopathology of the injured brains was examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunocytochemistry of inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 Î². Results NNZ- 2566 treatment significantly reduced injury-mediated up-regulation of IL- 1 Î², TNF-Î±, E-selectin and IL- 6 mRNA during the acute injury phase. ELISA cytokine array showed that NZ- 2566 treatment significantly reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 Î², TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ in the injured brain, but did not affect anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6 levels. Conclusion Collectively, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of NNZ- 2566 may, in part, be functionally attributed to the compound's ability to modulate expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators in the injured brain. </p...|$|R

We showed that rs 2295633, a single-nucleotide polymorphism of FAAH, was significantly associated with PTSD diagnosis in subjects without lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the presence of the C allele was associated with more severe re-experiencing of trauma and more negative reported childhood experiences. In conclusion, our data suggest that FAAH has an important role in PTSD through modulation of aversive memories and point to both a novel therapeutic target and a possible risk marker for this condition...|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} {{refers to}} an individualâ€™s ability to process and respond to emotions, including recognizing the expression of emotions in others, using emotions to enhance thought and decision making, and regulating emotions to drive effective behaviors. Despite their importance for goal-directed social behavior, {{little is known about}} the neural mechanisms underlying specific facets of emotional intelligence. Here, we report findings from a study investigating the neural bases of these specific components for emotional intelligence in a sample of 130 combat veterans with <b>penetrating</b> traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> We examined the neural mechanisms underlying experiential (perceiving and using emotional information) and strategic (understanding and managing emotions) facets of emotional intelligence. Factor scores were submitted to voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. The results indicate that two facets of emotional intelligence (perceiving and managing emotions) engage common and distinctive neural systems, with shared dependence on the social knowledge network, and selective engagement of the orbitofrontal and parietal cortex for strategic aspects of emotional information processing. The observed pattern of findings suggests that sub-facets of experiential and strategic emotional intelligence can be characterized as separable but related processes that depend upon a core network of brain structures within frontal, temporal and parietal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Experimental studies {{targeting}} traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (TBI) {{have reported}} that erythropoietin (EPO) is an endogenous neuroprotectant in multiple models. In addition to its neuroprotective effects, {{it has also been}} shown to enhance reparative processes including angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Based on compelling pre-clinical data, EPO was tested by the Operation Brain Trauma Therapy (OBTT) consortium to evaluate therapeutic potential in multiple TBI models along with biomarker assessments. Based on the pre-clinical TBI literature, two doses of EPO (5000 and 10, 000 IU/kg) were tested given at 15 min after moderate fluid percussion <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (FPI), controlled cortical impact (CCI), or <b>penetrating</b> ballistic-like <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (PBBI) with subsequent behavioral, histopathological, and biomarker outcome assessments. There was a significant benefit on beam walk with the 5000 IU dose in CCI, but no benefit on any other motor task across models in OBTT. Also, no benefit of EPO treatment across the three TBI models was noted using the Morris water maze to assess cognitive deficits. Lesion volume analysis showed no treatment effects after either FPI or CCI; however, with the 5000 IU/kg dose of EPO, a paradoxical increase in lesion volume and percent hemispheric tissue loss was seen after PBBI. Biomarker assessments included measurements of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L 1 (UCH-L 1) in blood at 4 or 24 h after injury. No treatment effects were seen on biomarker levels after FPI, whereas treatment at either dose exacerbated the increase in GFAP at 24 h in PBBI but attenuated 24 - 4 h delta UCH-L 1 levels at high dose in CCI. Our data indicate a surprising lack of efficacy of EPO across three established TBI models in terms of behavioral, histopathological, and biomarker assessments. Although we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} other doses or more prolonged treatment could show different effects, the lack of efficacy of EPO reduced enthusiasm for its further investigation in OBTT...|$|R
