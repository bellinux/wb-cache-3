40|$|One of {{two major}} {{facilities}} used for <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels</b> research and development studies at Battelle-Northwest is the <b>Plutonium</b> <b>Fuels</b> Laboratory (PFL). This facility was specifically designed and equipped {{for research and development}} studies involving multikilogram quantities of plutonium and its mixtures, compounds, and alloys. As at other sites, the design and operation philosophy of the PFL is one of complete plutonium containment. Primary plutonium containment is provided by glove boxes, secondary containment is provided by individual laboratories, and tertiary containment is supplied by the building proper. Air samples, taken throughout the facility, are constantly being monitored for free contamination. Personnel exposure caused by X, gamma, and neutron radiation has been primarily omitted by inspiring good work habits and housekeeping practices in personnel (i. e., uncontrolled accumulations of plutonium are avoided, plutonium is confined as much as possible, exposure times are limited, and shielding equipment is used whenever necessary). Rules for the prevention of an inadvertent criticality in the PFL are based upon the criteria that at least two control conditions must fail before criticality is imminent...|$|E

40|$|For over 40 years Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and its {{predecessor}} organizations have maintained and operated the Zero-Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) {{as a test}} bed for studying reactor physics and nuclear reactor design. Although the ZPPR is no longer operated as an active research reactor, it’s infrastructure (radiation shielding, safety systems, physical safeguards) and special nuclear material (SNM) inventory (variably enriched uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels</b> available in metallic, oxide, alloy, and other forms) still makes the facility a unique national resource {{for research and development}} activities involving the use of SNM. Recently INL has utilized this facility to serve as a test and evaluation facility for active interrogation research and development. This facility is currently hosting scoping experiments using neutron and x-ray radiation sources to characterize SNM active interrogation signatures and to develop tools and techniques to detect and identify shielded SNM.

40|$|One of the {{proposed}} ways to dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium (Pu) is to irradiate the high-fissile material in light-water reactors {{in order to reduce}} the Pu enrichment to the level of spent fuels from commercial reactors. Considerable experience has been accumulated about the behavior of mixed-oxide (MOX) uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels</b> for plutonium recycling in commercial reactors, but the experience is related to Pu enrichments typical of spent fuels quite below the values of weapons-grade plutonium. Important decisions related to the kind of reactors to be used for the disposition of the plutonium are going to be based on calculations, so the validation of computational algorithms related to all aspects of the fuel cycle (power distributions, isotopics as function of the burnup, etc.), for weapons-grade isotopics is very important. Analysis of public domain data reveals that the cycle- 2 irradiation in the Quad cities boiling-water reactor (BWR) is the most recent US destructive examination. This effort involved the irradiation of five MOX assemblies using 80 and 90 % fissile plutonium. These benchmark data were gathered by General Electric under the sponsorship of the Electric Power Research Institute. It is emphasized, however, that global parameters are not the focus of this benchmark, since the five bundles containing MOX fuels did not significantly affect the overall core performance. However, since the primary objective of this work is to compare against measured post-irradiation assembly data, the term benchmark is applied here. One important reason for performing the benchmark on Quad Cities irradiation is that the fissile blends (up to 90 %) are higher than reactor-grade and, quite close to, weapons-grade isotopics...|$|E

40|$|For the {{management}} of high level and long-lived radioactive waste, a large and continuous research and development effort is carried out in France, to provide {{a wide range of}} scientific and technical alternatives along three lines, partitioning and transmutation, disposal in deep geological formations and long term interim surface or subsurface storage. For the line one, and in close link with the partitioning studies, research is carried out to evaluate the transmutation potential of long-lived waste in appropriate reactors configurations (scenarios) relying on current technologies as well as innovative reactors. Performed to evaluate the theoretical feasibility of the Pu consumption and waste transmutation {{from the point of view}} of the reactor cores physics to reach the equilibrium of the material fluxes (i. e. consumption = production) and of the isotopic compositions of the fuels, these studies insure the “scientific ” part of the transmutation feasibility. For the technological part of the feasibility of waste transmutation in reactors, a large programme on fuel development is underway. This includes solutions based on the advanced concepts for <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels</b> in PWR and the development of specific fuels and targets for transmutation in fast reactors in the critical or sub-critical state. For the waste transmutation in fast reactors, an important programme has been launched to develop specific fuels and targets with experiments at various stages of preparation in different experimental reactors including Phénix.

40|$|Reducing the {{radiotoxicity}} of spent {{nuclear fuel}} is an important objective to ensure the sustainability of the nuclear energy. This objective can be attained by separation of the long-lived actinides from the fuel constituents and their conversion into short-lived radionuclides by nuclear reactions, the so-called partitioning and transmutation strategy. An important step of this method is the co-conversion of the actinides solutions issued from partitioning into solid fuels precursors for transmutation. On the other hand, incorporating the actinides into an inert matrix allows an easier handling of these fuels and is particularly useful for high burn-up transmutation. Yttria-stabilized zirconia is such an inert matrix, with a high stability. Among the co-conversion methods, the sol-gel processes such as internal gelation present an interest due to their mild conditions, the fact {{they are easy to}} handle remotely and the absence of radioactive dust formation during fabrication. Internal gelation has been often used for the preparation of uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels,</b> but no studies focused on its application to zirconium and minor actinides (neptunium, americium, curium). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to prepare and characterize solid microspheres of yttria-stabilized zirconia loaded by cerium as a surrogate for trivalent actinides by internal gelation, but also to perform basic studies on this gelation. It occurs by decomposition of organic precursors (hexamethylenetetramine HMTA, and urea) under heat, which produce ammonia. This causes an increase of pH which ensures the gelation. The studies performed aim to better understand the phenomena occurring during gelation, {{and the role of the}} organic additives used. It was found from these studies that the role of urea was to catalyze the decomposition of HMTA into NH 3, and to bring porosity to the solid material. It was also found that a complete gelation could not be attained, and that an aging step in an alkaline medium was required to prevent losses. The microspheres characterization by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and microscopy indicated that the material crystallized into a solid solution with a fluorite structure at approximately 400 °C, but also that the mixture of urea and HMTA caused a strongly exothermic decomposition. This resulted in cracks formation during thermal treatment. Optimizations were attempted to reduce this, mainly the quantity of urea and HMTA used, but also on the parameters of thermal treatment. Alternatively, microspheres were directly pressed into pellets, without milling. A repressing method allowed densities up to 86 % of TD to be reached...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} an {{original}} set of coupled neutronics and thermo-hydraulic simulation {{results for the}} VSOP 99 / 05 diffusion code are presented for advanced fuel cycles for the incineration of weapons-grade plutonium, reactor-grade plutonium and reactor-grade plutonium with its associated Minor Actinides in the 400 MWth Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Demonstration Power Plant. These results are also compared {{to those of the}} standard 9. 6 wt% enriched 9 g/fuel sphere U/Pu fuel cycle. The weapons-grade and reactor-grade <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles produced good burn-ups. However, the addition of the Minor Actinides to the reactor-grade plutonium caused a large decrease in the burn-up and thus an unacceptable increase in the heavy metal (HM) content in the spent fuel, which was intended for direct disposal in a deep geological repository, without chemical reprocessing. All the <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles failed the adopted safety limits used in the PBMR 400 in that either the maximum fuel temperature of 1130 °C during normal operation, or the maximum power density of 4. 5 kW/sphere was exceeded. All the <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles also produced positive uniform temperature reactivity coefficients, i. e. the reactivity coefficient where the temperatures of the fuel and the graphite moderator in the fuel spheres were varied together. These unacceptable positive coefficients were experienced at low temperatures, typically below 700 °C. This was due to the influence of the thermal fission cross-section resonances of 239 Pu and 241 Pu. Weapons-grade plutonium produced the worst safety performance. The safety performance of the reactor-grade plutonium also deteriorated when the HM loading was reduced from 3 g/sphere to 2 g or 1 g. In view of these safety problems, these <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles were judged to be not licensable in the PBMR DPP- 400 reactor. Therefore a redesign of the fuel cycle for reactor-grade plutonium, the power conversion system and the reactor geometry is proposed, in order to resolve these safety issuesTHRIP; South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation[URL]...|$|R

50|$|By 1978, the U.S. led {{the world}} in numbers and {{efficiency}} of nuclear power plants. The chemistry of wartime reprocessing had been adapted to the commercial fuel cycle.

The European nations, Russia and Japan particularly, were building nuclear power plants and looking ahead to breeder reactors for the future. Therefore, President Carter’s dramatic changes in U.S. nuclear energy policy to discontinue reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and terminate the U.S. Breeder Reactor Program, a program Ferguson himself had worked on and believed in, were abrupt and difficult for most countries to understand. Carter hoped that in setting this example, the U.S. would encourage other nations to follow its lead. Most nations went ahead with reprocessing and breeder development until high costs and loss of political support delayed plans in nuclear projects around the world.|$|R
