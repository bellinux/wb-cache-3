40|$|Background: Although {{educational}} disparity {{has been}} linked to single risk behaviours, it has not previously been studied as a predictor of overall lifestyle. We examined if current education, parental education or educational mobility between generations was associated with healthy lifestyles in young Australian adults. Methods: In 2004 - 06, <b>participant</b> <b>and</b> parental education (high [bachelor degree or higher], intermediate [vocational training], low [secondary school only]) were assessed. Educational mobility was defined as: stable high (<b>participant</b> <b>and</b> parent in high group), stable intermediate (<b>participant</b> <b>and</b> parent in intermediate group), stable low (<b>participant</b> <b>and</b> parent in low group), downwardly (lower group than parent) and upwardly (higher group than parent) mobile. We derived a lifestyle score from 10 healthy behaviours (BMI, non-smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure time physical activity and six components of diet). Scores > 4 indicated a high healthy lifestyle score. We estimated the likelihood of having a high healthy lifestyle score by education (<b>participant</b> <b>and</b> parent) and educational mobility.

5|$|After {{the success}} of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of {{stagnation}} that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. The Games in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement. The Games rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of <b>participants</b> <b>and</b> generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity {{and the size of the}} Olympics.|$|E
