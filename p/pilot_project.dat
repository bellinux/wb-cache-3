40|$|The {{individual}} {{action plans}} from the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> differ across project partners {{for a variety}} of locally specific reasons. In order to later compare the results from the different <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> it is essential to have a clear understanding of the commonalities and differences across the action plans.

5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} <b>pilot</b> <b>project.</b> The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius of a few hundred feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> were poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for a <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks.

5|$|In 2013, a {{year before}} the {{payphone}} contract was set to expire, there was a competition that sought ideas to further repurpose the network of payphones. The competition, held by the administration of Michael Bloomberg, expanded the idea of the <b>pilot</b> <b>project.</b> There were 125 responses that suggested a Wi-Fi network, but none of these responses elaborated on how that would be accomplished.|$|E

5|$|The Orangi <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project</b> {{was very}} {{different}} from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} OPP model {{became an}} inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project</b> (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Firstly, {{the reader}} is {{introduced}} to the Swiss political system, which {{can be described as}} a federalist state with direct democracy. Secondly, the Swiss e-voting <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> will be presented, against the background of the political system. Switzerland runs three <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in order to test the feasibility of e-voting. In a third part the legal framework of e-voting in Switzerland is highlighted. In a fourth part the work of the Council of Europe is addressed. A last part contains Recommendations to the Swiss legislator. Today, the legal scheme allows for <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> Should e-voting be introduced in Switzerland, the legal basis has to be adapted, taking into account the experience acquired through the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> and the Council of Europe’s Recommendation on e-voting. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1980, Khan {{moved to}} Karachi and {{started working on}} the {{improvement}} of sanitary conditions in Karachi suburbs. He laid {{the foundations of the}} Orangi <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project</b> for the largest squatter community of Orangi in the city. He remained associated with this project until his death in 1999. Meanwhile, he maintained his support for rural communities around Karachi, and also helped to develop the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme. OPP became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{he started}} a Bottom Up {{community}} development initiative of Orangi <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project,</b> based in the outskirts of Karachi, which became a model of participatory development initiatives. He also directed many programmes, from microcredit to self-finance and from housing provision to family planning, for rural communities and urban slums. It earned him international recognition and high honours in Pakistan. Khan was fluent in at least seven languages and dialects. Apart from many scholarly books and articles, he also published a collection of poems and travelogues in Urdu.|$|E

5|$|Work {{with the}} system started in 1995, when the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision took {{initiative}} for a new mobile telecommunications platform. The issue was coordinated by the Ministry of Justice, and the issue was first discussed politically in 1997, and in 1998 a project group was created. In 2001, a <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> was established in Trondheim, which included all three agencies. The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003. Later that year, the Parliament of Norway made the principal decision to establish the network. Quality control {{of the project was}} concluded in June 2004, and construction was estimated at NOK3.6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small <b>pilot</b> <b>project.</b> De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the capital letter with a flat top. In 1499, Griffo recut the capitals, changing the appearance of the typeface slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{rural health}} {{and other health}} service {{development}} contexts, there is frustration with a reliance on <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> {{as a means of}} informing policy and service innovation. There is also an emerging recognition that existing research methods do not draw lessons from the failed sustainability that characterises many of these <b>pilots</b> and demonstration <b>projects.</b> Discussion: This article describes critical aspects of the methodology of a successful collaborative, multi-method, systematic synthesis of exemplary primary health care <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in rural and remote Australia, which synthesised principles from a number of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> to inform policy makers and planners. Hallmarks of the method were: the nature of the source materials for the research, the subsequent research engagement with the actual <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> the extent of collaboration throughout the study with end-users from policy and planning arenas, and the attention to procedural quality. Summary: The methodology, while time consuming, has resulted in applied, policy-relevant findings, and evidence of consideration by policy-makers. Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E
5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of a <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{principal}} of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed {{a special interest in}} grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project</b> in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.|$|E
