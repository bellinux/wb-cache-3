40|$|Recent {{discussions of}} studentification have {{emphasised}} {{the development of}} exclusive <b>purpose-built</b> <b>student</b> <b>accommodation</b> in city centres, shifting the focus away from Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) in established residential neighbourhoods. In this paper we explore the growth of student housing on a former social-rented (council) housing estate, and the social friction that it has created—arguing that the production of student HMO has remained prolific, and is pushing the studentification frontier into outer-city deprived communities. Drawing on empirical evidence from a former social-rented housing estate, we explore the recent emergence of a ‘student area’ where student occupation is having marked impacts on a relatively deprived local population. These findings have implications for urban policy making, given they highlight the negative outcomes of studentification in deprived communities, and reveal the challenge this poses for providing affordable housing, and engendering sustainable communities in university towns...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{concern about}} the {{negative}} impacts of students on ‘host communities ’ has triggered debates {{about the consequences of}} studentification in the UK. For some commentators, <b>purpose-built</b> <b>student</b> <b>accommodation</b> (PBSA) appears the panacea for studentification, as it offers the potential to reintroduce balance to studentified communities by redistributing student populations in regulated ways. This paper explores this contention, drawing upon focus groups and household surveys con-ducted in the vicinity of a PBSA development in Brighton, UK. The paper concludes that the location of this development in a densely populated neighbourhood has engendered adverse student/community relations, conflict, feelings of dispossession and displacement of established local residents. It is asserted that future develop-ments of PBSA should be mindful of these issues and their implications for ques-tions of community cohesion, quality-of-life and belonging in established residential communities. These findings are discussed in relation to debates of age differentials, segregation and new-build gentrification...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the ‘geographies of students’ {{have become}} {{increasingly}} prevalent across {{the social sciences and}} are particularly concerned with the predilection for young UK University undergraduates to be mobile in their institutional choice. A more recent focus within this work has been upon student identities, with attention given to how the spaces to which students move and in which they settle can have both positive and negative consequences for the evolution of the student identity, and how such identities are often framed within the context of social activities; learning environments; friendship networks; or other sociocultural factors. This paper contributes to these discussions by considering the role of student accommodation – a site which often remains on the periphery of discussions of student identities – in offering students opportunities to construct, adapt and manage their student identities. This adds to the important contemporary geographies of student accommodation, which are currently debating, among others, <b>purpose-built</b> <b>student</b> <b>accommodation</b> and the broad housing ‘careers’ and strategies of students. In contrast, this paper explores the micro-geographies of student accommodation (and more specifically, the bedroom) to highlight its value in providing young, mobile students with an anchor within which they can draw together their learner, social and domestic dispositions into one geographical location...|$|E

40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of a}} paper subsequently published in the journal, Environment and Planning A. The definitive version is available at: [URL] scholarship on student geographies and urban change continues to advance knowledge of the intense commodification of student lifestyles and student housing. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to consider some of the hitherto under-researched wider knock-on effects of more commodified student housing markets. Here we present findings from the first-ever empirical study of de-studentification. Using the case study of Loughborough, we demonstrate how de-studentification is a process of change that has been stimulated by the increased supply of <b>purpose-built</b> <b>student</b> <b>accommodation.</b> We show that de-studentification leads to the depopulation and decline of some classical studentified neighbourhoods. Moreover, these urban transformations have several significant implications for pre-existing conceptualisations of urban change and student geographies. Notably, the impacts of de-studentification pose important questions for the conceptual boundaries of studentification – a prerequisite of de-studentification – and although, to date, dominant conceptualisations of studentification are wedded to upgrading-led representations of urban gentrification, it is shown that de-studentification, conversely, leads to physical downgrading and emptying of neighbourhoods in distinct phases. We therefore argue for a process-led definition of de-studentification, to illustrate how studentified neighbourhoods are gradually ‘emptied’ of student populations and student housing. More broadly, it is asserted that new student geographies are being created by the deepening neoliberalisation and commodification of higher education, which, in turn, will have unintentional consequences for wider social, cultural and economic relations in university towns and cities, such as emergent community cohesion and changing senses of place...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Processes of studentification encompass socio-economic, cultural and physical changes which are tied to seasonal population movements of university students. To date, most empirical investigations of studentification have tended {{to take place in}} Anglophone contexts. This thesis extends the lens of study to China, and shows the salience of the concept for understanding urban transformations which have unfolded since the introduction of a new state policy in 1999 for the expansion of higher education. Using the case study of Haidian District (Beijing), and focussing on Peking University students, the thesis makes original contributions to academic knowledge. First, it argued that the concept of studentification can be transposed to the Chinese context, and that social, cultural, economic and physical signifiers of studentification are evident in Beijing. Second, four main geographies of studentification are revealed, which concur with Smith and Hubbard s (2014) discussion of the co-existence of diverse geographies of studentification in the UK. These include: on-campus, university-managed dormitories (Yanyuan and Shaoyuan by Peking University); off-campus, university-managed dormitories (Wanliu, Changchunyuan/Changchunxinyuan, and Global Village); off-campus, Housing in Multiple Occupation (Haidianlu), and; off-campus, <b>Purpose-built</b> <b>student</b> <b>accommodation</b> (Wudaokou). By contrast to the UK, it is shown that all geographies of studentification are gated. Yet, differential residential and socio-cultural experiences are highlighted, in part, influenced by state regulations for Chinese students to reside within university-managed dormitories, or acquire permission to live off-campus; contrary to less-regulated accommodation patterns of International students. This division marks a conceptual difference between studentification in China and UK, with international students more aligned to stereotypical cultural/lifestyle traits of UK students (e. g. noise, partying), as opposed to Chinese counterparts residing in regulated (study-oriented) spaces on-campus. The thesis presents a redefined conceptualisation of studentification for pining down the diverse geographies of student housing in Beijing, to meet the differential demands of Chinese and international students in an expanded system of higher education...|$|E
