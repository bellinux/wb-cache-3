40|$|Mangabeira (Hancornia speciosa) is {{a native}} fruit tree found mainly in the Cerrado biome and shows great {{economic}} potential due to its multiple uses; the fruits are used in agriculture, are important as a food resource, and can be consumed in natura or processed. Due {{to a reduction in}} the area of ecosystems where it occurs, mangabeira is threatened by genetic erosion in Brazil. The characterization of the genetic diversity of plants can provide the basis for strategies to protect and conserve endangered populations, like mangabeira. This study aimed to compare eight DNA extraction methods in mangabeira because the key to success is the use of a pure genomic DNA for the characterization of genetic diversity in molecular biology techniques. The quality and concentration of DNA were revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were successfully by extractions using two commercial <b>purification</b> <b>kits</b> and by the method proposed by Khanuja et al.

5000|$|The {{amplicon}} to be analysed must preferably {{correspond to}} a size of greater than 1000bp, purely {{for the sake}} of encountering a greater possibility of the restriction site.

This can be done by numerous commercially available <b>purification</b> <b>kits.</b> Care should be taken to choose the restriction enzymes. Certain restriction enzymes recognize the same sites, and cannot contribute productively to the analysis. Overnight digestion (10-16 hours) of about 300-500 ng of amplicon DNA in a 20 μL system with 4-5 units of Restriction Enzyme along with the recommended buffer at the prescribed temperature is recommended. Following digestion, the reaction is stopped and the entire digest run in a 2-3% agarose gel at 90-100V. The gel should be of a length that would allow proper resolution of minor fragments, as small as 100-200 bp.|$|R
