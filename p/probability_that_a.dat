5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by {{the square of the}} absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E

We hypothesize that increasing the number of mandates will decrease the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> individual has EPHI. Using the within-state variation of the number of mandates, we show that each additional mandate causes approximately a 0. 2 percentage point decrease in the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> individual has EPHI. Importantly, using a two-stage least squares model, we are able to clearly demonstrate that these results are not biased by endogeneity. ...|$|R

Parametric linkage analysis is the traditional approach, whereby the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> gene important for a disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, {{is due to the}} existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance.
