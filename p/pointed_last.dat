30|$|If the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> of any two sampled points locates on {{the left}} of V_m, e.g., D_ 1 to B_ 1, namely, {{the slope of the}} <b>last</b> <b>point</b> (B_ 1) on P–V curve is positive. This {{perturbation}} will make the operating <b>point</b> (the <b>last</b> <b>point,</b> B_ 1) move to the MPP. In this situation, the perturbation direction employed in the conventional MPPT method is correct. However, if the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> of two sampled points locate on the right of V_m, e.g., B_ 1 to E_ 1, namely, the slope of <b>last</b> <b>point</b> (E_ 1) on P–V curve is negative. This perturbation will make the operating <b>point</b> (the <b>last</b> <b>point,</b> E_ 1) still move to the right, going in the opposite direction towards the MPP. In this situation, the perturbation direction is apparently wrong, which is defined as the confusion by most of papers. In practical applications, if the conventional MPPT method is employed, such problem will occur when there is a sudden increase or decrease in the solar irradiance.|$|R
