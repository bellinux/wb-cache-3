The third RAF {{station on the}} shores of Loch Erne was RAF Castle Archdale but St Angelo was the only station of the three that additionally had land-based runways.In August 1943, the positions were reversed and St Angelo was designated as a subsidiary satellite airfield for No. 17 Group RAF Coastal Command which had established its headquarters at RAF Killadeas and commanded all Lough Erne flying boat squadrons. St Angelo became home to several squadrons of Consolidated PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland flying boats operating from Lough Erne. Later that year, Bristol Beaufighters of No. 235 Squadron RAF were based at St Angelo during anti-submarine patrols in the Irish Sea and over the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
40|$|The MNC {{literature}} {{treats the}} (<b>parent)</b> <b>HQ</b> as entirely benevolent {{with respect to}} their perceived and actual intentions when they intervene at lower levels of the MNC. However, HQ may intervene in subsidiaries in ways that demotivate subsidiary employees and managers (and therefore harm value-creation). This may happen even if such intervention is benevolent in its intentions. We argue that the movement away from more traditional hierarchical forms of the MNC and towards network MNCs placed in more dynamic environments gives rise to more occasions for potentially harmful intervention by HQ. Network MNCs should therefore be particularly careful to anticipate and take precautions against "intervention hazards". Following earlier research, we point to the role of normative integration and procedural justice, but argue that they also serve to control harmful HQ intervention (and not just subsidiary opportunism).

40|$|Abstract 8 -Hydroxyquinoline (8 HQ) {{compounds}} {{have been}} reported to possess diverse bioactivities. In recent years, drug repositioning has gained considerable attention in drug discovery and development. Herein, 8 HQ (1) and its derivatives (2 – 9) bearing various substituents (amino, nitro, cyano and halogen) were investigated for their antimicrobial against 27 microorganisms (agar dilution method) and antioxidant (DPPH method) activities. The <b>parent</b> 8 <b>HQ</b> (1) exerted a highly potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including diploid fungi and yeast with MIC values in the range of 3. 44 – 13. 78 μM. Moreover, the halogenated 8 HQ, especially 7 -bromo- 8 HQ (4) and clioquinol (6), displayed a high antigrowth activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared with the parent compound (1). Apparently, the derivatives with a relatively high safely index, e. g., nitroxoline (2), exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC= 5. 26 μM) and selectively inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa with the MIC value of 84. 14 μM; cloxyquin (3) showed a strong activity against Listseria monocytogenes and Plesiomonas shigelloides with MIC values of 5. 57 and 11. 14 μM, respectively. Most compounds displayed an antioxidant activity. Specifically, 5 -amino- 8 HQ (8) was shown to be the most potent antioxidant (IC 50 = 8. 70 μM) compared with the positive control (α-tocopherol) with IC 50 of 13. 47 μM. The findings reveal that 8 HQ derivatives are potential candidates to be further developed as antimicrobial and antioxidant agents...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the literature on subsidiary evolution by exploring the developments of subsidiary technological capabilities. It has been widely acknowledged that subsidiaries have unique in-house capabilities that are embedded in two contexts: 1) the internal technology sources including the headquarter ("HQ") and affiliated-units, such as the research and development ("R&D") centres; 2) the external technology sources comprised of local, regional or global entities, such as local universities. This study examines the relationship between subsidiary capability and autonomy and the mediating effects of communication systems, by linking internal and external networks through which the subsidiary both exploits and creates particular technological capabilities, and through which the <b>parent</b> company <b>HQ,</b> exercises its control. Through a synthesis of the international business and innovation management literature review, a set of measures of technological capability, autonomy and communication have been drawn. A capability taxonomy configured for the semiconductor industry by Ernst et al. (1998) was adapted to specifically examine integrated circuit ("IC") design, production and marketing capabilities amongst five different Taiwan-based foreign wholly-owned subsidiaries in the electronics industry (particular in the integrated circuits sector). These are compared using quantitative and qualitative measures on factors such as the types and levels of technological capabilities, the degree of autonomy and the intensity of communication they have developed. The findings demonstrated that the heart of subsidiary technological-capability creating lies in exploiting the parent company's core- competitive assets and capabilities and creating its capability development using local knowledge systems, and regional and global cooperative partners. The extent to which such developments of subsidiary technological capabilities are dispersed throughout and leveraged on the multinational enterprise ("MNE") 's differentiated network, depends on the intensity of internal and external communication systems for assimilating information or knowledge. Moreover, single subsidiaries have different degrees of decision-making autonomy, which influence both the nature of the internal NINE network, and the extent of influence of the internal and external network linkages on the developments of subsidiary technological capabilities. Overall, this research concludes that subsidiary autonomy is a cyclical process between the parent company and subsidiary, which is affected by the development of a subsidiary's technological capability. The capability- creating of a subsidiary is driven by the interactions between internal and external leverages which broaden the level and types of technological capabilities (namely, marketing-, design-and production-related) in terms of the scope of responsibility, in-house capability and the capacity for assimilation and creation of 4 new' technology.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{processes}} and challenges involved in multinational enterprise (MNE) establishing and operating regional headquaters (RHQs) as bridges between the <b>parent</b> <b>HQ</b> and their subsidiaries within a region. The role of regional structures has been neglected {{in research on}} international management, and, until recently, especially in research on HRM and talent management (TM). We know little about how MNEs develop, introduce and adapt TM (global TM (GTM) in this context) to accommodate local/country/regional contexts and challenges. The paper addresses these lacunae by reviewing the literature on GTM, MNE regional structures and GTM in the Asia Pacific region, and by presenting our findings from {{a study of the}} recent establishment by a multinational vehicle manufacturer of a regional headquarters in the Asia Pacific region. Four main challenges were identified: setting up the regional headquarters, legitimacy and contribution issues relating {{to the role of the}} RHQ, specific regional TM matters and centralisation versus decentralisation within the region...|$|E
40|$|Through {{longitudinal}} {{case studies}} of headquarters-subsidiary knowledge transfer, I explore knowledge sender and receiver capabilities, and the underlying micro-mechanisms that have implications on knowledge transfer processes and outcomes over time. The knowledge transfer phenomenon between <b>parent</b> firm headquarters (<b>HQ)</b> and subsidiaries has received {{a substantial amount of}} research attention over the last decades. Even so, knowledge of firms’ disseminative and absorptive capacities and the mechanisms through which they interact and shape knowledge transfer is lacking. This doctoral thesis aims to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} strategic, relational and political nature of sender and receiver capabilities, and their implications on HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNC). This thesis consists of four research papers and their findings point to evolutionary dynamics of HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer where power and politics play an important role. Most studies have looked at MNC knowledge transfer processes at one point in time. Using a longitudinal case study design, I find that the amounts and the types of transferred knowledge change over time. Headquarters-subsidiary knowledge flows vary with strategic opportunities, but also with changing abilities and motivations to disseminate and absorb knowledge. Whereas most studies of MNC knowledge transfer focus on the recipient, I demonstrate that sender-receiver interactions matter, and explain how these interactions influence HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer processes and outcomes over time. I studied the headquarters-subsidiary knowledge transfer processes in the context of post-acquisition integration where power and politics play an important role. My data shows that power imbalance between parent firms and their newly acquired targets influence the type, the timing and the amount of knowledge transfer through power balancing actions. Political strategies and influence tactics of the acquiring and target firms differ in conventional (acquirer to target) and reverse (target to acquirer) knowledge flows, and generate distinct knowledge outcomes. In this thesis, I develop a new conceptualization of headquarters’ disseminative capacity that refers to political capability of the parent firm to influence change in the behavior and attitudes of the subsidiary and, ultimately, gain and preserve power. This constitutes a novel way of looking at the headquarters’ role in intra-MNC knowledge flows through which a competitive advantage can be gained and sustained...|$|R
