The paper shows that under Bertrand competition it is relatively more difficult to achieve compliance with environmental standards than under Cournot competition, requiring larger fines to achieve both <b>partial</b> and universal <b>compliance.</b> The paper also shows that when goods are substitutes, that the rate of compliance among firms competing as Cournot oligopolists is higher than if firms were competing in a Bertrand market.

Inadequate compliance and treatment persistence results in poor outcomes, despite the best efforts of the medical team. It is important to develop and implement a strategy to improve compliance.

30|$|In many {{developing}} countries, {{a significant portion}} of the wage distribution is found below the legal minimum wage. In order to fully understand the nature of this non-compliance, we need to compare the counterfactual wage distribution without the minimum wage law to the current wage distribution. Such a comparison could reveal <b>partial</b> <b>compliance,</b> where employers raise wages some of the way to the minimum wage, to balance out the benefits of non-compliance with the costs and penalties to the extent that they depend on the gap between the legal minimum wage and the wage actually paid. This paper presents a simple model of such <b>partial</b> <b>compliance</b> and uses its predictions to structure an empirical investigation of the impact of introducing a minimum wage law for agricultural workers in South Africa. We find that <b>partial</b> <b>compliance</b> is indeed taking place and further, the lowest wages are being raised disproportionately, consistent with the predictions of the model.|$|E

Methods: The incidence and direct costs of PID sequelae (infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain) resulting after partially treated chlamydial PID were taken from previous estimates.

30|$|We {{then turn}} to an {{empirical}} application {{based on the}} agriculture sector in South Africa, focusing on wage effects. We utilise an index of minimum wage violation to estimate whether relative compliance levels, measured here by a closing of the average gap between actual and minimum wages, have changed {{as a result of}} the promulgation of the minima. We find that there is evidence of <b>partial</b> <b>compliance,</b> where employers adjust wages upwards {{as a result of the}} law, but not all the way to the minimum wage. This supports work by Dinkelman and Ranchhod (2012), Dinkelman et al. (2014) who observe partial response to the minimum wage law in the Domestic Worker sector in South Africa. However, unlike Dinkelman and Ranchhod (2012), we find that when the minimum wage is set at a higher level relative to existing mean wages in a district, there is evidence of greater <b>partial</b> <b>compliance,</b> which is predicted by the theoretical model for some parameter values.|$|E
40|$|Crack {{growth and}} the crack growth rate can be {{determined}} continuously by using the single-specimen <b>partial</b> unloading <b>compliance</b> technique, modified for high-temperature tests, or a direct-current potential drop technique with similar accuracy for temperatures up to 800 degrees C and test durations from a few hours up to several months. The possibilities and limitations of the experimental setup are discussed. The increasing influence of time-dependent processes with increasing test temperature is shown {{on the basis of}} J-integral versus crack growth resistance curves (J-R curves), determined in short-time tests in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 degrees C. Creep deformation and creep crack growth are significant for this alloy at temperatures higher than about 600 degrees C. An evaluation in terms of J-R curves represents the limiting case of negligible time-dependent effects, and therefore it is only meaningful for relatively high loading with relatively high deforma tion rates. This is demonstrated for high temperature crack growth experiments with different loading rates. For these cases the evaluation of short - time tests (less than one day) in terms of the C-integral for steady-state creep conditions is consistent with results of long-time creep tests at 800 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Ductile {{fracture}} material parameters {{have been}} determined for a {{reactor pressure vessel}} material to characterize its fracture resistance in the upper shelf toughness regime. Three different methods (the multiple specimen unloading (MSU), direct current potential drop (DCPD) and single specimen <b>partial</b> unloading <b>compliance</b> (SSPUC) methods) have been applied to test different CT-specimen geometries at temperatures between 25 and 300 degrees C. It is shown that there are principle differences between J-R-curves measured by different experimental procedures, because of different methods for the measurement of crack lengths and crack growth. For instability analyses, using a complete J-R-curve, these differences seem to be negligible. For the determination of critical material parameters at or close to initiation of stable crack growth these differences may cause systematic errors tending to higher values for DCPD as compared to MSU-results and to lower values for SSPUC respectively. Proced ures can be defined to evaluate comparable critical material parameters from the different experimental procedures, if J sub i is known in a good approximation allowing to consider only the real extension without blunting, or if in addition the real (or realistically modelled) blunting and the effective blunting of the specific method are known.
