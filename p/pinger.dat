5|$|On 29 November 2006, an Australian Army S-70A Black Hawk {{helicopter}} {{operating from}} Kanimbla, and carrying ten Army personnel on board, crashed whilst attempting {{to land on}} the ship's deck, killing 1 person, injuring 7 more and leaving one missing (later confirmed dead). HMAS Melville arrived on task the morning of 15 December 2006, equipped with a Towed <b>Pinger</b> Locating Drone supplied from the United States Navy set about locating the downed Black Hawk. Melville detected the locator beacon during its first pass over the crash site and pinpointed its exact location in subsequent passes. The helicopter is sitting in around 2900 metres of water.|$|E
25|$|Bluefin-21 {{required}} 16 {{missions to}} complete its {{search of the}} 314 square kilometre area around the detections made by the Towed <b>Pinger</b> Locator. The seafloor sonar search was suspended on 2 May for the AVDOcean Shield to return to port to replenish supplies and personnel. Within two hours of its first deployment after returning to the search area on 13 May, Bluefin-21 developed a communications problem and was recovered. Spare parts from the UK were required and the AVDOcean Shield returned to port to collect the parts. After Bluefin-21 was repaired, the seafloor sonar survey resumed on 22 May.|$|E
25|$|There were {{fears that}} the plane's {{tracking}} equipment and emergency locator beacon could have been damaged after the crash or weakened by interference, and that this would hamper the search. The head of the National Search and Rescue Agency told the Associated Press that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea. From 5 January 2007, {{the main focus of}} the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's Sam Ratulangi Airport reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before. However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim. Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece. On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore sent four towed underwater locator beacon detectors, sometimes called Towed <b>Pinger</b> Locators, and six consultants in their use to aid in the search. These would successfully locate the black boxes. On 24 January, the British ship MN Endeavour joined the search. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed. By 24 January, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.|$|E

500|$|Revised {{estimates}} of the radar track and the aircraft's remaining fuel led to a move of the search [...] north-east of the previous area on 28 March, which was followed by another shift on 4 April. Between 2 and 17 April an {{effort was made to}} detect the underwater locator beacons (ULBs; informally known as [...] "pingers") attached to the aircraft's flight recorders, whose batteries were expected to expire around 7 April. Australian naval cutter ADV Ocean Shield equipped with a towed <b>pinger</b> locator (TPL); China's Haixun 01 equipped with a hand-held hydrophone; and the Royal Navy's HMS Echo equipped with a hull-mounted hydrophone; were utilized in the search. Operators considered it a shot in the dark, when comparing the vast search area with the fact that a TPL could only search up to [...] per day. Between 4–8 April several acoustic detections were made that were close to the frequency and rhythm of the sound emitted by the flight recorders' ULBs; analysis of the acoustic detections determined that, although unlikely, the detections could have come from a damaged ULB. A sonar search of the sea-floor near the detections was carried out between 14 April and 28 May without any sign of Flight 370. In a March 2015 report, it was revealed that the calendar life of the battery for the ULB attached to Flight 370's flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and may not have been as capable.|$|E

In controlled trials, active and control <b>pingers</b> were deployed on fixed moorings, with T-PODs—acoustic monitoring devices to detect cetacean activity. In a separate trial, <b>pingers</b> were deployed from a moving boat which actively located dolphin groups in the estuary, and dolphin behaviour was recorded. In the static trials, overall detection rates of dolphin vocalizations on the T-POD were significantly lower in the presence of active CPs, but {{this was not the case}} for RPs. Mean inter-click interval values were longer for click trains produced in the presence of inactive RPs than for active RPs, active or inactive CPs. In boat-based trials, both active CPs and RPs appeared to affect bottlenose dolphin behaviour, whereby dolphins immediately left the area at speed and in a highly directional manner, involving frequent leaps...|$|R
2500|$|On 14 April, {{due to the}} {{likelihood}} of the ULBs' acoustic pulses having ceased because their batteries would have run down, the Towed <b>Pinger</b> Locator search gave way to a seabed search using side-scan sonar installed in a Bluefin-21 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The first day's search was aborted because the sea bed was considerably deeper than the maximum operating depth of Bluefin. Scanning subsequently resumed and after covering 42 square miles in its first four dives, the submersible was reprogrammed to allow it to dive 604 feet lower than its operational limit of 14,800 feet, when the risk of damage was assessed as [...] "acceptable".|$|E
2500|$|On 6 April, JACC {{announced}} that Ocean Shield had also {{picked up a}} signal, about [...] from Haixun 01. It was announced the next day that the TPL-25 <b>pinger</b> locator towed by Ocean Shield had picked up a signal twice on 6 April. The first was {{on the morning of}} 6 April, at approximately [...] depth, and lasted two hours and 20 minutes. The second signal reception took place at approximately [...] depth and lasted 13 minutes. During the second episode, two distinct <b>pinger</b> returns were audible. Both episodes of recorded signals, which took place at roughly the same position though several kilometres apart, were considered to be consistent with signals expected from an aircraft's flight recorder ULB. The signals received by Ocean Shield were recorded at the north of a newly calculated impact area, which was announced on 7 April, while the Haixun 01 signals had been recorded at its southern edge. Ocean Shield detected two more signals on 8 April. The first was acquired at 16:27 AWST and held for 5 minutes, 32 seconds and the second was acquired at 22:17 AWST and held for around seven minutes. Experts had determined that the earlier signals captured by Ocean Shield were [...] "very stable, distinct, and clear ... at 33.331 kHz and ... consistently pulsed at a 1.106-second interval". These were said to be consistent with the flight recorder ULB. but the frequency of the detections was well outside the manufacturer's specification of 37.5 +/- 1. The later signals were at a frequency of 27kHz, which raised doubts that they were from a black box. On 10 April, a signal recorded by one of the sonobuoys deployed with a hydrophone at 300 metres depth was found unlikely to have originated from Flight 370.|$|E

But for billiards he had a decided taste, a genuine taste, not the pumped-up affectation sometimes displayed by boys of his age. Considering his age he was a remarkable player. Later on in life it appeared likely that he would have the choice of three professions open to him, namely, professional billiard player, billiard marker, and billiard sharp. At each of the three he showed distinct promise. He was not 'lured to the green cloth' by Monk or Danvers. Indeed, if there had been any luring to be done, it is probable that he would have done it, and not they. Neither Monk nor Danvers was in his confidence in the matter. Billiards is not a cheap amusement. By the end of his sixth week Farnie was reduced to a single pound, a sum which, for one of his tastes, was practically poverty. And just at the moment when he was least able to bear up against it, Fate dealt him one of its nastiest blows. He was playing a fifty up against a friendly but unskilful farmer at the 'Cow and Cornflower'. 'Better look out,' he said, as his opponent effected a somewhat rustic stroke, 'you'll be cutting the cloth in a second.' The farmer grunted, missed by inches, and retired, leaving the red ball in the jaws of the pocket, and Farnie with three to make to win.|$|E

Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|R
