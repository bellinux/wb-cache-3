However, while FDI has clearly <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on technology transfers, its effects on resource use within firms is less clear and, in principle, efficiency losses might offset some of the productivity gains associated with improved technologies. In this paper, we study the impacts of FDI on efficiency in Swedish manufacturing. We find that foreign ownership has <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on efficiency, supporting the earlier findings on productivity...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the means of systemising the hotel sector by {{integrating}} the concepts and practices of ISO 14001 certification. The research problem was approached by a literature synthesis, questionnaire survey and case study analysis. It was identified that the implementation of ISO 14001 is being very less at present. The case study analysis revealed that, the ISO 14001 certification made <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on the identified performance indicators and recognized the there were more <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on energy saving and reduction of waste generation. The result of ISO 14001 non-certified hotel shows, the EMS policy made few <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on units of production and reduction of waste generation {{and there were no}} more <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> on other indicators. By failing to perceive benefits from this well-known standard, hotel can lose financial stability as well as benchmarks. Finally, the paper sets the direction for continual improvement of environmental and financial performance in the future hotel sector...|$|R

A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 9,000 papers based on Hubble data {{have been published}} in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> on their sense of well-being.|$|E
