5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also why they wore highly {{identifiable}} wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches should have to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, Ko {{becomes a}} second-year student and Aoba enters Seishu High School. Yūhei, who stays at Seishu despite having {{been on the}} former first-string team, moves in with Ko's family after the first-stringers' {{dormitory}} is closed. The reformed Seishu team goes on to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> by defeating Sannō High School {{in the first round}} of the summer prefectural qualifying tournament. However, they lose to their second-round opponents, Ryuō, in overtime, ending Seishu's hopes of Koshien for the year. Ryuō subsequently reaches Koshien, advances up to the semifinals where they are narrowly beaten. However, Ryuō then goes on to win the spring invitational Koshien tournament later that same year.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol was {{conceived}} {{in the late}} 1930s by aviation advocate Gill Robb Wilson, who foresaw general aviation's potential to supplement America's military operations. With the help of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, {{in his capacity as}} then-Director of the Office of Civilian Defense, CAP was created with , signed by LaGuardia on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941. The Civil Air Patrol had 90 days to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> to Congress. Major General John F. Curry was appointed as the first national commander. Texas oilman David Harold Byrd was a co-founder of CAP.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b> Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Partly due {{to these}} events, and {{partly due to}} the major losses in {{manpower}} Gallia suffers {{towards the end of the}} war with the Empire, the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force. This is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire, kept secret by their benefactor. Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in the war with Gallia, it is Dahau's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation. As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations' cease-fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace, Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless, asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed-in-action. Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves, the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon. Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{was traded}} {{back to the}} Raw brand on October 11, 2010, after being swapped with Edge. He {{took part in the}} interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after {{injuring}} Evan Bourne to win a place, but the team lost. It was reported later that he was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on Raw from November 22, having already commentated one NXT. During his commentary, he criticized John Cena for his actions against The Nexus. Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of The Nexus. Punk then made each member of the group <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> worthy of a spot, with some choosing to join The Corre, which had been started by former Nexus leader Wade Barrett on SmackDown, instead.|$|E

25|$|The team's general {{philosophy}} {{at the time}} was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive.

25|$|Exhausted by {{the game}} versus France, the Lithuanians {{still had to}} <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in the final against Spain. And while the first quarter was played equally (20–19), {{afterwards}} the Lithuanians dominated and never gave the Spanish any chance. Lithuania won their third European title 93–84 after a 64-year hiatus. Šarūnas Jasikevičius was named MVP, and was included along with Saulius Štombergas in the All-Tournament Team.|$|E
25|$|Officers {{were trained}} at the School of Infantry. Freshly {{graduated}} Second Lieutenants had to first <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in action before being given the responsibility of becoming a stick leader. When these nascent officers joined a Commando, they were normally assigned an experienced NCO as mentor and performed {{the role of a}} rifleman in a stop; in this way new officers learned lessons concerning war not taught in training.|$|E
25|$|That season, Smith {{broke his}} ankle in training, {{and missed the}} {{majority}} of the season. However, by the time he made his return to first team action, manager Jim Magilton had left the club and been replaced by Roy Keane. Smith featured heavily in Keane's early games as Ipswich manager, with the former Manchester United midfielder opting to give some of the club's younger talent – such as Connor Wickham and Smith – a chance to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking.|$|E
25|$|For {{its fifth}} game, Michigan {{traveled}} to Columbus to play Ohio State. The game presented {{an opportunity for}} Michigan to lay claim to the Big Ten Conference championship. Illinois had previously beaten Ohio State by a 13–0 margin, and Michigan supporters hoped that a greater margin of victory would allow the Wolverines to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> superior to the Illini. Michigan did not achieve the large margin it had hoped for, but won the game 14–0, scoring one point more than Illinois.|$|E
25|$|The Tanduay Rhum Masters {{made its}} PBA {{return in the}} 1999 season, after a 12-year hiatus. This time, the team had a new {{ownership}} in Asia Brewery of Lucio Tan's son, Bong (The Tanduay team in the 1970s and 80s was owned by the Elizalde family). After a runner-up finish in the 1999 All-Filipino Conference, the Rhum Masters failed to advanced in the finals since. To add insult, the deportation of alleged fil-sham Sonny Alvarado and the indefinite suspensions of Eric Menk and Rudy Hatfield (due to lack of documents to <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> as a legitimate Fil-American), the management became frustrated.|$|E
