50|$|One common kind of {{decoupling}} is {{to protect}} a <b>powered</b> <b>circuit</b> from signals in the power supply. Sometimes, for various reasons, a power supply supplies an AC signal superimposed on the DC power line. Such a signal is often undesirable in the <b>powered</b> <b>circuit.</b> A decoupling capacitor can prevent the <b>powered</b> <b>circuit</b> from seeing that signal, thus decoupling it from that aspect of the <b>power</b> supply <b>circuit.</b>|$|R

40|$|A RF <b>powering</b> <b>circuit</b> used in {{radio-frequency}} identification (RFID) tags and other batteryless embedded devices {{is presented in}} this paper. The RF <b>powering</b> <b>circuit</b> harvests energy from electromagnetic waves and converts the RF energy to a stable voltage source. Analysis of a NMOS gate-cross connected bridge rectifier is conducted to demonstrate relationship between device sizes and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rectifier. A rectifier with 38. 54 % PCE under normal working conditions is designed. Moreover, a stable voltage regulator with a temperature and voltage optimizing strategy including adoption of a combination resistor is developed, which is able to accommodate a large input range of 4 V to 12 V and be immune to temperature variations. Latch-up prevention and noise isolation methods in layout design are also presented. Designed with the HJTC 0. 25 μm process, this regulator achieves 0. 04 mV/°C temperature rejection ratio (TRR) and 2. 5 mV/V voltage rejection ratio (VRR). The RF <b>powering</b> <b>circuit</b> is also fabricated in the HJTC 0. 25 μm process. The area of the RF <b>powering</b> <b>circuit</b> is 0. 23 × 0. 24 mm 2.

25|$|The {{circuit breaker}} {{contacts}} must carry the load current without excessive heating, and must also withstand {{the heat of}} the arc produced when interrupting (opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but <b>power</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.|$|E
25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the <b>power</b> <b>circuit.</b> This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E

25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC <b>power</b> <b>circuit</b> closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.|$|E
25|$|The current edition (17th) of the {{regulations}} requires that all socket outlets in most domestic installations have RCD protection, though there are exemptions. Cables buried in walls must also be RCD protected (again with some specific exemptions). {Refer to 17th Edition Amendment 1 effective from January 2012} Provision of RCD protection for circuits present in bathrooms and shower rooms reduces the requirement for supplementary bonding in those locations. Two RCDs {{may be used to}} cover the installation, with upstairs and downstairs lighting and power circuits spread across both RCDs. When one RCD trips, power is maintained to at least one lighting and <b>power</b> <b>circuit.</b> Other arrangements, {{such as the use of}} RCBOs, may be employed to meet {{the regulations}}. The new requirements for RCDs do not affect most existing installations unless they are rewired, the distribution board is changed, a new circuit is installed, or alterations are made such as additional socket outlets or new cables buried in walls.|$|E

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>circuits</b> are data {{structures}} which support efficient algorithms {{for highly}} compressed integers. Using this new data structure {{it has been}} shown recently by Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won that the Word Problem of the one-relator Baumslag group is in P. Before that the best known upper bound has been non-elementary. In the present paper we provide new results for <b>power</b> <b>circuits</b> and we give new applications in algorithmic algebra and algorithmic group theory: 1. We define a modified reduction procedure on <b>power</b> <b>circuits</b> which runs in quadratic time thereby improving the known cubic time complexity. The improvement is crucial for our other results. 2. We improve the complexity of the Word Problem for the Baumslag group to cubic time thereby providing the first practical algorithm for that problem. 3. The main result is that the Word Problem of Higman's group is decidable in polynomial time. The situation for Higman's group is more complicated than for the Baumslag group and forced us to advance the theory of <b>power</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A large {{section of}} the superconducting magnets in CERN's Large Hadron Collider {{unexpectedly}} quenched during start-up operations in 2008, necessitating the replacement {{of a number of}} magnets. In order to mitigate against potentially destructive quenches, the superconducting magnets that form the LHC are equipped with fast-ramping heaters which are activated once a quench event is detected by the complex quench protection system. As the dipole bending magnets are connected in series, each <b>power</b> <b>circuit</b> includes 154 individual magnets, and should a quench event occur, the entire combined stored energy of these magnets must be dumped at once. This energy is transferred into dumps that are massive blocks of metal which heat up to several hundreds of degrees Celsius—because of resistive heating—in a matter of seconds. Although undesirable, a magnet quench is a [...] "fairly routine event" [...] during the operation of a particle accelerator.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released.

Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main <b>power</b> <b>circuit.</b> Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact.
