40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to {{investigate}} {{the ability of the}} Tinospora cordifolia to scavenge free radicals generated during aflatoxicosis. A total no. of 48 male Swiss albino mice (30 ± 5 g) were exposed to Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) (2 μg/ 30 g b. wt, orally) either individually or in combination with T. cordifolia (50, 100, 200 mg/kg, orally) once daily for 25 days. AFB 1 exposure led to significant rise in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and fall in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbic acid, and <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> <b>T.</b> cordifolia was found to show protective effect by lowering down the content of TBARS and enhancing the GSH, ascorbic acid, protein, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes viz., SOD, CAT, glutathione peroxidase, GST, and GR in kidney. Histopathological analysis of kidney samples also confirmed the protective values and antioxidant activity of ethanolic extract of herb. T. cordifolia showed protection against aflatoxin-induced nephrotoxicity due to the presence of alkaloids such as a choline, tinosporin, isocolumbin, palmatine, tetrahydropalmatine, and magnoflorine...|$|E
40|$|Complications {{of acute}} {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) are common among critically ill patients infected with highly pathogenic influenza viruses. Macrophages and neutrophils constitute the majority of cells recruited into infected lungs, and are associated with immunopathology in influenza pneumonia. We examined pathological manifestations in models of macrophage- or neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H 1 N 1 strain PR 8. Infected mice depleted of macrophages displayed excessive neutrophilic infiltration, alveolar damage, and increased viral load, later progressing into ARDS-like pathological signs with diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. In contrast, neutrophil-depleted animals showed mild pathology in lungs. The brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice exhibited elevated <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> <b>T</b> 1 -α, thrombomodulin, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, and myeloperoxidase activities indicating augmented alveolar-capillary damage, compared to neutrophil-depleted animals. We provide evidence {{for the formation of}} neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), entangled with alveoli in areas of tissue injury, suggesting their potential link with lung damage. When co-incubated with infected alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, neutrophils from infected lungs strongly induced NETs generation, and augmented endothelial damage. NETs induction was abrogated by anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, thus implying that NETs generation is induced by redox enzymes in influenza pneumonia. These findings support the pathogenic effects of excessive neutrophils in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonia by instigating alveolar-capillary damage...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{differentiate}} septic from non-septic arthritis by measuring lactate concentration with (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HMRS) and by estimating total <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> with the assessment of T (2) values. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 30 patients with acute arthritis, synovial fluid was aspirated. Lactate concentrations were analyzed with single voxel HMRS at 1. 5 T. T (2) relaxation times were mapped with a multi-spin echo sequence. All samples underwent microbiological testing and routine laboratory analysis to quantify lactate concentration and total <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> Values obtained in septic and non-septic arthritis were compared with a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis (n = 10) had higher concentrations of lactate (11. 4 +/- 4. 0 mmol/L) and higher total <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> (51. 8 +/- 10. 7 g/L) than fluid obtained in non-septic arthritis (n = 20; 5. 2 +/- 1. 1 mmol/L and 40. 4 +/- 6. 9 g/L, respectively, p 6 mmol/L) in combination with low T (2) values (< 550 ms) identify septic arthritis with a sensitivity of 70 % and a specificity of 89 %. CONCLUSION: Spectroscopic measurements of lactate concentration in combination with the estimation of <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> using <b>T</b> (2) may be of value in the differentiation of septic from non-septic arthritis...|$|R

Multivariate analyses indicated that elevated temperature played {{a greater role in}} altering {{physiological response}}, with the greatest degree of change occurring within M. monasteriata and T. reniformis. Algal cellular volume, <b>protein,</b> and lipid <b>content</b> all increased for M. monasteriata. Likewise, S. trenchii volume and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in <b>T.</b> reniformis also increased with temperature. Despite decreases in maximal photochemical efficiency, few changes in biochemical composition (i. e. lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) or cellular volume occurred at high temperature in the two thermally sensitive symbionts C 21 a and C 1 c-d-t. Intracellular carbonic anhydrase transcript abundance increased with temperature in A. millepora but not in P. damicornis, possibly reflecting differences in host mitigated carbon supply during thermal stress. Importantly, our results show that the host and symbiont response to climate change differs considerably across species and that greater physiological plasticity in response to elevated temperature may be an important strategy distinguishing thermally tolerant vs. thermally sensitive species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cytotoxic {{cells of}} the immune system have evolved a {{lysosomal}} compartment to store and mobilize effector molecules. In T lymphocytes and NK cells, the death factor FasL is one of the characteristic marker proteins of these so-called secretory lysosomes, which combine properties of conventional lysosomes and exocytotic vesicles. Although these vesicles are crucial for immune effector function, their <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in <b>T</b> cells has so far not been investigated in detail. Results In the present study, intact membranous vesicles were enriched from homogenates of polyclonally activated T cells and initially characterized by Western blotting and electron microscopic inspection. The vesicular fraction that contained the marker proteins of secretory lysosomes was subsequently analyzed by 2 D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The proteome analysis and data evaluation revealed that 70 % of the 397 annotated proteins had been associated with different lysosome-related organelles in previous proteome studies. Conclusion We provide the first comprehensive proteome map of T cell-derived secretory lysosomes with only minor contaminations by cytosolic, nuclear or other proteins. This information will be useful to more precisely address the activation-dependent maturation and the specific distribution of effector organelles and proteins in individual T or NK cell populations in future studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Beer {{production}} generates {{huge amounts}} of streams with high energetic potential. This work investigates the energetic valorization of the brewery wastes, trub (T) and spent grain (SG), by anaerobic digestion processes. T had a higher BMP (251 ± 2 L CH 4 kg- 1 COD) than SG (191 ± 3 L CH 4 kg- 1 COD). The methane yield (72 ± 1 %) and methane production rate (1. 08 ± 0. 10 d- 1) were also higher for T because of the recalcitrant nature of SG (55 ± 1 % and 0. 21 ± 0. 01 d- 1). The co-digestion ratio of 10 %T + 90 %SG produced 199 ± 2 L CH 4 kg- 1 COD. Due to the high <b>proteins</b> <b>content</b> of <b>T</b> and SG, 54. 0 ± 6. 6 and 30. 5 ± 1. 7 respectively, crude glycerol (CGly) is a promising co-substrate, with high energy potential and ideal to optimize the C:N ratio for the anaerobic digestion process. The co-digestion with 10 % (w/w) of CGly increased the methane production to 328 ± 5 L CH 4 kg- 1 COD (yield = 94 ± 2 %). Adding higher concentrations of CGly caused inhibitions, decreasing the methane production. Therefore, {{it seems that the}} addition of, up to 10 % (w/w), of CGly had a positive synergetic effect on the brewery wastes anaerobic digestion...|$|R

A high protein (29. 2 %) desi chickpea line ICC 5912 with pea-shaped small seed, grey seed coat and blue flower was crossed with a low protein (20. 5 %) kabuli line ICC 17109 with owl’s head shaped large seed, beige seed coat, and white flower. The F 2 population was evaluated under field conditions and observations were recorded on <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and other traits on individual plants. The <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of F 2 segregants showed continuous distribution suggesting that it is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The blue flowered segregants had pea shaped seed with grey seed coat, while the white flowered segregants had owl’s head shaped seed with beige seed coat indicating pleiotropic effects of gene(s) on these traits. On an average, blue flowered segregants had smaller seed, lower grain yield per plant and higher <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> than the pink flowered and the white flowered segregants. The <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was negatively correlated with seed size (r = − 0. 40) and grain yield per plant (r = − 0. 18). Thus, an increment in <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> is expected to {{have a negative effect on}} seed size and grain yield. However, careful selection of transgressive segregants with high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> along with moderate seed size and utilizing diverse sources of high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> will be usefull in developing chickpea cultivars with high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and high grain yield...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePea seed <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> (SPC) {{and seed}} dry weight (SDW) are both {{influenced}} by genetic and environmental factors. To assess the variations of these within-plant traits between seeds, six genotypes were field tested. The sequential seed development at nodes {{along the main}} stem was determined. Nitrogen fixation {{was measured by the}} acetylene reduction assay (ARA). At maturity, <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and dry weight were measured according to seed position on the plant. Individual <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was determined by near-infrared transmission spectroscopy. The results show a significant difference in <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> between nodes of the genotypes Solara, L 765 and L 833. <b>Protein</b> <b>content</b> tended to decrease from the bottom {{to the top of the}} plant for these genotypes. The difference in <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> between the lowest and the uppermost node was about 26 g kg- 1 for Solara, 40 g kg- 1 for L 765 and 49 g kg- 1 for L 833. There were also significant differences in dry weight between plant nodes for all genotypes, except Finale. In addition, the range of difference in dry weight between plant nodes was higher than that for <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> Further, to determine the influence of morphological position on individual <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and dry weight, multiple linear regression was established on node position, pod position on the node, and seed position within pods. The results showed that <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and dry weight were not influenced either by within-pod seed position or pod position on the raceme. Moreover, <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and dry weight were mainly influenced by node position on the main stem. However, for <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> the effect of node position varied with genotype, indicating a genetic variability for this character. This genetic variability could be attributed to the difference between genotypes in the ability to maintain nitrogen fixation during the onset of seed filling. For dry weight, the decrease in seed weight for upper nodes of the plant also varied with genotype in relation to the duration of seed filling and the seed growth rate...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{management}} at the panicle initiation stage (PI) should be fine-tuned for securing a concurrent high yield and high quality rice pro-duction. For calibration and testing of the recommendation models of N topdressing rates at PI for target grain yield and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of rice, three split-split-plot design experiments including five rice cultivars and various N rates were conducted at the experimental farm of Seoul National University, Korea from 2003 to 2005. Data from {{the first two years}} of experiments were used to calibrate models to predict grain yield and milled-rice <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> using shoot fresh weight (FW), chlorophyll meter value (SPAD), and the N topdressing rate (Npi) at PI by step-wise multiple regression. The calibrated models explained 85 and 87 % of the variation in grain yield and <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> respectively. The cali-brated models were used to recommend Npi for the target <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of 6. 8 %, with FW and SPAD measured for each plot in 2005. The rec-ommended N rate treatment was characterized by an average <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of 6. 74 % (similar to the target <b>protein</b> <b>content),</b> reduced the coeffi-cient of variation in <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> to 2. 5 % (compared to 4. 6 % of the fixed rate treatment), and increased grain yield. In the recommended N rate treatments for the target <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of 6. 8 %, grain yield was highly dependent on FW and SPAD at PI. In conclusion, the models for N topdressing rate recommendation at PI were successful under present experimental conditions. However, additional testing under more variable environmental conditions should be performed before universal application of such models.

40|$|Abstract. Improvement of {{processing}} quality {{is a very}} important objective for Chinese wheat breeding programs. Twenty-five CIMMYT and Chinese spring wheat cultivars were grown at four managed conditions by CIMMYT in Cd. Obregon, Sonora, Mexico and in nine environments in China, over two successive wheat seasons from 2000 to 2002. These trials were used to identify patterns of cultivar, environment and cultivar × environment interactions, and to determine opportunities for indirect selection for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and the protein-quality related parameter, SDS sedimentation (SDSS) value. The cultivar Inqalab 91 showed low levels of interaction with environments in the 2000 – 01 crop cycle for <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> and expressed intermediate levels for both <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and SDSS value, across most of the environments in both years. Longmai 26 had consistently high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and SDSS value across environments in both years, indicating {{that it is possible to}} breed cultivars expressing high yields with good protein properties. Cluster analyses revealed that cultivars grouped differently for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and SDSS value. Besides photoperiod, water availability appeared to influence the ranking of cultivars for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and SDSS value. Temperature and soil type may underlie the observed interactions for <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> while temperature may also be a factor associatedwith interactions for SDSSvalue.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to study the genetic variability and the interaction between genotypes and environments for cooking time and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of bean grains {{as well as to}} identify elite lines of Carioca grain type with short cooking time, high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and high adaptability and stability for these two traits. Sixteen experiments were conducted in a complete randomized block design with three replications during the rainy, dry and winter seasons, in Goiás, Distrito Federal, Pernambuco, Sergipe, Bahia and Paraná States, in 2009 and 2010. Each trial was composed by 16 elite lines of Carioca grain type and the data of cooking time and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> were obtained. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and to stability and adaptability analysis, according to the methodology proposed by Annichiarico. Genetic variability was found for cooking time and for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> among Carioca common bean elite lines; however, for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> this variability is lower. The environmental effect is important for the expression of these traits and is larger than the genetic effect. The interaction between genotypes and environments is important for cooking time and for <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of common beans. The lines CNFC 11951 and CNFC 11962 presents short cooking time, high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and high stability and adaptability for both traits...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if ten weeks of aerobic exercise training could increase hepatic glycogen storage in rats with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T 1 DM) and whether elevated hepatic glycogen content is associated with alterations in glycogenic proteins and insulin signaling. Rats were divided into control-sedentary, control-exercised, T 1 DM-sedentary and T 1 DM-exercised groups. Animals from each group underwent a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp {{at the conclusion of the}} study. Exercise training consisted of treadmill running at 27 m/min, 6 % incline for 1 hr, five days/week for ten weeks. T 1 DM rats had lower liver glycogen concentrations than control rats and glycogen was not increased with training. GS, GK and PEPCK <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> were also increased in the T 1 DM groups. Insulin-clamp stimulated GSK phosphorylation was not different between treatments. These findings indicate that aerobic exercise training does not increase liver glycogen <b>content</b> in <b>T</b> 1 DM rats despite increases in glycogenic <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and normal insulin signaling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} some {{environmental}} variation factors and the genetic parameters for total milk traits (fat <b>content,</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> casein <b>content,</b> serum <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> lactation mean of individual laboratory cheese yield (LILCY), lactation mean of somatic cell count (LSCC), and milk yield) were estimated from {{the records of}} 1 [*] 111 Churra ewes. Genetic parameters were estimated by multivariate REML. Heritability for fat content was low (0. 10) as is usually found in the Churra breed. Heritabilities for <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> casein <b>content,</b> serum <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> LILCY, milk yield and somatic cell count were 0. 31, 0. 30, 0. 22, 0. 09, 0. 26 and 0. 11, respectively. The highest heritability estimates were for <b>protein</b> and casein <b>contents.</b> Casein content is not advisable {{as an alternative to}} <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> as a selection criterion for cheese yield improvement; it does not have any compelling advantages and its measurement is costly. Our results for LSCC indicated that efforts should focus on improving the level of management rather than selecting for somatic cells, in the actual conditions of the Churra breed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{availability}} {{of hundreds of}} bacterial genomes allowed a comparative genomic study of the Type VI Secretion System (T 6 SS), recently discovered as being involved in pathogenesis. By combining comparative and phylogenetic approaches using more than 500 prokaryotic genomes, we characterized the global T 6 SS genetic structure in terms of conservation, evolution and genomic organization. Results This genome wide analysis allowed the identification {{of a set of}} 13 proteins constituting the T 6 SS protein core and a set of conserved accessory proteins. 176 T 6 SS loci (encompassing 92 different bacteria) were identified and their comparison revealed that T 6 SS-encoded genes have a specific conserved genetic organization. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the core genes showed that lateral transfer of the T 6 SS is probably its major way of dissemination among pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the sequence analysis of the VgrG proteins, proposed to be exported in a T 6 SS-dependent way, confirmed that some C-terminal regions possess domains showing similarities with adhesins or proteins with enzymatic functions. Conclusion The core of T 6 SS is composed of 13 proteins, conserved in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Subclasses of T 6 SS differ in regulatory and accessory <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> suggesting that <b>T</b> 6 SS has evolved to adapt to various microenvironments and specialized functions. Based on these results, new functional hypotheses concerning the assembly and function of T 6 SS proteins are proposed. </p...|$|R
