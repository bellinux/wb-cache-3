25|$|A multinomial discrete-choice {{model can}} examine the {{responses}} to these questions (model G, model H, model I). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural {{to think that the}} respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered <b>probit</b> models are derived under this concept.|$|E

He uses Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) {{for this purpose}} and finds that {{physical and mental health}} has significant effect on becoming employed. Male respondents are more likely to change their status from being not-employed to employed, but being insured has a negative effect on switching job status from “not-employed” to “employed” for people aged 60–62 and insignificant effect for 55-59 and aged over 63.|$|E

2500|$|Mixed logit- Allows {{any form}} of {{correlation}} and substitution patterns. When a mixed logit is with jointly normal random terms, the models is sometimes called [...] "multinomial <b>probit</b> model with logit kernel". Can be applied to route choice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantile}} {{function of}} a distribution is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. [...] The quantile function of the standard normal distribution is called the <b>probit</b> function, and can be {{expressed in terms of}} the inverse error function: ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{straightforward}} method {{is based on}} the probability integral transform property: if U is distributed uniformly on (0,1), then Φ−1(U) will have the standard normal distribution. The drawback of this method is that it relies on calculation of the <b>probit</b> function Φ−1, which cannot be done analytically. Some approximate methods are described in [...] and in the erf article. Wichura gives a fast algorithm for computing this function to 16 decimal places, which is used by R to compute random variates of the normal distribution.|$|E
2500|$|In economics, {{discrete}} choice models, or qualitative choice models, describe, explain, {{and predict}} choices between {{two or more}} discrete alternatives, such as entering or not entering the labor market, or choosing between modes of transport. Such choices contrast with standard consumption models in which the quantity of each good consumed {{is assumed to be}} a continuous variable. In the continuous case, calculus methods (e.g. first-order conditions) can be used to determine the optimum amount chosen, and demand can be modeled empirically using regression analysis. On the other hand, discrete choice analysis examines situations in which the potential outcomes are discrete, such that the optimum is not characterized by standard first-order conditions. Thus, instead of examining “how much” as in problems with continuous choice variables, discrete choice analysis examines “which one.” However, discrete choice analysis {{can also be used to}} examine the chosen quantity when only a few distinct quantities must be chosen from, such as the number of vehicles a household chooses to own [...] and the number of minutes of telecommunications service a customer decides to purchase. Techniques such as logistic regression and <b>probit</b> regression can be used for empirical analysis of discrete choice.|$|E
50|$|A <b>probit</b> {{model is}} a popular {{specification}} for an ordinal or a binary response model. As such it treats {{the same set of}} problems as does logistic regression using similar techniques. The <b>probit</b> model, which employs a <b>probit</b> link function, is most often estimated using the standard maximum likelihood procedure, such an estimation being called a <b>probit</b> regression.|$|E
5000|$|Closely {{related to}} the logit {{function}} (and logit model) are the <b>probit</b> function and <b>probit</b> model. The logit and <b>probit</b> are both sigmoid functions with a domain between 0 and 1, which makes them both quantile functions—i.e., inverses of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a probability distribution. In fact, the logit is the quantile function of the logistic distribution, while the <b>probit</b> is the quantile function of the normal distribution. The <b>probit</b> function is denoted , where [...] is the CDF of the normal distribution, as just mentioned: ...|$|E
5000|$|... for Different links g lead to {{proportional}} odds models or ordered <b>probit</b> models,e.g., the [...] family function [...] assigns a <b>probit</b> {{link to the}} cumulativeprobabilities, therefore {{this model}} is also called the cumulative <b>probit</b> model.In general they are called cumulative link models.|$|E

50|$|As {{shown in}} the graph, the logit and <b>probit</b> {{functions}} are extremely similar, particularly when the <b>probit</b> function is scaled so that its slope at y=0 matches {{the slope of the}} logit. As a result, <b>probit</b> models are sometimes used in place of logit models because for certain applications (e.g., in Bayesian statistics) the implementation is easier.|$|E

50|$|In {{statistics}} and econometrics, the multinomial <b>probit</b> {{model is a}} generalization of the <b>probit</b> model used when there are several possible categories that the dependent variable can fall into. As such, it is {{an alternative to the}} multinomial logit model as one method of multiclass classification. It is {{not to be confused with}} the multivariate <b>probit</b> model, which is used to model correlated binary outcomes for more than one independent variable.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, ordered <b>probit</b> is a {{generalization}} of the widely used <b>probit</b> analysis {{to the case}} of more than two outcomes of an ordinal dependent variable (a dependent variable for which the potential values have a natural ordering, as in poor, fair, good, excellent). Similarly, the widely used logit method also has a counterpart ordered logit. Ordered <b>probit,</b> like ordered logit, is a particular method of ordinal regression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Probit</b> models {{offer an}} {{alternative}} to logistic regression for modeling categorical dependent variables. Even though the outcomes tend to be similar, the underlying distributions are different. <b>Probit</b> models are popular in social sciences like economics.|$|E
5000|$|The method {{introduced}} by Bliss was carried forward in <b>Probit</b> Analysis, an important text on toxicological applications by D. J. Finney. Values tabled by Finney {{can be derived}} from probits as defined here by adding a value of 5. This distinction is summarized by Collett (p. 55): [...] "The original definition of a <b>probit</b> 5 added was primarily to avoid having to work with negative probits; ... This definition is still used in some quarters, but in the major statistical software packages for what is referred to as <b>probit</b> analysis, probits are defined without the addition of 5." [...] It should be observed that <b>probit</b> methodology, including numerical optimization for fitting of <b>probit</b> functions, was introduced before widespread availability of electronic computing. When using tables, it was convenient to have probits uniformly positive. Common areas of application do not require positive probits.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistics}} and econometrics, the multivariate <b>probit</b> {{model is a}} generalization of the <b>probit</b> model used to estimate several correlated binary outcomes jointly. For example, if {{it is believed that}} the decisions of sending at least one child to public school and that of voting in favor of a school budget are correlated (both decisions are binary), then the multivariate <b>probit</b> model would be appropriate for jointly predicting these two choices on an individual-specific basis.|$|E
50|$|Discrete choice models {{take many}} forms, including: Binary Logit, Binary <b>Probit,</b> Multinomial Logit, Conditional Logit, Multinomial <b>Probit,</b> Nested Logit, Generalized Extreme Value Models, Mixed Logit, and Exploded Logit. All {{of these models}} have the {{features}} described below in common.|$|E
50|$|Another {{model that}} was {{developed}} to offset the disadvantages of the LPM is the <b>probit</b> model. The <b>probit</b> model uses the same approach to non-linearity as does the logit model; however, it uses the normal CDF instead of the logistic CDF.|$|E
50|$|The <b>probit</b> {{model has}} been around longer than the logit model. They behave similarly, except that the {{logistic}} distribution tends to be slightly flatter tailed. One {{of the reasons the}} logit model was formulated was that the <b>probit</b> model was computationally difficult due to the requirement of numerically calculating integrals. Modern computing however has made this computation fairly simple. The coefficients obtained from the logit and <b>probit</b> model are fairly close. However, the odds ratio is easier to interpret in the logit model.|$|E
