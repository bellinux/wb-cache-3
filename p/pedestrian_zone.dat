25|$|During {{two years}} of construction, the Basilica of the Holy Trinity was {{designated}} GECA, for Grande Espaço Coberto para Assembleias (Great Covered Space for Assemblies), owing to its relative importance. Due to its importance, {{not just for the}} sanctuary, the church and the town, the architects' planners started a dialog with the local authority to study the best urban solution for its location. The area of Avenida D. José A. C. Silva was lowered in front the sanctuary, and a competition introduced into the urban area a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>zone</b> from Rua S. Vicente de Paulo and Avenida João XXIII, transforming this area into a boulevard, reducing transit and providing an artistic touch to the subterranean landscape. These change would result in the transformation of Fátima into a destination for pilgrims.|$|E
