It will often occur in pregnancy even without breast feeding.|$|R
40|$|Ectodermal dysplasia-skin {{fragility}} syndrome (EDSFS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} genodermatosis first described in 1997 by Mc Grath. EDSFS results from loss of function mutations in plakophilin- 1 (PKP 1). PKP 1 is a structural component of desmosomes, cellcell adhesion complexes. It is also found as a nuclear protein in several cell types that are lack of desmosomes. In skin, however, PKP 1 expression is confined mainly to suprabasal keratinocytes and the outer root sheath of hair follicules. Loss of function mutation in PKP 1 leads to extensive skin fragility, bullae and erosions following minor trauma, focal keratoderma with <b>painful</b> <b>fissures,</b> alopecia, and nail dystrophy. In some patients hypohidrosis may also be seen. EDSFS is now considered as a specific suprabasal form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. In this report we describe a 20 year old EDSFS case. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hereditary}} palmoplantar keratodermas are {{a heterogeneous}} group of diseases unified by thickening of the stratum corneum of the palms and soles with consequent <b>painful</b> <b>fissuring,</b> discomfort on pressure, and resultant disability. One of the histologic patterns underlying palmoplantar hyperkeratosis {{is that of}} epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Because that histologic pattern {{has been found in}} its generalized form to be due to keratin gene mutations, we assessed the inheritance of the form localized to the palms and soles. In each of two families studied, the mutant gene causing the disease is linked strongly to the chromosome 17 cluster of genes encoding type I keratins, and mutations are present in the conserved helix initiation region of keratin 9 in affected members of both kindreds. These data, as well as those generated recently by others, indicate that keratin gene mutations may underlie not only the generalized phenotype but also this more localized phenotype of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and suggest one mechanism by which skin diseases can achieve their characteristic localization...|$|R
40|$|Women with lichen sclerosus (LS) may {{experience}} (superficial) dyspareunia or {{the inability to}} have vaginal intercourse due to <b>painful</b> <b>fissures</b> and narrowing of the vaginal introitus. A surgical procedure {{may contribute to the}} relief of these sexual pain problems. It is unknown what motives women have to undergo surgery in order to regain the ability to have sexual intercourse. Such knowledge can offer important insights that are indispensable when discussing the option of vulvar surgery with patients with LS and might prevent potential patient dissatisfaction. This study's purpose is to examine why women with LS decide to undergo vulvar surgery in order to restore intercourse. Nineteen women with anogenital LS participated in audiotaped qualitative individual interviews, in which their motives for undergoing vulvar surgery to restore intercourse were explored retrospectively. Interview data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Three main motives for wanting to undergo surgery in order to restore intercourse were found. These were the desire to be a "normal" woman, the desire to sexually satisfy the male partner, and the desire to regain the experience of intimacy and sexual enjoyment. Another reason for surgery was to reduce daily life LS symptoms. The sexual pain complaints prevented the women from living up to their norms about heterosexuality and gender roles. Being unable to have intercourse led women to feel inadequate as a woman and as a sexual partner. Women with LS may opt for surgery to restore their identity as a "normal" woman and sexual partner, to regain the experience of coital intimacy, and to be less bothered by LS symptoms in daily life. The present findings point to the importance of a thorough couple-based sexual history in which women's motives for and expectations of vulvar surgery will be explored in order to facilitate a good decision and to increase treatment satisfactio...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of the {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) {{represents one of the}} most important avenues of research and development in cancer therapy. The cutaneous toxicity [papularâ€“pustular eruption (PPE), seborrheic dermatitis-like erythema, diffuse xerosis, inflammatory paronychia, <b>painful</b> <b>fissures</b> on fingers, hair changes] frequently described with EGFR inhibitors (EGFRI) can result in significant physical discomfort and often lead to interruption or dose modification of EGFRI. Therefore, appropriate management of skin toxicity is mandatory to allow adequate drug administration and to improve health-related quality of life and therapy outcomes. Although the mechanism by which inhibition of EGFR leads to skin toxicity is still largely unknown, EGFR is primarily expressed in undifferentiated proliferating basal and suprabasal keratinocytes both in the epidermis and in the outer layers of hair follicle [1]. The activation of EGFR by its ligand EGF regulates normal keratinocytes proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival in the skin [1]. Tan et al. [2] demonstrated that MAPK activity shows a trend in association with skin toxicity after tyrosine kinase inhibitors administration and they concluded that by giving an inhibitor of MAPK phosphorylation to patients undergoing treatment with EGFR inhibitors, clinicians could control the skin toxicity. It has recently been demonstrated that topical application of green tea polyphenols in rats prevents the UVB-induced oxidative phosphorylation of MAPK [3] and nicotinamide also inhibits the MAPK pathways in cell cultures and in rats [4, 5]. Starting from these data, we report our experience in the management of EGFR skin toxicity using a new therapeutic approach, based on the use of a combined therapy: topical application of a moisturizer cream containing green tea polyphenols twice a day and oral administration of nicotinamide (1 g/die) for 12 weeks. The moisturizer cream containing green tea was applied on face, hands, neck, back, shoulders, arms, and legs, starting when skin toxicity occurred. Topical application of 1...|$|R
40|$|Lichen sclerosus (LS) of the vulva can profoundly affect sexual {{interaction}} {{because of}} <b>painful</b> <b>fissures</b> and narrowing of the vaginal introitus. Successful surgical treatment is usually defined as restoration of (pain-free) penetrative sexual activity. To evaluate {{the impact of}} surgery on (dyadic) sexual functioning and pleasure and psychological well-being. Nineteen women with anogenital LS participated in audiotaped, qualitative, individual interviews after surgery to re-enable sexual intercourse. Physical, sexual, and psychological experiences were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Vulvar surgery resulted in a decrease of sexual pain in 13 of 19 patients (68 %). Of these 13 patients, 4 were completely free of pain and the other 9 patients expressed a shift from preoperative sexual pain to postoperative sexual discomfort. These women reported improved sexual functioning, increased sexual activity and intimacy with the partner, and reinstated feelings of being an adequate woman and sexual partner. In 1 of the 19 patients (5 %), surgery {{did not result in}} decreased sexual pain, yet she continued to have intercourse. Five of the 19 patients (26 %) stopped having intercourse because of pain; one woman had secondary vaginismus and another woman, in retrospect, had premorbid generalized unprovoked vulvodynia. Four of these women were unable to communicate with their partner about sexual matters and to change their sexual repertoire (satisfactorily) once they had ceased intercourse (attempts). Eighteen women (95 %) reported a decrease of LS symptoms in daily life. Vulvar surgery seems an effective treatment for most women with LS who experience sexual pain owing to anatomic or epithelial changes and who wish to resume intercourse. To assess whether women might benefit from such surgery and/or whether (additional) sexual counseling is indicated, preoperative sexological couple-based consultation is needed. This consultation should exclude comorbid vaginismus and generalized unprovoked vulvodynia and index the couple's pre-existing sex life, including sexual communication skills, and the ability to incorporate non-coital pain-free sexual activitie...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Chronic {{anal fissure}} is a benign {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} considerable discomfort. Surgical treatment in the form of lateral sphincterotomy has long been regarded as the gold standard of treatment. This study compared the open and closed techniques of lateral sphincterotomy in terms of their postoperative outcomes. Methods: A prospective, randomized comparative study was conducted between October 2010 and August 2012. A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to each of two groups. Patients were followed up postoperatively for more than 1 year to assess any complications. The outcomes were compared among the two groups using the Chi-square test and Student t test. Results: The mean age at presentation was 40. 13 years. The male to female ratio was 1. 47 : 1. The typical presentation was <b>painful</b> defecation. <b>Fissures</b> were most often located in the posterior midline and associated with a sentinel pile. Delayed postoperative healing was found in 4. 4 % of the group of patients undergoing open lateral sphincterotomy. The mean pain score and duration of hospital stay were lower with the closed technique. Conclusion: Closed lateral internal sphincterotomy is the treatment of choice for chronic fissures as it is effective, safe, less expensive, and associated with a lower rate of complications than the open sphincterotomy technique...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Painful</b> nipple <b>fissure</b> is a {{troublesome}} {{problem for}} breastfeeding mothers. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effect of saqez (Pistacia atlantica) ointment on the improvement of nipple fissure in breastfeeding women during one-month follow-up. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 100 eligible women who visited the selected health centers affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from July 2015 to December 2015 during their postpartum period. A total of 100 subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups of 50 women grouped as saqez ointment group and breast milk group, and followed-up for one month. Both groups received face-to-face instructions on breastfeeding techniques. Â  For severity of nipple fissure, Storr scale and to measure the intensity of pain, visual analog scale (VAS) were used. Results: The results showed that the two groups were matched in terms of demographic and obstetric characteristics. Mean of nipple fissure severity in ointment group (42. 62) was lower than that of the control group (48. 02), that was significantly different between the two groups (p= 0. 047). In addition, Mean nipple pain intensity in ointment group (40. 57) was lower than that of the control group (49. 81), but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups (p= 0. 056). Conclusion: The present study showed that saqez ointment was more effective than breast milk in healing and controlling nipple fissures during one-month follow-up, without resulting in any side effects...|$|R
40|$|Topical tissue {{adhesives}} {{have been}} used widely in healthcare for the closure of wounds and lacerations (Beam 2008). A recent Cochrane review (Coulthard et al 2009) has indicated the benefit of this modality over other more traditional types of closure. However, little investigation has been undertaken into the potential applications of tissue adhesives in podiatry, such as closure of dry heel fissures which often cause pain and offer a challenge for podiatrists to manage effectively (Singh 1996). A case series is presented reporting {{the use of a}} glue in the management of dry heel fissures. A review of 18 patients treated with Octyl-Blend 10 â„¢ tissue adhesive (MedLogic Global LtdÂ®, Plymouth, UK) was undertaken across four private practices in Hampshire. Each patient underwent administration of tissue adhesive by the podiatrist and was followed up for a minimum of three weeks. Outcomes were measured using a patient/practitioner evaluation and feedback form and digital photographs of the lesions before, during, immediately after and three weeks post treatment. Overall the response was positive from patients and practitioners alike with regard to ease of application, aesthetics and patient comfort. During the study period, 94 % (17 patients) of lesions healed with no adverse events. Instant and lasting pain relief following application was reported by the majority of patients. Dehiscence of the fissure occurred in only 1 subject. This exploratory work suggests that cyanoacrylates, and the Octyl-Blend 10 â„¢ tissue adhesive in particular, may have a place in the management of <b>painful</b> heel <b>fissures.</b> <br/...|$|R
