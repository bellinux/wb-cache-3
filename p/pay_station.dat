2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to <b>pay</b> <b>station</b> costs, proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{the city}} of Portland Oregon {{utilizes}} <b>pay</b> <b>stations</b> to manage their street parking infrastructure. The <b>pay</b> <b>stations</b> allow car owners {{to pay for a}} designated public parking spot for {{a certain amount of time}} through the use of a variety of payment methods. While functionally these <b>pay</b> <b>stations</b> suffice the requirements, we believe there is another economical way to maintain this parking infrastructure. Their current design requires a lot of hardware and maintenance which greatly increases the operational cost. Because of the requirements on having hardware on every street, this requires a lot of overhead and maintenance. We will illustrate another functional model and show the economical analysis between the two models to allow decision makers to better evaluate alternatives of these two parking models. This alternative functional model has been deployed in other cities that remove the need for physical hardware on the streets and thus reducing the operational cost. We believe, once compared in our economic analysis, will give {{the city of}} Portland a footprint in which to review their parking infrastructure design...|$|R
