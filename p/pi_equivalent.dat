In previous papers we discussed some sharp differences between these two cases for the characteristic, and we showed that the so-called Tensor Product Theorem is in part no longer valid in the second case. In this paper we study the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of the relatively free algebras of verbally prime and related algebras. We compute the GK dimensions of several algebras and thus obtain a new proof {{of the fact that the}} algebras M 1, 1 (E) and E⊗E are not <b>PI</b> <b>equivalent</b> in characteristic p> 2.

For some “small” algebras we can remove the restriction on the characteristic of the base field, and we show that the behaviour of the corresponding graded tensor products is quite similar to that for the usual (ungraded) tensor products. Finally we consider β-graded tensor products (also called commutation factors) and their identities.

The large amount of magnetometer data allowed us to trace {{evolution of the}} PI and MI equivalent currents. The PI current pair formed equatorward and sunward of the preexisting DP- 2 currents, and in event 1 with a southward IMF, it propagated antisunward over a 3 -h MLT distance across the dawn–dusk meridian. An MI current pair also formed {{at about the same}} location at which the PI currents initiated, propagated antisunward, and then became the post-SC DP- 2 currents. The overall current pattern is consistent with the model by Araki (1994), and the coexisting current patterns of the PI and MI as well as their antisunward propagation are quite analogous to results from MHD simulations (e.g., Fujita et al. 2003; Samsonov et al. 2010).

In order to realise the benefits of hybrid fuel cell power systems, an energy management strategy is essential for distributing the required power properly between the fuel cell and the energy storage system. For a hybrid fuel cell/battery passenger vessel, an improvement to the classical proportional-integral (PI) controller based energy management strategy is presented. This takes fuel cell efficiency into consideration as an input to maintain higher efficiency of fuel cell and reduce stresses on it and hence reduce its fuel consumption. A 25. 5 m long passenger vessel is used and its propulsion system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink environment using the SimPowerSystems toolbox. The performance of the proposed PI energy management strategy is compared to original <b>PI,</b> <b>equivalent</b> fuel consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), and state-based energy management strategies in terms of consumed energy, battery state of charge, fuel cell efficiency, hydrogen consumption, and the stresses seen by each power source of the hybrid system taking into consideration a daily operation of 8 hours.

But {{the rise in}} the non-oil fiscal deficit in 2007 - 08 and, more importantly, the massive impact of the global crisis in late 2008 and 2009 have dramatically altered Russia's medium-term and long-term economic and fiscal outlook. While Russia is emerging from this crisis on a much stronger footing than during the 1998 - 09 crisis thanks to its strong-pre crisis fundamentals, large fiscal reserves and solid management of the crisis, it will nevertheless need to implement sustained fiscal adjustment in the coming years. Both revenue and expenditure measures will be needed. This will require 2 - 3 percentage points of GDP in fiscal adjustment for about five years in addition to keeping total expenditure levels at a relatively low 31. 5 percent of GDP, consistent with long-term social expenditure needs and requirements of long-term fiscal sustainability. Following a period of adjustment, if Russia would restrain its long-term non-oil deficits to the permanent income (<b>PI)</b> <b>equivalent</b> of its oil revenues as proposed in this paper, its fiscal policy will return to long-term sustainable path. The long-term, sustainable level of non-oil fiscal deficit is estimated at about 4. 3 percent of GDP.

Here K is the free associative algebra of infinite rank, with free generators T, E denotes the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra over K, M_n(K) and M_n(E) are the n× n matrices over K and over E, respectively. The algebras M_ab(E) are subalgebras of M_a+b(E), see their definition below. The generic (also called relatively free) algebras of these algebras have been studied extensively. Procesi described the generic algebra of M_n(K) and lots of its properties. Models for the generic algebras of M_n(E) and M_ab(E) are also known but their structure remains quite unclear. In this paper we study the generic algebra of M_ 11 (E) in two generators, over a field of characteristic 0.

The main motivation comes from wireless data networks where the service rate of each user varies randomly due to fading.

When the objective is to minimize the mean number of users in the system or to minimize the mean waiting time, we obtain a prioritybased policy which we call the “Potential Improvement ” (PI) rule, since the priority index equals to the ratio between the current available service rate and the expected potential improvement of the service rate. We also show that for certain objective functions, the index rule takes the form of known opportunistic scheduling rules like “Relatively Best ” (RB) or “Proportionally Best ” (PB). Thus our model provides a formal justification for the deployment of opportunistic scheduling rules in order to improve the flow-level performance in the presence of time varying capacities.

To assess the relative contributions of the lipid headgroups {{as well as those of}} the ceramide and diacylglycerol hydrocarbon regions, we synthesized various GalCer and SM species with identical, homogeneous acyl residues and compared their behavior to that of PCs possessing similar hydrocarbon structures. For PCs, this meant that the sn- 1 acyl chain was long and saturated (e. g., palmitate) and the sn- 2 chain composition was varied to match that of GalCer or SM. When at <b>equivalent</b> <b>pi</b> and in either the chain-disordered (liquid-expanded) or chain-ordered (liquid-condensed) state, GalCer films were less elastic than either SM or PC films. When lipid headgroups were identical (SM and PC), Cs- 1 values (at <b>equivalent</b> <b>pi)</b> for chain-disordered SMs, but not chain-ordered SMs, were 25 - 30 % higher than those of PCs. Typical values for fluid phase (liquid-expanded) GalCer at 30 mN/m and 24 degrees C were 158 (+/- 7) mN/m, whereas those of SM were 135 (+/- 7) mN/m and those of PC were 123 (+/- 2) mN/m. Pressure-induced transitions to chain-ordered states (liquid-condensed) resulted in significant increases (two- to fourfold) in the "in-plane" compressibility for all three lipid types. Typical Cs- 1 values for chain-ordered GalCers at 30 mN/m and 24 degrees C were between 610 and 650 mN/m, whereas those of SM and of PC were very similar and were between 265 and 300 mN/m. Under fluid phase conditions, the pi-Cs- 1 behavior for each lipid type was insensitive to whether the acyl chain was saturated or monounsaturated. Measurement of the Cs- 1 values also provided an effective way to evaluate the two-dimensional phase transition region of SMs, GalCers, and PCs. Modest heterogeneity in the acyl composition led to transitional broadening. Our findings provide useful information regarding the in-plane elasticity of lipids that are difficult to investigate by alternative methods, i. e., micropipette aspiration technique. The results also provide insight into the stability of sphingolipid-enriched, membrane microdomains that are thought to play a role in the sorting and trafficking of proteins containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors with cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{reactor vessel}} level {{monitoring}} system measures {{the water level}} in a reactor during normal operation and abnormal conditions. A drop in the water level can expose nuclear fuel, which may lead to fuel meltdown and radiation spread in accident conditions. A level monitoring system mainly consists of a sensing line and pressure transmitter. Over {{a period of time}} boron sediments or other impurities can clog the line which may degrade the accuracy of the monitoring system. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine blockage in a sensing line using the energy of the composite signal. An <b>equivalent</b> <b>Pi</b> circuit model is used to simulate blockages in the sensing line and the system's response is examined under different blockage levels. Composite signals obtained from the model and plant's unblocked and blocked channels are decomposed into six levels of details and approximations using a wavelet filter bank. The percentage of energy is calculated at each level for approximations. It is observed that the percentage of energy reduces as the blockage level in the sensing line increases. The results of the model and operational data are well correlated. Thus, in our opinion variation in the energy levels of approximations can be used as an index to determine the presence and degree of blockage in a sensing line...|$|R
