5|$|Ashburton Playing Fields {{are just}} off Shirley Road, behind the school. The fields were first {{dedicated}} {{as a public}} horse racing course by James I in the early 17th century. Following {{the opening of the}} nearby Woodside railway station in 1871 large numbers of Londoners began travelling to the racecourse. Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to <b>public</b> <b>use</b> as playing fields.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all <b>public</b> <b>use</b> from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Marble Hill House on {{the north}} bank of the Thames and the {{surrounding}} park were purchased for <b>public</b> <b>use</b> and in 1902 the footpath on the southern bank near Ham House became a public right of way by Act of Parliament resulting in increased passenger traffic in the area. In 1908 local resident Walter Hammerton began hiring out boats to leisure users from a boathouse opposite Marble Hill House, and in 1909 began to operate a regular ferry service across the river at this point using a 12-passenger clinker-built skiff, charging 1d per journey.|$|E

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for <b>public</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the uprising, Poland {{repressed}} Lithuanian {{cultural life}} in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to Lithuanians, the repressions {{were even more}} far-reaching, including a ban on <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian Łossowski notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support.|$|E

5|$|Concerned by {{the effects}} of {{commercial}} interests, prominent citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated for protection of the area. A park bill was prepared {{with the assistance of}} the General Land Office in the Interior Department. The bill passed both houses of the 38th United States Congress, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and <b>public</b> <b>use</b> by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone as the first national park. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed <b>public</b> <b>use</b> {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned most, if not all, movie theaters in cities {{throughout}} the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 {{with the arrival of}} the three Wong brothers from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s. These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined inter-ethnic relations as a main theme. The later ban on the <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of Chinese language meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with subtitles in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because of an agreement between importers and the film censor board.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free <b>public</b> <b>use,</b> it was suggested that the Board should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London. Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich, but the latter plan was abandoned. In 1884 the Board agreed to provide two steam-powered ferries, each costing £10,650, and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction. In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at £54,900 to build approaches, bridges and pontoons.|$|E

Property could not be taken for <b>public</b> <b>use</b> without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives.

5|$|In 1952, Chotiner {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both major party primaries, virtually assuring his re-election. The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the file in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E

A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land {{should be used for}} a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for <b>public</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, <b>public</b> <b>use</b> of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary <b>public</b> <b>use</b> airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
