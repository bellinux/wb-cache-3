500|$|Halkett {{designed}} a waterproof cloak made {{from an early}} form of Macintosh cloth, cotton impregnated with India rubber by using naphtha as a solvent. The lining of the cloak contained an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid, split into four separate airtight compartments in case of puncture, and a pocket containing a <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> and a small bellows. The wearer of the cloak would carry a walking stick, which would double as the shaft of the paddle, and a large umbrella {{to serve as a}} sail. The cloak weighed around [...] in total, and took three to four minutes to inflate; once inflated, it could support the weight of six to eight people.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the new Curtiss <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> {{propeller}} significantly increased climb rate at lower altitudes, and {{came as a surprise}} to German pilots who had resorted to steep climbs to evade pursuit by the P-47. Other positive attributes included the P-47's ruggedness; it could sustain a large amount of damage and still be able to get its pilot back to base. With eight [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns, the P-47 carried more firepower than other single-engined American fighters. P-47 pilots claimed 20 Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters and four Arado Ar 234 jet bombers in aerial combat.|$|E
2500|$|The P-47's initial {{success in}} combat was {{primarily}} due to tactics, using rolls (the P-47 had an excellent roll rate) and energy-saving dive and zoom climbs from high altitude to outmaneuver German fighters. Both the Bf 109 and Fw 190 could, like the Spitfire, out-turn and out-climb the early model P-47s at low-to-medium altitude. Once <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> propellers {{were added to the}} P-47 in early 1944, climb performance improved significantly. The Thunderbolt was the fastest-diving American aircraft of the war—it could reach speeds of 550mph (480kn, 885km/h). Some P-47 pilots claimed to have broken the sound barrier, but later research revealed that because of the pressure buildup inside the pitot tube at high speeds, airspeed readings became unpredictably exaggerated. But German pilots gradually learned to avoid diving away from a Thunderbolt. Kurt Bühligen, a high-scoring German fighter ace with 112 victories, recalled: ...|$|E
50|$|Because normal {{paddling}} involves alternately dipping {{and raising}} the <b>paddle</b> <b>blades,</b> the colour of the blades may affect the visibility of the kayaker to powerboats operators under limited visibility conditions. For this reason white or yellow blades may offer a safety advantage over black or blue blades. Of course, kayakers should wear a headlamp or have other lighting on their kayak under conditions of limited lighting. However, if a powerboat operator must look straight into a sun {{low in the sky}} to see a kayaker, the motion of brightly coloured <b>paddle</b> <b>blades</b> may be of more value than lighting on the kayak. Highly reflective water resistant tape (e.g. SOLAS tape) may be affixed to the <b>paddle</b> <b>blades</b> and boat to enhance visibility.|$|R

60|$|He stopped {{paddling}} {{the moment}} that he descried the gleaming beacon of hope ahead of him.

2500|$|The P-47 {{first saw}} action with the 4th Fighter Group. The Group's pilots were mainly {{drawn from the}} three British Eagle Squadrons who had {{previously}} flown the British Supermarine Spitfire Mark V, a much smaller and much more slender aircraft. At first they viewed their new fighter with misgivings. It was huge; the British pilots joked that a Thunderbolt pilot could defend himself from a Luftwaffe fighter by running around and hiding in the fuselage. Optimized for high altitude work, the Thunderbolt had [...] more wingspan, a quarter more wing area, about four times the fuselage volume, and nearly twice {{the weight of a}} Spitfire V. One Thunderbolt pilot compared it to flying a bathtub around the sky. When his unit (4th Fighter Group) was equipped with Thunderbolts, ace Don Blakeslee said, referring to the P-47's vaunted ability to dive on its prey, [...] "It {{ought to be able to}} dive. It certainly can't climb." [...] (Blakeslee's early-model P-47C had not been fitted with the new <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> propeller). The 4th Fighter Group's commander hated the P-47, and his prejudices filtered down to the group's pilots; the 4th had the fewest kills of any of the first three P-47 squadrons in Europe.|$|E
60|$|A half-hour passes; {{but not for}} {{an instant}} does the {{listening}} tension of the lake relax. Then the loud bellow rings out again, startling us and the echoes, though we were listening for it. This time the tension increases an hundredfold; every nerve is strained; every muscle ready. Hardly have the echoes been lost when from far up the ridges comes a deep, sudden, ugly roar that penetrates the woods like a rifle-shot. Again it comes, and nearer! Down in the canoe a <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> touches the water noiselessly from the stern; and over the bow there is the glint of moonlight on a rifle barrel. The roar is now continuous on {{the summit of the}} last low ridge. Twigs crackle, and branches snap. There is the thrashing of mighty antlers among the underbrush, the pounding of heavy hoofs upon the earth; and straight down the great bull rushes like a tempest, nearer, nearer, till he bursts with tremendous crash through the last fringe of alders out onto the grassy point.--And then the heavy boom of a rifle rolling across the startled lake.|$|E
50|$|Some {{techniques}} are rarely used by modern paddlers. The Pawlata roll is performed while gripping {{the far end}} of one <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> and sweeping the other from front to back. The Steyr roll is a reverse Pawlata. In the put across roll, one <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> is gripped {{while the rest of the}} paddle extends out at right angles to the kayak; the paddler pulls down on the paddle to right the kayak without any sweeping action. The storm roll utilises a vertical rather than horizontal sweeping action.|$|E
60|$|Never {{before had}} I seen the deep foliage of {{woodlands}} navigated by canoes. But on they came sailing through the leaves; two abreast; borne on men's shoulders; in each a chief, carried {{along to the}} measured march of his bearers; <b>paddle</b> <b>blades</b> reversed under arms. As they emerged, the multitude made gestures of homage. At the distance of some eight or ten paces the procession halted; when the kings alighted to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal Mixer - Consisting of <b>paddles</b> or <b>blades</b> {{attached}} to a horizontal rotor, these mixers usually have a higher consistent homogeneity and short mixing times.|$|R
2500|$|Relatively narrow blades {{which are}} rounded and full near the loom and blade roots, and {{becoming}} oval near the <b>blade</b> tips. Some <b>paddles</b> feature a [...] "shoulder", or abrupt transition between the loom and <b>blade</b> roots. Greenland <b>paddle</b> <b>blades</b> are usually never feathered. Short Greenland paddles (generally one arm-span in length), called storm paddles, are {{used with a}} sliding stroke, where the hands are shifted along the blades for each stroke.

50|$|The pistol flip {{is like a}} back panam {{combined}} with a McNasty with the difference being the boat comes right over the kayakers head, much like a Pan-Am. It is often initiated with a bounce to rotate the boat over the head, with the front to back axis only being rotated when the kayaker is upside down, where they engage one <b>paddle</b> <b>blade</b> and use {{the stern of the}} boat to right themselves.|$|E

60|$|They kept it up {{for several}} hours, and then, toward evening, the rain ceased and the clouds rolled aside. A {{wonderful}} yellow light shone behind the bordering hills, and the twisted, wind-battered cedars on their crests stood out against it in hard, fretted tracery. The wind dropped; the short, white waves smoothed down; the water, heaving gently, gleamed with a coppery glare, and the <b>paddle</b> <b>blades</b> seemed to splash up liquid fire.

50|$|A {{double pump}} {{is the basic}} move to sink, or initiate, {{one end of the}} boat. The boater begins by {{simultaneously}} putting the boat on edge, making a quick forward power stroke, and leaning backwards. Immediately after this stroke, the boater leans forward, switches the blade from a forward to a back stroke at the stern and pushes down hard using the core muscles on the same <b>paddle</b> <b>blade.</b> The boat should now be perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} water, with the bow down in the water and the stern up toward the sky.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the epitome}} of fowling was the punt gunner. He had what {{amounted}} to a long, small-bore muzzle-loaded cannon. It was mounted along the centre-line of the forward half of a specially designed boat which slightly resembled a heavy wooden kayak in form.

The skill was to stalk a raft of duck until within the rather short range required and to fire the gun from which small shot scattered. It remained to gather up the harvest and get it to market.

5000|$|Born 19 February 1900 in Vienna, Pawlata had {{a passion}} for {{paddling}} the faltbooten or folding kayaks that were popular in Europe after World War I. He studied written accounts of the kayaks and skills of the Greenland Inuit people, especially the work of Knud Rasmussen, Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen. From his research, he designed a folding kayak which he believed was [...] "purebred" [...] and more faithful to the original Arctic boats. The 4.9 metre long kayak was built for him by the firm of Otto Hartel in Graz, and he called it [...] "Aijuk". On 30 July 1927, on the Weissensee, he publicly demonstrated his ability to capsize his kayak and right it again without leaving the cockpit. The method he devised, which involved gripping {{the far end of}} the <b>paddle</b> <b>blade,</b> is now known as the Pawlata roll and is still used as a training or sea kayaking technique.

5000|$|Kayak <b>paddles</b> having <b>blades</b> in {{the same}} plane (when viewed down the shaft) are called [...] "un-feathered." [...] <b>Paddles</b> with <b>blades</b> in {{different}} planes (such as in the image) are called [...] "feathered".

Many modern paddles are made of two pieces which can be snapped together in either feathered or unfeathered settings. The shaft is normally straight {{but in some cases}} a 'crank' is added with the aim of making the paddle more comfortable and reducing the strain on the wrist. Because the kayak paddle is not supported by the boat, paddles made of lighter materials are desired; {{it is not uncommon for}} a kayak paddle to be two pounds (32 oz [...] ) or less and very expensive paddles can be as light as 22 oz.
