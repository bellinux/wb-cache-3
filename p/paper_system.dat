The regent was excessively annoyed by the difficulties they conjured up {{in the way of his}} darling schemes of finance, and the countenance they gave to the opposition of parliament; which body, disgusted more and more with the abuses of the regency, and the system of Law, had gone so far as to carry its remonstrances to the very foot of the throne.|$|E

6000|$|Hitherto all {{had gone}} well, and all might have {{continued}} to go well, had not the <b>paper</b> <b>system</b> been further expanded. But Law had yet the grandest part of his scheme to develop. He had to open his ideal world of speculation, his El Dorado of unbounded wealth. The English had brought the vast imaginary commerce of the South Seas in aid of their banking operations. Law sought to bring, as an immense auxiliary of his bank, the whole trade of the Mississippi. Under this name was included not merely the river so called, but the vast region known as Louisiana, extending from north latitude 29° up to Canada in north latitude 40°. This country had been granted by Louis XIV. to the Sieur Crozat, {{but he had been}} induced to resign his patent. In conformity to the plea of Mr. Law, letters patent were granted in August, 1717, {{for the creation of a}} commercial company, which was to have the colonizing of this country, and the monopoly of its trade and resources, and of the beaver or fur trade with Canada. It was called the Western, but became better known as the Mississippi Company. The capital was fixed at one hundred millions of livres, divided into shares, bearing an Interest of four per cent, which were subscribed for in the public securities. As the bank was to co-operate with the company, the regent ordered that its bills should be received the same as coin, in all payments of the public revenue. Law was appointed chief director of this company, which was an exact copy of the Earl of Oxford's South Sea Company, set on foot in 1711, and which distracted all England with the frenzy of speculation. In like manner with the delusive picturings given in that memorable scheme of the sources of rich trade to be opened in the South Sea countries, Law held forth magnificent prospects of the fortunes to be made in colonizing Louisiana, which was represented as a veritable land of promise, capable of yielding every variety of the most precious produce. Reports, too, were artfully circulated, with great mystery, as if to the [...] "chosen few," [...] of mines of gold and silver recently discovered in Louisiana, and which would insure instant wealth to the early purchasers. These confidential whispers of course soon became public; and were confirmed by travelers fresh from the Mississippi, and doubtless bribed, who had seen the mines in question, and declared them superior in richness to those of Mexico and Peru. Nay, more, ocular proof was furnished to public credulity, in ingots of gold conveyed to the mint, as if just brought from the mines of Louisiana.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Computerised {{record keeping}} {{in primary care}} is increasing. However, no study has {{systematically}} examined the completeness of computer records in practices using different forms of record keeping. AIM: To compare computer-only record keeping to paper-only and hybrid systems, by measuring the number of consultations and symptoms recorded within individual consultations. DESIGN OF STUDY: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eighteen general practices in the Exeter Primary Care Trust. METHOD: This study {{was part of a}} retrospective case control study of cancer patients aged over 40 years. All recorded consultations for a 2 -year period were identified and coded for 1396 patients. Records were classified as paper, computer, or hybrid, depending on which medium stored the clinical information from consultations. RESULTS: More consultations were recorded in hybrid systems (median in 2 years = 11, interquartile range [IQR] = 6 - 18) than computer systems (median in 2 years = 9, IQR = 4 - 16. 5) or <b>paper</b> <b>systems</b> (median in 2 years = 8, IQR = 5 - 14,) : P < 0. 001. In a Poisson regression analysis, which included age, sex, and future cancer diagnosis, the rates of consultations recorded in <b>paper</b> and computer <b>systems</b> were 16 % and 11 % lower, respectively, than in hybrid systems. Fewer telephone consultations were recorded in <b>paper</b> <b>systems,</b> and fewer home visits in computer systems. Fewer symptoms were recorded in individual consultations on computer systems. Recording of absent symptoms and severity of symptoms was highest in <b>paper</b> <b>systems.</b> CONCLUSION: Hybrid systems of primary care record keeping document higher numbers of consultations than computer-only or paper-only systems. The quality of individual consultation recording is highest in paper-only systems. This has medicolegal implications and may impact upon continuity of care...|$|R
