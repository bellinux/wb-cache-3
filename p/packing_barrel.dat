50|$|From {{the late}} 18th century until the mid-19th century, Allonby {{was home to}} a small fishing fleet. The main catch was herring. Fish yards were built where these were salted and <b>packed</b> in <b>barrels</b> made on the premises. There was also a smoke house where kippers were produced.|$|R

5000|$|During the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983-2009), barrel {{bombs were}} used by {{government}} forces. William Dalrymple reported that the Sri Lanka Air Force, lacking modern bombers, used Chinese Y-12 transport planes to drop improvised 300 kg bombs <b>packed</b> into wooden <b>barrels</b> onto civilian areas in the northern peninsula of Jaffna. A 1990 newspaper reported that [...] "barrel bombs - 210 litre cast iron <b>barrels</b> <b>packed</b> with explosives, rubber and saw dust" [...] were used against residential areas knocking out 20 houses {{at a time in}} the Jaffna region.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Magpul Masada's design {{represented a}} combination of several recent rifle designs, incorporating what was considered by its designers {{to be the best}} features of each in a single, lightweight, modular rifle. Design features from the Armalite AR-18 (short-stroke gas system), the FN SCAR (upper receiver, charging handle location), the Heckler & Koch G36 and XM8 (liberal use of polymer components), and the M16/AR-15 (trigger <b>pack,</b> <b>barrel,</b> fire control group) were present. The rifle also included several features developed by Magpul, such as a quick-change barrel/trunnion system, adjustable gas regulator, non-reciprocating charging handle, and storage compartments located in the stock and grip. Just prior to the deal with Bushmaster, Magpul made additional changes to their design, the most obvious of these was the relocation of the ambidextrous operating handle to a forward position (somewhat similar to the Heckler & Koch G3 and Heckler & Koch MP5 series of weapons). The weapon's caliber could easily be changed by replacing the bolt head, magazine, and barrel.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} Ireland {{produced}} {{large quantities of}} salted (corned) beef, {{almost all of it}} for export. This beef was <b>packed</b> into <b>barrels</b> to provide supplies to the British Navy, army and merchant fleet. Corned beef became associated with the Irish in America where it was plentiful and used as a replacement for the bacon in bacon and cabbage. However, it was not traditional fare in Ireland.|$|R

40|$|Japanese {{abandoned}} {{chemical weapons}} (JACWs) are a momentous and eventful historical issue for both China and Japan. Large quantities {{of chemical weapons}} abandoned by the Japanese invaders still remain on Chinese soil after 1945 when Japanese invaders were defeated and surrendered. Up to date, JACWs {{have been found in}} 19 provinces (cities or districts) of mainland China. The types of JACWs include chemical bombs, chemical aerial bombs, gas cylinders and loose <b>packed</b> <b>barrels.</b> The types of toxic agents include mustard gas, irritant agents, choking agents, systemic poisoning agents and etc. In order to eliminate JACWs to reduce injuries produced by toxic agents, Chinese government, in cooperation with Japanese government, organized a special troop to search, excavate, retrieve, and destroy JACWs. Up to date, about 50, 000 pieces of poisonous chemical had retrieved and destroyed. The first operation was officially begun in Nanjing in October 2010. The main points of medical support on the operation of destroying JACWs include proper treatment of the newly discovered patients caused by JACWs, preparedness for handling the emergency medical rescue, and to actively provide routine medical support for JACWs operation field...|$|R
50|$|In 1985 {{parts of}} the hamlet were {{designated}} an historic district and listed with the National Register of Historic Places as the Pultneyville Historic District. The honor recognizes the community's architectural significance, particularly {{in the areas of}} Federal, Second Empire, and Greek Revival styles. Additionally, Gates Hall, a structure built in 1825 as a multi-denominational church, is still in use as a performance theater and meeting hall. It, too, is listed with the National Register of Historic Places (2000) in recognition of its contributions in the areas of architecture (Queen Anne and Greek Revival), social history, and performing arts. During the second quarter of the nineteenth century lectures on the evils of alcohol and slavery, the merits of women's suffrage, phrenology and spiritualism were held in the church. During the Civil War the church was used for <b>packing</b> <b>barrels</b> of supplies for Union Army soldiers. In 1867, the Pultneyville Lyceum began performing improvised stage productions with gasoline lamps serving as spotlights. Contemporary community theater organizations have continuously staged productions in the building since 1961. As a result, the Library of Congress found Gates Hall to be the second-oldest little theater in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Antelope, buckskin, lambskin, {{sheepskin}} and cowhide are the hides {{most commonly}} used to make leather jackets. As soon as the skin {{is removed from the}} animal at the meat processing plant, it is refrigerated, salted, or <b>packed</b> in <b>barrels</b> of brine. It is then sent to the tannery where the skins undergo a series of processes designed to preserve and soften the hides. Sewing materials such as thread, lining, seam tape, buttons, snaps and zippers are generally bought from outside vendors and stored in the garment factory.|$|R
2500|$|Some pioneers took {{eggs and}} butter <b>packed</b> in <b>barrels</b> of flour, and some took dairy cows along the trail. Hunting {{provided}} {{another source of}} food along the trail; pioneers hunted American bison as well as pronghorn antelope, deer, bighorn sheep, and wildfowl. From rivers and lakes, emigrants also fished for catfish and trout. When emigrants faced starvation, they would sometimes slaughter their animals (horses, mules, and oxen). [...] In desperate times, migrants would search for less-popular sources of food, including coyote, fox, jackrabbit, marmot, prairie dog, and rattlesnake (nicknamed [...] "bush fish" [...] in the later period).|$|R
50|$|Various other {{factories}} and shops existed over the years. During the Civil War, swords and Bowie knives {{were made in}} Snowville for the Confederate Army and delivered to Christiansburg where they were shipped out. Joe Craft operated a barrel factory which produced whiskey barrels and flour containers, as well as wooden washtubs. There are records of eggs being brought from the surrounding countryside to Snowville, where they were sold for merchandise, then <b>packed</b> into <b>barrels</b> with wood shavings and sawdust, and finally sent to large cities. In another building, bird feathers and down feathers were made into pillows and feather beds.|$|R
50|$|Winnowing barns (or {{winnowing}} houses) were {{commonly found}} in South Carolina on antebellum rice plantations. A winnowing barn consists of a large shed on tall posts {{with a hole in}} the floor. Raw, husked rice was carried up into the barn by enslaved workers and then the grain was forced through the small hole. As the grain dropped to the ground, the lighter and undesirable chaff was carried away in the wind, leaving a mound of purified rice grains directly below the winnowing barn. The purified grain was then <b>packed</b> into <b>barrels</b> and carried down river to port cities for distribution.|$|R
