In fact, on the molecular level disorders within both groups represent different ends of the same spectrum of inherited extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders.

40|$|In {{the spirit}} of the {{devolution}} of public policy, we have recently witnessed an increasing popularity of decentralised forms of decision-making in urban land-use policy, in which both local (or regional) authorities and the private sector play a more <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> role in the preparation and implementation of urban development projects. The paper describes the pathway to a more institutional multi-actor mode of urban land-use and revitalisation projects within the framework of deregulated land markets and maps out various relevant aspects of competitive land use. In particular, an attempt is made to identify the crucial 'drivers' of this complex decision-making process in an urban context, against the background of revitalisation objectives for modern cities. The literature suggests, in particular, that the institutional constellation, the financial viability and the presence of spatial externalities may act as critical factors for public-private partnerships. This proposition is tested in the paper by means of a comparative study on nine carefully selected urban development projects-more specifically, nine types of public-private partnerships-in The Netherlands. After the design of a systematic database on these projects, a particular type of qualitative fuzzy classification analysis originating from artificial intelligence, known as rough set analysis, is deployed to assess and identify the most important factors that are responsible for successes and failures of recent development plans in Dutch cities. This approach allows us to pinpoint the most critical policy variables...|$|E

However, our knowledge of hypothalamic connections is incomplete, particularly for the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Here we present the results of neuronal pathway-tracing experiments to investigate connections of the LHA juxtaventromedial region, which is parceled into dorsal (LHAjvd) and ventral (LHAjvv) zones. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL, for outputs) and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB, for inputs) coinjections were targeted stereotaxically to the LHAjvd/v. RESULTS: LHAjvd/v connections overlapped highly but not uniformly. Major joint outputs included: Bed nuc. stria terminalis (BST), interfascicular nuc. (BSTif) and BST anteromedial area, rostral lateral septal (LSr) - and ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nuc., and periaqueductal gray. <b>Prominent</b> <b>joint</b> LHAjvd/v input sources included: BSTif, BST principal nuc., LSr, VMH, anterior hypothalamic-, ventral premammillary-, and medial amygdalar nuc., and hippocampal formation (HPF) field CA 1. However, LHAjvd HPF retrograde labeling was markedly more abundant than from the LHAjvv; in the LSr this was reversed. Furthermore, robust LHAjvv (but not LHAjvd) targets included posterior- and basomedial amygdalar nuc., whereas the midbrain reticular nuc. received a dense input from the LHAjvd alone. Our analyses indicate the existence of about 500 LHAjvd and LHAjvv connections with about 200 distinct regions of the cerebral cortex, cerebral nuclei, and cerebrospinal trunk. Several highly LHAjvd/v-connected regions have a prominent role in reproductive behavior. These findings contrast with those from our previous pathway-tracing studies of other LHA medial and perifornical tier regions, with different connectional behavioral relations. The emerging picture is of a highly differentiated LHA with extensive and far-reaching connections that point to a role as a central coordinator of behavioral control...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} small scale {{explosive}} tests were performed {{during the spring of}} 1994 at a perlite mine located near Socorro, NM. The tests were designed to investigate the azimuthal or directional relationship between small scale geologic structures such as joints and the propagation of explosively induced ground motion. Three shots were initiated within a single borehole located at ground zero (gz) at depths varying from the deepest at 83 m (272 ft) to the shallowest at 10 m (32 ft). The intermediate shot was initiated at a depth of 63 m (208 ft). An array of three component velocity and acceleration transducers were placed in two concentric rings entirely surrounding the single shot hole at 150 and 300 azimuths as measured from ground zero. Data from the transducers was then used to determine the average propagation velocity of the blast vibration through the rock mass at the various azimuths. The rock mass was mapped to determine the <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> orientations (strike and dip) and the average propagation velocities were correlated with this geologic information. The data from these experiments shows that there is a correlation between the orientation of prominent joints and the average velocity of ground motion. It is theorized that this relationship is due to the relative path the ground wave follows when encountering a joint or structure within the rock mass. The more prominent structures allow the wave to follow along their strike thereby forming a sort of channel or path of least resistance and in turn increasing the propagation velocity. Secondary joints or structures may act in concert with more prominent features to form a network of channels along which the wave moves more freely than it may travel against the structure. The amplitudes of the ground motion was also shown to vary azimuthally with the direction of the most prominent structures...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} active {{involvement}} of Myeloid-related proteins S 100 A 8 and S 100 A 9 in joint inflammation and cartilage destruction during antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). METHODS: Joint inflammation and cartilage destruction {{was measured with}} 99 mTc uptake and histology. The role of S 100 A 8 /A 9 was investigated by inducing AIA in S 100 A 9 -/- mice that also lack S 100 A 8 at protein level, or after intra-articular injection of rS 100 A 8 in mouse knee joints. Cartilage destruction was measured using immunolocalisation of the neoepitope VDIPEN or NITEGE. mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines were measured using reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR. RESULTS: Immunisation of S 100 A 9 -/- mice with the antigen mBSA induced normal cellular and humoral responses, not different from wild type (WT) controls. However, joint swelling measured at day 3 and 7 after AIA induction was significantly lower (36 and 70 %, respectively). Histologically, at day 7 AIA, cellular mass was much lower (63 - 80 %) and proteoglycan depletion from cartilage layers was significantly reduced (between 50 - 95 %). Cartilage destruction mediated by MMPs was absent in S 100 A 9 -/- mice but clearly present in controls. MMP 3, 9 and 13 mRNA levels were significantly lowered in arthritic synovia of S 100 A 9 -/-. In vitro stimulation of macrophages by the heterodimer S 100 A 8 /A 9 or S 100 A 8 elevated mRNA levels of MMP 3, 9 and in particular MMP 13. Intra-articular injection of S 100 A 8 caused <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> inflammation and depletion of proteoglycans at day 1. Significant upregulation of mRNA levels of S 100 A 8 /A 9, cytokines (interleukin 1 (IL 1)), MMPs (MMP 3, MMP 13 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) 4) {{was found in the}} synovium and correlated with strong upregulation of NITEGE neoepitopes within the cartilage layers.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe Keimoes Suite is a {{group of}} poorly defined granitoids that {{characterize}} the Namaqua Front and Foreland zones. There is a lack of knowledge on its content and distribution. A significant amount of work has been done on the geochemical and geochronological aspects of the Keimoes Suite but no structural analysis using a comparison between joint occurrences in the suite and the country rock has been found in the literature. This study provides insight on whether these joints formed {{as a result of the}} emplacement and subsequent cooling of the granitoids or whether they are the result of later deformation processes. This was achieved through remote sensing, detailed field mapping and structural analysis of joint data to determine the type of stress regime associated with their deformation. Eleven granitoids of the Keimoes Suite were mapped in the Kakamas-Keimoes area in the Northern Cape, South Africa. Up to four joint sets were mapped and characterized according to orientation, abutting relationship, in-filling material and spacing properties. The orientation analysis revealed two <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> sets (NNW and NE) that are consistent throughout the Keimoes Suite granite. However after careful analysis of their abutting relationship it has been concluded that these joints are the youngest joints formed in the Keimoes Suite. The fourth set is the E-W set which does not occur at a wide spread scale. The oldest joint set (NNE) is defined by the quartz and feldspar filling and these joints only occur in the oldest granite of the suite. Field observation revealed shear displacement, forming a conjugate joint set. This conjugate set closes at an acute angle of 60 Ë and the joints displace each other. The presence of en echelon sigmoidal veins suggests these joints formed as mode II fractures and that they are tectonic joints. The dominant joint set NNW is parallel to the regional foliation, shear zones and faults which were formed during the D 2 deformational vent of the Namaqua Orogeny. This NNW joint set post-dates the D 2 deformational event and was formed during the D 3 deformational environment of the Namaqua Orogeny. Principal stress analysis of all the joints in the study area suggests a strike-slip environment, which coincides with the D 3 deformation event of the Namaqua Natal Province. Even though the country rock and the Keimoes Suite granites were subjected to same stress field during the D 3 event, the analysis of principal stresses between the Keimoes Suite granites and the country rock reveals a slight difference in the orientation of the principal stresses. This is caused by the difference in competency between the Keimoes Suite granites and the country rock thus caused the refraction. In conclusion Structural evidence on various members of the Keimoes Suite indicates three episodes of intrusions with respect to the D 2 Namaqua deformation event based on foliation and mineral filled joints. The Vaalputs Granite is pre tectonic relative to the main D 2 deformation event and the thermal peak M 2 metamorphisms, while Louisvale, Kanon Eiland and Klip Kraal Granites are syn-tectonic to these deformation events. The granites that lack foliation are classified as post-tectonic granites and these are the Keboes, Kleinbegin, Gemsbokbult, Colstone and Cnydas Granites as well as the Friesdale Charnockite. However the presence of foliation in some granites suggests that a compressional episode existed for a period of time and ended sometime before the onset of the post-tectonic granites. Therefore the D 2 pre-dates the last episode of Keimoes Suite granite emplacement. This study partly validates the work done by previous workers on the Keimoes Suite, although there are some slight differences which are subjected to change. Conclusion can be drawn that this study provided additional insight in the findings of other workers nonetheless also differs with some of their findings regarding the timing of emplacement of the Keimoes Suite...|$|E
40|$|The {{great toe}} {{is the part}} of the foot that most often {{requires}} surgical intervention. The first metatarsophalangeal joint (FMTPJ) is the most <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> of the great toe. Primary causes of FMTPJ failure are rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and joint degeneration secondary to deformities such as hallux valgus, hallux rigidus or the trauma of previous surgery. FMTPJ prostheses are used to restore a measure of motion, correct deformities and relieve pain. FMTPJ replacement is most often indicated for elderly and less active patients but is contra-indicated for young, rheumatoid and active patients. The most common types of FMTPJ prostheses are made from silicone elastomer. Although these have been in use since the 1960 's, there are many problems associated with these and all other types of FMTPJ prostheses. For example, recent research has shown that silicone elastomer metatarsophalangeal arthroplasties may cause severe, chronic silicone granulomatous disease. Also, previous studies of the pressure distribution under normal feet, and pathological feet before and after surgery, can be used to show that FMTPJ prostheses fail to restore normal weight-bearing. In this regard, FMTPJ arthroplasties perform little better than amputation. The reasons for the poor biomechanical performance of FMTPJ arthroplasty are not well documented. Existing theoretical models of FMTPJ function cannot be used to explain why almost all surgery of the first ray causes weight bearing to transfer to the lateral side of the foot. A new hypothesis of FMTPJ function was therefore formulated. It is known that the motions of the FMTPJ are linked to motions of the other bones of the foot and ankle because the strong fibrous tissues of the plantar aponeurosis connect the hallux to the calcaneus. However, it is hypothesised that the particular orientation of the bones at the final stages of the stance phase is crucial to the weight-bearing functions of the FMTPJ. A specification for a new prosthesis was therefore developed in accordance with the biomechanical principles contained in the hypothesis. Various potential designs of prosthesis were investigated, but a ball-and-socket configuration was selected because it appeared to allow the motions necessary to restore normal loading in the foot. Three slightly different prototype ball-and-socket FMTPJ prostheses were designed and manufactured. These prototypes were inserted into cadavers; which allowed the range of motion of the prototype prostheses to be assessed in relation to the constraints imposed by the strong fibrous attachments in the foot. Some of the rudimentary surgical techniques and the instruments required to insert and align the prostheses were developed. The various design features that had been incorporated in the different prototypes were assessed in terms of their relevance to ultimate performance of the arthroplasty. In order to verify the biomechanical design principles, cadaveric FMTP joints were tested for range of motion before and after inserting the prostheses. The results were compared to the range of motions obtained from a dry bone specimen, and to the most successful FMTPJ design to date- a double-stem silicone elastomer prosthesis. Finally, the results from all the tests were compared and discussed in relation to the original hypothesis about the function of the great toe. The results obtained from the new prosthesis were sufficiently encouraging to be able to recommend that the prototype be manufactured for further clinical trials. The new prosthesis was found to simulate the conditions that are necessary to re-establish normal weight-bearing patterns in the foot; such as an elevated centre of rotation for the proximal end of the first metatarsal bone, tension in the plantar aponeurosis, mobile bones in the arch, and weight-bearing by the first metatarsal. Previous prostheses used in FMTPJ arthroplasty are believed to be inadequate in that they do not restore {{at least one of these}} conditions, which ultimately lead to implant failure. Within the limits of cadaver trials, the new design has demonstrated that it has the potential to succeed...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the engineering geologic factors influencing the stability of slopes along a coastal escarpment in the northern Illawarra region. The particular area covered by this study lies between Coalcliff and Clifton where a number of known or visible areas of slope instability are present. Slope instability {{in the study area}} {{is a function of the}} stratigraphy, structural geology, petrology, geomorphology, climate and mechanical properties of the rock and soil. In the northern Illawarra region the essentially flat-lying lower Narrabeen Group conformably overlies the upper Illawarra Coal Measures and the strata consist of repeated beds of sandstone, shale, claystone and coal seams. The lower Narrabeen Group consists of thick sequences of weak fine-grained rocks which are rather more easily eroded than the associated sandstone strata and hence relatively rapid rates of recession occur. Undermining along this the contacts between claystone and sandstone reduces the support for the overlying vertically-jointed sandstone and eventually leads to stabs falling off along the vertical joint faces. Thin marker beds (coal seams) in the Illawarra Coal Measures and sandstone beds in the Narrabeen Group commonly act as aquifers, with claystone beds acting as aquitards. Slope instability is usually related to the presence of the aquifers which are the source of high pore water pressures:- Perched water tables have been found to be quite common in the study area. The topography along the escarpment is mainly steep and highly irregular because of past and present marine and fluvial erosion:- Large colluvial deposits have accumulated at the base of the steeper slopes. Generally, colluvial deposits are clay-rich containing abundant mixed-layer clay and smectite (montmorillonite). Based on the petrological study, the Narrabeen group was derived from the New England Fold Belt to the north and consists predominantly of volcanic detritus. The volcanic detritus is present in both the sandstone and shale units either in form of detrital grains of volcanic rock or as fine volcanic ash- During post-depositional alteration and diagenesis the original volcanic glass in the ash and matrix of larger grains has devitrified to produce smectite clays. These clays not only cause swelling and shrinkage near the surface as a response to wetting and drying, but also reduce the permeability of the near the surface rock mass. This latter factor increases the aqueous pore pressures and hence increases the likelihood of surficial mass movement of both the rock mass and the adjacent talus deposits. Based on X-ray diffraction, carbonates are mostly rare in the talus deposits. The natural reduction in carbonate cement due to weathering is one a cause for talus slope instability in the Illawarra area. The high horizontal stress environment known to exist in the Illawarra area is an important factor which also influences slope failure. The resulting joint strike maxima for the lower Narrabeen Group show that the most <b>prominent</b> <b>joint</b> set exposed at the surface, with a direction between 005 Â° and 025 Â°, has a significant effect on slope stability in the study area. Fracture permeability is also the most important feature of groundwater movements with it most of the fractures occurring in areas of stress relief near the face of the escarpment. It is quite obvious from studying the rainfall figures and periods of prevalence of landslides that the most unstable periods are those when the rainfall is above 400 mm per month. A significant decrease in durability was found to accompany changes in mineralogy and an increase in weathering from fresh to weathered rocks. Moderately and highly weathered claystone and shale in the Narrabeen Group rocks have low to very low durability; it is dependent on their mineralogy, and especially on the type and quantity of clay minerals present. Claystone samples interbedded in the Bulgo Sandstone also show very low durability. In contrast, claystone interbedded in the Scarborough Sandstone shows a medium durability whereas claystone in the Coal Cliff Sandstone has a high durability. The differences in the behaviour of samples is that slake durability is sensitive to the abundance of clay minerals as opposed to carbonate in these samples. Claystone interbeds in the Bulgo Sandstone and the highly weathered Stanwell Park Claystone both have very low durability. This has a significant effect on slope stability in the Bulgo Sandstone especially where the Stanwell Park Claystone acts as the bedrock for the talus mantle between Clifton and Stanwell Park. The Wombarra Shale and Stanwell Park Claystone, two units of the Narrabeen Group, appear to dominate the study area as being the units most prone to instability problems. Failure surfaces of landslides are located at or near the base of highly weathered shale or claystone sequences. A significant decrease in strength was also found to occur with an increase in weathering from fresh to weathered rocks. The geotechnical properties of the talus most related to its stability, are clay content, plasticity index and residual friction angle. These parameters and the angle of natural slopes show the talus is unstable in the longterm at slopes above 10 - 12 Â°. Man 2 Ì 7 s construction activities have also caused some landslides in the northern Illawarra, especially along the excavations for the railway and road. Two main transport routes, the Illawarra Railway and Lawrence Hargrave Drive, pass through the study area. Along Lawrence Hargrave Drive major movement in gently sloping land has been triggered by high pore-water pressures in highly weathered Wombarra Shale covered by a talus mantle. Increased urban development has and will continue to complicate the issue in the future. Seven landslides have been detailed in this thesis. The majority of these have or are presently undergoing block type movements at creep rate. Detailed geotechnical investigations with survey monitoring is often necessary to identify these failures. The area has also been extensively mined for coal, resulting in minor subsidence. This has usually caused fracturing of the rock strata and opening of the joint system which have increased water ingress, resulting in higher subsurface flows and altered groundwater regimes. Based on observations, mine subsidence has been one contributory factor to slope instability in the northern Illawarr...|$|E

Notably, one of our patients with a p. Gly 1132 Asp mutation showed typical morphological features but an exceptional good development with borderline overall IQ and learning difficulties, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome...|$|R
5000|$|The genus name Burhinus {{comes from}} the Greek bous, ox, and rhis, nose. The species name oedicnemus {{comes from the}} Greek oidio, to swell, and kneme, the shin or leg, {{referring}} to the bird's <b>prominent</b> tibiotarsal <b>joints,</b> which also give it the common name of [...] "thick-knee". This is an abbreviated form of Pennant's 1776 coinage [...] "thick kneed bustard".|$|R
5000|$|The Organ Pipes (...) is {{a notable}} rock cliffs on the {{northwest}} side of Jaeger Table, south of Cairn Ridge, in the Dufek Massif, Pensacola Mountains. The name {{is suggested by the}} appearance of the feature caused by weathering along <b>prominent</b> vertical <b>joints</b> in the gabbro rock. Named by Arthur B. Ford, United States Geological Survey (USGS) geologist, leader of the USGS Pensacola Mountains survey party, 1978-79.|$|R
50|$|They are diurnal fliers. Genus {{differs from}} Orgyia due to much longer palpi and less hairy body. Third <b>joint</b> <b>prominent.</b> Legs are less hairy. Female has fully {{developed}} wings. Antennae branches are shorter than in male.|$|R
50|$|Palpi long, porrect and {{met by a}} short sharp frontal tuft. Third <b>joint</b> <b>prominent.</b> Antennae simple. Thorax and abdomen {{smoothly}} scaled and tuftless. Fore wings with non-creulate cilia. Veins 7,8 and 9,10 stalked. Larva possess four abdominal prolegs.|$|R
40|$|We report three {{children}} from two inbred Arab families with StÃ¼ve-Wiedemann syndrome who {{have survived the}} first year of life (ages are 6 years, 2. 8 years and 2 years). All exhibited a characteristic phenotype resembling that described by Chen et al. [(2001). Am J Med Genet 101 : 240 - 245]. In all {{three children}} the skeletal abnormalities progressed to severe bowing of the long bones with <b>prominent</b> <b>joints</b> and severe spinal deformity. Neurological symptoms were present in all of them. These included temperature instability with excessive sweating, reduced pain sensation with repeated injury to the tongue and limbs, absent corneal reflexes and a smooth tongue. Mentality was normal in all of them. Radiological changes included under tubulation of the diaphyses, rarefaction and striation of metaphyses, destruction of the femoral heads and spinal deformity. We confirm that survival in this syndrome is possible and that the prognosis improves after {{the first year of}} life. This should be taken into consideration when counselling parents of affected children. This report further supports the existence of a characteristic phenotype in StÃ¼ve-Wiedemann syndrome survivors which include, in addition to the skeletal abnormalities and distinctive radiological features, neurological symptoms reminiscent of dysautonomia.
