5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously.

5|$|The {{increasing}} role of {{the private}} sector forms an important trend in the ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>to</b> improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E

When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>To</b> tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
