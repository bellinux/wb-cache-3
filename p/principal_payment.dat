5000|$|Planned Amortization Class (PAC) bonds have a <b>principal</b> <b>payment</b> rate {{determined}} by two different prepayment rates, which together form a band (also called a collar). Early {{in the life}} of the CMO, the prepayment at the lower PSA will yield a lower prepayment. Later in the life, the principal in the higher PSA will have declined enough that it will yield a lower prepayment. The PAC tranche will receive whichever rate is lower, so it will change prepayment at one PSA for the first part of its life, then switch to the other rate. The ability to stay on this schedule is maintained by a support bond, which absorbs excess prepayments, and will receive less prepayments to prevent extension of average life. However, the PAC is only protected from extension to the amount that prepayments are made on the underlying MBSs. When the principal of that bond is exhausted, the CMO is referred to as a [...] "busted PAC", or [...] "busted collar".|$|E

We then analyze the theoretical properties of the equilibriums (multiplier effect, stability conditions) resulting from the introduction of this framework in three types of models that differ in regard of who are the debtors and who are the creditors: workers can borrow from capitalists (essay 1) or from their peer (essay 2); capitalists can borrow from their peer (essay 3) ...|$|E

The authors describe the system, its payment instruments, and its links to other networks and the government's payment and collections operations. They examine factors that have affected system development, planned innovations and improvement opportunities. The <b>principal</b> <b>payment</b> instruments used in Brazil are cash, checks, cobrancas (like European GIRO payments) and DOCs (Documentos de Credito). DOCs are used to make interbank credit payments, intrabank transfers of funds between a client's different accounts and client to client payments between parties with accounts at the same banking institution. Although they can be initiated on paper, all DOCs are electronic and processed only by banks. Networks include direct deposit and direct debit services, automated teller machines, credit cards and home banking services. The system is highly automated, with separate systems for clearing and settling checks and credit payments; government securities, private securities, state, local, and municipal securities; government payments; and foreign exchange. Among the lessons learned: a) banks can cut costs by cooperating on check processing and transportation; b) a broad, inclusive approach {{should be taken to}} modernizing the payments system, taking into account the needs of all users; and c) a wider menu of payment instruments should be offered.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the price {{sensitivity}} of fixed-income securities to the interest rate changes, expressing a dominant source of financial risk the financial institutions or other market participants manage. The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the Macaulay's duration normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as weighted average maturity of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the bond redemption prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fun- damental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the scheduled <b>principal</b> <b>payment</b> date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's dura- tion approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities...|$|E

40|$|As in any {{commercial}} activity, {{cash flow}} {{is vital for}} the survival of construction businesses. Construction activities take a long time, the products are expensive and the fact that payments are usually made for work already done, makes cash flow and financial status highly dependent on timely payments from the principals. Cash flow constraints of contractors not only result in business failures but also create flow-on effects in the supply chain. In recognition of these effects, most countries including New Zealand have established payment-specific construction industry legislation to ensure a steady flow of cash to project participants. However, payment problems persist within culture and practices, suggesting that industry characteristics may make it difficult to mitigate the problems. It is in this context, that this research investigates payment problems in the New Zealand construction industry with the main focus on exploring feasible solutions to secure payments to construction parties. This research has adopted a sequential mixed-method design consisting of three approaches; preliminary document analyses of liquidators’ reports, and payment disputes heard in the High Court; analysis of a questionnaire survey; and interviews with construction industry practitioners. The data collected through preliminary investigations and an online questionnaire administered to consultants, contractors and subcontractors based in New Zealand was validated and extended using semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). Data analysis techniques employed include: descriptive, inferential statistics and thematic analysis. The findings of the study confirm that payment problems are still prevalent though not as widespread and significant as was the situation before the introduction of the Construction Contracts Act (CCA). The prevalence of payment problems is mainly due to failure to comply with the requirements of the CCA, lack of knowledge and understanding of the Act, and financial strength of industry players. The study found that other main causes were cash flow difficulties due to delays and non-payments experienced on other projects, disputes over payment claims and responses, inadequate fund sourcing and management, the easy exit of players from the industry with little/no liability to creditors, and the general payment culture of the industry. The research revealed that the cost consequences of construction insolvencies are significant and very often there is no security for payment losses due to insolvencies. The research finds that the most appropriate forms of securities include: escrow/trust accounts, <b>principal</b> <b>payment</b> bonds, direct payments/tripartite agreements and retention bonds. Amongst, the use of escrow accounts seems the most appropriate/feasible protection mechanism for held funds (e. g. retention monies). Subcontractors and lower tier parties in the construction supply chain are more impacted by payment difficulties and very often are unable to secure payment from the upper tiers. The cost of a financial security and constructors not being able to influence the upper tiers are found to be two major practical obstacles for obtaining security for payment in New Zealand. The research therefore recommends among others, adjustments to provisions within the CCA and other regulatory documents, changes to registration and pre-qualification of project owners and participants, changes to project administration processes, and general attitudinal changes within the New Zealand construction industry...|$|E
30|$|De- and re-levering betas is {{important}} to obtain discount rates for assets that are not publicly traded. A de- and re-levering procedure is around for the case of risk-free debt. The procedure for risky debt is much less clear even under very simplifying assumptions.

I derive procedures for different assumptions on the taxation of a cancellation of debt (COD) and for different assumptions regarding the distribution of losses on interest and <b>principal</b> <b>payments.</b> With a tax on the COD I obtain known results. However, without taxes on a COD, the distribution of losses on interest and <b>principal</b> <b>payments</b> matters and equations differ markedly for different assumptions on the assignment of losses to interest and <b>principal</b> <b>payments.</b> Furthermore, using a procedure that does not fit the COD treatment is {{likely to lead to}} substantial deviations for de- and re-levered betas from their correct values.|$|R
