25|$|A graph {{property}} {{is the question}} of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E
25|$|Solubility is a <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in {{many aspects}} of science, {{including}} but not limited to: environmental predictions, biochemistry, pharmacy, drug-design, agrochemical design, and protein ligand binding. Aqueous solubility is of fundamental interest owing to the vital biological and transportation functions played by water. In addition, to this clear scientific interest in water solubility and solvent effects; accurate predictions of solubility are important industrially. The ability to accurately predict a molecules solubility represents potentially large financial savings in many chemical product development processes, such as pharmaceuticals. In the pharmaceutical industry, solubility predictions form part of the early stage lead optimisation process of drug candidates. Solubility remains a concern {{all the way to}} formulation. A number of methods have been applied to such predictions including quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) and data mining. These models provide efficient predictions of solubility and represent the current standard. The draw back such models is that they can lack physical insight. A method founded in physical theory, capable of achieving similar levels of accuracy at an sensible cost, would be a powerful tool scientifically and industrially.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{will study}} abstractions and {{algorithms}} for planar manipulation systems using two cooperating robots under uncertainties. We propose a formal framework for developing abstractions, which are simpler models of the original systems that preserve <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to facilitate the development of planning and control algorithms. Our abstractions are derived from robust motion primitives that correspond to control inputs leading to system trajectories which preserve the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> under uncertainties. We then use the proposed framework to construct an abstraction and design planning and control algorithms for a multiple robot cooperative manipulation system. Finally, we present experimental results to validate our approach. Static obstacles Goal configuratio...|$|R

Starting from a case study, we present a methodology for the derivation of qualitative dynamical models from biochemical networks. Properties are formalised using abstract interpretation.
