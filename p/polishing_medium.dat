Mathematical modelling is applied to model the micro finishing operation. The study is conducted to compare the simulated results with the existing experimental results. A flexible polishing tool comprising <b>polishing</b> <b>medium</b> is used to carry out the analysis. The relative motion between the <b>polishing</b> <b>medium</b> and the workpiece surface provides the required finishing action. In the present work a two dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation inside the workpiece fixture is performed to evaluate the axial and radial stresses developed due to the flow of <b>polishing</b> <b>medium.</b> The present study also develops optimization for AFM process of Al. alloy using response surface method...|$|E

The <b>polishing</b> <b>medium</b> was 1 µm diamond paste with Microcloth(polishing cloth). Surface finish parameter Sa was chosen as criterion for optimization. The experimental result indicates that the optimal polishing condition for CoCr alloy polishing is 5 deg of precess angle, 800 rpm of head speed, 0. 2 mm of tool offset and 1. 5 bar of tool pressure. With this optimal condition, a confirmatory experiment was conducted. The surface roughness Sa reduced from initial 24 nm to 7 nm and reduction ratio was 72. 5...|$|E

The study focuses on surface integrity of the fibre and ferrule {{as well as other}} geometry of the polished connector end faces covering the fibre height or undercut, the apex offset, and the radius of curvature. Optical performances of the polished connectors were evaluated by return and insertion losses. Finally, relationship between geometrical qualities and optical performances was established.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on firm competitiveness by advancing the perspective of organizational politics that views this process as a driver which creates identifiable differences in firm performance. The hypothesized relationships were tested on the basis of data from 355 <b>Polish</b> <b>medium</b> and large-sized enterprises.

The main result of the conducted analyses proved the coexistence, previously examined in the literature, of corporate entrepreneurship and firm performance. The obtained research findings made it possible to add organizational politics {{to a wide range of}} elements determining corporate entrepreneurship, followed by competitive advantage, in addition to antecedents such as strategic leadership, corporate culture, opportunity-oriented resource-based management, etc. Also, the empirical results suggest that four dimensions of organizational politics (dominant coalition, influence exertion, making organizational changes, and information openness) are positively related to firm competitiveness. In addition, these findings seem to underline a supposition that corporate entrepreneurship is an important mediator which strengthens the competitive effects of organizational politics...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} project analyses the internationalisation {{processes of}} <b>Polish</b> <b>medium</b> size enterprise Foliarex. Specifically, the study focuses on two destinations of firm’s foreign activity. The Ukrainian market, where Foliarex established its sales representative and the British market, {{where the company}} engaged in indirect exporting. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explain the internationalisation of the company by comparing Foliarex entry strategy into these two markets. The study seeks to analyse the reasons for differences in entry modes employed for these two markets {{from the perspective of}} theories and models of internationalisation. The focus of the research will be on the external international environment in which Foliarex operates and firms internal factors – motives and barriers for internationalisation specific for the two markets. The collected empirical data indicates that firm’s decision to internationalise is related to three groups of factors. The first one is the influence of the top manager who plays a considerable role in company’s development. The second set of factors is related to firm’s specific resources which significantly constrain firm’s choices of foreign markets and entry mode selection. Finally, the internationalisation of Foliarex depends on the specific characteristics of a foreign market such as the perspectives for growth and the level of saturation. Overall, various theories and models of internationalisation analysed in this study are only partially able to explain the internationalisation of Foliarex into the UK and Ukrainian markets. The study indicates that only the integration of several theories can explain the internationalisation of the company...|$|R
