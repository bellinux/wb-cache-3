5|$|A {{month after}} Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland formed the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in August 1953, Huggins became the amalgamated body's first Prime Minister. Salisbury was {{designated}} the Federal capital, and the United <b>Party</b> renamed itself the United Rhodesia <b>Party.</b> Garfield Todd {{took over as}} Southern Rhodesia's Prime Minister. Huggins headed the Federal government for three years, then retired in November 1956 after a combined 23 years as a national leader. The United Rhodesia <b>Party</b> merged with the Federal <b>Party</b> to become the United Federal <b>Party</b> (UFP) in November 1957, and the liberal Todd was voted out of office by the more right-wing members of his <b>party</b> four months later, in February 1958. He was replaced by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Todd led {{his own version of}} the United Rhodesia <b>Party</b> against the UFP and the Dominion <b>Party</b> in June the same year, but failed to win a single seat—the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, with the Dominion <b>Party</b> taking the remainder.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic <b>Party</b> lost two seats, one to the National Mandate <b>Party</b> and Prosperous Peace <b>Party</b> each. The Pioneers' <b>Party</b> gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood <b>Party.</b> Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National <b>Party</b> by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star <b>Party.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Oxford, Tsakalotos joined the Communist <b>Party</b> of Greece (Interior), a eurocommunist <b>party</b> that had split from the main Communist <b>Party</b> of Greece, a Marxist–Leninist <b>party,</b> in 1968. In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of Synaspismos, a radical left-wing {{political}} <b>party,</b> which was to become the largest constituent <b>party</b> of Syriza. Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's legislative election, as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece. Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004. However, he also remained a prominent member of Synaspismos and served on both their Central Political Committee and their Political Secretariat until a July 2013 <b>party</b> congress, during which Syriza voted to become an independent political <b>party</b> and for all component parties to disband, including Synaspismos.|$|E

5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country <b>Party</b> remain independent of the United Australia <b>Party</b> (which had succeeded the Nationalist <b>Party)</b> amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country <b>Party</b> Leader Buttenshaw notified the <b>party</b> of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new <b>party</b> Leader.|$|E
50|$|A {{multilateral}} NDA involves {{three or}} more <b>parties</b> where {{at least one of}} the <b>parties</b> anticipates disclosing information to the other <b>parties</b> and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two <b>parties.</b> e.g; a single multiparty NDA entered into by three <b>parties</b> who each intend to disclose information to the other two <b>parties</b> could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second <b>parties,</b> second and third <b>parties,</b> and third and first <b>parties.</b>|$|R
40|$|Decisions-makers often rely on {{information}} supplied by interested <b>parties.</b> In practice, some <b>parties</b> have {{easier access to}} information than other <b>parties.</b> In this light, we examine whether more powerful <b>parties</b> have a disproportionate influence on decisions. We show that more powerful <b>parties</b> influence decisions with higher probability. However, in expected terms, decisions do {{not depend on the}} relative strength of interested <b>parties.</b> When <b>parties</b> have not provided information, decisions are biased towards the less powerful <b>parties.</b> Finally, we show that compelling <b>parties</b> to supply information destroys incentives to collect information...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{election}} there were 17 registered parties (a <b>party</b> has to collect signatures from at least 5,000 eligible voters in order to be accepted on the official <b>party</b> register, which is maintained by the Ministry of Justice). Eight of the parties were represented in the current parliament: the Centre <b>Party,</b> National Coalition <b>Party</b> (NCP), Social Democratic <b>Party</b> (SDP), Left Alliance, Green League, Swedish People's <b>Party</b> (SPP), Christian Democrats and True Finns.

5|$|Below {{the central}} level {{there are several}} {{commissions}} for discipline inspection (CDI). The CDI's composition is decided by the CDI a level above it, and endorsed by its <b>party</b> committee and the committee superior to it; the establishment of discipline commissions {{at the local level}} is decided by the upper-level <b>party</b> committee. The main duties and responsibilities of local CDIs are to educate <b>party</b> members on their duties and rights, preserve <b>party</b> discipline, uphold <b>party</b> decisions, see that <b>party</b> members exercise their duties in accordance with the <b>party</b> constitution, examine cases and investigate corruption. It is expected to report its findings regularly to its corresponding-level <b>party</b> committee. If a member of the local <b>party</b> committee is involved in corruption, the local CDI should ask the <b>party</b> committee at the corresponding level and the CDI at the level above to approve a full investigation. Before the 2014 reforms it was difficult for the CDIs to carry out their responsibilities; although they no longer needed approval from the secretary of the corresponding-level <b>party</b> committee, CDI officials were often appointed to positions of power within the institutions they were tasked to supervise (see above). The 2004 reforms increased CDI independence from the <b>party</b> committee; they were previously elected by the corresponding-level <b>party</b> committee, but beginning in 2004 CDI membership was selected by the upper-level CDI. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee in 2013 again reformed the CCDI's structure, with each CDI directly responsible to the CCDI.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 24 {{political}} <b>parties</b> were {{represented on the}} electoral ballot, including the two large <b>parties</b> and 22 small <b>parties.</b> The small <b>parties</b> are those which do not receive more than 10% of the vote and which are clearly not directly rivaling the main candidates. These <b>parties</b> generally choose to ally themselves {{with one of the}} large <b>parties.</b> Thirteen <b>parties</b> were previously rejected by the Central Electoral Commission.|$|R

The Red-Green Coalition, {{consisting of the}} Labour <b>Party</b> (61 members), the Socialist Left <b>Party</b> (15 members) and the Centre <b>Party</b> (11 members) gained a majority and created Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet. The majority cabinet lasted the entire session and was reelected in the 2009 election. The opposition {{consisted of}} four parties: the Progress <b>Party</b> (38 members), the Conservative <b>Party</b> (23 members), the Christian Democratic <b>Party</b> (11 members) and the Liberal <b>Party</b> (10 members).|$|E
5|$|Dacey {{became a}} senior <b>party</b> {{figure in the}} late 1890s and began to work on {{political}} strategy to win support in suburban seats and from white-collar voters. He stood in opposition to his party's support for the Premiership of Sir George Reid and instead threatened to resign if the <b>party</b> did not switch its support to William Lyne's Protectionist <b>Party.</b> At a Labor <b>Party</b> conference in 1899, the <b>party</b> executive decided to put forward the protectionism/free trade debate to a referendum of all <b>party</b> members, despite Dacey's campaigning. Dacey's standing in the Labor <b>Party</b> continued to grow: he was the party's treasurer from 1901 to 1910 and on the <b>Party</b> Central Executive in 1912.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{regional}} <b>parties</b> {{that do not}} generally campaign for greater autonomy or federalism include most provincial <b>parties</b> in Canada, most regional and minority <b>parties</b> in Europe, notably including the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (Germany), most <b>parties</b> in Belgium, most <b>parties</b> in Northern Ireland, the Istrian Democratic Assembly in Istria and the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar in Primorje-Gorski Kotar (both counties of Croatia), and most political <b>parties</b> in India.|$|R
50|$|Political <b>parties</b> {{are thus}} {{organised}} along community lines, {{especially for the}} three main communities. There are no representative <b>parties</b> active in both communities. Even in Brussels, all <b>parties</b> presenting candidates are either Flemish <b>parties,</b> or French-speaking. As such, the internal organisation of the political <b>parties</b> reflects the fundamentally dual nature of Belgian society.|$|R

5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} Communist <b>Party</b> in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the <b>party</b> to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist <b>Party.</b> In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist <b>Party</b> should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour <b>Party</b> and the Social Democratic Labour <b>Party.</b> A local <b>party</b> convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist <b>Party,</b> and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the <b>party</b> at the same time.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} very poor results of the federal United Australia <b>Party</b> under Billy Hughes at the 1943 Federal election, the UAP disintegrated.

With the {{conservative}} vote split in half, Mair had little chance, and resigned as Democratic <b>Party</b> Leader on 10 February 1944, {{to be replaced by}} Weaver, who then became <b>Party</b> Leader and Leader of the Opposition. Weaver then led the <b>party</b> to the 1944 election where it won 19% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Weaver himself retained his seat with 56.90%.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s.
