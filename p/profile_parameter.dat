A numerical solution for the {{mathematical model}} using finite element scheme is obtained using three nodes isoparametric quadratic elements. Stiffness integrals obtained from the weak form of the governing equations were solved using Gauss Quadrature to obtain {{a finite number of}} stiffness matrices. The global system of equations was obtained for the bearing and solved using Gauss Seidel iterative scheme. The converged pressure solution was used to obtain the load capacity of the bearing.

As the first investigation, {{the cutting line}} force of the two-line blade (90 / 30 deg.) on the laminated PC sheet was measured with a load cell and the sheared profile of the worksheet was observed by a CCD camera in order to reveal {{the effect of the}} time delay of the ultrasonic blade excitation on the deformation flow of the worksheet.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{disadvantage}} of Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval methods from Landsat TM thermal channel images is that atmospheric <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> are needed, and MODIS has several near infrared bands {{that can be}} used to estimate atmospheric <b>profile</b> <b>parameters.</b> Two methods that could be used to retrieve the LST from Landsat TM and MODIS data were compared in this paper, the first of them is the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. and the second is the single-channel algorithm developed by Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino. Atmospheric <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> such as atmospheric moisture content, atmospheric transmittance and average atmospheric temperature have been estimated from MODIS data, and the land surface emissivity values have been estimated from a methodology based on spectral mixture analysis. Finally, a comparison between the LST measured in situ and retrieved by the algorithms over urban area of Changsha city in China is present. Result indicates that the two LST retrieval algorithms can get high-precision results in support of atmospheric parameters from MODIS images, the average deviation of mono-window algorithm is 0. 76 K, and the deviation of generalized single-channel algorithm is 1. 23 k...|$|R
40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and treatment of cartilage degeneration is of high clinical interest. Loss of surface integrity {{is considered one of the}} earliest and most reliable signs of degeneration, but cannot currently be evaluated objectively. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an arthroscopically available light-based non-destructive real-time imaging technology that allows imaging at micrometre resolutions to millimetre depths. As OCT-based surface evaluation standards remain to be defined, the present study investigated the diagnostic potential of 3 D surface <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> in the comprehensive evaluation of cartilage degeneration. To this end, 45 cartilage samples of different degenerative grades were obtained from total knee replacements (2 males, 10 females; mean age 63. 8 years), cut to standard size and imaged using a spectral-domain OCT device (Thorlabs, Germany). 3 D OCT datasets of 8 × 8, 4 × 4 and 1 × 1 [*]mm (width×length) were obtained and pre-processed (image adjustments, morphological filtering). Subsequent automated surface identification algorithms were used to obtain the 3 D primary profiles, which were then filtered and processed using established algorithms employing ISO standards. The 3 D surface profile thus obtained was used to calculate a set of 21 3 D surface <b>profile</b> <b>parameters,</b> i. e. height (e. g. Sa), functional (e. g. Sk), hybrid (e. g. Sdq) and segmentation-related parameters (e. g. Spd). Samples underwent reference histological assessment according to the Degenerative Joint Disease classification. Statistical analyses included calculation of Spearman’s rho and assessment of inter-group differences using the Kruskal Wallis test. Overall, the majority of 3 D surface <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> revealed significant degeneration-dependent differences and correlations with the exception of severe end-stage degeneration and were of distinct diagnostic value in the assessment of surface integrity. None of the 3 D surface <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> investigated were capable of reliably differentiating healthy from early-degenerative cartilage, while scan area sizes considerably affected parameter values. In conclusion, cartilage surface integrity may be adequately assessed by 3 D surface <b>profile</b> <b>parameters,</b> which should be used in combination for the comprehensive and thorough evaluation and overall improved diagnostic performance. OCT- and image-based surface assessment could become a valuable adjunct tool to standard arthroscopy...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of algorithms for the reliable calculation of surface texture <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Some of these parameters are impossible to compute exactly given a discrete set of measured profile points. A need to represent the profile as a continuous function therefore arises, a need that occurs in many metrological applications. By reconstructing surface profiles accurately, with elements of numerical safety, we can provide a mathematically sound basis on which to compute surface texture <b>profile</b> <b>parameters.</b> As an important direct benefit, parameters involving the integrals of profiles can be calculated exactly from the interpolant introduced. Another advantage of a continuous representation is that it allows measured surface profile data, that is shown to be inherently non-uniform in the x-axis spacing, to be re-sampled at uniform intervals as it has been discovered that standard filtering techniques are apparently ineffective with non-uniform spacing. A novel method for data fitting discretely sampled surface profiles is presented with the advantages clearly stated. This provides a solid basis for <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> to be calculated upon and also intelligent functions for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty to be appended, which is equally important for the evolution of algorithms designed to be the complete evaluation of a parameter with a traceable measure of uncertainty.

40|$|BACKGROUND HIV {{patients}} receiving highly active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) usually suffer from side effects like hepatitis, neurological problems, abnormal fat distribution etc. Among these, the most physical, mental and cosmetically disturbing side effect is adipose tissue alterations (ATA), also called as lipodystrophy, which is abnormal fat deposition (Lipohypertrophy) and/or fat atrophy (Lipoatrophy). AIM Several {{studies have shown}} dyslipidemia in patients on HAART, but {{there are very few}} studies on the lipid profile changes in patients on ART with ATA. Hence a study was conducted to assess the serum lipid profile and transaminases activity in patients on ART with ATA and also to evaluate whether lipid <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> can predict ATA changes in HIV patients on HAART. METHOD Randomly selected HIV positive patients, who were attending ART centre, were included in the study. Twenty five of these patients in whom HAART was yet to be started were considered as Control group, 25 patients on HAART for more than 12 months but without ATA as ART group and 23 patients on HAART with ATA as ATA group. Lipid profile and serum transaminases in all the groups were assayed by standard methods. RESULTS Serum cholesterol and LDL were significantly increased in ART group and ATA group when compared to control group, but {{there was no significant difference}} in lipid <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> between ART group and ATA group. Serum AST and ALT levels were significantly increased (p< 0. 02) in ATA group when compared to ART group. Buffalo hump was seen only in females in our study. Lipoatrophy (facial and limbs) and central obesity was seen in males. CONCLUSION There was no significant change in lipid <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> in ATA group when compared with ART group. Hence lipid <b>profile</b> <b>parameters</b> are not good predictors of ATA changes in HIV patients on HAART. Significant increase in transaminase levels suggests increased hepatotoxity in ATA patients due to HAART drugs. There is a need for further evaluation on the role of hormones, environmental or genetic factors in different clinical presentations of ATA in male and female patients. ...|$|R
