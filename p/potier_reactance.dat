Important {{conclusion is that}} corresponding <b>potier</b> <b>reactance</b> values practically equally that in rated regime.

Proposed procedure accuracy, {{which is based}} on loaded machine saturation curve and leakage reactance, is considered. Loaded machine saturation curve is obtained so that to the no-load excitation current values with saturation curve are added corresponding current components due to the rotor addition saturation in load regime.

40|$|Abstract: Following {{results of}} an {{investigation}} the author comes to the conclusion: that the <b>Potier</b> <b>reactance</b> values depend almost solely on the turbogenerator(s) reactive currents (iaQ = ian∙sinφ) for a given voltage value. This new rule is after being proven by a general qualitative analysis, and his thesis is then checked for rated values of the active and reactive power, {{for an example of}} a GTHW 360 (360 MW) turbogenerator. <b>Potier</b> <b>reactance</b> xp is determined by the open-circuit saturation characteristics and data from the zero-power factor at the rated voltage (ia ═ ia, 90 ·cosφ═ 0, U═Un). The procedures used to determine the <b>Potier</b> <b>reactance</b> (xP or xP,n) are performed by a computer with the open-circuit saturation curves if 0 (e 0) expressed analytically. The author proposes the IEC 34 - 4 standard in the part on the determination of the <b>Potier</b> <b>reactance.</b> It is proposed that it is determined for the excitation current corresponding to the rated voltage and armature current value ia, 90 = ian∙sinφn, at the zero-power factor (overexcitation), and for some characteristic values is needed for the construction of the turbogenerator capability curve (P-Q curve) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the operational saturated synchronous reactances (Xd,sat and Xq,sat) and the rotor angle (δ), under the normal operating condition, was presented in this paper. At the power station the voltages (U), active (P) and reactive power (Q) are recorded. It is necessary to fit the no load generator saturation curve with appropriate analytical function. The output results obtained by corresponding calculations includes values of Xd,sat, Xq,sat and power angle δ, that reflect the level of generator saturation. Procedure by proposed method is following: - first the synchronous reactance Xd,sat value is determined by no load saturation curve using the voltage behind from leakage reactance (Xℓ) value or the voltage behind <b>Potier</b> <b>reactance</b> (XP), then - quadrature-axis reactance (Xq,sat) and load angle (δ) are determined by corresponding per-unit equations that connects generator parameters and characteristics d-axis and q-axis. The proposed method was verified using reported case study of 500 MW generator [1], where are used, besides U, P, Q and E(if) curve, the recorded rotor load angle value δ at rated load. Obtained results by new method differ up to 1 - 2 % from results in [1] obtained by more complex procedure, i. e. (i) by method with direct measurement of power angle δ, and corresponding Xd,sat, Xq,sat values determined by indirect method, i. e. on the base by corresponding per-unit equations, and (ii) by the finite-element method, when Xd,sat, Xq,sat and power angle (δ) values are calculated. Obtained results proved that synchronous reactance Xd,sat values can {{be as much as}} 30 % below unsaturated vales (Xd,unsat), and measured values Xq,sat can be up to 20 % below Xd,sat values. Based on obtained results the proposed method is verified for indirect measurement of synchronous turbine-generator parameters and characteristics under load condition...|$|E
