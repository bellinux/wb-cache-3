Therefore, this study was then to report a national data of the number of hip replacements, incidence rate, demographic characteristics of hip replacement patients, and short-time survival rate after hip replacement of Han Chinese in Taiwan. Methods We analyzed 105, 688 cases of hip <b>replacements</b> (including primary <b>partial</b> hip <b>replacement,</b> primary total hip replacement and revision of hip replacement) from National Health Insurance research database between 1996 and 2004. The survival rate of primary hip replacement was estimated for each disease by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Average annual number of primary <b>partial</b> hip <b>replacement</b> and primary total hip replacement were 4, 257 and 6, 206 cases, respectively. The most two common diagnosis of primary <b>partial</b> hip <b>replacement</b> were femoral neck fractures (73. 6 %, 34 % men, mean age 76 years) and avascular necrosis (18. 0 %, 84 % men, mean age 48 years). In primary total hip replacements, the most two common diagnosis were avascular necrosis (46. 9 %, 79 % men, mean age 50 years) and osteoarthrosis (41. 6 %, 43 % men, mean age 60 years). Both the number of primary <b>partial</b> hip <b>replacements</b> and primary total hip replacements increased steadily between 1996 and 2004. The cumulative survival of primary <b>partial</b> hip <b>replacements</b> and primary total hip replacements in all patients were 93. 97 % and 79. 47 % in 9 years follow-up, respectively.
