40|$|Dividend {{policy is}} the set of {{guidelines}} a company uses to decide how much of its earnings it will pay out to shareholders. When a company earns profits from operations, management can do {{one of two things}} with those profits. It can choose to retain them - essentially reinvesting them into the company with the hope of creating more profits and thus further stock appreciation. The alternative is to distribute a portion of the profits to shareholders in the form <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The present paper highlight different approaches <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy which are residual, hybrid and stability dividend approach. Companies using the residual dividend policy choose to rely on internally generated equity to finance any new projects. As a result, dividend payments can come out of the residual or leftover equity only after all project capital requirements are met. The fluctuation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> created by the residual policy significantly contrasts with the certainty <b>of</b> the <b>dividend</b> stability policy. With the stability policy, quarterly dividends are set at a fraction of yearly earnings. This policy reduces uncertainty for investors and provides them with income. Using the hybrid approach; companies tend to view the debt/equity ratio as a long-term rather than a short-term goal. In this paper cash dividend and procedure for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> explained. A cash dividend is money paid to stockholders, normally out of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits. Not all companies pay a dividend. Usually, the board of directors determines.
