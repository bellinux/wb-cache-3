2500|$|The beam <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> {{is usually}} a tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
2500|$|Aligning {{the grid}} wires {{also helps to}} reduce screen current, which {{represents}} wasted energy. This design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high-power, high-efficiency power tubes. EMI engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda developed the design which became the 6L6, the first popular beam <b>power</b> <b>tube,</b> introduced by RCA in 1936 and later corresponding tubes in Europe the KT66, KT77 and KT88 made by the Marconi-Osram Valve subsidiary of GEC (the KT standing for [...] "Kinkless Tetrode").|$|E

2500|$|Power-tube {{distortion}} {{is required}} for amp sounds in some genres. In a standard master-volume guitar amp, as the amp's final or master volume is increased beyond the full power of the amplifier, <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> distortion is produced. The [...] "power soak" [...] approach places the attenuation between the power tubes and the guitar speaker. In the re-amped or [...] "dummy load" [...] approach, the tube power amp drives a mostly resistive dummy load while an additional low power amp drives the guitar speaker. In the isolation box approach, the guitar amplifier is used with a guitar speaker in a separate cabinet. A soundproofed isolation cabinet, isolation box, isolation booth, or isolation room can be used.|$|E

50|$|Flight Rail Corp. in the USA has {{developed}} {{the concept of}} a high-speed atmospheric train that uses vacuum and air pressure to move passenger modules along an elevated guideway. Stationary power systems create vacuum (ahead of the piston) and pressure (behind the piston) inside a continuous pneumatic tube located centrally below rails within a truss assembly. The free piston is magnetically coupled to the passenger modules above; this arrangement allows the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> to be closed, avoiding leakage. The transportation unit operates above the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> on a pair of parallel steel rails.|$|E

50|$|Compressed gas {{enters the}} valve of the Phantom, {{pressing}} the cup seal assembly against the retainer with the aide of the valve spring. This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the pump stroke which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The pump stroke consists of two parts; the backward pump stroke and the forward pump stroke. On the backward pump stroke the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the bolt and hammer are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward pump stroke, both the bolt and hammer move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the hammer from the bolt. The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> and provides enough energy to force the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> back. As the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the <b>power</b> <b>tube</b> and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|E

Rectification in the original Bronco is via a single 5Y3GT rectifier tube, used by Fender since the early 1950s. In fact, Fender used {{an earlier version of this}} rectifier tube in the 1940s (the 5Y3) before it was phased out by manufacturers in the early 1950s to be replaced by the more electrically robust 5Y3GT.|$|E
