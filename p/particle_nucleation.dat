Two kinetic models have been successfully developed and used to propose a mechanism for the complete decomposition of alane and to predict its shelf-life during storage. Under non-isothermal heating, alane decomposes in two steps; the slowest is solely controlled by solid state nucleation of aluminum crystals; the fastest is due to growth of the crystals. Thus, during decomposition, hydrogen gas is liberated and the initial polyhedra AlH 3 crystals yield final amorphous aluminum <b>particles.</b> <b>Nucleation</b> of aluminum atoms is the rate determining step.

A novel Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (cluster-CIMS) has been developed, in collaboration with colleagues at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, to characterize homogeneously nucleated molecular clusters produced in a controlled laboratory environment. The cluster-CIMS gently ionizes neutral molecular clusters for quadrupole mass filtration with a minimum of disturbance to cluster composition.
