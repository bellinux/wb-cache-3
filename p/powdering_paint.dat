40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials. Generally, color keyed primer is close in color to the topcoat and {{is applied to the}} exterior surfaces of the vehicle body. Color specific primer identically matches the topcoat material color, and {{can be used as a}} replacement for topcoat on interior surfaces. Application of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister <b>Powder</b> <b>Paint</b> Delivery System to meet the challenges of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application. In anticipation of multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Objectives: <b>Powder</b> <b>painting</b> is an {{alternative}} to solvent-based spray <b>painting.</b> <b>Powder</b> <b>paints</b> may contain organic acid anhydrides (OAAs), which are irritants to the airways and may cause sensitisation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and immunological response among powder painters and to describe the exposure to OAAs. Methods: In all, 205 subjects in 32 enterprises participated: 93 exposed and 26 formerly exposed workers in 25 <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> shops and 86 unexposed workers. They completed a questionnaire about working conditions and symptoms and took part in a medical examination, which included a lung function test. Urine samples, for determination of two OAAs, and blood samples, for analysis of specific antibodies against the OAAs, were taken. In addition, 33 paint samples were analysed for nine OAAs. Results: The powder painters reported more work-related respiratory symptoms than unexposed subjects did. The prevalence of three or more symptoms was 24 % in subjects with low exposure, 44 % in highly exposed individuals, 46 % in formerly exposed subjects and 19 % in unexposed workers. Asthma symptoms were frequent, 7 %, 40 %, 15 % and 2 %, respectively. Regression analyses of the lung volumes did not show any influence of exposure. IgG, but not IgE, against the OAAs and metabolites of OAAs was found in some subjects, but no associations with the exposure could be observed. OAAs were found in only small amounts in the paint samples. Conclusions: The exposure to organic acid anhydrides was estimated to be low, and yet, IgG antibodies to OAA were observed in some subjects. The prevalence of work-related symptoms from the eyes and the airways was relatively high among the powder painters, and these symptoms, but not the lung volumes, were clearly related to exposure. The symptoms were probably caused by irritative properties of the <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> dust...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{operating}} under outer space conditions besides providing originally specified protective function, coating should often ensure accomplishment of functional properties, for instance conductivity of electric current. The solution {{of this problem}} {{can be reached by}} adding powder fillers with specified functional properties into <b>powder</b> <b>paint.</b> The paper deals with development of technique for formation of protective conducting coatings by filling <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> and treatment in planetary ball mill. For protection of magnesium alloy shells the technique is offered which combines formation of the oxidized sublayer, introduction of electroconductive filler, treatment of the powder mixture in the planetary ball mill and electrostatic deposition of sifted mixture of definite dispersion. This allows sinking of static electricity from cabinets of the equipment for the space-crafts applications in conditions of the outer space...|$|R

40|$|Triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) {{is mainly}} used in polyester-based <b>powder</b> <b>paints,</b> {{but also in}} laminates, {{insulating}} varnishes, coatings and adhesives. Several cases of contact allergy to TGIC have been reported during the last 10 years. Contact allergy to TGIC has developed in a factory producing the chemical, in a factory producing <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> containing TGIC, and in industries using powder coating. In this paper, we report a man who developed a work-related dermatitis when working on the painting of metal frames. He was exposed to polyester powder pigments containing TGIC. When patch tested, he was negative to TGIC (prepared in 1988) 3 x and positive to polyester powder pigment. Only when a new test preparation of fresh TGIC powder was tested, was a positive reaction obtained. Chemical analyses showed {{that there was no}} TGIC in the test preparation from 1988, and that in the TGIC powder from 1988, there was only 30 % of the expected amount of TGIC. The investigations, clinical and chemical, strongly indicate degradation of TGIC in the test preparation and powder. Both substances and the test preparations made from them may change over time. Therefore, if a false-negative reaction due to a test preparation is strongly suspected, we recommend a re-test of the patient with a new test preparation of fresh material. As a general rule, patch testing should be performed with fresh substances and test preparations made from them, unless their stability and durability are known. status: publishe...|$|R
