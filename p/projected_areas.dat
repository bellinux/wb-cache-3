Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations.

50|$|The Cone of Uncertainty is {{also used}} {{extensively}} as a graphic in hurricane forecasting, where its most iconic usage is more formally known as the NHC Track Forecast Cone, and more colloquially known as the Error Cone, Cone of Probability, or the Cone of Death. (Note that the usage in hurricane forecasting is essentially {{the opposite of the}} usage in software development. In software development, the uncertainty surrounds {{the current state of the}} project, and in the future the uncertainty decreases, whereas in hurricane forecasting the current location of the storm is certain, and the future path of the storm becomes increasingly uncertain.) Over the past decade, storms have traveled within their <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> two-thirds of the time, and the cones themselves have shrunk due to improvements in methodology. The NHC first began in-house five-day projections in 2001, and began issuing such to the public in 2003.

In this study, some physical properties of date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruit (cv. Lasht) were determined. Dry-basis moisture content of date fruits found to be 18. 48 % (19. 60 % for pitted dates and 8. 69 % for their pits). Other results showed that linear dimensions varied from 33. 10 to 42. 60 mm in length, 18. 20 to 25. 30 mm in width, and 17. 40 to 24. 40 mm in thickness. Mean mass and fruit volume was measured as 7. 16 g and 7. 24 cm 3, respectively. The <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> perpendicular to length (PL), width (PW), and thickness (PT) were 389. 31, 633. 38 and 663. 05 mm 2, respectively. Attempt was made to model date mass by applying different physical characteristics as three different classifications based on single or multiple variable regressions of dimensions characteristic, <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> and single variable regression of volume.

Obtained information is the particle-size-distribution curve relating volume-proportions to the sizes of fragments. Calculation by image {{analysis of}} this particle-size-distribution is carried out in several steps, and each step has its inherent limitations. We will focus in this paper {{on one of the}} most crucial steps: reconstructing the volumes (3 D). For the 3 D-step, we have noticed that, due to the current acquisition method, there is no correlation between the average grey level of surfaces of the fragments and their third dimension. Consequently volumes (3 D) as well as the sizes (1 D) has to be calculated indirectly from the extracted <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> of the visible fragments of images. For this purpose, we have built in laboratory a set of images of fragmented rocks resulting from blasting. Moreover, several tests based on comparisons between image analysis and screening measurements were carried out.

A nondestructive method for estimating the total GLA of individual rice plants based on multi-angle color images is presented. Using <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> of the plant in images, linear, quadratic, exponential and power regression models for estimating total GLA were evaluated. Tests demonstrated that the side-view projected area had a stronger relationship with the actual total leaf area than the top-projected area. And power models fit better than other models.

The inclusion of the top-view projected area as a second predictor provided only a slight improvement of the total leaf area estimation. When the <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> from multi-angle images were used, the estimated leaf area (ELA) using the power model and the actual leaf area had a high correlation coefficient (R 2 > 0. 98), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was about 6 %.
