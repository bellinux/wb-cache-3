40|$|Abstract Background An {{effective}} tuberculosis (TB) {{control programme}} requires early diagnosis and immediate initiation of treatment. Any delays in diagnosing TB not only impair a patient's prognosis, but {{also increase the}} risks of transmitting the disease within the community. Unfortunately, the most recent TB diagnostic tools still depend on high-infrastructure laboratories, making them poorly adapted for use in resource-limited settings. Additionally, existing tests show poor performance in diagnosing TB in children, people living with HIV/AIDS, and extrapulmonary forms of the disease. As a consequence, TB patients are still to date left with either fair access to poor diagnostics or poor access to fair diagnostics. Discussion This article discusses recent efforts to identify the minimal test specifications for a new TB <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> through an approach based on medical and patient needs. As a first step, survey interviews with field practitioners were designed {{in order to identify}} the top-priority medical needs in resource-limited settings concerning new TB diagnostics. Subsequently, an expert meeting convening field practitioners, laboratory experts, diagnostic test developers and researchers was held with the objective of defining the minimal test specifications for a new TB point-of-care test that would meet the identified medical needs. Finally, gaps in, as well as potential solutions for, enabling the development of adequate, patient needs-driven, low-cost new TB diagnostic tests specifically designed for vulnerable populations are discussed. Summary Any new TB <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> should be designed to meet minimal specifications satisfying the most urgent medical needs in resource-poor settings. The major gaps for developing a new TB point-of-care test include identification of new biomarkers, simplification of technological platforms, development of adequate and accessible specimen banks, and identification and definition of reference standards for diagnosis of childhood TB. Innovative research and development funding ensuring de-linkage of research and development costs from the price of the new product, such as a prize fund mechanism, could help focus these efforts towards the delivery of a much-needed <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> for TB. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Rapid {{progress}} has been made in the development of new diagnostic assays for tuberculosis in recent years. New technologies have been developed and assessed, and are now being implemented. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which enables simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance, was endorsed by WHO in December, 2010. This assay was specifically recommended for use as the initial diagnostic test for suspected drug-resistant or HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis. By June, 2012, two-thirds of countries with a high tuberculosis burden and half of countries with a high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis burden had incorporated the assay into their national tuberculosis programme guidelines. Although the development of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is undoubtedly a landmark event, clinical and programmatic effects and cost-effectiveness remain to be defined. We review the rapidly growing body of scientific literature and discuss the advantages and challenges of using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in areas where tuberculosis is endemic.

However, few aptamers have reached the stage of clinical application. A key challenge is discovery of suitable aptamer-target pairs and how best to link the binding event to a diagnostic signal particularly for point-of-care tests. Here, we present our work to develop DNA aptamers for point-of-care malaria diagnosis. We discovered aptamers against Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase as a general Plasmodium biomarker and against histidine-rich protein 2 as a Plasmodium falciparum specific biomarker. We have solved the crystal structure of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase aptamer in complex with its target, making this one of the best characterized aptamer-target pairs. Furthermore, we have integrated aptamers into an assay termed aptamer-tethered enzyme capture (APTEC) which is able to diagnose malaria in stored clinical patient blood samples. Work is ongoing using microarrays to optimize aptamer affinity and we are rapid prototyping 3 D printed aptamer-enabled devices with a view to developing a <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> that is inexpensive, robust, sensitive and specific for the developing world. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Leprosy can be {{a devastating}} chronic {{infection}} that causes nerve function impairment and associated disfigurement. Despite the recent {{reduction in the number}} of registered worldwide leprosy cases as a result of the widespread use of multidrug therapy, the number of new cases detected each year remains relatively stable. The diagnosis of leprosy is currently based on the appearance of clinical signs and requires expert clinical, as well as labor-intensive and time-consuming laboratory or histological, evaluation. For the purpose of developing an effective, simple, rapid, and low-cost diagnostic alternative, we have analyzed the serologic antibody response to identify Mycobacterium leprae proteins that are recognized by leprosy patients. More than 100 recombinant antigens were analyzed in a protein array format to select those with discriminatory properties for leprosy diagnosis. As expected, multibacillary leprosy patients recognized more antigens with stronger antibody responses than paucibacillary leprosy patients. Our data indicate, however, that multibacillary patients can be distinguished from paucibacillary patients, and both of these groups can be segregated from endemic control groups. We went on to confirm the diagnostic properties of antigens ML 0405 and ML 2331 and the LID- 1 fusion construct of these two proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We then demonstrated the performance of these antigens in rapid test formats with a goal of developing a <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test.</b> A serological diagnostic test capable of identifying and allowing treatment of leprosy could reduce transmission, prevent functional disabilities and stigmatizing deformities, and facilitate leprosy eradication...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{need for}} a rapid, {{inexpensive}} <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> for tuberculosis (TB). The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the performance of a novel rapid diagnostic test for TB, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, in symptomatic adults and to compare it to other commercially available nucleic acid amplification assays and to standard microbiological smear and culture. The GeneXpert system performs real time, nested PCR from sputum and provides a result within two hours of sampling. The result includes a semi-quantitative assessment of bacillary load in the sample and simultaneously detects rifampicin resistance. This study was part of a cross-sectional, multi-centre clinical trial. The Cape Town component of this study was conducted at three sites, one hospital based and other two community clinics, all with high TB/HIV coinfection rate. Among 43. 2 % of patients diagnosed with TB during the evaluation study, GeneXpert detected TB in 95. 5 % of all culture positive cases. In smear positive patients, sensitivity was 99. 0 % and in smear-negative, culture positive patients, 86. 1 %. Specificity in patients who were culture negative and clinically diagnosed as non-TB after follow up was 98. 4 %. Sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert in detecting rifampicin resistance was 100 % comparing to phenotypically detected drug resistance. GeneXpert is a highly promising novel tool for the rapid diagnosis of adult TB. Future studies are needed to establish the performance and impact of GeneXpert when performed at the level of the microscopy centre...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of effective diagnostic tools will be essential {{in the continuing}} fight to reduce schistosome infection; however, the diagnostic tests available to date are generally laborious and difficult to implement in current parasite control strategies. We generated a series of single-chain antibody Fv domain (scFv) phage display libraries from the portal lymph node of field exposed water buffaloes, Bubalus bubalis, 11 - 12 days post challenge with Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. The selected scFv-phages showed clear enrichment towards adult schistosomes and excretory-secretory (ES) proteins by immunofluorescence, ELISA and western blot analysis. The enriched libraries were used to probe a schistosome specific protein microarray resulting in the recognition {{of a number of}} proteins, five of which were specific to schistosomes, with RNA expression predominantly in the adult life-stage based on interrogation of schistosome expressed sequence tags (EST). As the libraries were enriched by panning against ES products, these antigens may be excreted or secreted into the host vasculature and hence may make good targets for a diagnostic assay. Further selection of the scFv library against infected mouse sera identified five soluble scFv clones that could selectively recognise soluble whole adult preparations (SWAP) relative to an irrelevant protein control (ovalbumin). Furthermore, two of the identified scFv clones also selectively recognised SWAP proteins when spiked into naïve mouse sera.

40|$|Abstract. Mutations in the {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) gene {{are associated with a}} favorable clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We present here, a new method for the rapid detection of the two most common EGFR mutations (delE 746 -A 750 and L 858 R) from clinical samples. The methodology involves the combination of newly designed mutation-specific primers and a novel real-time PCR machine with an innovative thermo-control mechanism that enables ultrarapid PCR. We evaluated this method using a cell mixture composed of various ratios of lung cancer cells harboring mutated or wild-type EGFR, lung cancer tissues obtained by surgery, and a cytology sample obtained by bronchoscopy from a lung cancer patient. In the cell mixture analysis, our method detected 0. 1 % of cells with delE 746 -A 750 and 1 % of cells with L 858 R among cells with wild-type EGFR. In 143 lung cancer tissues, the result of this assay was concordant with those of direct sequencing in 138 samples. The five samples with discordant results were tested using a PCR-Invader assay and the result matched those of our method at 100 %. We also successfully detected EGFR mutations in the lavage obtained from a lung cancer patient. The turnaround time for this method was < 10 min, and all steps could be accomplished in < 50 min after sample collection. Thus, our novel PCR method offers a rapid, simple, and less expensive test for EGFR mutations and can be applied as a <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

Vaginal and cervical swabs were collected from 230 consecutive women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic with reported symptoms of vaginal discharge and/or itching. Etiological testing was carried out. BV was diagnosed on the basis of the Nugent score, the Amsel clinical criteria, and results of FemExam card tests. Card 1 is for pH and amines, and card 2 measures proline iminopeptidase (PIP) activity. BV prevalence was 47. 9 % according to the Nugent score. When compared with the Nugent score, the Amsel clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 77. 9 % and specificity of 58. 4 %, FemExam card 1 had a sensitivity of 71. 4 % and specificity of 72. 8 %, FemExam card 2 had a sensitivity of 70 % and specificity of 81. 0 %, and FemExam cards 1 and 2 combined had a sensitivity of 91. 0 % and specificity of 61. 5 %. Cost per patient and cost per true case detected ranged from US $ 0. 74 and US $ 1. 54, respectively, for Gram stain diagnosis, to US $ 8. 32 and US $ 18. 49 for the FemExam two-card method.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL), {{a widely}} distributed systemic disease caused by infection with the Leishmania donovani complex (L. donovani and L. infantum), {{is almost always}} fatal if symptomatic and untreated. A rapid <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> for anti-Leishmania antibodies, the rK 39 -immunochromatographic test (rK 39 -ICT), has high sensitivity and specificity in South Asia but is less sensitive in East Africa. One of the underlying reasons may be continent-specific molecular diversity in the rK 39 antigen within the L. donovani complex. However, a second reason may be differences in specific IgG anti-Leishmania levels in patients from different geographical regions, either due to variable antigenicity or immunological response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined IgG titres of Indian and Sudanese VL patients against whole cell lysates of Indian and Sudanese L. donovani strains. Indian VL patients had significantly higher IgG titres against both L. donovani strains compared to Sudanese VL patients (p< 0. 0001). Mean reciprocal log 10 50 % end-point titres (1 /log 10 t 50) were i) 3. 80 and 3. 88 for Indian plasma and ii) 2. 13 and 2. 09 for Sudanese plasma against Indian and Sudanese antigen respectively (p< 0. 0001). Overall, the Indian VL patients therefore showed a 46. 8 - 61. 7 -fold higher mean ELISA titre than the Sudanese VL patients. The higher IgG titres occurred in children (< 16 years old) and adults of either sex from India (mean 1 /log 10 t 50 : 3. 60 - 4. 15) versus Sudan (mean 1 /log 10 t 50 : 1. 88 - 2. 54). The greatest difference in IgG responses was between male Indian and Sudanese VL patients of ≥ 16 years old (mean 1 /log 10 t 50 : 4. 15 versus 1. 99 = 144 -fold (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Anti-Leishmania IgG responses among VL patients in Sudan were significantly lower than in India; {{this may be due}} to chronic malnutrition with Zn(2 +) deficiency, or variable antigenicity and capacity to generate IgG responses to Leishmania antigens. Such differential anti-Leishmania IgG levels may contribute to lower sensitivity of the rK 39 -ICT in East Africa...|$|E
40|$|Most current {{non-invasive}} {{tests for}} Helicobacter pylori {{depend on the}} conversion of labelled (13 C or 14 C) urea to labelled carbon dioxide (13 CO 2 or 14 CO 2) and ammonium (NH 4 +) by the enzyme urease, with the labelled CO 2 detected in exhaled air. Despite suggestions going back {{over a number of}} years, the alternative possibility of using NH 4 + (in the form of gaseous ammonia [NH 3]) as the test parameter has received little or no attention. However, this approach is now being explored using a chemiresistive sensor detecting sub-parts per million concentrations of NH 3. An in vitro 'glass stomach' (containing various volumes of hydrochloric acid [HCl] and ammonium chloride [NH 4 Cl]) was used to evaluate the means of increasing 'gastric' pH to that of the NH 4 + [...] >NH 3 transition that occurs significantly at pH 9. 24. This 'stomach' also was used to study mechanisms by which NH 3 may be expelled in a pulse (as a surrogate belch), either by the in situ production of CO 2 or through an exogenous source. On the basis of the protocols developed, H. pylori-negative subjects were tested before and after ingestion of 10 mg NH 4 Cl (as a surrogate for bacteria-produced NH 4,), and H. pylori-positive subjects were tested without taking urea or NH 4 Cl. 'Intragastric' pH in the in vitro 'glass stomach' could be increased above pH 9. 24 by adding a mixture of 15 - 30 mL magnesium hydroxide mixture (or the proprietary equivalent) and 50 mL water, and the resulting NH 3 expelled by adding 100 mL CO 2 -saturated cold water (sparkling water). In vivo, NH 3 levels in the oral cavity of H. pylori-negative subjects were increased after ingestion of 10 mg NH 4 Cl; however, levels in the oral cavity of a small number of H. pylori-positive subjects were two- to threefold higher after magnesium hydroxide and sparkling water. On the basis of in vitro studies, an in vivo protocol was developed to increase gastric pH above that required for the NH 4 + [...] >NH 3 transition, and a mechanism established to release the NH 3 into the oral cavity. Preliminary in vivo data confirm the chemiresistive sensor is sufficiently sensitive to NH 3 to distinguish H. pylori-negative subjects who have taken 10 mg NH 4 Cl from those who have not, and clearly distinguish H. pylori-negative subjects from H. pylori-positive subjects. Ingestion of urea or other labelled tracers is not required, nor is belching; and the sensor takes less than two minutes to reach a maximum response. The data provide good evidence that the chemiresistive detection of NH 3 has considerable potential as a rapid, <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> for H. pylori infection...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} detection of infectious agents {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks in scenarios lacking well-equipped laboratory infrastructure, like diagnostics in rural areas of developing countries. Commercially available <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for emerging and rare diseases are particularly scarce. Results: In this work we present a point-of-care test for the detection of Orthopoxviruses (OPV). The OPV ABICAP assay detects down to 1 [*]×[*] 104 plaque forming units/mL of OPV particles within 45 min. It can be applied to clinical material like skin crusts and detects all zoonotic OPV infecting humans, including Vaccinia, Cowpox, Monkeypox, and most importantly Variola virus. Conclusions: Given the high sensitivity and the ease of handling, the novel assay could be highly useful for on-site diagnostics of suspected Monkeypox virus infections in areas lacking proper laboratory infrastructure as well as rapid on-site testing of suspected bioterrorism samples...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: John Bischof. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 216 pages. Nanomaterial research has grown exponentially for biomedical applications in imaging, diagnostics and therapeutics. Within these areas laser nanoparticle heating uniquely enables important applications including molecular delivery or destruction, endosomal release of genes or siRNA, and selective cell or tumor destruction, with nano to macro-scale spatiotemporal control and precision. While our studies were initially motivated to support in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications, further study of laser nanoparticle heat transfer at a fundamental level, suggested a further opportunity {{for use in}} point-of-care diagnostics, in particular for gold nanoparticle (GNP) based lateral flow assays. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) is a <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> that has found broad applications in medicine, agriculture, and over-the-counter personal use such as for pregnancy testing. Within the LFA, antibody-coated GNPs are used as reporters due to accumulation (i. e. antigen-antibody recognition) on a test line {{that leads to a}} visually detectable signal due to a deep red color indicative of GNP accumulation. However, one universally recognized limitation of LFA is the low sensitivity of this visual readout. In this work, we developed a low cost solution to this sensitivity using laser GNP heating. Specifically, metallic nanoparticles generate heat upon optical (i. e. laser) stimulation. This in turn can be used to enhance detection of GNPs, creating a thermal contrast amplification (TCA). We have shown that TCA improves the analytical sensitivity on several existing, commercial LFAs. For instance, our results show a 32 -fold improvement in analytical sensitivity using an FDA-approved cryptococcal antigen LFA. My dissertation then describes the development of TCA devices and components that will ultimately allow clinical, laboratory and eventually lay people alike to use and benefit from the technology. In particular, a benchtop TCA prototype device is described and engineering efforts continue to place TCA in a number of clinical laboratories and eventually create a product for infectious disease detection. The absorption and heat generation from nanoparticles eventually determine the magnitude of TCA. Thus, the use of higher heat generating nanoparticles can further improve the LFA sensitivity. Literature suggests that nanoparticle morphology {{plays an important role in}} the optical absorption, and nanorods absorb more light energy than nanospheres with the same amount of gold per particle based on previous calculations. Our study suggests that the optical absorption and extinction of gold nanorods are significantly reduced (more than 70 %) by polydispersity (i. e. distribution of size and shape) while relatively unaffected for gold nanospheres (less than 10 % change). This indicates that the expected enhancement due to absorption of gold nanorods over nanospheres may be greatly diminished by the presence of polydispersity in real nanoparticle samples. Further work incorporating higher heating gold nanoparticles (i. e. larger gold spheres and well characterized gold nanorods) to improve existing lateral flow assays such as to one day rival the sensitivity of more costly, time and labor intesive laboratory testing is underway. In summary, this dissertation describes the foundation of a new technology entitled: Thermal Contrast Amplication (TCA). TCA has been patented and licensed by a start up that is pursuing commercialization and broader societal impact of the technology. Future work including the development of a handheld TCA device for point-of-care diagnostics, and a next generation LFA optimized for TCA are underway. TCA and LFA together represent a potential disruptive platform technology that can improve early diagnosis of infectious diseases and general biomolecular screening in areas of medicine, agriculture, and biodefense where a quick and sensitive detection is needed...|$|E
40|$|Haemorrhagic {{septicaemia}} (HS) is {{an acute}} fatal septicaemic disease of cattle and buffaloes associated with strains of serotypes B: 2 and E: 2 of the bacterium Pasteurella multocida. Asia and Africa are currently the regions where HS occurs {{with the highest}} prevalence and has the greatest economic importance. There is currently only limited information available on the diversity of P. multocida strains that cause HS in these regions. A retrospective epidemiological case-control study was performed in Karachi, Pakistan from January to April 2013 looking at HS cases {{that occurred in the}} 2012 calendar year. The owners from 217 dairy cattle and dairy buffalo farms from six different locations around Karachi were interviewed. The study was based on a questionnaire that was designed to identify independent variables that were statistically associated with the presence of HS on the farm. The final multivariable logistic model contained five factors. Two protective factors were identified: HS vaccination (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0. 22) and the length of time cattle were kept on farm (months) : for every extra month cattle were kept, the odds of disease were reduced by a factor of 0. 9. In contrast, supplying underground water and the presence of foot and mouth disease on the farm increased the risk of infection by 2. 90 and 2. 37, respectively. In addition, for every extra animal on the farm, the risk of infection increased by a factor of 1. 01. To understand the epidemiology of HS in Karachi dairy herds more fully, further in-depth research is required to study the risk and protective factors identified in this survey and to evaluate risk mitigation strategies where possible. The study also showed the need for developing a <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> that can be used by veterinarians to diagnose the disease on the farm. Haemorrhagic septicaemia-associated strains of P. multocida were then analysed using molecular methods. Haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine strains and HS-associated field isolates were obtained from different places in Pakistan and as a comparison group, vaccine strains and HS-associated field strains were obtained from Thailand to investigate the genetic diversity of strains associated with the disease from two endemic countries. Initially, 21 field isolates and three vaccine strains from different regions within these countries were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The MLST technique was not able to differentiate between the strains from Pakistan and Thailand as all of the tested isolates (n = 21) were sequence type (ST) 122. The PFGE technique showed a difference of one band between the Thai and Pakistani isolates. Neither technique was able to show any variation between isolates from the same country. Based on the MLST and PFGE results, 12 of the 24 HS-associated strains were selected for next generation sequencing (NGS). Analyses of the genome data identified a core set of 1824 genes that were shared by the 12 HS-associated Asian strains, M 1404 (North American HS-associated strain), and the available P. multocida complete genomes of strains Pm 70, 3480, 36950 and HN 06. Four sets of unique genes were found. One set (96 genes) was shared by all HS-associated strains. The second set (59 genes) was shared by the Asian HS-associated strains only. The third set (39 genes) was shared by seven out of nine Pakistani HS-associated strains. The last set (42 genes) was shared by the remaining two Pakistani HS-associated strains that were studied. The set of 96 unique genes, found in all HS-associated strains but absent from the non-HS-associated strains Pm 70, 3480, 36950 and HN 06, was identified by the PHAST bacteriophage detection algorithm to encode two putative temperate phages. It seems reasonable to suspect that the presence of these putative prophages may provide virulence genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of HS. The set of 59 unique genes shared by the 12 Asian HS-associated strains but not the North American HS-associated strain M 1404, was also predicted to encode a temperate phage. Likewise, another putative temperate phage was predicted in the seven Pakistani strains that accounted for the set of 39 unique genes they shared. Interestingly, two Pakistani strains (BUKK and TX 1) carried acquired antimicrobial resistance genes as predicted by the Resfinder tool. BUKK and TX 1 strains shared 42 unique genes that were not present in any other HS strains. Some of these unique genes may contribute to a putative integrative conjugative element (ICE). The putative ICE of BUKK and TX 1 is not identical to ICEPmu 1, the first ICE that was found in P. multocida (strain 36950), and therefore, it may be the second ICE to be discovered in P. multocida strains. Phylogenetic analysis, predicted by analysis of core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms, demonstrated a strong correlation between the individual strains and their countries of origin. The Pakistani and Thai strains were more closely related to each other than the North American strain. Similarly, the isolates from Pakistan clustered together, and were distinctly separate from Thai isolates. A specific rapid diagnostic test, based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), for HS-associated B: 2 strains, was developed using the previously-identified 96 unique genes obtained from NGS. Duplicates of each reaction were run, and this allowed two different definitions of a positive result to be applied to the experimental data. The first definition, “singlets”, treated each reaction tube as an independent entity. The second definition, “duplicates”, required that both tubes containing the same reactants must be positive for the overall reaction to be considered positive. The best sensitivity and specificity for HS-LAMP singlets (96. 7...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFungi {{are major}} {{contributors}} to the opportunistic infections that affect patients with HIV/AIDS. Systemic infections are mainly with Pneumocystis jirovecii (pneumocystosis), Cryptococcus neoformans (cryptococcosis), Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis), and Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei (talaromycosis). The incidence of systemic fungal infections has decreased in people with HIV in high-income countries because of the widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs and early testing for HIV. However, in many areas with high HIV prevalence, patients present to care with advanced HIV infection and with a low CD 4 cell count or represent with persistent low CD 4 cell counts because of poor adherence, resistance to antiretroviral drugs, or both. Affordable, rapid <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> (as {{have been developed for}} cryptococcosis) are urgently needed for pneumocystosis, talaromycosis, and histoplasmosis. Additionally, antifungal drugs, including amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, and flucytosine, need to be much more widely available. Such measures, together with continued international efforts in education and training in the management of fungal disease, have the potential to improve patient outcomes substantially...|$|R
40|$|Background. A {{number of}} <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> are commercially {{available}} in the UK, however, not much is known regarding GPs’ desire for these tests or the clinical areas of interest. Objective. We sought to establish for which conditions point-of-care tests (POCTs) would be most helpful to UK GPs for diagnosis, reduction of referrals, and monitoring of chronic conditions. Methods. A total of 1635 regionally representative GPs were invited to complete an online crosssectional survey between 31 September and 16 October 2012. Results. A total of 1109 (68 %) GPs responded to the survey. The most frequently cited conditions were urinary tract infections for diagnosis (47 % of respondents), pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis for referral reduction (47 %) and international normalized ratio/anticoagulation for monitoring (49 %). Conclusions. This survey has identified the conditions for which UK GPs would find POCTs most helpful. Comments by respondents suggest that quite radical system-level adjustments {{will be required to}} allow primary care clinicians to capitalize on the potential benefits of POCTs...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis {{is unique}} {{among the major}} {{infectious}} diseases in that it lacks accurate rapid <b>point-of-care</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> Failure to control the spread of tuberculosis {{is largely due to}} our inability to detect and treat all infectious cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in a timely fashion, allowing continued Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission within communities. Currently recommended gold-standard <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for tuberculosis are laboratory based, and multiple investigations may be necessary over a period of weeks or months before a diagnosis is made. Several new <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> have recently become available for detecting active tuberculosis disease, screening for latent M. tuberculosis infection, and identifying drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. However, progress toward a robust point-of-care test has been limited, and novel biomarker discovery remains challenging. In the absence of effective prevention strategies, high rates of early case detection and subsequent cure are required for global tuberculosis control. Early case detection is dependent on test accuracy, accessibility, cost, and complexity, but also depends on the political will and funder investment to deliver optimal, sustainable care to those worst affected by the tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus epidemics. This review highlights unanswered questions, challenges, recent advances, unresolved operational and technical issues, needs, and opportunities related to tuberculosis diagnostic...|$|R
