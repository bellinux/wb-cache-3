5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low <b>platelet</b> <b>counts,</b> poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E
5|$|While heparin was {{introduced}} {{for clinical use}} in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features {{were the result of}} an immune process.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low <b>platelet</b> <b>counts.</b> Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{performed}} a retrospective study on patients with {{idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (ITP) to evaluate the response to splenectomy in relation to preoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> Materials and Methods: Two groups of patients oper-ated on with laparoscopic or open splenectomy for ITP, with a <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> 30, 000 /L (study group: 22 pa-tients) and 30, 000 /L (control group: 18 patients), re-spectively, were compared. The two groups were homo-geneous in relation to age, sex, length of preoperative steroid therapy, and time interval between diagnosis and surgery (Student t test with P. 1). The results of surgery were evaluated at one year after splenectomy. Positive response to surgery, according to the American Society of Hematologic Guidelines, was considered in patients with a postoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> 100, 000 /L or in patients with a postoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> 30, 000 /L and a twofold increase in <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> from baseline, {{in the absence of}} bleeding. The postoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> increase rate was statis-tically related to preoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> in both the study and control groups. Statistical analysis was per-formed using the Student’s t test for independent sample and the Pearson correlation in a 2 -tailed test. Results: No relationship between preoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> and postoperative <b>platelet</b> percent increase was observed in the control group (r – 0. 41; P. 089), whereas a significant negative correlation (r – 0. 68; P. 0004) was found in the study group. Conclusions: A higher increase of postoperative percent <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> may be predicted in patients with a low preoperative <b>platelet</b> <b>count...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> in 110 {{patients}} with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was analyzed retrospectively. Changes in the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> in 102 patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm surgery {{showed that the}} minimum <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> was similar in {{patients with}} and without symptomatic vasospasm, but the minimum occurred later in symptomatic vasospasm patients, regardless of Hunt and Hess grade or operation timing. Sixty-five of 67 non-symptomatic vasospasm patients (97 %) showed the minimum <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> within 4 days of SAH and two (3 %) on the 5 th day. In contrast, only 10 of 35 symptomatic vasospasm patients (29 %) showed a minimum <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> within 4 days after SAH and 25 (71 %) between the 5 th and 11 th days. Analysis of the eight patients not receiving surgery showed that the minimum <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> occurred 2 days after SAH in two non-symptomatic vasospasm patients, but after the 5 th day in five of six symptomatic vasospasm patients. Therefore, monitoring of the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> can provide {{an indicator of the}} occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm...|$|R
25|$|With rare exceptions, {{there is}} usually no need to treat based on <b>platelet</b> <b>counts.</b> Many older {{recommendations}} suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/µl) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment only in cases of significant bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia* is {{a common}} {{condition}} in dogs characterized by low <b>platelet</b> <b>counts.</b> Platelets are used in clotting the blood, so dogs with this condition may have spontaneous bleeding or prolonged bleeding following surgery, injury, or during an estrous cycle.

25|$|The risk to asplenic {{patients}} {{has been}} expressed as equivalent {{to an adult}} dying in a road traffic accident (in every 100 people without spleens, 1 to 5 would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK Splenectomy Trust Advice)hence sensible precautions are advisable. Increased <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> {{can be seen in}} individuals without a functioning spleen.|$|E
30|$|Thrombocytopenia {{was defined}} as a <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> ≤ 150, 000 /mm 3. We {{considered}} thrombocytopenic patients in 4 groups: <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> < 50, 000 /mm 3 or [50, 000 – 100, 000]/mm 3 or [100, 000 – 150, 000]/mm 3 or > 150, 000 /mm 3. Patients were compared according to their <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> using appropriate bivariate tests. Variables associated with the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> with a p value < 0.25 by bivariate analyses were included in a multivariate polytomic logistic regression to estimate their independent effect on <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> The probability of death at 28  days was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.

40|$|Background Pretreatment <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} as a potential tool to predict survival outcome in several solid tumors. However, the predictive value of pretreatment <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> remains obscure in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (M 3). Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 209 patients with de novo non-M 3 AML in our institute {{over a period of}} 8 years (2007 – 2015). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal platelet (PLT) cutoff in patients. We analyzed the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) using the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. Results By defining the <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> 50 ×  109 /L and 120 ×  109 /L as two cut-off points, we categorized the patients into three groups: low (120 ×  109 /L). On univariate analysis, patients with medium <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> had longer OS and DFS than those with low or high <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> However, the multivariate analysis showed that only longer DFS was observed in patients with medium <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> than those with low or high <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> Conclusion Our findings indicate that pretreatment <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> has a predictive value for the prognosis of patients with non-M 3 AML...|$|R

25|$|Eltrombopag (trade name Promacta in the USA, Revolade in the EU) is an orally-administered {{agent with}} an effect {{similar to that}} of romiplostim. It too has been {{demonstrated}} to increase <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> and decrease bleeding in a dose-dependent manner. Developed by GlaxoSmithKline and also designated an orphan drug by the FDA, Promacta was approved by the FDA on November 20, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cases of}} ITP {{can be left}} untreated, and {{spontaneous}} remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts of under 50,000 are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts of under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such a low platelet count. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> greater than 10,000, although there are documented exceptions to this observation.|$|E
25|$|The CBC {{provides}} a quantified {{measure of the}} different cells in the whole blood sample from the patient. Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is anaemia whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells. CBC tests are vital as a screening tool for examination the health of patient prior to surgery. Inconsistencies with <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) should be considered.|$|E
40|$|Background: Elevated <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> is {{associated}} with risk of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients initiating chemotherapy. It is not known whether this risk by <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> is causal or merely reflects the malignant disease. We investigated whether pre-cancer <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> alone or together with high leukocyte count was associated with risk of venous thromboembolism in subjects who did and did not develop cancer during follow-up in a population-based cohort study. Methods: <b>Platelet</b> <b>count</b> and other baseline characteristics were measured in 25160 initially cancer-free subjects {{who participated in the}} Tromsø Study in 1994 – 1995. Incident cancer and symptomatic venous thromboembolism events were registered up to December 31 st, 2009. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratio for venous thromboembolism across categories of <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> (, 40 th, 40 – 80 th, and. 80 th percentile) with 95 % confidence interval. Results: During follow-up, 2082 subjects were diagnosed with cancer. <b>Platelet</b> <b>count</b> was measured on average 8. 3 years before the cancer diagnosis. There were 129 venous thromboembolism events in the cancer cohort (13. 5 per 1000 personyears) and 377 in the non-cancer cohort (1. 2 per 1000 person-years). In cancer patients, pre-cancer <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> above the 80 th percentile ($ 2956109 /L) was associated with a 2 -fold higher risk of venous thromboembolism (Hazard ratio: 1. 98, 95 % confidence interval 1. 21 – 3. 23) compared to <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> below the 40 th percentile (, 2356109 /L). Concomitant high <b>platelet</b> and leukocyte <b>counts</b> showed a synergistic effect on the VTE risk. In cancer-free subjects, no association was found. Comment: In conclusion, pre-cancer <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> was associated with risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in cancer patients, but not in cancer-free subjects. Our findings suggest that <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> and platelet-leukocyte interactions {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of cancer-related venous thromboembolism...|$|R

25|$|In adults, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} areas with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and {{has been associated with}} peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe. In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{tests in}} PNH show changes {{consistent}} with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; {{there can be}} raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) {{if there is no}} iron deficiency present. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force {{the patient to}} medical care, are often the consequence of lower <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma. Patients may also report signs and symptoms {{as a result of}} (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and pallor. Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG-changes).|$|E
