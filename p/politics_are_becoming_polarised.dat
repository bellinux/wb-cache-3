More attention is paid to the former group than to the latter because commentators tend to believe that their situation is more problematic. During the period 1986 - 87 to 1998 - 99 the proportion of the labour force working long hours (45 +) increased far more than the proportion working fewer than 35 hours. This trend was particularly marked for older men and to a lesser degree for older married women. In 1998 - 99, more than 47 per cent of men in the labour-force aged 45 - 54 worked for longer than the standard working week, compared to just under 36 per cent in 1986 - 87...|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless, by 1953 <b>politics</b> <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> less European dominated, and the PPT was {{emerging}} as the major rival of the UDT.

The PPT originated as a territorial branch of the RDA and rapidly became the political vehicle of the country's non-Muslim intellectuals. Traditional rulers perceived the PPT to be antithetical to their interests and recognized that the local territorial assembly could adversely affect their revenue and power. These factors persuaded traditional rulers to become more active in the UDT, which, because of internal divisions, had changed its name in the late 1950s to the Chadian Social Action (Action Sociale Tchadienne or AST).|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{workplace}} skills <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more <b>polarised</b> in Britain. This tendency is sometimes considered to be a factor contributing to the process of social exclusion and growing wage inequality. Skill polarisation has therefore been the focus of renewed academic and - since the election of the Labour government - political interest. In some respects, previous survey evidence for the 1980 s can be used to support the skill polarisation thesis. This paper investigates whether the process has continued into the 1990 s among those in work. Our main finding is that there has been no overriding process of skill polarisation between 1992 and 1997. However, the picture is complex, with losers as well as winners. Among the winners are full-timers, employees and those employed by 'modern' organisations. The losers, on the other hand, include those in part-time work, the self-employed and those employed in organisations with less progressive management practices...|$|R

40|$|Modern <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{increasingly}} personalized. The {{personal qualities}} of political candidates, in fact, {{account for a}} considerable amount {{of the variance in the}} candidate preference of voters, often more than the political issues in their electoral programs. Despite the emphasis that both the media and campaign leaders place on the ways in which the personalities of politicians are portrayed, people tend to view the personalities of politicians in remarkably simple ways. Here we show that, although people tend to use five personality dimensions to characterize their own personalities, they rely upon only two dimensions to characterize the personalities of politicians. This finding holds across countries (i. e., Italy and the US), and across political figures (i. e., Prodi and Berlusconi in Italy, and Bush and Kerry in the US). The two factors obtained from evaluations of Prodi, Berlusconi, and Kerry were respectively a blend of Energy/Extraversion and Openness and a blend of Friendliness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability. The two factors obtained from evaluations of the US president, though, were respectively a blend of Openness, Conscientiousness, and Friendliness, and a blend of Energy/Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and Friendliness. Thus, the present study is novel in suggesting that while the personalities of politicians may be reduced by voters, they are not always reduced to the same basic factors. Alternative explanations of this "simplification effect" are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In 2006, India began {{formally}} reconstructing {{its national}} food safety policy, subsuming over seven laws and agencies {{into a single}} streamlined regulatory authority. This moment of reform offers a "most likely" test case for theories of global policy convergence. Scholars across multiple fields predict that national <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more similar over time.

The dissertation asks whether, how, and why we see both global pressures for and actual evidence of convergence in the Indian case. I ask if the details of the case map onto the prevailing account in sociology, which predicts convergence as a result of spreading political culture; the sociology of food's broad predictions of both convergence and low political autonomy vis a vis global trade mandates; or the prevailing account in political science, which sees domestic regulatory change as a result of global competitions for consumer markets. I find very limited convergence in the Indian case, mostly limited to a nascent movement toward norms of "science-based" regulation. I also find that theories of regulatory competition best explain why India has converged to the extent it has, though the case suggests new causal mechanisms whereby trade agreements and economic competition generate regulatory change...|$|R

40|$|Research on Brazilian {{federalism}} {{and state}} politics has focused {{mainly on the}} impact of federal arrangements on national political systems, whereas comparative analyses of the workings of state political institutions and patterns of political competition and decision-making have often been neglected. The article contributes to an emerging comparative literature on state politics by developing a typology that systematizes the variation in political competitiveness and the extent of state elites’ control over the electoral arena across Brazilian states. It relies on factor analysis to create an index of “electoral dominance”, comprised of a set of indicators of party and electoral competitiveness at the state level, which measures state elites’ capacity to control the state electoral arena over time. Based on this composite index and on available case-study evidence, the article applies the typological classificatory scheme to all 27 Brazilian states. Further, the article relies on the typological classification to assess the recent evolution of state-level political competitiveness. The empirical analysis demonstrates that state <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more competitive and fragmented, including in those states that have been characterized as bastions of oligarchism and political bossism. In view of these findings, the article argues that the power of state political machines rests on fragile foundations: in Brazil’s multiparty federalism, vertical competition between the federal and state governments in the provision of social policies works as a constraint on state bosses’ machine-building strategies. It is concluded that our previous views on state political dynamics are in serious need of re-evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine celebrity {{candidates}} in the European Parliament election in Sweden and Finland. The theoretical background assumes that candidate voting is beneficial in the election to the European Parliament. Previous research also shows that there are some opponents towards candidate voting, claiming it personalizes politics and it might lead to celebrities getting elected simply because they are well known to the voters. This study is a comparative analysis and analyzes the differences between Sweden and Finland when it comes to celebrity candidates. Furthermore, Max Weber’s theory on leadership will be used to categorize the celebrity candidates further. Weber’s ”rational leader” and ”charismatic leader” can today be referred to as the competent politician and the celebrity. The identified celebrity candidates in Sweden and Finland will thus be categorized as whether they are also competent politicians. The result of the analysis shows that celebrity candidates are fairly common in Finland but barely exists in Sweden. However, not many of these candidates actually get elected; only one celebrity candidate from Sweden and four from Finland. All but one is considered to be both charismatic and competent. The conclusion is that celebrity candidates do not get elected based only on them being a celebrity. They also have to be considered competent leaders. However, being a charismatic and personal candidate is getting more and more important as <b>politics</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more personalized, but simply being a celebrity will not get you a seat in the European Parliament. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to why multilevel <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> an integral part of politics in Europe. Multilevel <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> conceptualized as a system which functions through a complex web of political relations within and across levels of decision making. The thesis argues that the rise of multilevel <b>politics</b> can <b>be</b> explained by its institutionalization in terms of the emergence, the evolution and especially the effects of relevant institutions. Based on a mixed-method research project, the influence of European institutions on subnational actors and the alignment of actor motives with institutional characteristics are empirically shown. The first chapter of the dissertation establishes the centrality of institutions for political transformation, examines the role of transnational and domestic institutions for multilevel politics, and contextualizes the research question in terms of institution-actor relations. The second chapter develops a new-institutionalist theoretical framework that explains the emergence, the evolution and the effects of the institutions, and formulates a series of hypotheses with regard to freestanding institutional influence, power distribution, material benefits and political identification. The third chapter outlines the mixed-method research design which addresses individual-level and institutional-level variations through a Europe-wide survey and a comparative case study. The fourth chapter on survey results shows generally favourable views on multilevel politics, and strong associations of these views with the independent variables under scrutiny. The fifth chapter specifies a multivariate model which includes all posited variables and confirms the majority of the hypotheses. Therefore, the new-institutionalist argument is broadly confirmed, while there is relatively weak evidence to sustain sociological explanations. The final chapter compares the Committee of the Regions and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, and examines the institutional characteristics which correspond to the hypothesized variables. It is then concluded that the two institutions share several overarching similarities, and display complementarity in other aspects.

40|$|The {{research}} is an in-depth, empirical {{study of the}} political behaviour of the Church of Scotland; it is primarily intended as {{a contribution to the}} territorial field of Scottish politics. The most important aim of the thesis is to assess the overall effectiveness of the Church of Scotland when it takes part in political activities. More generally, the research has three key themes: first, it examines the place of religion in politics by analysing churches as political pressure groups rather than simply looking at voting behaviour; second, it looks at the development of the new Scottish political system, post-devolution; third, it explicitly compares the political behaviour of the Church of Scotland with the Scottish Catholic Church. Chapter two focuses on the political behaviour of the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland and concludes that its effectiveness is limited, primarily due to a shift in societal values. Chapter three focuses on the political behaviour of the Board of Social Responsibility of the Church of Scotland and concludes that is possesses more potential for influence than the Committee, {{due to the nature of}} the issues it is concerned with. Chapter four compares and contrasts the political behaviour of the Church of Scotland with the Scottish Catholic Church, and concludes that the latter is often more effective than the former when they act as political pressure groups. Chapter five analyses the results of the elite survey questionnaires and interviews; one of its main conclusions is that while most Scottish politicians believe the Church of Scotland to be influential, they do not perceive themselves to be personally influenced. The thesis argues that the political influence of the Church of Scotland is varied, depending on which area of policy is being addressed, and the place of religion generally in Scottish <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly peripheral.

40|$|The {{decline in}} {{traditional}} rural services namely the pub, Post Office and shop {{and the rise}} of ‘new’ niche entrepreneurial ventures has led to some villages taking on a different socio-economic identity.

One solution is for traditional service providers to draw upon their entrepreneurial skills to respond to the new opportunities associated with a rural economy that is increasingly driven by consumption demand (Slee, 2005), thus helping to ensure their viability and sustainability.
