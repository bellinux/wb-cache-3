5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} <b>pit</b> stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a <b>pit</b> stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a <b>pit</b> stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made <b>pit</b> stops. Button made a <b>pit</b> stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on <b>pit</b> boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their <b>pit</b> stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second <b>pit</b> stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the <b>pit</b> lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a <b>pit</b> stop, on lap 33.|$|E

Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the <b>pit</b> lane, triggering the second round of <b>pit</b> stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a <b>pit</b> stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their <b>pit</b> stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's <b>pit</b> stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the <b>pit</b> lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate vibration signals of gears with tooth <b>pitting</b> covering multiple teeth, investigate <b>pitting</b> effects on vibration properties and provide effective features for <b>pitting</b> growth estimation. The scope of this paper is limited to a fixed-axis gearbox with a single pair of spur gears. A dynamic model is used to investigate the effects of tooth <b>pitting</b> growth on vibration properties of a gearbox. The tooth <b>pitting</b> propagation to the neighboring teeth is modeled. Three <b>pitting</b> levels are modeled: slight <b>pitting,</b> moderate <b>pitting</b> and severe <b>pitting.</b> The vibration signals of a gearbox are simulated for each of the three severity levels. The vibration properties are investigated and fault symptoms are summarized. Statistical features are tested on simulated vibration signals. These features are ranked for <b>pitting</b> growth estimation. The features insensitive to gear mesh damping and environmental noise are recommended.|$|R
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} <b>pit</b> stop on lap 22. However, his <b>pit</b> stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his <b>pit</b> box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his <b>pit</b> stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his <b>pit</b> stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the <b>pit</b> lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his <b>pit</b> box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the <b>pit</b> lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a <b>pit</b> stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a <b>pit</b> stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his <b>pit</b> box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his <b>pit</b> stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled <b>pit</b> stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident.

30|$|Eight mesh periods (see Figure  4) are {{analyzed}} in Table  2 because only the mesh stiffness of these eight mesh periods {{may be affected}} in our model during one revolution of the pinion. One mesh period is defined as an angular displacement of the pinion experiencing a double-tooth-pair meshing duration and a single-tooth-pair meshing duration. For double-tooth-pair meshing durations, 4, 6 and 8 mesh periods have mesh stiffness reduction caused by slight <b>pitting,</b> moderate <b>pitting</b> and severe <b>pitting,</b> respectively. The maximum averaged mesh stiffness reduction in a double-tooth-pair meshing duration is 1.57 %, 4.26 % and 19.02 % corresponding to slight <b>pitting,</b> moderate <b>pitting</b> and severe <b>pitting,</b> respectively. While for single-tooth-pair meshing durations, 3, 5 and 7 mesh periods experience mesh stiffness reduction corresponding to slight <b>pitting,</b> moderate <b>pitting</b> and severe <b>pitting,</b> respectively. The maximum averaged mesh stiffness reduction in a single-tooth-pair meshing duration is 11.61 %, 55.33 % and 55.83 % related to slight <b>pitting,</b> moderate <b>pitting</b> and severe <b>pitting,</b> respectively. For each mesh period, the stiffness reduction in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration is larger than that in the double-tooth-pair meshing duration for two reasons: (a) the <b>pitting</b> mostly appear around the pitch line and the pitch line lies on the single-tooth-pair meshing duration, and (b) the perfect gear has a smaller averaged mesh stiffness in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration than the double-tooth-pair meshing duration. In the following section, the <b>pitting</b> effect on the vibration properties of a spur gearbox will be investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{sea urchin}} Anthocidaris crassispina (A. Agassiz) lives either in small <b>pits</b> {{or outside the}} <b>pits</b> on rock surfaces. Difference in {{movement}} between individuals living {{inside and outside the}} <b>pits</b> was investigated. Sea urchins living inside the <b>pits</b> never moved out of their <b>pits</b> either in summer or winter, or during the day or night, while urchins living outside the <b>pits</b> moved in both seasons, especially during the night. Among urchins living outside the <b>pits,</b> individuals occupying relatively sheltered microhabitats (hollows or edges; see Fig. 1) exhibited less movement than individuals occupying open flats. On transplantation to an open area without <b>pits,</b> some individuals previously occupying the <b>pits</b> showed slight movement. On the other hand, most of the individuals previously outside the <b>pits,</b> when transplanted into an area with many vacant <b>pits,</b> occupied them and showed reduced movement, although neither transplanted groups of individuals adjusted their movement perfectly to their new microhabitats during the observation period. These results suggest that the movement of the sea urchins is, to some extent, flexible and dependent on microhabitats and that they preferred sheltered microhabitats. A morphological and physiological investigation showed that sea urchins inside the <b>pits</b> had similar gut weight (with the content), shorter lateral spines and heavier gonads than sea urchins outside the <b>pits</b> of similar test diameter. The adaptive significance of pit-dwelling in A. crassispina is discussed...|$|R
30|$|This study investigates {{effects of}} <b>pitting</b> growth on {{vibration}} properties of a spur gearbox and tests {{the effectiveness of}} 114 features to estimate the <b>pitting</b> growth.
