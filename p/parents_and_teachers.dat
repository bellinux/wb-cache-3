5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

40|$|Background Differential ratings by {{multiple}} informants {{are an important}} issue in survey design.

Aim To examine differences in <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> ratings of school readiness of children from a disadvantaged community. Sample Participants were 94 <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>teachers</b> in a disadvantaged community in urban Ireland who completed a survey regarding the school readiness of 94 and 101 children respectively ranging in age from four to six years old. Method School readiness was assessed using <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> reports on the Short Early Development Instrument (S-EDI) which measures school readiness across the domains of physical health and well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, and communication and general knowledge.

A second purpose was to investigate the association between the integrity with which interventions were implemented and treatment acceptability. More specifically, the relationships between <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> treatment integrity <b>and</b> (a) time to effectiveness; and (b) intervention difficulty were examined. An A/B design was used and participants included 12 children, their <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> their <b>teachers.</b> Results indicate that <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> treatment integrity was moderately related to the effectiveness of interventions. Results also indicate that treatment integrity <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> perceptions of treatment acceptability were minimally related. However, strong relationships were found between treatment integrity <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> perceptions of time to effectiveness and a moderate relationship was found with treatment integrity <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> ratings of program difficulty. Moreover, the directions of the treatment integrity relationships with treatment acceptability and intervention difficulty factors were in the direction hypothesized with the exception of teacher perceptions of treatment acceptability.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the clinical utility of behavior ratings made by nonclinician examiners during assessments of preschool children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). Matched samples {{of children with}} (n = 127) and without (n = 125) AD/HD were utilized to test the internal, convergent, concurrent, and incremental validity of ratings completed by examiners on the Hillside Behavior Rating Scale (HBRS).

HBRS ratings also were significantly associated with other measures of functioning, and provided a significant increment in the prediction of impairment over <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> report alone. These findings suggest that behavioral ratings during testing provide a unique source of clinical information that may be useful as a supplement to <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> reports.

40|$|Shyness in {{childhood}} {{has been linked}} to multiple adjustment outcomes, including poor peer relations, internalizing problems, and clinical anxiety. However, shyness does not consistently emerge as a negative predictor of children’s success. This incongruity may stem, in part, from variations in the operationalization and measurement of shyness in different studies. Researchers often combine <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> ratings of shyness, but correlations between <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> reports are consistently small to medium. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> ratings of shyness as they predict language and attention skills in preschool children, and explore discrepancies between <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> ratings of shyness. Participants were 104 preschool children (48 males, 56 females), enrolled in 22 classrooms. Results from multi-level modeling revealed that teacher, but not parent, ratings of shyness using the shyness subscale of the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) were significantly and negatively associated with children’s early language and attention skills. Follow-up exploratory factor analyses with <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> CBQ shyness subscale ratings revealed a similar two-factor structure reflecting shyness and low sociability. Results suggest that a) discrepancies between parents’ and teachers’ views of children’s shy behaviors may stem from the different contexts and developmental time periods in which they observe children, and b) teachers’ ratings of shyness are more closely associated with children’s skills in an academic setting.
