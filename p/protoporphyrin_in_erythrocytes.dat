40|$|The porphyries are a {{group of}} {{metabolic}} disorders characterized by deficiencies in the activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heme. In erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), {{in the majority of}} cases an autosomal dominant disease, there is a mutation of the gene that encodes ferrochelatase (FECH). FECH deficiency is associated with increased concentrations of <b>protoporphyrin</b> <b>in</b> <b>erythrocytes,</b> plasma, skin and liver. The prevalence of this inherited disorder oscillates between 1 : 75 000 and 1 : 200 000. Clinical manifestations of EPP appear in early infancy upon first exposure to the sun. Nevertheless, approximately 5 %- 20 % of patients with EPP develop liver manifestations. Retention of protoporphyrin in the liver is associated with cholestatic phenomena and oxidative stress that predisposes to hepatobiliary disease of varying degrees of severity, such as cholelithiasis, mild parenchymal liver disease, progressive hepatocellular disease with end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Liver damage is the major risk in EPP patients, so surveillance and frequent clinical and biochemical liver follow-up is mandatory. The diagnostic approach consists in detecting increased levels of protoporphyrin, decreased activity of FECH and genetic analysis of the FECH gene. A variety of non-surgical therapeutic approaches have been adopted for the management of EPP associated with liver disease, but none of these {{has been shown to be}} unequivocally efficacious. Nevertheless, some may have a place in preparing patients for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation does not correct the constitutional deficiency of FECH.

Main Outcomes Measures Measurement of <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentration <b>in</b> red blood cells and feces by fluorometry and chromatography. Analysis of the mutations of the FECH gene by single-strand conformation analysis. Expression of mutations in Escherichia coli. Results FECH gene mutations were found in all 11 patients.

One patient did not present the IVS 3 - 48 C polymorphism and was found to harbor a novel A 185 T missense mutation in both alleles. The familial study confirmed a recessive mode of inheritance of the disease. The A 185 T mutation showed a residual activity 4 % of normal when expressed in E coli.

40|$|International audienceErythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an {{inherited}} disorder of the haem metabolic pathway characterised by accumulation of <b>protoporphyrin</b> <b>in</b> blood, <b>erythrocytes</b> and tissues, and cutaneous manifestations of photosensitivity. EPP {{has been reported}} worldwide, with prevalence between 1 : 75, 000 and 1 : 200, 000. It usually manifests in early infancy upon the first sun exposures. EPP is characterised by cutaneous manifestations of acute painful photosensitivity with erythema and oedema, sometimes with petechiae, together with stinging and burning sensations upon exposure to sunlight, without blisters. These episodes have a variable severity depending on the exposure duration and may result in chronic permanent lesions on exposed skin. As protoporphyrin is a lipophilic molecule that is excreted by the liver, EPP patients {{are at risk of}} cholelithiasis with obstructive episodes, and chronic liver disease that might evolve to rapid acute liver failure. In most patients, EPP results from a partial deficiency of the last enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway, ferrochelatase, EC 4. 99. 1. 1 /FECH (encoded by the FECH gene). EPP appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, the clinical expression of which is modulated by the presence of the hypomorphic FECH IVS 3 - 48 C allele trans, but recessive inheritance with two mutated FECH alleles has also been described. In about 2 % of patients, overt disease was recently shown to be caused by gain-of-function mutations in the erythroid-specific aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (ALAS 2 /ALAS, EC 2. 3. 1. 27) gene and named X-linked dominant protoporphyria. Diagnosis is established by finding increased levels of <b>protoporphyrin</b> <b>in</b> plasma and red blood cells, and detection of a plasma fluorescence peak at 634 nm. Investigations for hepatic involvement, ferrochelatase activity level, genetic analysis (FECH mutations, presence of the hypomorphic FECH IVS 3 - 48 C allele trans and ALAS 2 mutations) and family studies are advisable. Differential diagnosis includes phototoxic drug reactions, hydroa vacciniforme, solar urticaria, contact dermatitis, angio-oedema and, in some cases, other types of porphyria. Management includes avoidance of exposure to light, reduction of protoporphyrin levels and prevention of progression of possible liver disease to liver failure. As the major risk in EPP patients is liver disease, a regular follow-up of hepatic involvement is essential. Sequential hepatic and bone marrow transplantation should be considered as a suitable treatment for most severe cases of EPP with hepatic involvement.

This suggests that all the information required for mitochondrial localisation resides within the first 62 amino acid presequence. A missense mutation, P 62 R, predicted to be located within the ferrochelatase presequence has been identified in a patient with EPP.

Our data showed that this mutated full-length ferrochelatase successfully targeted to mitochondria.

Liver disease may occur {{in patients with}} EPP, some of whom develop progressive liver failure that necessitates transplantation. We investigated the mechanisms underlying EPP-associated liver disease in a mouse model of EPP. METHODS: Liver histology, indicators of lipid peroxidation, plasma parameters of liver function, and bile composition were studied in mice homozygous (fch/fch) for a point mutation in the ferrochelatase gene and in heterozygous (fch/+) and wild-type (+/+) mice. RESULTS: Microscopic examination showed bile duct proliferation and biliary fibrosis with portoportal bridging in fch/fch mice. PP content was 130 -fold increased, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (+ 30 %) and conjugated dienes (+ 75 %) were slightly higher in fch/fch than in fch/+ and +/+ livers. Levels of hepatic thiols (- 12 %) and iron (- 52 %) were reduced in fch/fch livers. Liver enzymes and plasma bilirubin were markedly increased in the homozygotes. Plasma bile salt levels were 80 times higher in fch/fch than in fch/+ and +/+ mice, probably related {{to the absence of}} the Na(+) -taurocholate cotransporting protein (Ntcp) in fch/fch liver. Paradoxically, bile flow was not impaired and biliary bile salt secretion was 4 times higher in fch/fch mice than in controls. Up-regulation of the intestinal Na(+) -dependent bile salt transport system in fch/fch mice may enhance efficiency of bile salt reabsorption. The bile salt/lipid ratio and PP content of fch/fch bile were increased 2 -fold and 85 -fold, respectively, compared with +/+, whereas biliary glutathione was reduced by 90 %. Similar effects on bile formation were caused by griseofulvin-induced inhibition of ferrochelatase activity in control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Bile formation is strongly affected in mice with impaired ferrochelatase activity. Rather than peroxidative processes, formation of cytotoxic bile with high concentrations of bile salts and PP may cause biliary fibrosis in fch/fch mice by damaging bile duct epithelium...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{activity}} of ferrochelatase in erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) results <b>in</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> (PP) accumulation <b>in</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> and liver. Liver disease may occur {{in patients with}} EPP, some of whom develop progressive liver failure that necessitates transplantation. We investigated the mechanisms underlying EPP-associated liver disease in a mouse model of EPP. Liver histology, indicators of lipid peroxidation, plasma parameters of liver function, and bile composition were studied in mice homozygous (fch/fch) for a point mutation in the ferrochelatase gene and in heterozygous (fch/+) and wild-type (+/+) mice. Microscopic examination showed bile duct proliferation and biliary fibrosis with portoportal bridging in fch/fch mice. PP content was 130 -fold increased, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (+ 30 %) and conjugated dienes (+ 75 %) were slightly higher in fch/fch than in fch/+ and +/+ livers. Levels of hepatic thiols (- 12 %) and iron (- 52 %) were reduced in fch/fch livers. Liver enzymes and plasma bilirubin were markedly increased in the homozygotes.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the amount of <b>protoporphyrin</b> <b>in</b> epidermis, blood plasma, and blister fluid has been developed. Epidermis was obtained in a simple way by making suction blisters. The protoporphyrin was extracted by a modification of the method of Schwartz, and was determined spectrofluorometrically. Plasma of normal controls contained little or no protoporphyrin, and no protoporphyrin could be demonstrated in blister fluid and epidermis. All patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria had an increased amount of protuporphyrin in the plasma. They all had <b>protoporphyrin</b> <b>in</b> the blister fluid, and <b>in</b> some the <b>protoporphyrin</b> level <b>in</b> the blister fluid was even higher than in the plasma.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the gold compound, gold sodium thiomalate, on the heme biosynthetic pathway, on {{cytochrome}} P- 4 S 0 -depemdent monooxygenases, and on heme catabolism were examined. The addition of the gold compound, in vitro, resulted in the inhibition ofhepatic S-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activities. There was also a slight decrease in cyto-chrome P- 4 S 0 content. Gold was a moncompetitive inhibitor of both 6 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ethylmorphime N-demethylase activities. Gold sodium thiomalate, administered acutely, altered heme biosynthetic pathway enzymes <b>in</b> <b>erythrocytes,</b> liver, and kidney. Erythrocyte -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity was decreased with a concomitant increase <b>in</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> content. <b>In</b> the liver 5 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase activities were significantly inhibited and the microsomal heme content was significantly decreased.
