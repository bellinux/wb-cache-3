5000|$|Mrs Penelope Wilson pawned (or [...] "pledged") her BMW 318 {{convertible}} for £5000 to a two-person {{company called}} First County Trust Ltd (i.e. {{she gave her}} car as security for a loan of £5000). She had to pay £304.50 per month in interest (a 94.78% pa interest rate). There was also a £250 [...] "document fee", but because Mrs Wilson could not pay it, the fee {{was added to the}} loan. Six months later she had to redeem the car by paying the full amount of £7,327, or the car would be sold. She did not pay six months later. When the pawnbroker asked her for the money, instead of paying, she brought an action against him under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to get her car back. Under s 127(3) an improperly executed consumer credit agreement - such as one where the debtor does not sign and the document does not contain all the <b>prescribed</b> <b>terms</b> of the agreement - is unenforceable by a creditor. Mrs Wilson argued that the £250 {{was not part of the}} credit under the agreement, and therefore where the document stated that £5250 was given as a loan, this was incorrect. Therefore, she argued the loan was unenforceable.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2014 season Skonto, initially, were refused the A License {{necessary}} to play in the Latvian Higher League due to their long-term debts. However, the license was later obtained after a successful process of appellation. Sanctions followed from the UEFA, with Skonto being disqualified from the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League, a place in which the club had previously secured due to success in the previous year's championship. On 30 May 2014 Latvian Football Federation issued a ban for Skonto to register new players during the summer transfer window until all the debts would have been cleared. On 6 July due to a long-term non-payment of salaries Skonto players refused to play the away match against FK Liepāja and the club suffered a 3-0 technical loss. On 14 July club's president Vladimirs Koļesņičenko announced his resignation and the club was taken over by Igors Zaicevs. On 2 September due to non-fulfillment of liabilities in the <b>prescribed</b> <b>terms,</b> LFF took away three points in the championship table, but on 17 September this penalty was reduced to just one point. On 14 October it was announced that Latvia's State Revenue Service had suspended the club's economic activity, with a possibility for an appellation to be submitted within a period of one month. A day later additional four points were taken away in the tournament table, with Skonto losing even the theoretical chance to win the 2014 championship. The same day Skonto announced the resignation of its president Igors Zaicevs, but the club was still considering the option to submit an appellation to the State Revenue Service. In November 2014 it was announced that Skonto had finally cleared its debts with that time and previous players, still being indebted to the State Revenue Service.|$|E

Several independent variables were examined including grades earned in prerequisite courses; replacement course frequency; scores earned on the Nurse Entrance Test (NET); the number of prerequisite courses taken at four-year institutions; race/ethnicity; and gender. The dependent variable and definition of success is completion of the Traditional Pre-licensure Clinical Nursing Program in the <b>prescribed</b> four <b>terms.</b> Theories of retention and success in nursing programs at colleges and universities guide the research.

40|$|The generic {{character}} of the regularity {{in the sense of}} Jongen, Jonker and Twilt is studied for a particular class of embeddings, which represents a quadratric penalty procedure. In this paper we state a suitable perturbation result (into the mentioned class), which is the main part for the proof of the genericity. Finally, the results of some numerical experience are mentioned and two selected examples are presented. 1 Introduction. The use of smooth penalty functions to solve constrained optimization problems in a sequential unconstrained optimization setting has been reported as a numerically inefficient approach for a long time. The principal difficulty appearing is the inevitable ill-conditioning when the penalty parameter is close to the <b>prescribed</b> <b>term</b> (see for example [4, 5, 6]). Recently, these sequential optimization approaches have been re-examined from a pathfollowing point of view in many papers.
