5|$|In 1920, Rabearivelo {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} librarian at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to correspond {{with a wide range}} of writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a <b>proofreader</b> at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18° Latitude Sud.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903– 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of Madagascar. Part {{of the first generation}} raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a <b>proofreader</b> and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy, as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.|$|E

25|$|The Avramović Dictionary {{translates}} between Slavonic-Serbian, {{which was}} the dominant literary language of Serbs at the time, and German, which had been a subject in Serb schools in the Habsburg Empire since 1753. Teodor Avramović adapted Jacob Rodde's German–Russian dictionary published in 1784 in Leipzig. Avramović was a <b>proofreader</b> at the Cyrillic printing house of Joseph Kurzbeck (alternative spelling: Kurzböck), who published the German–Serbian dictionary. The vernacular Serbian used in the dictionary reflects a dialect of the Serbs in Vojvodina.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 1918, typesetters {{from the}} Sfetea and Minerva graphic design studios {{went on strike}} {{demanding}} better working and living conditions (a pay raise, an eight-hour day, etc.). As their demands were not met, all the typographers in Bucharest announced that they would strike a week later. On December 13, 1918 (NS December 26), a large socialist demonstration of Bucharest workers took place. Its principal organisers were Rakovsky, the typographers Iancu Luchwig and Sami Steinberg, the bootmaker Marcus Iancu, the <b>proofreader</b> Marcel Blumenfeld, Ilie Moscovici, Frimu, Gheorghe Cristescu, D.

25|$|Servetus also {{published}} the first French edition of Ptolemy's Geography. He dedicated his {{first edition of}} Ptolemy and his edition of the Bible to his patron Hugues de la Porte. While in Lyon, Symphorien Champier, a medical humanist, had been his patron. Servetus wrote a pharmacological treatise in defence of Champier against Leonhart Fuchs In Leonardum Fucsium Apologia (Apology against Leonard Fuchs). Working also as a <b>proofreader,</b> he published several more books which dealt with medicine and pharmacology, such as his Syruporum universia ratio (Complete Explanation of the Syrups), for which he gained fame.|$|E
25|$|The 1772 {{grammar and}} the 1774 {{textbook}} were printed in Vienna by Austrian publisher and bookseller Joseph Kurzbeck. He established his Cyrillic printing house in 1770, and Empress Maria Theresia granted him {{a monopoly on}} printing and importing Cyrillic books. The empress sanctioned a Cyrillic press in Vienna to reduce the massive importation of Russian books requested by the Serbian Orthodox Church and schools. The Habsburg court had repeatedly rejected the Serbs' petitions to found their own printing houses. In 1786, Kurzbeck employed Teodor Avramović as a <b>proofreader,</b> who previously worked as a teacher in his home town of Ruma.|$|E
25|$|After an {{agreement}} with Metropolitan Putnik, Joseph Kurzbeck undertook the project of producing a German dictionary for the Serbian people. The quickest and least costly {{way to do that}} was to adapt an existing work. At that time, highly regarded was the German–Russian bidirectional dictionary composed by Jacob Rodde in Riga and printed in 1784 in Leipzig. Kurzbeck entrusted his <b>proofreader</b> Teodor Avramović with the job of adapting Rodde's work into Slavonic-Serbian. Avramović was helped by Atanasije Demetrović (or Dimitrijević) Sekereš, the censor of the Cyrillic books installed by the Habsburg court in 1772. Sekereš began composing his Slavonic-Serbian dictionary in 1775, using five Russian dictionaries as sources, but he later abandoned that work.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Miller was {{employed}} by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition as a <b>proofreader,</b> thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there. Miller took this opportunity to submit {{some of his own}} articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat. At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books. During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.|$|E

50|$|Only where {{workload}} volume {{does not}} compress all deadlines to ASAP and the workflow is reasonably predictable can proofreading {{be worth a}} premium wage. Inflexible deadlines mandate a delivery time, but in doing so they necessarily do not mandate delivery before that time. If deadlines are consistently maintained instead of arbitrarily moved up, <b>proofreaders</b> can manage their own time by putting proofs aside {{at their own discretion}} for re-reading later. Whether the interval is a few seconds or overnight, it enables proofs to be viewed as both familiar and new. Where this procedure is followed, managers can expect consistently superior performance. However, re-reading focuses responsibility instead of dividing it (as double-reading and copy holding, both described above, do) and obviously requires extra effort from <b>proofreaders</b> and a measure of independence from management. Instead of managers controlling deadlines, deadlines control managers, and leeway is passed to the <b>proofreaders</b> as well as commensurate pay.|$|R
25|$|Quintana became Charles V's confessor in 1530, and Servetus {{joined him}} in the {{imperial}} retinue as his page or secretary. Servetus travelled through Italy and Germany, and attended Charles' coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna. He was outraged by the pomp and luxury displayed by the Pope and his retinue, and decided to follow the path of reformation. It is not known when Servetus left the imperial entourage, but in October 1530 he visited Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel, staying there for about ten months, and probably supporting himself as a <b>proofreader</b> for a local printer. By {{this time he was}} already spreading his theological beliefs. In May 1531 he met Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Fabricius Capito in Strasbourg.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 Kedarnath Datta {{established}} the Vishva Vaishnava Raj Sabha (Royal World Vaiṣṇava Association); the association composed of leading Bengali Vaishnavas stimulated Bimala's intellectual and spiritual growth and {{inspired him to}} undertake an in-depth study of Vaishnava texts, both classical and contemporary. Bimala's interest in the Vaishnava philosophy was further fuelled by the Vaishnava Depository, a library and a printing press established by Kedarnath Datta (by that time respectfully addressed as Bhaktivinoda Thakur) at his own house for systematically presenting Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In 1886 Bhaktivinoda began publishing a monthly magazine in Bengali, Sajjana-toshani ("The source of pleasure for devotees"), where he published his own writings of the history and philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, along with book reviews, poetry, and novels. Twelve-year-old Bimala Prasad assisted his father as a <b>proofreader,</b> thus closely acquainting himself with the art of printing and publishing {{as well as with}} the intellectual discourses of the bhadralok.|$|E
25|$|Tarkovsky {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically {{in the center of}} action. His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a <b>proofreader</b> at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to Yuryevets, living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943 the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrey Voznesensky was one of his classmates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shchipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948 {{he was in the hospital}} with tuberculosis. Many themes of his childhood—the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film Mirror.|$|E
