5|$|The startup {{process and}} {{construction}} {{as a whole}} {{came to an end}} on August 1, 1977 when the tanker ARCO Juneau sailed out of Valdez with the first load of oil from the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic <b>pipeline</b> <b>system</b> to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40mph (65km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E

They include the Enbridge <b>Pipelines</b> (AlaTenn) <b>system,</b> the Enbridge <b>Pipelines</b> (MidLa) <b>system,</b> the Enbridge Offshore <b>Pipelines</b> (UTOS) <b>system,</b> and the Enbridge <b>Pipelines</b> (KPC) <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Pipelines</b> <b>systems</b> are {{identified}} {{to be the}} safest way of transporting oil and natural gas. One {{of the most important}} aspects in developing <b>pipeline</b> <b>systems</b> is determining the potential risks that implementers may encounter. Therefore, risk analysis can determine critical risk items to allocate the limited resources and time. Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP) {{is one of the best}} methodologies for assessing the security risks. However, the most challenging problem in this method is uncertainty. Therefore, fuzzy set theory is used to model the uncertainty. Thus, Fuzzy RAMCAP is introduced in order to risk analysis and management for <b>pipeline</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, a notional example from <b>pipeline</b> <b>systems</b> is provided to demonstrate an application of the proposed methodology...|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, Fluor {{introduced}} {{new services}} like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects {{and other environmental}} work became {{a significant portion of}} Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> and its completion in 1977 had an immense effect on Alaska, the United States, {{and the rest of}} the world. Its impact has included economic, physical, and social repercussions running the gamut from life in small towns to the global oil market.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} was the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> and the taxes and revenue it brought to Alaska. Alyeska {{and the oil}} companies injected billions of dollars into the Alaska economy during the construction effort and the years afterward. In addition, the taxes paid by those companies altered the tax structure of the state. By 1982, {{five years after the}} pipeline started transporting oil, 86.5 percent of Alaska revenue came directly from the petroleum industry.|$|E

5|$|In February 1969, {{before the}} SS Manhattan had even sailed from its East Coast {{starting}} point, the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, and Humble Oil in October 1968, asked for {{permission from the}} United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed oil pipeline route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, the oil companies had chosen the approximate route of the pipeline. Permission was given, and teams of engineers began drilling core samples and surveying in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by oil producers and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska's personal income tax rate was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in personal income. Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no personal income tax, the gross state product was $39billion, and Alaskans earned $25billion in personal income. Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed state to the most tax-free state.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System,</b> which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System,</b> which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline</b> <b>System</b> {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
