The prestigious philatelic collectors club Club de Monte-Carlo de l'Ã‰lite de la PhilatÃ©lie was established under his patronage in 1999; the club has its headquarters at the museum, with its membership restricted to institutions and one hundred prestigious collectors.

He liked stamps printed in intaglio {{and the art of}} engravers Henri Cheffer and CzesÅ‚aw SÅ‚ania.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first {{and it is the}} planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian's National <b>Postal</b> <b>Museum</b> offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|E
