Oklahoma was the first to score on an 8-yard pass to sophomore WR Ryan Broyles with five minutes left in the first quarter. BYU had missed a 46-yard field goal in their <b>prior</b> <b>possession.</b> On BYU's last possession of the half, quarterback Max Hall completed a 49-yard pass to Bryan Kariya which left the Cougars 5 yards short of the end zone. Two plays later, Hall completed another pass for a touchdown to tie the game. On the Sooners next possession, and the last series before halftime, the Sooners began at their own 30-yard line. After completing his longest pass of the game, an 18-yard pass to Brandon Caleb, which broke the school record for most passing yards in a career, previously held by Jason White, Sam Bradford went down with a shoulder injury. He would miss the rest of the game. The Sooners managed a 35-yard field goal to go up 10-7 at the half.|$|E

5000|$|In-game actions take time, and the character's {{creation}} {{is more complex}} than in other, similar simulations, and many veterans have been playing since the game's creation. The purpose of this slower, real-time pace (in comparison to other simulations) is also devised in order to allow players - who are spread {{all over the world and}} covering all time zones — to have the time to respond to events happening around them while being offline. The player's character is present in the game regardless of the player being online or offline. Therefore, results such as being killed are always possible, and unlike many other simulations a character's death is often permanent. [...] However, players can create a new character after a short waiting period and begin again, minus all <b>prior</b> <b>possessions</b> and positions.

50|$|The philosopher to whom {{above all}} others Hamilton professed {{allegiance}} was Aristotle. His works were {{the object of his}} profound and constant study, and supplied in fact the mould in which his whole philosophy was cast. With the commentators on the Aristotelian writings, ancient, medieval and modern, he was also familiar; and the scholastic philosophy he studied with care and appreciation {{at a time when it}} had hardly yet begun to attract attention in his country. His wide reading enabled him to trace many a doctrine to the writings of forgotten thinkers; and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to draw forth such from their obscurity, and to give due acknowledgment, even if it chanced to be of the <b>prior</b> <b>possession</b> of a view or argument that he had thought out for himself. Of modern German philosophy he was a diligent, if not always a sympathetic, student. How profoundly his thinking was modified by that of Kant is evident from the tenor of his speculations; nor was this less the case because, on fundamental points, he came to widely different conclusions.|$|E

Subjects were 16 children between 3 and 4 years of age who were-rvolved in free play. Six 40 -minute f.;a 1 samples of each child were videotaped.

The initiating action of the focal child, the social target of the action, and the response of the target child were coded. In addition, the time of possession of the object prior to an object exchange was recorded. Findings indicated that outcomes of object conflicts ana sharing were predicted by <b>prior</b> <b>possession,</b> but not by affiliation or dominance.

40|$|Plaintiff {{insurance}} company paid {{the owner of}} a stolen automobile full value for his loss, and received in return the certificate of title with a proper assignment thereon. Later, having found the automobile in the possession of the defendant, a purchaser from a thief, plaintiff sued out a writ of replevin without first obtaining a new certificate of title in its own name. Held: because of his failure to obtain a new certificate of title in his own name, the plaintiff failed to sustain the burden of proving ownership in a replevin action. It is a well-established rule of law that the plaintiff in a replevin action must bring the action on the strength of his own title, <b>prior</b> <b>possession</b> or right to possession. Here, because the plaintiff had failed to apply for a new certificate of title “within three days after delivery” of the automobile as required by Nebraska statute, the defendant was able to prove that title remained in the original owner...|$|E
40|$|What is {{morality}}? And to {{what extent}} does it vary around the world? The theory of ‘morality-ascooperation’ argues that morality consists {{of a collection of}} biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. Morality-as-cooperation draws on the theory of nonzerosum games to identify distinct problems of cooperation and their solutions, and predicts that specific forms of cooperative behaviour – including helping kin, helping your group, reciprocating, being brave, deferring to superiors, dividing disputed resources, and respecting <b>prior</b> <b>possession</b> – will be considered morally good wherever they arise, in all cultures. In order to test these predictions, we investigate the moral valence of these seven cooperative behaviours in the ethnographic records of 60 societies. We find that the moral valence of these behaviours is uniformly positive, and the majority of these cooperative morals are observed in the majority of cultures, with equal frequency across all regions of the world. We conclude that these seven cooperative behaviours are plausible candidates for universal moral rules, and that morality-ascooperation could provide the unified theory of morality that anthropology has hitherto lacked...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore a famous part of Plato's Theaetetus where Socrates {{develops}} various {{models of the}} mind (picturing it first as a wax tablet and then as an aviary full of specimen birds). These are to solve some puzzles about {{how it is possible}} to make a mistake. On my interpretation, defended here, the discussion of mistakes is no digression, but is part of the refutation of Theaetetus's thesis that knowledge is "true doxa". It reveals that false doxa is possible only if there is a certain stock of abstract knowledge, conceptual knowledge, that is not awareness of the particular individual that is being described. The individual must be identified under some description, or seen as something of a certain kind. Error can only occur if the description applied misdescribes the situation, but then {{if it is to be}} applied falsely it must first have been known from somewhere else. So knowledge cannot be reduced to the application of descriptions to particulars, but is to be found in the <b>prior</b> <b>possession</b> of abstract descriptions that can be deployed in identifying particular individuals on the ground...|$|E
