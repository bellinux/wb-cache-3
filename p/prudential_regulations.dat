60|$|This remonstrance {{has been}} forced from me by indignation:--let me explain in what sense I propose, with calmer thought, that the example of our enemy should be imitated.--The laws and customs of war, and the maxims of policy, have all had their {{foundation}} in reason and humanity; and their object has been the attainment or security of some real or supposed--some positive or relative--good. They are established among men as ready guides for the understanding, and authorities to which the passions are taught to pay deference. But the relations of things to each other are perpetually changing; and in course of time many of these leaders and masters, by losing part of their power to do service and sometimes the whole, forfeit in proportion their right to obedience. Accordingly they are disregarded in some instances, and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society. But they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively, but by an impulse--rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men,--or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds, though of a vitiated moral constitution,--or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who, checked by no restraint of morality, suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances. By any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through. We have seen, {{in the conduct of}} our Countrymen, to what degree it tempts to weak actions,--and furnishes excuse for them, admitted by those who sit as judges. I wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as, like them, to shake off these bonds; but not, like them, from the worst--but from the worthiest impulse. If this were done, we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice; have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned, and those which deserve to be retained; and should have known when, and to what point, they ought to be trusted.--But how is this to be? Power of mind is wanting, where there is power of place. Even we cannot, as a beginning of a new journey, force or win our way into the current of success, the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual courage--the only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of 'heroic wisdom;'--I mean, execute happily any of its <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations.</b> In the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success. There is a kindliness, as they feel, in the nature of advancement; and prosperity is their Genius. But let us know and remember that this prosperity, with all the terrible features which it has gradually assumed, is a child of noble parents--Liberty and Philanthropic Love. Perverted as the creature is which it has grown up to (rather, into which it has passed),--from no inferior stock could it have issued. It is the Fallen Spirit, triumphant in misdeeds, which was formerly a blessed Angel.|$|E

50|$|The Agency {{paradigm}} highlights {{various forms}} of principal-agent problems. An example is a moral hazard problem: considered as lender of last resort and provider of deposit insurance, government induces the under-regulated banks to take excessive risks which creates the financial vulnerability.

50|$|To {{justify the}} {{necessity}} of the external regulation, market imperfections of a free market economy must be identified as socially inefficient and adjustable {{in the sense of}} pareto improving.

The Externality Paradigm. The Prudential Capital Controls, as a particular form of <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations,</b> builds its theory foundation heavily on the paradigm of externalities.|$|E

50|$|Shadow {{institutions}} {{are not subject}} to the same <b>prudential</b> <b>regulations</b> as depository banks, so {{that they do not have}} to keep as high financial reserves relative to their market exposure. Thus they can have a very high level of financial leverage, with a high ratio of debt relative to the liquid assets available to pay immediate claims. High leverage magnifies profits during boom periods and losses during downturns. This high leverage will also not be readily apparent to investors, and shadow institutions may therefore be able to create the appearance of superior performance during boom times by simply taking greater pro-cyclical risks. Money market funds have zero leverage and thus do not pose this risk feature of shadow banks.|$|E

The [...] "prudence" [...] requirement says that such regulation should curb and manage the excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethought to prevent an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. The [...] "ex-ante" [...] timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy.|$|E
