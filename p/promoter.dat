5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a <b>promoter</b> region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the <b>promoter</b> region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the <b>promoter</b> region is not accessible.|$|E

The analysis showed that 7 of the 12 <b>promoters</b> were poorly conserved across C. trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia caviae. Interestingly, the associated gene sets for these seven <b>promoters</b> were homologs and the gene orders were well conserved across these three species. Additional phylogenetic footprinting, across different subsets from that used above, of the six publicly available whole chlamydial genome sequences and transcription initiation site mapping of chlamydial <b>promoters</b> was also performed. This analysis showed {{that two of the}} seven poorly conserved <b>promoters,</b> the <b>promoters</b> in the upstream regions of C. caviae ltuA and ltuB, were like Escherichia coli σ 70 <b>promoters.</b> Therefore, these <b>promoters</b> are similar to the <b>promoters</b> of C. trachomatis ltuA and ltuB, as they are σ 70 -like. Given the fact that 7 out of the 22 known σ 66 <b>promoters</b> in C. trachomatis are poorly conserved across C. trachomatis, C. pneumoniae and C. caviae, we would like to suggest that many other chlamydial <b>promoters</b> are poorly conserved across these species. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei evades the {{mammalian}} {{immune response}} {{by a process}} of antigenic variation. This involves mutually exclusive and alternating expression of telomere-proximal variant surface glycoprotein genes (vsgs), which is controlled {{at the level of}} transcription. To examine transcription repression in T. brucei we inserted reporter genes, under the control of either rRNA or vsg expression site (ES) <b>promoters,</b> into various chromosomal loci. Position-dependent repression of both <b>promoters</b> was observed in the mammalian stage of the life cycle (bloodstream forms). Repression of <b>promoters</b> inserted into a silent ES was more pronounced closer to the telomere and was bi-directional. Transcription from both ES and rRNA <b>promoters</b> was also efficiently repressed at a non-telomeric vsg locus in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. In cultured tsetse fly midgut-stage (procyclic) trypanosomes, in which vsg is not normally expressed, all inserted rRNA <b>promoters</b> were derepressed but ES <b>promoters</b> remained silent. Our results suggest that vsg <b>promoters</b> and ectopic rRNA <b>promoters</b> in bloodstream-form T. brucei are restrained by position effects related to their proximity to vsgs or other features of the ES.

40|$|CpG islands mark CpG-enriched {{regions in}} {{otherwise}} CpG-depleted vertebrate genomes. While the regulatory importance of CpG islands is widely accepted, {{it is little}} appreciated that CpG islands vary greatly in lengths. For example, CpG islands in the human genome vary ∼ 30 -fold in their lengths. Here we report findings suggesting that the lengths of CpG islands have functional consequences. Specifically, we show that <b>promoters</b> associated with long CpG islands (long-CGI <b>promoters)</b> are distinct from other <b>promoters.</b> First, long-CGI <b>promoters</b> are uniquely associated with genes with an intermediate level of gene expression breadths. Notably, intermediate expression breadths require the most complex mode of gene regulation, {{from the standpoint of}} information content. Second, long-CGI <b>promoters</b> encode more RNA polymerase II (Polr 2 a) binding sites than other <b>promoters.</b> Third, the actual binding patterns of Polr 2 a occur in a more tissue-specific manner in long-CGI <b>promoters</b> compared to other CGI <b>promoters.</b> Moreover, long-CGI <b>promoters</b> contain the largest numbers of experimentally characterized transcription start sites compared to other <b>promoters,</b> and the types of transcription start sites in them are biased toward tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. Finally, long-CGI <b>promoters</b> are preferentially associated with genes involved in development and regulation. Together, these findings indicate that functionally relevant variations of CpG islands exist. By investigating consequences of certain CpG island traits, we can gain additional insights into the mechanism and evolution of regulatory complexity of gene expression...|$|R

We questioned if specific combinations of CREB, C/EBPβ and c-Jun bound to <b>promoters</b> correlate with RNA polymerase II binding, mRNA transcript levels and methylation of <b>promoters</b> in proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes. Induction of mRNA and RNA polymerase II by differentiation is highest when <b>promoters</b> {{are bound by}} C/EBP β alone, C/EBPβ together with c-Jun, or by CREB, C/EBPβ and c-Jun, although in this case CREB binds with low affinity. In contrast, RNA polymerase II binding and mRNA levels change the least upon differentiation when <b>promoters</b> are bound by CREB either alone or in combination with C/EBPβ or c-Jun. Notably, <b>promoters</b> bound by CREB have relatively high levels of RNA polymerase II binding irrespective of differentiation. Inhibition of C/EBPβ or c-Jun preferentially represses mRNA when gene <b>promoters</b> are bound by corresponding transcription factors and not CREB. Methylated <b>promoters</b> have relatively low CREB binding and, accordingly, those which are bound by C/EBPβ are induced by differentiation irrespective of CREB.
