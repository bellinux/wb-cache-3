500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1940, Waldmann {{graduated}} from school with his Abitur (diploma). After this he was accepted into the Luftwaffe, two years after his initial application. Commencing in July 1940, he undertook 12 weeks of basic military training with Fliegerausbildungsregiment 72 (72nd Flight Training Regiment) at Fels am Wagram in Austria. Upon completion, Waldmann {{was transferred to the}} Flugzeugführerschule A/B 72 (flight school for the pilot license) at Markersdorf near Sankt Pölten in early October 1940. Eight days later his training group returned to Fels am Wagram because Markersdorf was overcrowded with other flight courses. Thus flight training started on the improvised airfield without hangars at Fels am Wagram. His first familiarisation flight was on 16 October 1940, in a Bücker Bü 131 [...] "Jungmann" [...] biplane marked [...] "VTAF". Waldmann logged his first solo flight on 13 November 1940 at 09:17 in a Bü 131 [...] "CGNL", landing again after six minutes of flight time. His training group returned to Markersdorf in February 1941. From here, he conducted his first cross-country flights on the Bü 131 [...] "Jungmann" [...] as well as the Focke-Wulf Fw 44 [...] "Stieglitz". The majority of the cross-country flights were flown on the Gotha Go 145. From 4 April to 28 April 1941 he made the round trip from Markersdorf to <b>Pocking,</b> Nürnberg, Ettingshausen, Ingolstadt, Zwickau, Hildesheim, Braunschweig, Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Delmenhorst, Halberstadt and Fürth. At Ettingshausen he received instruction in formation flying and aerobatics.|$|E

40|$|Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) {{multiply}} readily on the {{chorioallantoic membrane}} (CAM) of embryonated hen’s egg and produce easily visible foci or <b>pocks</b> on this membrane. In the present study, <b>pocks</b> {{produced by the}} two antigenic types of HSV (1 & 2) were compared {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of typing HSV isolates by <b>pock</b> size on CAMs. A total of 57 HSV isolates from both non-genital and genital samples were typed by the <b>pock</b> size produced on the CAMs of fertile hen’s eggs. Twenty two HSV isolates yielded visible <b>pocks</b> on CAM, of which 9 (40. 9 %) produced small <b>pocks,</b> while 13 (59. 1 %) produced large <b>pocks.</b> All <b>pocks</b> produced on CAM were confirmed by antigenic typing by the Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) method. HSV isolates which produced small <b>pocks</b> were in complete (100 %) concordance with HSV type- 1, while those producing larger <b>pocks</b> were in full (100 %) concordance with HSV type- 2. Thus, the <b>pock</b> size on CAM of embryonated fertile hen’s egg may be used as a simple and relatively inexpensive biological marker for the differentiation of HSV types 1 & 2...|$|R
40|$|Israeli, Ella (Rambam Hospital, Haifa, Israel). Mechanism of <b>pock</b> {{formation}} by Shope fibroma virus on monolayers of rabbit cells. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 727 – 732. 1966. —The {{mechanism of}} <b>pock</b> formation by the Shope fibroma virus (SFV) on rabbit cultures in vitro was studied {{with the use}} of p-fluorophenylalanine, 5 -bromodeoxyuridine, and 5 -iododeoxyuridine. The inhibitors were used to inhibit, and to initiate, virus replication at different times after infection. It was shown that <b>pock</b> formation required virus replication to a threshold value of 25 plaque-forming units per <b>pock</b> area, and that this amount of virus can be accumulated during a period about 3 days less than that required for <b>pock</b> formation. Inhibition of virus growth, and of cell multiplication, after this threshold has been reached, did not prevent <b>pock</b> development. A delay in the onset of virus growth required to reach the threshold virus content, caused an about equivalent delay in the time of <b>pock</b> formation. In the absence of inhibitors, <b>pocks</b> were not formed after infection of 84 rabbit embryo clones, or five mixtures of clones containing five to seven clones each. The results indicate that <b>pock</b> formation by SFV in vitro was the result of cell aggregation, and not of cell multiplication, in special types of cells...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{glass as}} a {{material}} {{is known for}} its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass. [...] Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or <b>pocking</b> of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4). [...] Glass plates can also darken or cloud {{as the result of the}} oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).|$|E
