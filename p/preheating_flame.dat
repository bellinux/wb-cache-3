40|$|In {{the present}} study, propane/oxygen and natural gas/oxygen {{diffusion}} flames within laminar regime {{have been investigated}} experimentally to determine the ef-fects of oxidant preheating and diluting. This research has been divided into two parts. At first, effect of oxygen dilution with nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases has been investigated. In this section, stability and flame configuration variations are studied. Furthermore, it is inferred that combustion of natural gas and propane with pure oxygen can increase flame stability against increasing the fuel jet veloci-ties through increasing burning velocity of the flame {{as compared with the}} combus-tion of natural gas or propane with normal air. In the other part, oxidant stream preheating up to 480 K and contemporaneous diluting with nitrogen or carbon di-oxide are investigated and results are compared with non-preheating tests.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study of NO formation in diluted and preheated combustion {{has been carried}} out to provide more insight into the ultimate low-NOx potential of MILD combustion. The measured profiles of NO mole fraction were obtained using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in the three laminar coflow diffusion flames burning with varying degree of preheating and dilution of coflow and fuel streams. The structure of all these flames was previously extensively studied experimentally and numerically by the authors. Non-preheated and moderately <b>preheated</b> <b>flames</b> show considerable NO formation (on the level of 100 ppm), while the NO formation in the MILD flame appears to be negligible (few ppm). Comparison of the experimental profiles with the results of flame calculations made with detailed chemical mechanisms and multicomponent mixture-averaged transport showed excellent agreement with each other for all flames studied. The rate-of-production analysis demonstrates that Fenimore production is the dominant path of NO formation in all flames studied. Analysis of the computational results also suggests that the reaction reversed to the reaction CH + N- 2 -> NCN + H returns a considerable fraction of NCN back to N- 2. We studied also the fate of the NO mole fraction seeded to oxidizer coflow in the MILD flame. The experiments display a significant NO reduction at downstream distances. The calculations are in quantitative agreement with measurements and reveal that the reduction is due to the conversion of the NO molecules to the N-containing intermediates which further downstream convert back to NO rather than N- 2.

Since LES needs to resolve the large turbulent eddies, the LES filter width is bounded by a maximum. For the present Bunsen flame this means that the filter width should be of the order of the flame thickness or smaller. In this regime, the effects of subgrid reaction and subgrid flame wrinkling turn out to be quite modest. The LES-results of the second case (Sandia Flame D) are compared to experimental data. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for the main species.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on the central pilot body (RPLrich- pilot-lean) of Siemens prototype 4 th generation DLE burner to investigate the flame behavior at atmospheric pressure condition when varying equivalence ratio, residence time and co-flow temperature. The flame at the RPL burner exit was investigated applying OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and high-speed chemiluminescence imaging. The results from chemiluminescence imaging and OH PLIF show that {{the size and shape}} of the flame are clearly affected by the variation in operating conditions. For both preheated and non-preheated co-flow cases, at lean equivalence ratios combustion starts early inside the burner and primary combustion comes to near completion inside the burner if residence time permits. For rich conditions, the unburnt fuel escapes out through the burner exit along with primary combustion products and combustion subsequently restarts downstream the burner at leaner condition and in a diffuse-like manner. For preheated co-flow, most of the operating conditions yield similar OH PLIF distributions and the flame is stabilizing at approximately the same spatial positions.

The effects of preheat temperature, tube diameter, equivalence ratio and mixture flow rate on the flame speed and extinction conditions are deter-mined. The analytical results show that high preheat temperature of the mixture can effectively suppress flame quenching, and the occurrence of stable solution in the slow flame branch extends the flammability limit leading to possible flame propagation in mini channels. Experimental results confirm that the flame speed increases and the flammability limit shifts toward the fuel lean direction either through increasing the preheat temperature or decreasing the mixture flow rate, or both. Decrease of propagating flame speed is observed before the stoichiometric equivalence ratio at high preheat temperatures. The analytical model provides insights into how propagating flame in mini channels can be sustained; however, the model is only good at predicting flame speed near the fuel lean branch. Influence of Cu 2 + ions exchanged zeolite 13 X catalyst on flame speed is also addressed. It is noted that the zeolite based catalyst can lower the preheat temperature requirement in order to sustain the flame propagation in narrow channels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{opportunity}} for ignition assistance by a pulsed applied voltage is investigated in a canonical one-dimensional configuration. An incipient ignition kernel, formed by localized energy deposition into a lean mixture of methane and air at atmospheric pressure, {{is subjected to}} sub-breakdown electric fields (E/N ≈ 100 Td) by a DC potential applied across the domain, resulting in non-thermal behavior of the plasma formed during the discharge. A two-fluid approach is employed to couple thermal neutrals and ions to the non-thermal electrons. A two-temperature plasma mechanism describing gas phase combustion, excitation of neutral species, and high-energy electron kinetics is employed to account for non-thermal effects. Charged species transported from the ignition zone drift rapidly through the domain, augmenting {{the magnitude of the}} electric field in the fresh gas during the pulse through a dynamic-electrode effect, which results in an increase in the energy of the electrons in the fresh mixture with increasing time.

A simultaneous dual-sheet Rayleigh/OH-LIPF measurement technique was applied using two parallel laser light sheets {{to measure the}} temperature in the preheat zone for three lean (ϕ= 0. 7) turbulent methane/air flames. The ratio of the turbulence intensity to the laminar burning velocity v′/sL was varied from 3. 5 to 9. 2 and to 18. 7. The first of these flames lies on the borderline between the “corrugated flamelets” regime and the “thin reaction zones” regime, while the other two are in the “thin reaction zones” regime. The results confirm the occurrence of strong temperature fluctuations ahead of the <b>preheat</b> zone for <b>flames</b> in the “thin reaction zones” regime. Single temperature images show a significant temperature increase ahead of the preheat zones of up to 700 K for flames at the highest turbulence intensity. For statistical analysis conditional mean temperature profiles and probability density functions conditioned on the distance from the flame contour were calculated from the experimental data. Only those portions of the flame front were included which were found to be approximately normal to the two laser sheets. The resulting probability density functions show that the effect of temperature rise ahead of the preheat zone becomes significant only for flames in the “thin reaction zones” regime. The mean temperature profiles show a much smaller temperature rise which, however, increases with increasing velocity ratios v′/sL...|$|R

To this end, the software package HSC Chemistry (R) {{was used to}} determine the composition of the synthesis gas at thermodynamic equilibrium. This software operates on the basis of Gibb's energy minimization. In the model, dry and ash-free wood has been represented by CH 1. O- 44 (0. 66). Dry air has been modeled as a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and argon. As the calculations were carried out with respect to adiabatic conditions, it was necessary to determine the adiabatic flame temperature via beat and mass balances. This approach of adopting adiabatic conditions, though generally not taken into consideration in thermodynamic studies, is seen as beneficial, providing additional information with regard to the gasifier operating point. A sensitivity analysis was conducted. The influence of parameters; like equivalence ratio, water content of wood fuel and air <b>preheating</b> on adiabatic <b>flame</b> temperature and cold gas efficiency is discussed. For air at ambient temperature, the highest cold gas efficiency is achieved with an equivalence ratio of about 0. 28. This was dependent to some small degree on the water content of the fuel wood. With increased air preheating, the maximum cold gas efficiency is increased and shifted to lower equivalence ratios. For wet wood, it transpired to be more efficient to use the sensible beat from the synthesis gas for drying of the fuel rather than preheating of the air.

40|$|Abstract — A CFD-based {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed for {{the determination of the}} volume concentration and number density of soot in a laminar diffusion flame of methane in air, under transient condition following ignition of the flame. The transience is studied from the point of ignition till the final steady state is reached. The burner is an axisymmetric co-flowing one with the fuel issuing through a central port and air through an annular port. Both normal air (non-preheated) and preheated air have been used for this simulation to capture the effect of preheating on soot distribution. Attention is focused on various soot forming and destruction processes, like nucleation, surface growth and oxidation, during the transient phase to evaluate their relative importance. The transient soot distribution has been studied with the help of radial distributions of soot at six different axial heights of 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 12 cm respectively above the burner tip. Beyond 12 cm height, the concentration becomes very less in all cases. The contribution of surface growth towards soot formation is more significant than that of nucleation during the early periods following ignition. Once the high temperature reaches the oxygenenriched zone beyond the flame, the soot oxidation becomes important. Coagulation, on the other hand, limits the soot particle number. Preheating of air increases the soot volume fraction in the flame significantly. But, the soot distribution patterns remain almost similar to that with non-preheated air during the flame transient period and also in the steady state.

40|$|The paper reports {{experiments}} {{employing the}} cloud chamber technique for creating fuel aerosols, {{in studies of}} premixed laminar flames. Spherical explosion flames were initiated at different times {{after the start of}} expansion of the original gaseous mixture to lower pressure. Flame speeds were measured close to atmospheric pressure, over a range of equivalence ratios of iso-octane, ethanol and hydrous ethanol with air. A methodology was developed for deriving mass burning velocities and entrainment velocities, as well as mass burning fluxes, from the measurements of aerosol number densities, droplet sizes and flame speeds. It was vital to estimate whether droplet evaporation was completed in the <b>flame</b> <b>preheat</b> zone. This was done by calculating the spatial progress of droplet evaporation for the different aerosols from values of the evaporation rate constants of the different fuels. With predominantly the leaner mixtures and smaller droplet diameters, evaporation was close to completion, but the mass burning velocities of the aerosols were somewhat lower than those of the corresponding gaseous phases, because of the lower final temperatures due to the required evaporation enthalpies. However, the mass burning fluxes were higher than those for the purely gaseous flames, due to the higher two-phase reactant densities. At the higher values of the liquid phase equivalence ratio, in overall lean mixtures, the mass burning velocity could exceed that in the purely gaseous phase due to localised enrichment around the droplets. The presence of fuel droplets is shown to enhance the generation of Darrieus-Landau, thermo-diffusive instabilities and the associated flame wrinkling. With richer mixtures and larger droplets, it is possible for droplets to enter the reaction zone and further enhance existing gaseous phase instabilities through the creation of yet further flame wrinkling. This leads to the maximum entrained fuel mass flux, in the richest mixture, being significantly higher than that occurring at the maximum burning velocity of a premixed gaseous flame...|$|R

Iron pentacarbonyl {{has been found to be}} up to several orders of magnitude more effective than CF 3 Br, but it is flammable and highly toxic. Ferrocene [Fe(C 5 H 5) 2], which is much less toxic and flammable than Fe(CO) 5, can also be used to introduce iron into a flame. We present the first experimental data and numerical modeling for flame inhibition by ferrocene and find it to behave similarly to Fe(CO) 5. A ferrocene mole fraction of 200 ppm reduced the burning velocity of slightly <b>preheated</b> premixed methane/air <b>flames</b> by a factor of two, and the effectiveness dropped off sharply at higher mole fractions. For air with a higher oxygen mole fraction, the burning velocity reduction was less. We also present experimental data and modeling for flames with ferrocene blended with CO 2 or CF 3 H. The combination of the thermally acting agent CO 2 with ferrocene mitigated the loss of effective-ness experienced by ferrocene alone at higher mole fractions. An agent consisting of 1. 5 % ferrocene in 98. 5 % CO 2 performed as effectively as CF 3 Br in achieving a 50 % reduction in burning velocity. Likewise, four times less CO 2 was required to achieve the 50 % reduction if 0. 35 % ferrocene was added to the CO 2. In contrast, addition of 0. 35 % ferrocene to the hydrofluorocarbon CF 3 H reduced the CF 3 H required to achieve the 50 % reduction in burning velocity by only about 25 %.

40|$|The burning {{velocity}} of a premixed ﬂame propagating {{in a given}} ﬂammable mixture is known {{to depend on the}} diﬀerence between the curvature of the ﬂame and the so-called curvature of the ﬂow, which is the strain rate of the ﬂow of fresh gas along the normal to the ﬂame divided by the {{burning velocity}} of the planar ﬂame. The diﬀerence between the local burning velocity and the burning velocity of a planar ﬂame in a gas at rest is proportional to the diﬀerence of the ﬂame and ﬂow curvatures. The proportionality factor is the product of the burning velocity of the planar ﬂame and the Markstein length, which is an intrinsic property of the ﬂame that characterizes its dynamics. The Markstein length can be determined experimentally by simultaneously measuring the curvature of the ﬂame and the strain rate of the ﬂow. To achieve this goal, we have set up a laminar jet burner and used two PIV systems to measure the gas ﬂow velocity in two perpendicular planes normal to the ﬂame. Each PIV system is composed by two Q-switched Nd: YAG pulse lasers (New Wave, maximum 120 mJ/pulse at 532 nm wavelength), a double-shuttered cross-correlation camera (PCO, 1392 × 1040 pixels) and a pulse generator (ILA GmbH) to synchronize all the components as well as the two PIV systems. Oil droplets are used for tracking the ﬂow and the ﬂame. They are formed by condensation after oil evaporation in a seeding chamber placed in the air line.

40|$|Chemically {{reacting}} zones such as flames act {{as sources}} of charged species and can thus be considered as weakly-ionized plasmas. As such, the action of an externally applied electric field {{has the potential to}} affect the dynamics of reaction zones by enhancing transport, altering the local chemical composition, activating reaction pathways, and by providing additional thermal energy through the interaction of electrons with neutral molecules. To investigate these effects, one-dimensional simulations of reacting flows are performed including the treatment of charged species transport and non-thermal electron chemistry using a modified reacting fluid solver. A particular area of interest is that of plasma assisted ignition, which is investigated in a canonical one-dimensional configuration. An incipient ignition kernel, formed by localized energy deposition into a lean mixture of methane and air at atmospheric pressure, is subjected to sub-breakdown electric fields by applied voltages across the domain, resulting in non-thermal behavior of the electron sub-fluid formed during the discharge. Strong electric fields cause charged species to be rapidly transported from the ignition zone across the domain in opposite directions as charge fronts, augmenting the magnitude of the electric field in the fresh gas during the pulse through a dynamic-electrode effect. This phenomenon results in an increase in the energy of the electrons in the fresh mixture with increasing time, accelerating electron impact dissociation processes. A semi-analytic model to represent this dynamic electrode effect is constructed to highlight the relative simplicity of the electrodynamic problem admitted by the far more detailed chemistry and transport. Enhanced fuel and oxidizer decomposition due to electron impact dissociation and interaction with excited neutrals generate a pool of radicals, mostly O and H, in the fresh gas ahead of the <b>flame's</b> <b>preheat</b> zone.

The first part was about methane combustion {{at low concentration}} condition aiming at air cleaning usage. The second part focused on methane combustion at high concentration condition aiming at energy generation. In low methane concentration condition, performance of multi-metal-(Cu, Cr, Ni, Co and Zn) -ion-exchanged zeolites on methane combustion was evaluated under various parameters including the amount of metal loading, reaction temperature, space velocity and methane concentration. The {{results showed that the}} amount of metal loading in zeolite {{played an important role in}} affecting the apparent activation energy for methane combustion, the active sites, and the BET surface area of the catalyst. An optimized amount of metal loading at which the highest catalytic activity was observed due to the combined effects of the various factors was determined. Further experiments were designed to investigate the effect of ozone on low-temperature combustion of methane over the zeolite material. The presence of ozone to the zeolite catalyst enhanced methane combustion efficiency by 24 - 56 %, giving overall performance of 93 % in 295 - 435 °C. Mechanisms of methane combustion with the catalyst with and without ozone were proposed. Recycled zeolite materials from coal fly ash were also used in the work demonstrating good performance.

40|$|Lean direct-injection (LDI) spray flames {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of reducing NO(sub x) emissions from gas turbines by rapid mixing of the liquid fuel and air so as to drive the flame structure toward partially-premixed conditions. We consider the technical approaches required to utilize laser-induced fluorescence methods for quantitatively measuring NO concentrations in high-pressure LDI spray flames. In the progression from atmospheric to high-pressure measurements, the LIF method requires a shift from the saturated to the linear regime of fluorescence measurements. As such, we discuss quantitative, spatially resolved laser-saturated fluorescence (LSF), linear laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements of NO concentration in LDI spray flames. Spatially-resolved LIF measurements of NO concentration (ppm) are reported for <b>preheated,</b> LDI spray <b>flames</b> at pressures of two to five atmospheres. The spray is produced by a hollow-cone, pressure-atomized nozzle supplied with liquid heptane. NO is excited via the Q(sub 2) (26. 5) transition of the gamma(0, 0) band. Detection is performed in a two nanometer region centered on the gamma(0, 1) band. A complete scheme is developed by which quantitative NO concentrations in high-pressure LDI spray flames can be measured by applying linear LIF. NO is doped into the reactants and convected through the flame with no apparent destruction, thus allowing a NO fluorescence calibration to be taken inside the flame environment. The in-situ calibration scheme is validated by comparisons to a reference flame. Quantitative NO profiles are presented and analyzed so as {{to better understand the}} operation of lean-direct injectors for gas turbine combustors. Moreover, parametric studies are provided for variations in pressure, air-preheat temperature, and equivalence ratio. Similar parametric studies are performed for lean, premixed-prevaporized flames to permit comparisons to those for LDI flames. Finally, PLIF is expanded to high pressure in an effort to quantify the detected fluorescence image for LDI flames. Success is achieved by correcting the PLIF calibration via a single-point LIF measurement. This procedure removes the influence of any preferential background that occurs in the PLIF detection window. In general, both the LIF and PLIF measurements verify that the LDI strategy could be used to reduce NO(sub x) emissions in future gas turbine combustors...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{thrust for}} a cleaner, greener environment has prompted air pollution regulations {{to be enforced}} with increased stringency by environmental protection bodies all over the world. This has prompted gas turbine manufacturers to move from non-premixed combustion to lean, premixed combustion. These lean premixed combustors operate quite fuel-lean compared to the stochiometric, {{in order to minimize}} CO and NOx productions, and are very susceptible to oscillations in any of the upstream flow variables. These oscillations cause the heat release rate of the flame to oscillate, which can engage one or more acoustic modes of the combustor or gas turbine components, and under certain conditions, lead to limit cycle oscillations. This phenomenon, called thermoacoustic instabilities, is characterized by very high pressure oscillations and increased heat fluxes at system walls, and can cause significant problems in the routine operability of these combustors, not to mention the occasional hardware damages that could occur, all of which cumulatively cost several millions of dollars. In a bid towards understanding this flow-flame interaction, this research works studies the heat release response of premixed flames to oscillations in reactant equivalence ratio, reactant velocity and pressure, under conditions where the <b>flame</b> <b>preheat</b> zone is convectively compact to these disturbances, using the G-equation. The heat release response is quantified by means of the flame transfer function and together with combustor acoustics, forms a critical component of the analytical models that can predict combustor dynamics. To this end, low excitation amplitude (linear) and high excitation amplitude (nonlinear) responses of the flame are studied in this work. The linear heat release response of lean, premixed flames are seen to be dominated by responses to velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations at low frequencies, and to pressure fluctuations at high frequencies which are in the vicinity of typical screech frequencies in gas turbine combustors. 	The nonlinear response problem is exclusively studied in the case of equivalence ratio coupling. Various nonlinearity mechanisms are identified, amongst which the crossover mechanisms, viz., stoichiometric and flammability crossovers, are seen to be responsible in causing saturation in the overall heat release magnitude of the flame. The response physics remain the same across various preheat temperatures and reactant pressures. 	Finally, comparisons between the chemiluminescence transfer function obtained experimentally and the heat release transfer functions obtained from the reduced order model (ROM) are performed for lean, CH 4 /Air swirl-stabilized, axisymmetric V-flames. While the comparison between the phases of the experimental and theoretical transfer functions are encouraging, their magnitudes show disagreement at lower Strouhal number gains show disagreement.
