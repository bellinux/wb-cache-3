40|$|Medium {{carbon steel}} can be {{assembled}} in various ways, {{one of them}} by welding. On the implementation of welding using SMAW welding type which is one method of welding is used widely in construction grafting techniques. In welding, there 2 ̆ 7 s common defects such as imperfections of root <b>penetration,</b> <b>hardened</b> and cracked. Back chipping or welding opponent {{needs to be done}} to avoid or fix things that often occur in the root weld. SMAW welding is one method which is widely used in construction grafting techniques. This study aims to determine the different test results with the depth of groove weld seam treatment chipping back to the tensile strength test also to determine micro structure. The depth of groove seam using a variation of 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm, then the welding results of each treatment were divided into three tensile test specimens and one photo micro specimen. Upon completion of the test specimens and then tensile test performed and photo micro to acknlowledge changes in mechanical properties. From the testing that has been done, the result from tensile strength at back chipping welding with 3 mm depth is higher than treated back chipping welding with 2 mm and 4 mm depth. The largest maximum tensile strength were found in the back chipping welding groove with 3 mm depth is 683. 3 MPa, while the untreated back chipping weld the largest maximum tensile strength is 591. 7 MPa.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{diffusion}} of chloride ions through limestone cement concrete is studied. The Portland limestone cements have many benefits and the new European Standard EN 197 - 1 identifies 4 types of Portland limestone cement containing 6 - 20 % limestone (types II/A-L and II/ALL) and 21 - 35 % limestone (types II/B-L and II/B-LL), respectively. Portland limestone cements of different fineness and limestone content (0 - 35 % w/w) have been produced by inter-grinding clinker, gypsum and limestone. Six concrete mixtures were prepared and the Nordtest Method (accelerated chloride penetration) was applied for the determination of penetration parameters for estimating the resistance against chloride <b>penetration</b> into <b>hardened</b> concrete. The diffusion equation of Fick's second law {{was used for the}} determination of the effective chloride transport coefficient. It is concluded that Portland limestone cement concrete indicates competitive behavior with the Portland cement concrete. Limestone content up to 15 % has a positive effect on the concrete resistance against chloride penetration. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{study with}} synchrotronradiation X-raytomographic {{microscopy}} (SRXTM) of PUR, PVAC, and UF adhesive bond lines in beech wood, bonded under various growth ring angles is presented. After determining the hardening {{characteristics of the}} adhesives, we evaluate the bond line morphologies, and the adhesive penetration into the wood structure. We find distinct bond line imperfections for the different adhesive systems. To describe the adhesive distribution inside the bond line we propose the saturation of the pore space instead of the commonly used maximum penetration depth.

50|$|The newest variant is the B61 Mod 11, a <b>hardened</b> <b>penetration</b> bomb with a {{reinforced}} casing (according to some sources, containing depleted uranium) and a delayed-action fuze, {{allowing it}} to penetrate several metres into the ground before detonating, damaging fortified structures further underground. The Mod 11 weighs about 1,200 lb (540 kg). Developed from 1994, the Mod 11 went into service in 1997 replacing the older megaton-yield B53 bomb. About 50 Mod 11 bombs have been produced, their warheads converted from Mod 7 bombs. At present, the primary carrier for the B61 Mod 11 is the B-2 Spirit.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} axisymmetric computational {{study of}} the penetration of a tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) rod into a 6061 -T 6 aluminum target has been performed using a Lagrangian formulation. Adaptive remeshing {{has been used to}} alleviate the problem of excessive distortion of elements which occurs during large deformation studies (such as ballistic <b>penetration).</b> Strain <b>hardening,</b> strain-rate hardening and thermal softening in both the penetrator and target materials are taken into full consideration. The computed depth of penetration (DOP), residual penetrator length and maximum crater diameter match very well the experimental results reported by Yadav and Ravichandran (Int. J. Impact Eng., Submitted for publication) for an impact velocity of 1100 m/s. Computer simulations reveal that in the absence of failure mechanisms (such as shear banding), introduction of thermal softening in the penetrator material decreases its depth of penetration in a metal target, when compared to a penetrator material which does not soften thermally. These results are in contrast to the recent work of Rosenberg and Dekel (Int. J. Impact Eng. 21 (1998) 283 – 296) and a plausible explanation for this discrepancy is presented...|$|R

40|$|Highstrength {{concrete}} B 85 {{possesses a}} very small amount of pores and therefore a significant higher resistance against penetration of Trichlorethylene, which is {{a representative of the}} chlorinated hydrocarbons, compared to concrete according to DIN 1045. Due to this, highstrength concrete is particularly qualified for building catchment and barrier constructions. However, a <b>penetration</b> of the <b>hardened</b> cement materials by Trichlorethylene effects an extraction of water and a coarsening of the pore structure. In addition to this, chloride ions are produced in the structure of cement bound materials by the decay of Trichlorethylene. These chloride ions cause corrosion of embedded steel, stainless steel and tension wire in concrete B 35, B 55 and B 85 within a year. (orig.)

40|$|Laser Beam Hardening with High Power Diode Lasers is {{presented}} as an excellent method for local heat treatment and minimum distortion. An overview is given about several strategies for local heat treatment and different industrial applications. Precise measuring and controlling of the surface temperature makes the process very reliable and is an essantial tool for industrial users. To keep a constant <b>penetration</b> of the <b>hardening</b> zone at constant surface temperatures the feed rate {{can be adapted to}} local heat flow conditions. A former postprocessor of Fraunhofer IWS generates a CNC-program for the treatment and changes the feed rate in dependence of the surface shape. The new processor additionally considers local heat flow variations of a part caused by boreholes, grooves and changing local thickness. The processing is very fast and can be applied for solving daily problems of laser beam hardening. Some examples show the performance of the new postprocessor...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presented}} to compare the transmission gear products from SME (UKM gear) and national scale manufacturer (OEM gear) especially on the surface hardening characterization. Both gears were heat treated with different methods. The gear product of SME was heat treated by pack carburizing and quenching whereas the OEM gear was predicted to be heat treated using induction heating with high frequency. The surface hardening characterization was conducted by investigating the hardening thickness, the hardness number and the microstructure observation on the gear surfaces. The result of the hardening thickness investigation reveals a distinction on the depth of <b>hardening</b> <b>penetration.</b> The heat treatment using long interval pack carburizing of UKM gear produces a deeper penetration and the higher hardness number on the gear surface whereas the OEM gear has a thin hardness penetration and lower hardness number. The microstructure of the both gears depicts {{the different types of}} phase. The SME gear shows the present of the carbon infiltration on the martensitic phase structure boundary whereas the OEM gear exhibits lower bainite phase on the gear surface. With this condition the OEM gear is predicted to behave a better contact stress distribution during operation...|$|R
5000|$|The first 4 bores were {{probably}} single barrel muzzleloaders converted from British fowling pieces that were, in essence, slug guns. Loads (bullet weights and gunpowder loads) varied greatly. As {{the weight and}} strength increased, gunpowder loads went from 8 drams (0.5 oz) to a full ounce (16 drams), or more, of powder. The advent of rifling after about 1860 allowed longer conical projectiles to be stabilised, and, aside from accuracy, these provided even greater weight and <b>penetration,</b> with some <b>hardened</b> lead or steel bullets weighing as much as 2000 grains. The 4 bore was also occasionally used for shooting exploding projectiles. Although 4-bore firearms were {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "rifles", smoothbore version of the weapon were actually more popular, and continued to be so throughout the era of four bore usage. Since dangerous game was shot at ranges under 40 yards, a smoothbore was sufficiently accurate, {{while at the same time}} providing higher velocities and lower recoil, and needing less cleaning. The prominent British gunmaker W. W. Greener even recommended against rifled firearms above the bore size of eight, with the four bores that he continued producing from then on being exclusively smoothbores. The smoothbore also, at least until the advent of breechloading, could be reloaded faster.|$|R
40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear resistance of {{white cast iron}} was studied. The iron was solidified using two solidification rates of 1. 5 and 15 degrees C/s. Mass loss was evaluated with tests of the type pin on abrasive disc using alumina of different sizes. Two matrices were tested: one predominantly austenitic and the other predominantly martensitic, containing M(3) C carbides. Samples with cooling rate of 15 degrees C/s showed higher hardness and more refined microstructure compared with those solidified at 1. 5 degrees C/s. During the test, the movement of successive abrasives {{gave rise to the}} strain hardening of the austenite phase, leading to the attainment of similar levels of surface hardness, which explains why the wear rate showed no difference compared to the austenite samples with different solidification rates. For the austenitic matrix the wear rate seems to depend on the hardness of the worn surface and not on the hardness of the material without deformation. The austenitic samples showed cracking and fracture of M(3) C carbides. For the predominantly martensitic matrix, the wear rate was higher at the solidification rate of 1. 5 degrees C/s, for grain size of 66 and 93 mu m. Higher abrasive sizes were found to produce greater <b>penetration</b> and strain <b>hardening</b> of austenitic matrices. However, martensitic iron produces more microcutting, increasing the wear rate of the material. The analysis of the worn surface by scanning electron microscopy indicated {{abrasive wear}} mechanisms such as: microcutting, microfatigue and microploughing. Yet, for the iron of austenitic matrix, the microploughing mechanism was more severe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Press {{hardening}} steel {{has become}} a much used material in car body manufacturing due to its excellent safety and lightweight potential. In some recent car models press hardening steel has reached already a weight share of more than 20 % in the body structure while {{it is estimated that}} it could reach even around 40 % in the future. However conventional press hardening steel based on the alloying concept 22 MnB 5 was designed originally not for automotive application. In spite of the high strength level, press hardening steel has generally low toughness due to the relatively high carbon content and its martensitic microstructure. Particularly important is the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature at low temperature, which might lead to unexpected failure in cold climate regions. Furthermore, hydrogen embrittlement is a major concern in press hardening steel as previous results indicated that only a few ppm of hydrogen could induce delayed cracking. Generally it is important that impact energy should be absorbed by the material to avoid unexpected disintegration of the structure. This material capability is usually characterized by the toughness. All these characteristics have not yet been systematically investigated in press hardening steel. Consequently, no {{attempts have been made to}} optimize conventional press hardening steel for obtaining better toughness, lower ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and reduced sensitivity to hydrogen induced cracking. A generally proven approach of improving the resistance against brittle failure in high strength steel is the refinement of microstructure, which can be efficiently achieved by Nb microalloying. This paper will introduce modified alloy designs for press hardening steel and explain fundamentally the metallurgical effects of Nb microalloying on the improvement of crack propagation resistance, bendability and delayed cracking behavior induced by hydrogen <b>penetration</b> in press <b>hardening</b> steel. The results reveal better toughness, improved bending behavior and increased resistance against hydrogen embrittlement. status: publishe...|$|R
