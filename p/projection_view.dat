40|$|Synchrotron-radiation-based microcomputed-tomography (SR-μCT) is a {{powerful}} tool for yielding 3 D structural information of high spatial and contrast resolution about a specimen preserved in its natural state. A large number of <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> are required currently for yielding SR-μCT images by use of existing algorithms without significant artifacts. When a wet biological specimen is imaged, synchrotron x-ray radiation from a large number of <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> can result in significant structural deformation within the specimen. A possible approach to reducing imaging time and specimen deformation is to decrease the number of <b>projection</b> <b>views.</b> In the work, using reconstruction algorithms developed recently for medical computed tomography (CT), we investigate and demonstrate image reconstruction from sparse-view data acquired in SR-μCT.

In this method, we model the motion as a time varying deformation of a static prior of the anatomy.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that the internal motion {{caused by a}} patient’s breathing can be estimated from a sequence of slowly rotating 2 D cone-beam X-ray <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> and a static prior of of the patient’s anatomy. 1, 2 The estimator iteratively updates a parametric 3 D motion model so that the modeled <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> of the deformed reference volume best match the measured <b>projection</b> <b>views.</b> Complicated motion models with many degrees of freedom may better describe the real motion, but the optimizations assiciated with them may overfit noise and may be easily trapped by local minima due to {{a large number of}} parameters. For the latter problem, we believe it can be solved by offering the optimization algorithm a good starting point within the valley containing the global minimum point. Therefore, we propose to start the motion estimation with a simplified motion model, in which we assume the displacement of each voxel at any time is proportional to the full movement of that voxel from extreme exhale to extreme inhale. We first obtain the full motion by registering two breathhold CT volumes at end-expiration and end-inspiration. We then estimate a sequence of scalar displacement proportionality parameters. Thus the goal simplifies to finding a motion amplitude signal. This estimation problem can be solved quickly using the exhale reference volume and <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> with coarse (downsampled) resolution, while still providing acceptable estimation accuracy. The estimated simple motion then can be used to initialize a more complicated motion estimator...|$|R

Accurate motion estimates may lead to improved treatment planning and dose calcula-tion in radiation therapy.

We propose to estimate the parameters of a nonrigid mo-tion model from a set of <b>projection</b> <b>views</b> of the thorax that are acquired using a slowly rotating cone-beam CT scanner, such as a radiotherapy simulator.

PurposeTo determine the optimal portal venous <b>projection</b> <b>view</b> for stent-graft placement during TIPS and the potential influence of the portal vein anatomy. Material and MethodsOn 76 cirrhotic patients (48 men and 28 women) selected for TIPS, rotational, three-dimensional (3 D), catheter-directed angiography of the portal vein was performed. The 3 D portograms were reviewed by two independent interventional radiologists to determine the optimal angiographic projection views for stent-graft placement. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities were tested and subgroups of patient portal vein anatomy were categorized. ResultsAmong all patients, the optimal portal venous projection views for stent-graft placement during TIPS centered around 27 ° (± 14 °) right oblique and 3 ° (± 7 °) craniocaudal. Of these, 56 % were within the standard deviations. Intra-observer reliabilities were 0. 60 and 0. 62 for the two radiologists, respectively. Inter-observer reliability was 0. 48. Anatomical variations in the patient population were: normal portal vein (67 %), trifurcation at main portal vein (16 %), right posterior portal vein as the first branch of main portal vein (3 %), no right posterior portal vein (1 %), and other variations (13 %). Anatomical subgroups did not influence the best angiographic <b>projection</b> <b>view</b> significantly (F(4, 295) = 0. 91, P = 0. 457). ConclusionThe mean optimal angiographic <b>projection</b> <b>view</b> for TIPS stent-graft placement was 27 ° right oblique and 3 ° craniocaudal.

In the <b>Projection</b> <b>view,</b> all data items are projected based on {{the first and second}} principal components by default. The Eigenvector view displays the calculated eigenvectors and eigenvalues in a vertically projected parallel coordinate view. The distances between the eigenvectors in the parallel coordinate view vary based on their eigenvalues, separating the eigenvectors based on their mathematical weights. The Data view shows the original data points in parallel coordinates. The Correlation view represents Pearson-correlation coefficients and relationships between variables as a matrix of scatter plots and values. Pearson-correlation coefficient provides a value between + 1 and - 1 by measuring the linear correlation between two variables. If the value is close to 1, the two variables maintain a positive correlation. Otherwise (close to - 1), the two variables preserve a negative correlation. All views are closely connected, such that if the user changes the elements in one view, its corresponding results are updated in other views (brushing & linking). This interactivity allows the user to infer relationships between the coordinated spaces (see the paper [6] for details).|$|E

Recently, deep learning approaches using large receptive field neural networks such as U-net have demonstrated impressive performance for sparse view CT reconstruction.

In particular, inspired by the recent theory of deep convolutional framelets, we show that the U-net relies on a sub-optimal non-local bases that overly emphasizes low frequency components. The discovery leads to a dual frame and a tight frame U-net architectures for effective recovery of directional image components...|$|R
