He was replaced by Shane Carwin, who ended up losing against dos Santos. Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with diverticulitis. Dana White said that he had a 12-inch <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colon removed.|$|E
5|$|The new {{district}} map was not {{agreed upon}} by the General Assembly until March 26, 1992, one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5. Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27, and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2. Miller's hometown of Lancaster was placed in freshman David Hobson's Springfield-based Seventh District, but Miller chose {{to run in the}} Sixth District against McEwen since the largest <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old district — five counties — was placed in the new Sixth. Miller's decision was also impacted by his strong personal distaste for McEwen.|$|E
5|$|In , {{the evil}} sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces {{to conquer the}} realms. By , after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile {{at the end of}} Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu, the source of Onaga's power. Onaga then confronted the {{alliance}} of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi and thus obtained Quan Chi's amulet, the final <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power. Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over the Dragon King and removed his threat to the Mortal Kombat universe.|$|E

5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a large <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written {{would create a}} bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of}} the following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On {{the left of the}} mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gold.|$|E

5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E

25|$|A {{newspaper}} reported that Kelly's body was dissected by medical students who removed {{his head and}} organs for study. Dissection outside of a coronial enquiry was illegal. Public outrage at the rumour raised real fears of public disorder, leading the commissioner of police to write to the gaol's governor, who denied that a dissection had taken place. (Saw cuts on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> occipital bone recovered in 2011 confirm that a dissection had been done.) His head was allegedly given to phrenologists for study, {{then returned to the}} police, who used it for a time as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Voldemort's {{creation}} of Horcruxes {{is central to}} the later storyline of the Harry Potter novels. As the number seven is a powerful number in magic, Voldemort intended to split his soul into that many pieces, with six Horcruxes and the last piece reposing within his body. When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, and his body was destroyed by the rebounded Killing Curse, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul splintered off and attached itself to the only living thing remaining in the room, Harry Potter, {{in a manner similar to}} a Horcrux. Later on, Voldemort went on to complete his collection of the intended six Horcruxes by turning his snake Nagini into one, thus fragmenting his soul into a total of eight (counting the one residing in his own body), not seven, pieces. Complicating things even further, no more than six Horcruxes (including Harry) ever existed at any one time in the series: by the time Nagini had been made a Horcrux, one of the Horcruxes (Tom Riddle's diary) had already been destroyed.|$|E

A ball remained lodged in his head, and he died shortly aftwerwards on Hispaniola. A young Horatio Nelson was serving in the West Indies at the time, and wrote to his friend and patron William Locker about the captures, noting that William Williams, commander of Active had also died shortly afterwards, apparently of a broken heart. The heavy British losses at the time speeded Nelson's own promotion, and he was made master and commander of the brig [...] on 8 December 1778.|$|E
500|$|After {{being sent}} an invite to Aragog the Spider's funeral, he uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in {{retrieving}} Slughorn's unedited memory {{while at the}} funeral. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle {{about the process of}} splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called Horcruxes. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux; Voldemort has created six of them, making himself virtually immortal by placing a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul in each and keeping the seventh and last one within his body. Dumbledore explains that in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes—Riddle's diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt—have already been destroyed, but four others remain.|$|E

Doctor Light gives a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul to the Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift. As the group is ready to leave, Zauriel appears, dismisses Batman and Deadman, and follows through on his promise to erase the Phantom Stranger from existence. Wonder Woman and her team track Pandora to the prison where Lex Luthor is held. Pandora approaches Luthor, hoping that he can open the box. Before she can give it to him, Wonder Woman and her group arrive to retrieve the box. Upon touching the box, Wonder Woman is apparently possessed just as Superman was.|$|E
500|$|His {{father died}} in June 1912, which, {{according}} to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu's correspondence), left him indifferent. By then, Caragiale-son resented Ion Luca's alleged exploitation of his popularity for material gains, and, later in the same year, commented that, [...] "for a small fee", Caragiale-father could be persuaded to read his works at the fair in Obor. In a since-lost <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> diary that was commented upon by Cioculescu, he also claimed that binge drinking and tobacco abuse had made his father decay physically and mentally. Despite his love for Berlin, he was also dissatisfied with his father's move to the city, and spread the rumor that, {{in the eyes of}} his family and friends, Ion Luca's departure was interpreted as [...] "insane" [...] (while alleging that Caragiale-father was planning to author plays in German, with assistance from Mite Kremnitz, the one-time lover of poet Mihai Eminescu). At the funeral ceremony, he reputedly shocked pianist Cella Delavrancea by coldly stating in French: Je suis venu voir feu mon père ("I came to see my late father").|$|E
500|$|Another local legend arose about a stone coffin that {{supposedly}} held Richard's remains, which Speed wrote was [...] "now made a drinking trough for horses at a common Inn". A coffin certainly {{seems to have}} existed; John Evelyn recorded it on a visit in 1654, and Celia Fiennes wrote in 1700 {{that she had seen}} [...] "a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tombstone [...] he lay in, which was cut out in exact form for his body to lie in; {{it remains to be seen}} at ye Greyhound [...] in Leicester but is partly broken." [...] William Hutton found in 1758 that the coffin, which had [...] "not withstood the ravages of time", was kept at the White Horse Inn on Gallowtree Gate. Although the coffin's location is no longer known, its description does not match the style of late 15th-century coffins, and it is unlikely to have had any connection with Richard. It is more likely that it was salvaged from one of the religious establishments demolished following the Dissolution.|$|E
