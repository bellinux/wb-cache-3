5|$|The roster was {{selected}} internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the selection process, which took around {{three to four}} months, {{was to create a}} cast featuring a wide variety of characters. Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well they fit within the Injustice storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development. The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties, allowing them to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> spin on characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, such as Darkseid, Scarecrow, Metallo, and Gorilla Grodd, also appear as non-player characters, making cameo appearances in story cutscenes, stages, and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character.|$|E

Learning that Blume is planning to install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area of one of the satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Dušan for good, Marcus breaks into all of Blume's international headquarters and lastly their San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Dušan's corruption. Dušan is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and {{that it is time to}} <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> plans into motion.|$|E

In Connecticut, state {{officials}} deployed about 200trucks to remove debris on roads. The Massachusetts National Guard was activated to assist in relief efforts. In Rhode Island, a man was killed while repairing damage caused by Bob. Beaches in the state re-opened by {{five days after the}} storm. The hurricane mixed the waters in Long Island Sound and prevented the algae bloom that happened in previous summers. In the days after Bob, the Commonwealth Electric Company brought electricians from outside the company and <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> workers on 16‑hour shifts to restore power across Massachusetts. Most Massachusetts residents, excluding those living on Cape Cod, had their power restored within five days.

25|$|The {{history of}} the temple is not known clearly. Different {{communities}} <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> version of it. There are many beliefs regarding the antiquity and history of this splendid, miraculous and extraordinary idol. This idol was in Lanka. It was very much worshipped in the times Bhagawan Munisuvrat Swami. Ramchandraji took it to Ayodhya. Then it was in Ujjain. In course of time, it appeared under a banyan tree outside Vatpradnagar. It was worshipped for some years. Again it appeared under a tree at distance of one kilometer from the village. This is the Chief Tirth of Jains in the Mevad State. A fair is held here every year on the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Fagan. With all the five fingers, people worship God here with Saffron. They give a gift of saffron to God. Bhils, know God {{by the name of}} ‘Kalababa’. Non - Jain devotees come here with faith. Since centuries, there is a custom of giving saffron to God as a gift.

500|$|The 747 {{enjoyed a}} fairly smooth {{introduction}} into service, overcoming concerns that some airports {{would not be}} able to accommodate an aircraft that large. Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved. After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 747s into service. [...] Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity. [...] While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747. Nonetheless, many flag-carriers purchased the 747 due to its iconic status [...] "even if it made no sense economically" [...] to operate. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the weekly}} adversaries for the Winchesters were {{often based on}} urban legends, the writers tried to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> spin on the stories {{for each of the}} episodes. For example, Kripke {{combined}} the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot. The episode [...] "Hook Man", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided {{for the purposes of the}} show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest star—she wears a cross made from his melted hook. Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that Supernaturals vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangs—these were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharks—as well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the term conatus {{is that of a}} series of subtle tweaks in meaning and {{clarifications}} of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition. The earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on ancient Greek concepts. These thinkers therefore used [...] "conatus" [...] not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In English translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets. Today, conatus is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Louis Dumont.|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists in many {{different}} styles. Elvis Presley used the song in a large dance scene in his 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and released it as a single with the title song on the B-side. It became a gold record. Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, the Big Three, Eddie Cochran, Bobby Darin, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Nancy Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Trini Lopez, Roy Orbison, Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash and June Carter, Rare Earth and The Ronettes all <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> style on the song. [...] Checkmates, Ltd. released {{a version of the}} song as part of a medley on their 1967 debut album, Live! At Caesar's Palace. [...] Jerry Lee Lewis found particular success with his rendition in 1961, which peaked at number 30 and spent eight weeks on the charts. Charles noticed, later writing [...] "I saw that many of the stations which had banned the tune started playing it when it was covered by white artists. That seemed strange to me, as though white sex was cleaner than black sex. But once they began playing the white version, they lifted the ban and also played the original." [...] In 2001 the italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari sampled part of the melody for his song Porca l'oca, included in the album Shake.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} of Halo Wars 2s soundtrack, [...] "Recommissioned", is an {{adaption}} of the [...] "Spirit of Fire" [...] theme {{from the original}} Halo Wars soundtrack. Haab stated {{that they wanted to}} <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> style on this existing theme. Specific melodies were written for each of the game's main characters to reflect their personalities. For example, the track [...] "Run Little Demons" [...] made use of tribal drums, electronic percussion, and heavy brass to capture the dread and terror induced by Atriox and the Banished. To generate an array of emotional effects, different instruments were used to create variations of the character themes. One goal was to have the music dynamically interact with dialogue and gameplay. The composers created music of different intensity levels to correspond with the player's actions in the game; for example, low intensity, ambient music would play during base construction and more percussive, thematic music would play during battles. A system was designed to adapt the score based on events occurring during gameplay and to prevent the music from becoming repetitive. The composers worked closely with Lipson and Creative Assembly's audio lead, Sam Cooper, on the implementation of the interactive audio. The live orchestra was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox's studio in Los Angeles. The Halo Wars 2 Original Game Soundtrack, featuring 21 tracks, was released in retail stores on February 17, 2017, and digitally on February 21, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Other {{stories were}} {{developed}} from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode [...] "Bloodlust" [...] {{was developed to}} suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to [...] "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a [...] "fun way". The episode [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen—warning people of future tragedy, {{rather than trying to}} kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for [...] "Tall Tales" [...] originated as a [...] "he said, he said" [...] episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a trickster because it [...] "can do everything [...] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of [...] "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life. The plot, which [...] "fell into place" [...] during the writing process, included demonic possession to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.|$|E
