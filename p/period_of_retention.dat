Following the terrorist attacks in Paris in January 2015, European Parliament MEP’s have already heard proposals for an amended draft of the Passenger Name Records Directive be introduced.

The median treatment time was 5 months, followed by a median period of observation or retention of 7 months. The effects of the treatment were evaluated from cephalograms taken before the treatment, at the removal of the Jumpers {{and at the end of}} the period of observation or retention. The Jumpers brought about a slight retrusion of the maxilla and markedly increased the mandibular prognathism. The maxillary incisors and molars were retruded, and the mandibular incisors and molars protruded. The median correction of the overjet was almost 5 mm and of the molar relationship 3 mm.

40|$|Exposure {{to chronic}} stress {{can alter the}} {{structure}} and function of brain regions involved in learning and memory, and these effects are typically long-lasting if the stress occurs during sensitive <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> development. Until recently, adolescence has received relatively little attention as a sensitive <b>period</b> <b>of</b> development, despite marked changes in behaviour, heightened reactivity to stressors, and cognitive and neural maturation. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to investigate the long-term effects of chronic stress in adolescence on two spatial learning and memory tasks (Morris water maze and Spatial Object Location test) and on a working memory task (Delayed Alternation task). Male rats were randomly assigned to chronic social instability stress (SS; daily 1 hour isolation and subsequent change of cage partner between postnatal days 30 and 45) or to a no-stress control group (CTL). During acquisition learning in the Morris water maze task, SS rats demonstrated impaired long-term memory for the location of the hidden escape platform compared to CTL rats, although the impairment was only seen after the first day of training. Similarly, SS rats had impaired long-term memory in the Spatial Object Location test after a long delay (240 minutes), but not after shorter delays (15 or 60 minutes) compared to CTL rats. On the Delayed Alternation task, which assessed working memory across delays ranging from 5 to 90 seconds, no group differences were observed. These results are partially in line with previous research that revealed adult impairment on spatial learning and memory tasks after exposure to chronic social instability stress in adolescence. The observed deficits, however, appear to be limited to long-term memory as no group differences were observed during brief <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Root {{resorption}} is a {{side effect}} of orthodontic treatment that occurs with the removal of hyalinized tissue. Studies have shown that a reparative process in the periodontium begins when the applied orthodontic force is discontinued or reduced below a certain level. However, quantitative 3 -dimensional evaluation of root resorption repair has not been done. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantitatively assess the 2 - and 3 -dimensional changes of root resorption craters after 2 weeks of continuous mesially applied orthodontic forces of 50 g on rat molars and 2 - to 16 -week retention periods. Methods: We used 60 male Wistar rats (10 weeks old). Nickel-titanium closed-coil springs were used to apply 50 -g mesial forces for 2 weeks to move the maxillary left first molars. The rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups. Those in the zero-week retention group were killed after force application. In the remaining 5 groups, the interdental spaces between the maxillary first and second molars were filled with resin to retain the molars. The molars were extracted after <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> from 2 and 16 weeks. The maxillary right molars were used as the controls. Mesial and distal roots (distobuccal and distopalatal) were examined by using scanning electron and 3 -dimensional scanning laser microscopes. The surface area, depth, volume, and roughness of the root resorption craters were measured. Results: The area, depth, and volume of the craters decreased gradually and showed similar trends over the retention time, approaching a plateau at the 12 th week. After 16 weeks <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> the volumes <b>of</b> the resorption craters of the distobuccal and distopalatal roots reached recovery peaks of 69. 5 % and 66. 7 %, respectively. Small pits on the mesial roots showed recovery of 62. 5 % at the 12 th week. The healing patterns in distal roots with severe resorption and mesial roots with shallow resorption had no significant differences. Conclusions: The resorption and repair processes during the early stages <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> are balanced, and most of the reparative process occurs after 4 weeks <b>of</b> passive <b>retention</b> after the application of orthodontic force. Frequent orthodontic reactivations should be avoided to allow recovery and repair of root surface damage...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This prospective study consisted of 31 patients (11 girls and 20 boys) in the mixed or permanent dentition stage, treated using a tooth-tissue borne expanders (Haas). Occlusal digital radiographs were taken at three stages: prior to rapid maxillary expansion (Stage I); immediately after desired maxillary expansion (Stage II); and after three months of retention (Stage III). Radiographs were taken on a dental X-ray machine, set at 70 kVp and 7 mA with an exposure time of 0. 04 s. A phosphor storage plate system, imaging plate size n. 2 (35 × 45 × 1. 6 mm), was used. Three regions (A, B and C) measured 0. 02 mm² were selected for optical density analysis. The difference between the measurements was evaluated with the paired t-test. Results: The optical density was reduced at Stages II and III compared with Stage I. Between-stage comparison showed statistically significant changes for all variables (P < 0. 05), with the highest mean optical density at Stage I and the lowest at Stage II, in all groups. Actually, there was an increase in optical density between Stages II and III, but they are reduced compared with Stage I.

40|$|In {{the attempt}} {{to account for the}} {{emptying}} of the uterus at a definite time, various hypotheses have been formulated upon the basis of {{one or more of the}} changes in the fetal or maternal organism which have been noted at the time of termination of pregnancy. The viewpoint of the obstetrician, whose experience involves chiefly tlhe phenomena of labor, has been the basis of numerous theories, the multiplicity of which bears evidence of the uncertaintly attending them. A clue to the nature of parturition is found by experiment. Empty-ing of the uterus is under hormonal control; the time of onset may be hastened or postponed as desired, living offspring being born in either case. In experiments in which a new ovulation is superimposed upon pregnancy, a definite rhythm is still evident in the duration of gesta-tion; the amount of lengt!hening or shortening of pregnancy is not irregular, but is fixed according to the length of the ovulation cycle; the normal mechanism of labor seems to be in operation except, at an earlier or later time than is usual. In order to determine the relation of parturition to preceding stages of pregnancy, the method of the embryologist rather than that of t. he obstetrician must be followed. The common method of approach to a problem of embryology, whether a structure or a function is involved, is to reconstruct various stages in the development of the organ or pro-cess. The final form is viewed from the standpoint of its development. Frorn the embryological standpoint, parturition represellts merelv tlhe terminal phase of a long series of events constituting embryonic 1 ifeU.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the amount and}} pattern of relapse of maxillary front teeth previously retained with a bonded retainer for two to four years. Which teeth {{are more prone to}} relapse? Is there any difference in behavior between contact point displacement and rotation? What is the magnitude of the relapse in short-term and long-term? Materials and Methods: The study group originally consisted of 45 patients, and 27 patients on recall for the second study. Recordings from study models before treatment (T 1), at debonding (T 2), one year after removal of the retainer (T 3) and seven years postretention (T 4) were present. All patients had been treated with fixed edgewise appliances by the same operator. The irregularity index (sum of contact point displacement [CPD]), and rotations of front teeth in relation to the Raphe line and intercanine distance, were calculated at T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4. Statistical analysis: Paired t-test, Pearson’s product-moment correlation and Pearson’s productmoment correlation coefficient were applied. For all statistical analyses, the statistical significance level was set to 5 %. Results: Before treatment (T 1), the mean irregularity index was 10. 1 (range 3. 0 – 29. 9). The largest displacements were recorded between laterals and centrals followed by the displacement between laterals and canines. The smallest deviations were found between the centrals. After treatment (T 2), the mean irregularity index was 0. 7 (range 0. 0 – 2. 1). There was {{a significant difference in the}} index between T 1 and T 2 (P <. 0001). One year postretention (T 3), the mean irregularity index was 1. 4 (range 0 – 5. 1). There was a significant difference in the index between T 2 and T 3 (P <. 0001). Results from the second study showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the change in mean CPDs for the contacts canines/laterals, laterals/centrals, or centrals/centrals. The mean irregularity 9 index for the 27 patients examined in the second study was 10. 3 (range 3. 7 - 29. 9) at T 1, 0. 9 (range 0. 0 - 2. 1) at T 2, 1. 3 (range 0. 0 - 3. 5) at T 3 and 2. 0 (range 0. 0 - 5. 8) at T 4. No correlations were found between the pretreatment and postretention irregularity T 1 /T 3 and T 1 /T 4. There was a significant association between the irregularity index at T 3 and T 4 (R = 0. 938, P <. 0001). The irregularity index of the maxillary front teeth changed very little or not at all during the first year postretention. Further changes long-term resulted in an irregularity index of mean 2. 0 mm (range 0. 0 – 5. 8). The contact relationship between the laterals and centrals seems to be the most critical. Forty rotated teeth in 21 patients were corrected more than 20 o. Mean relapse during the first year postretention was 6. 7 degrees (range 0. 0 - 14. 7). Mean changes during seven years were 8. 2 degrees (range 0. 0 - 19. 3). Conclusions: Minor or no relapse in short-term follow-up (one year) was noted in the maxillary front after correction of irregularity and a two to four year period of bonded retention. Further, small relapses occurred long-term i. e. at mean seven years postretention. No significant relation was found between the amount of correction of contact point displacement and magnitude of relapse neither in one nor seven years postretention. There was a strong correlation between irregularity one and seven years postretention. Stable cases one year postretention are stable in the longterm and cases with small changes one year postretention tend to deteriorate with time. Most of the rotational relapse was seen one year postretention with small changes long-term. There was a significant positive correlation between the amount of correction of incisor rotation and the magnitude of relapse. Of the over corrected contacts, only 50 percent returned to perfect alignment. Laterals are more prone to relapse. If, after a three year <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> a decision is made to use permanent retention of the maxillary front teeth, a retainer bonded to only the incisors seems to be a relevant choice...|$|E

Despite the small sample of females reproducing twice, there is a significant tendency regarding a positive correlation between frequency of reproduction and female body size, within the study population. Reproductive females were bigger than females found without eggs; in addition, carapace length increased significantly in females found zero, one and two times with eggs. A comparison with preliminary data from northern populations of E. orbicularis, lead to the hypothesis that the annual clutch frequency could be negatively related to latitude, the model of this relationship should be still a matter of discussion...|$|R

40|$|In {{the lower}} St. Lawrence estuary (LSLE, eastern Canada), blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense are a {{recurrent}} phenomenon, resulting in paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreaks every summer. A first coupled physical-biological model of A. tamarense blooms {{was developed for}} this system in order to explore the interactions between cyst germination, cellular growth and water circulation and to identify the effect of physical processes on bloom development and transport across the estuary. The simulated summer (1998) was characterized by an A. tamarense red tide with concentrations reaching 2. 3 x 10 (6) cells L- 1 along the south shore of the LSLE. The biological model was built with previously observed A. tamarense cyst distribution, cyst germination rate and timing, and A. tamarense growth limitation by temperature and salinity. The coupled model successfully reproduced {{the timing of the}} A. tamarense bloom in 1998, its coincidence with the combined plumes from the Manicouagan and Aux-Outardes (M-O) rivers on the north shore of the estuary, and the temporal variations in the north-south gradients in cell concentrations. The simulation results reveal that the interaction between cyst germination and the estuarine circulation generates a preferential inoculation of the surface waters of the M-O river plume with newly germinated cells which could partly explain the coincidence of the blooms with the freshwater plume. Furthermore, the results suggest that the spatio-temporal evolution of the bloom is dominated by alternating <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and advection <b>of</b> the M-O plume: east or northeast winds favor the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the plume close to the north shore while west or north-west winds result in its advection toward the south shore. The response of the simulated freshwater plume to fluctuating wind forcing controls the delivery of the A. tamarense bloom from {{the northern part of the}} estuary to the south shore. In addition, our results suggest that a long residence time of the M-O plume and associated A. tamarense population in the LSLE during the summer 1998 contributed to the development of the red tide. We thus hypothesize that the wind-driven dynamics of the M-O plume could partly determine the success of A. tamarense blooms in the LSLE by influencing the residence time of the blooms and water column stability, which in turn affects A. tamarense vertical migrations and growth.

40|$|Summary Corticosteroids {{are known}} to {{modulate}} the consolidation of memories during sleep, specifically in the hippocampus-dependent declarative memory system. However, effects of the major human corticosteroid cortisol are conveyed via two different receptors, i. e., mineralo-corticoid (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) whose specific contributions to memory consolidation are unclear. Whereas {{a shift in the}} balance between MR and GR activation toward predominant GR activation has been found to impair sleep-dependent consolidation of declara-tive memories, the effect of predominant MR activation is not well characterized. Here, we examined differential corticosteroid receptor contributions to memory consolidation during post-learning sleep in two placebo-controlled double-blind studies in humans, by comparing the effects of the selective MR agonist fludrocortisone (0. 2 mg, orally, Study 1) and of hydrocortisone (22 mg, intravenously, Study 2) with strong binding affinity to both MR and GR. We hypothesized increased activation of MRs during sleep to enhance declarative memory consolidation, but the joint MR/GR activation to impair it. Participants (16 men in each study) learned a declarative (word pair associates) and a procedural task (mirror tracing) before a 7 -h <b>period</b> <b>of</b> nocturnal <b>retention</b> sleep, with the substances administered before sleep (Study 1) and during sleep (Stud...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} {{a large number}} of types of nominal and real {{exchange}} rates, while estimating the real equilibrium exchange rate, one should always remember that there is no a single, universal equilibrium exchange rate. A point value or a path of that exchange rate depends on the adopted definitions and assumptions {{as well as on the}} method and purpose of the analysis. However, a value added of each estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate is an answer, whether the economic policy causes upset or stabilisation of the economy. Moreover, in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> discussion on the exchange rate of accession to ERM- 2, showing an interval of the exchange rate where all values of the exchange rate ensure at least suboptimal behaviour of the economy may help to make a decision on the date of accession to ERM- 2 that will minimise costs <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate within a definite currency band. For Poland, estimated by the NATREX method the long-run real equilibrium exchange rate ensures the internal equilibrium with annual growth rates of GDP amounting to 4. 1 %, comprised of growth of consumption by 4 % p. a., investment by 8. 7 %, volume of exports by 8. 5 % and volume of imports by 8. 1 % p. a. Estimating on the ground of real exchange rates an approximate value of nominal exchange rates, one can state that the long-term equilibrium in the economy is ensured with the exchange rate of 3. 80 - 3. 90 zlotys for 1 euro. The current exchange rate will probably approach the equilibrium exchange rate at the turn of 2010 and 2011, and it will remain near that level over 5 - 6 quarters. This means that in that <b>period</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the PLN exchange rate within a narrow band of fluctuations is relatively the least. The next period where the current exchange rate should approach the optimal exchange rate is 2014. Then, also in the medium term, the exchange rate of zloty should be comprised within the interval of 3. 80 - 3. 90 (assuming the stable exchange rate of USD/EUR= 1. 40) ...|$|R

40|$|Low yields often {{obtained}} from commercial seed production crops of ‘common’ Brachiaria humidicola, a tropical forage grass used as cultivated pasture, result from {{an association between}} short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> seed <b>retention</b> in the inflorescences and a marked synchronism of inflorescence emergence. In consequence, the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> seed availability for harvesting is brief. The possibility of staggering seed production among crops would allow extension <b>of</b> the harvest <b>period</b> and, hence, <b>of</b> equipment use. This work was carried out to evaluate the influence of N doses on this period and to discuss {{the possibility of using}} this practice to extend harvest period. Five N doses (0; 25; 50; 75 and 100 kg ha- 1 de N) were applied as urea top-dress {{at the start of the}} 2000 ’s raining season. Seed samples were collected on the 66 th, 69 th and 72 nd days after N application. Treatment effects were evaluated in terms of potential pure seed yield and several seed yield components. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> highest availability of pure seed to harvest and the extension <b>of</b> this <b>period</b> varied according to the N dose applied. The highest potential yield (295 kg ha- 1) resulted from the application of 75 kg ha- 1 de N. The maximum yield resulted from the application of 50 kg ha- 1 de N was 16 % lower and was achieved four days later. Even at the yield reduction cost, the use of different N doses may contribute to risk and cost reductions in commercial seed production systems of ‘common’ Brachiaria humidicola...|$|R
