In mathematics and physics, nonlinearity describes systems in which {{a change in the}} size of the input does not produce a proportional change {{in the size of the}} output. For a given change in input, such systems may yield significantly greater than or less than <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> in output, or even no output at all, depending on the current state of the system or its parameter values.|$|E

5000|$|... nd = 1⁄t, where n is the <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in pause number, d is the <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> {{in their}} mean duration, and {{t is the}} <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in tempo. This {{expression}} describes a number-duration curve, in which the number and mean duration of pauses form a hyperbolic relationship (since neither n nor d ever reaches zero). The curve represents the range of possible ratios for using these variables {{to adapt to a}} change in tempo. In Souter (2001), tempo was doubled from the first to the second reading, from 60 to 120 MM; thus, t = 2, and the number-duration curve is described by nd = 0.5 (Figure 2). In other words, factoring the <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in the number and mean duration of pauses between these readings will always equal ½. Each participant’s two readings thus corresponded to a point on this curve.|$|R

If output increases by less than that <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in inputs, there are decreasing returns to scale (DRS). If output increases by more than the <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in inputs, there are increasing returns to scale (IRS). A firm's production function could exhibit different types of returns to scale in different ranges of output. Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{very large}} group of birds, enantiornitheans {{displayed}} a high diversity of different body plans based on differences in ecology and feeding, reflected in an equal diversity of wing forms, many paralleling adaptions to different lifestyles seen in modern birds. In general, the wings of enantiornitheans were advanced compared to more primitive avialans like Archaeopteryx, and displayed some features related to flight {{similar to those found}} in the lineage leading to modern birds, the Ornithuromorpha. While most enantiornitheans had claws on at least some of their fingers, many species had shortened hands, a highly mobile shoulder joint, and <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> in the wing bones similar to modern birds. Like modern birds, enantiornitheans had alulas, or [...] "bastard wings", small forward-pointing arrangements of feathers on the first digit that granted higher maneuverability in the air and aided in precise landings.|$|E
5000|$|John Maynard Keynes, like Marx, {{accepted}} the theory {{in general and}} wrote... This Theory is fundamental. Its correspondence with fact is not open to question. [...] Also like Marx {{he believed that the}} theory was misrepresented. Where Marx argues that the amount of money in circulation is determined by the quantity of goods times the prices of goods Keynes argued the amount of money was determined by the purchasing power or aggregate demand. He wrote [...] Thus the number of notes which the public ordinarily have on hand is determined by the purchasing power which it suits them to hold or to carry about, and by nothing else. [...] In the Tract on Monetary Reform (1924), Keynes developed his own quantity equation: n = p(k + rk'),where n is the number of [...] "currency notes or other forms of cash in circulation with the public", p is [...] "the index number of the cost of living", and r is [...] "the proportion of the bank's potential liabilities (k') held in the form of cash." [...] Keynes also assumes [...] "...the public,(k') including the business world, finds it convenient to keep the equivalent of k consumption in cash and of a further available k' at their banks against cheques..."

5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|E

40|$|The angular {{displacements}} {{necessary for}} 70 % correct detection were determined in normal subjects {{at the shoulder}} and elbow joints and at the terminal joint of the middle finger. Angular velocities of displacement between 0. 125 degrees and 160 degrees/s were tested. Each joint was tested in the mid-range of its normal excursion. The joints were carefully supported for testing and the muscles acting at the joints were relaxed. When assessed in terms of angular displacements and angular velocities, proprioceptive performance at the shoulder and elbow joints was superior to that at the finger joint. Optimal performance at the finger joint was attained over the range of angular velocities from 10 degrees to 80 degrees/s. Optimal performance at both more proximal joints was optimal over a wider range (2 degrees- 80 degrees/s). Active pointing movements made without vision of the moving part were performed at each joint at velocities {{within the range of}} optimal proprioceptive performance. However, when detection levels and displacement velocities were expressed in terms of linear displacements and velocities at the finger tip for all three joints, the finger joint gave the best performance and the shoulder the worst. In practical terms, therefore, displacements of a given linear extent are best detected if they move distal joints and worst if they move proximal joints. For the elbow and finger joints the detection level and velocity data were expressed also in terms of <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> in the lengths of muscles operating at these joints, and as <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> in the distance between the points of attachment of the joint capsules. Analysis in terms of <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> of muscle length showed remarkably similar performance levels at both joints.

Modeling fermentation-altering supplements is of interest, and thus, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to quantify the change in VFA profile caused by monensin dose in high-grain-fed beef cattle. The developmental database used for meta-analysis included 58 treatment means from 16 studies from the published literature, and the <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in molar acetate, propionate, and butyrate (mol/ 100 mol) as well as total VFA (mM) with monensin feeding dose (mg/kg DM, concentration in the feed) was evaluated using the MIXED procedure (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) with the study treated as a random effect. The mean monensin dose in the literature database was 30. 9 ± 3. 70 mg/kg DM and ranged from 0. 0 to 88. 0 mg/kg DM. Mean DMI was 7. 8 ± 0. 26 kg DM/d, mean concentrate proportion of the diet was 0. 87 ± 0. 01, and mean treatment period was 42 ± 5. 6 d. Results produced the following equations: <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in acetate (mol/ 100 mol) = - 0. 0634 (± 0. 0323) × monensin (mg/kg DM) / 100 (P = 0. 068), <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in propionate (mol/ 100 mol) = 0. 260 (± 0. 0735) × monensin (mg/kg DM) / 100 (P = 0. 003), and <b>proportional</b> <b>change</b> in butyrate (mol/ 100 mol) = - 0. 335 (± 0. 0916) × monensin (mg/kg DM) / 100 (P = 0. 002). The change in total VFA was not significantly related to monensin dose (P = 0. 93). The results presented here indicate that the shift in VFA profile may be dose dependent, with increasing propionate and decreasing acetate and butyrate proportions (mol/ 100 mol). These equations could be applied within mechanistic models of rumen fermentation to represent the effect of monensin dose on the VFA profile in high-grain-fed beef cattle...|$|R

The comparative risk assessment approach has been used to assess the health consequences of climate change worldwide, to inform decisions on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and in a regional assessment of the Oceania region in the Pacific Ocean to provide more location-specific information relevant to local mitigation and adaptation decisions. The approach places climate change within the same criteria for epidemiologic assessment as other health risks and accounts for the size of the burden of climate-sensitive diseases rather than just proportional change, which highlights the importance of small <b>proportional</b> <b>changes</b> in diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition that cause a large burden.
