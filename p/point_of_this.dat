25|$|A {{bridge of}} high ground connects the Southern and Central Fells, running from Bow Fell in the Scafells to Pike of Stickle, {{one of the}} Langdale Pikes. Rossett Pike is the high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ridge, bordered by Mickleden {{in the south and}} Langstrath to the north.|$|E
25|$|The Langdale Pikes form {{a raised}} rocky parapet around the {{southern}} and eastern edges of a high tableland centred upon Thunacar Knott. Harrison Stickle is the high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system and its crags fall south and east from the summit, presenting an arresting view from the valley floor 2,000ft below, or from further afield.|$|E
25|$|The Saint John River itself {{flows into}} the Bay of Fundy through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at {{the centre of the}} city. It {{contains}} a unique phenomenon called the Reversing Falls where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> gorge also create a series of rapids.|$|E

25|$|Another notable <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> posture {{is that it}} {{is based}} on the six point star. Nataraja's head forms the topmost point of the star, while His {{spreading}} hair and right hand form the upper side points. His drape and raised left leg form the lower points, and His right leg that rests on the demon Myalagga forms the lowest point. Surrounding this is the arc of fire.|$|E
25|$|Swirl How {{stands at}} the {{geographical}} centre of the Coniston Fells and, according to some sources, may be the highest of the group. A long sickle shaped ridge extends from the summit of Swirl How, first north and then curving around to the east. Great Carrs is the high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ridge, which continues as Wet Side Edge, falling {{to the floor of}} Little Langdale. A western outlier branching off the main ridge between Great Carrs and Swirl How is Grey Friar.|$|E
25|$|Wisdom's career revived in the 1990s, {{helped by}} the young comedian Lee Evans, whose act was often {{compared}} to Wisdom's work. His films for Rank were playing to new audiences via television screenings, with young fans in the United Kingdom and abroad. The high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new popularity was the knighthood he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list. During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} half of {{the district}} is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to {{some parts of the}} borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> end of the district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Geffrye Museum and Hoxton War Memorial.|$|E
25|$|Glaramara is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District in Cumbria. It is a {{substantial}} fell {{that is part of}} a long ridge that stretches for over six kilometres from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale up to the important mountain pass of Esk Hause. The summit of Glaramara at 783m (2,569ft) is the central <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ridge, which separates the valleys of Langstrath and Grains Gill. However, the ridge has two additional fells, numerous subsidiary tops and several small tarns making its traverse an appealing and challenging walk.|$|E
25|$|The Slavic tribes {{settled in}} the {{territory}} of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of Samo's empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the Principality of Nitra arose in the 8th century and its ruler Pribina had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring Moravia, the principality formed {{the core of the}} Great Moravian Empire from 833. The high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Slavonic empire came with the arrival of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863, during the reign of Duke Rastislav, and the territorial expansion under Duke Svätopluk I.|$|E

25|$|In Alliance, {{there are}} three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one {{specific}} team (not the team chasing them, {{but they will be}} able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. The Advanced Alliance mode is a variant of Alliance mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the Advanced Wanted mode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s a post-rave, DIY, free party scene had {{established}} {{itself in the}} UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban squat scenes and politically inspired new age travellers. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike. Prominent among the sound systems operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in Brighton, Smokescreen in Sheffield, DiY in Nottingham, Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's Spiral Tribe. The high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the Castlemorton Common Festival for 5 days of partying.|$|E
25|$|In the 1999–2000 season, on {{the back}} of his most {{successful}} season at Leeds where he also won PFA Young Player of the Year was selected in the PFA Team of the Year, Italian giants Internazionale had bid £25million for Kewell, but Leeds rejected the offer, citing his value to their side. The high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period was when Kewell helped Leeds to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League in 2000–01. The club, however, began to suffer financial difficulties and, by 2002–03, having sold many of their best players, Kewell's efforts in front of goal merely delayed Leeds' slide from being relegated from the Premiership. Kewell's efforts at Leeds United gained him international recognition for his talents. He scored 45 goals in over 180 appearances for Leeds over eight years.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe discuss {{relations}} between cluster structures and so-called cluster prestructures. On the other hand, we place {{ourselves in the}} framework of a context where entity descriptions belong to a complete meet-semilattice. Such a context induces a Galois correspondence which, in turn, induces a closure operator on the powerset of the entity set. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a particular collection <b>of</b> fixed <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> closure operator to be hierarchical. Moreover, we specify the collection of all entity subsets which are both fixed <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> closure operator and strong clusters associated with a given pairwise dissimilarity function, {{as well as that of}} all entity subsets which are both fixed <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> closure operator and weak clusters associated with a given k-way dissimilarity function...|$|R

25|$|South Africa's early Test record {{remains the}} worst among all current Test-playing nations with ten defeats {{and just a}} solitary draw from their first eleven tests, {{and it was not}} until 1904 that they began to emerge as a quality {{international}} team. They recorded their first Test win against England in 1906, which took them 17 years. The low <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> barren early period for the South African team was an English tour of 1895-96, where South Africa was humiliated 3-0 in 3 Tests by an English side for the first time remotely comparable to a full-strength team, losing all the tests by 288 runs, an innings and 197 runs, and by an innings and 32 runs respectively. The touring English team, arranged by Lord Hawke, consisted of four of the best cricketers of the world at the time: Tom Hayward, C.B. Fry, George Lohmann and Sammy Woods.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex activity increases when errors {{occur and}} are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept {{as a form of}} higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the {{anterior cingulate cortex}}, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.|$|E
