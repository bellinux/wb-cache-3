50|$|Before the {{creation}} of the CIC, Cadet Service of Canada Officers that led Army Cadets were trained through a seven-week modified Reserve Force Infantry Officers Course during July and August. Air Cadet Squadron Officers had a similar training system. With integration, those programs ceased. In 1969, the Army Cadet program that was accustomed to sending new entries for training, established an internal training program. They conducted two-week summer courses at the Citadelle in Quebec City, for groups of officers from the three elements. A school for Cadet Instructors was established in Eastern Region in 1971. From 1972 on, CIL officers were required to take courses at what was first called the Cadet Instructor School, and later became the RCIS (Regional Cadet Instructor School). Passing these courses was not yet a prerequisite for promotion. During the <b>first</b> few years, <b>officers</b> of all ranks were taking part in the basic courses. Following the example of Eastern Region, other regions opened schools during the mid-1970s and, in 1976, Ottawa finally gave them official blessing by providing training programs and standards to meet. Since then, taking courses has been required for promotion. Former Officers of the Regular Force or Primary Reserve who component transfer to the Cadet Organization and Training Service maintain their commission and Non Commissioned Members may retain their rank or choose to be commissioned into the CIC Branch. Sergeants/Petty Officers Second Class are commissioned as Second Lieutenants/Acting Sub Lieutenants, former Warrant Officers/Petty <b>Officers</b> <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> are commissioned as Lieutenants/Sub Lieutenants and former Master Warrant Officers/Chief <b>Petty</b> <b>Officers</b> Second Class and Chief Warrant Officers/Chief <b>Petty</b> <b>Officers</b> <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> are commissioned as Captains/Lieutenants (Navy).|$|R
