5|$|Inspired by the curve-shortening flow on smooth curves, {{researchers}} have studied methods for flowing polygons {{so that they}} stay <b>polygonal,</b> with applications including pattern formation and synchronization in distributed systems of robots. Length-preserving <b>polygonal</b> flows {{can be used to}} solve the carpenter's rule problem.|$|E
5|$|Msida Bastion – a <b>polygonal</b> {{asymmetrical}} bastion with a demi-bastioned retrenchment. A cemetery {{was built}} on its upper part in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Quarantine Bastion – a <b>polygonal</b> {{asymmetrical}} bastion with a demi-bastioned retrenchment. It is breached by {{a modern}} road.|$|E
5|$|From 1888 to 1910, a {{new series}} of fortifications were built to house breech-loading guns. These were Della Grazie Battery, Spinola Battery, Garden Battery, Wolseley Battery, Pembroke Battery and Fort Benghisa. The latter was the last <b>polygonal</b> fort to be built in Malta.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. <b>Polygonal</b> tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the <b>polygonal</b> scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or <b>polygonal</b> roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over <b>polygonal</b> garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The PC game {{featured}} a non-linear plot, non-player characters that each ran {{in their own}} independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed <b>polygonal</b> solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not {{require the use of}} a 3D accelerator card to play the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} Fort Tigné was mainly {{based on the}} Lunette d'Arçon, {{as well as the}} work of Marc René, marquis de Montalembert. The final design by Antoine Étienne de Tousard {{resulted}} in a revolutionary fortification, which made it one of the oldest <b>polygonal</b> forts in the world.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a <b>polygonal</b> shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two <b>polygonal</b> chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from one pair of segments to another.|$|E
5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using <b>polygonal</b> geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1084 and 1504, Worcester Cathedral {{represents}} every medieval style from Norman to Perpendicular. It {{is famous}} for its Norman crypt, and for its circular chapter house, which became the model from which derives the series of uniquely British <b>polygonal</b> chapter houses. Also notable are a series of unusual Transitional Gothic bays, fine woodwork and the central tower, which, though not large, is nevertheless of particularly fine proportions.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief French occupation, {{the islands}} fell under British rule in 1800. Between the 1870s and the 1900s {{a number of}} <b>polygonal</b> forts and {{batteries}} were built around Malta's coastline and along the Great Fault. In the 1930s and 1940s, Fort Campbell, a series of pillboxes {{and a number of}} anti-aircraft batteries were constructed, and these were the last fortifications to be built in Malta.|$|E
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel {{was built}} on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major {{fortification}} in the harbour area was Fort Tigné, built at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture {{is very different from}} the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a <b>polygonal</b> fort. Many other <b>polygonal</b> forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Keep {{design in}} England {{began to change}} only {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or <b>polygonal</b> keeps built, including the keep at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped keep of Trim Castle and the famous <b>polygonal</b> design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square keeps remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great keeps were being built at Newcastle. Circular keep designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{also exist}} for {{describing}} <b>polygonal</b> tilings. When the tessellation {{is made of}} regular polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which is simply {{a list of the}} number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.|$|E
5|$|The Thayer {{system was}} white with large <b>polygonal</b> patches of light sea blue (called Thayer Blue). This measure was most useful in Arctic latitudes with {{extended}} twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover. Purity of color {{was important for}} full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is located}} on the top of an {{irregular}} plateau, whose southern, eastern and northern slopes are abrupt, with the softer western slope, towards the modern village of Kastro, offering the easiest access. The heart of the fortress consists of a large hexagonal keep, complemented towards the west, where the terrain is more accessible, by an additional outer wall, likewise of irregular <b>polygonal</b> outline, enclosing a second, much wider courtyard (the outer ward).|$|E
5|$|The new fort {{was quite}} small by eighteenth century standards, {{and it was}} more similar to a large redoubt than a fort. Despite this, its design was {{considered}} to be revolutionary, since {{it was one of the}} earliest <b>polygonal</b> forts to be built around the world. Fort Tigné was also the last major fortification built by the Order of Saint John.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{rectangular}} 13th century porch {{on either side}} of the nave. The north porch has an inner component dating from 1200, with black Purbeck Marble columns, and an outer hexagonal portion built in 1325 which is ogee-cusped with a Moorish appearance. The outer <b>polygonal</b> part of the north porch was built in the 14th century. It has crocketed gables to the buttresses and is richly decorated with pinnacles and a quatrefoil parapet above a lierne vault.|$|E
5|$|Timber-roofed basilicas, {{which had}} been the {{standard}} form until the 6th century, would be displaced by domed churches from the 9th century on. In the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843 – 1204), domes were normally built to emphasize separate functional spaces, rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier. Resting domes on circular or <b>polygonal</b> drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.|$|E
5|$|A new keep was built, {{probably}} in the 13th century. This {{took the form of}} a <b>polygonal</b> shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{section of}} rubble wall about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high remains, {{incorporated}} into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are {{designated as a}} scheduled monument. The area {{to the south of}} the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two <b>polygonal</b> towers. The site is {{on the east side of}} Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.|$|E
5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it was framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the <b>polygonal</b> vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many fortresses, Golubac's {{structure}} was modified over time. For years, there were only five towers. Later, four more were added. The towers were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel. Once firearms came into use, the Turks fortified the western towers with cannon ports and <b>polygonal</b> or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick. After the Hungarian raid in 1481, they added the final tower, complete with cannon embrasures and galleries.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the character set {{to include more}} features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of <b>polygonal</b> tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large <b>polygonal</b> tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is <b>polygonal</b> in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D <b>polygonal</b> renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Sierra's Betrayal at Krondor (1993) {{was based}} upon author Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia setting. It {{featured}} turn-based, semi-tactical combat, a skill-based experience system, and a magic system {{similar to that of}} Dungeon Master, but suffered due to outdated, <b>polygonal</b> graphics. Feist was heavily consulted during development, and later created his own novelization based upon the game. The sequel Betrayal in Antara (1997) re-used the first game's engine but—as Sierra had lost its license for Krondor—was set in a different universe. Return to Krondor (1998) used a new game engine, but returned to Feist's setting.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The <b>polygonal</b> tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with <b>polygonal</b> towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E
5|$|The <b>polygonal</b> gun {{platform}} {{around the}} keep has 16 sides, {{with a total}} of 14 gun embrasures. The two-storey forebuilding dates from {{the second half of the}} 16th century, with three rooms on each level linked by a spiral-staircase, and was originally used to house the captain of the castle. Its entrance was guarded with a portcullis, and the roof was designed to be defendable with handguns. The stone bridge that stretches across the ditch that protects the castle dates from 1902; it would originally have been protected at the front by a rectangular gatehouse, but this was demolished at the start of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but <b>polygonal</b> or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small <b>polygonal</b> creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E
5|$|Transforming a curve {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform. Curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners, the trace of which forms the medial axis of the curve. A closely related curve {{evolution}} which moves straight segments of a <b>polygonal</b> curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve, its straight skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Upminster Bridge is a London Underground {{station on}} Upminster Road in the Upminster Bridge {{neighbourhood}} of the London Borough of Havering in northeast London, England. The station {{is on the}} District line and is the penultimate station on the eastern extremity of that line. The station was opened on 17 December 1934 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the local electrified tracks between Upminster and Barking that were constructed in 1932. The main station building is of a distinctive <b>polygonal</b> design. It has relatively low usage for a suburban station with approximately 1 million entries and exits during 2011.|$|E
