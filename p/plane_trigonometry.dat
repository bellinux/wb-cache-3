2500|$|In THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE ART OF WEIGHING, The second part: Of the propositions , Page 41, Theorem XI, Proposition XIX, he derived the {{condition}} for the balance of forces on inclined planes using a diagram with a [...] "wreath" [...] containing evenly spaced round masses resting on the planes of a triangular prism (see the illustration on the side). He concluded that the weights required were proportional to the lengths of the sides on which they rested assuming the third side was horizontal and {{that the effect of}} a weight was reduced in a similar manner. It's implicit that the reduction factor is the height of the triangle divided by the side (the sine of the angle of the side with respect to the horizontal). Stevin also made contributions to trigonometry. His book, De Driehouckhandel, included <b>Plane</b> <b>Trigonometry.</b> [...] The proof diagram of this concept is known as the [...] "Epitaph of Stevinus". [...] Although Stevin's conclusion is correct his proof has certain logical defects as pointed out by Dijksterhuis.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical <b>plane</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> and this is why it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
