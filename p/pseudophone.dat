For {{most of his}} career, he was {{a faculty member at}} the University of Illinois. In 1928, he constructed the <b>pseudophone,</b> an acoustic device that induced a form of auditory illusion by distorting the direction from which an audible sound appeared to originate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{what we call}} Transparent Hearing: the use of microphone equipped headphones for augmented audio. It provides a framework for experiments like realtime audio alteration, multi-modal sensory integration and collaborative listening experiences. We attach high-quality microphones to headphones and send the signal through a computer to these headphones. We have built headphones that stop the music if somebody {{wants to talk to}} you, a <b>pseudophone,</b> and collaborative I Hear What You Hear headphones that are triggered by eye-contact...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical speculations {{concerning}} {{the presence or}} absence of inter-manual transfer under differing conditions of sensorimotor adaptation have assumed that the adaptation produced by them are essentially equivalent. The possibility remains that sensorimotor changes generated by these differ-ent exposure conditions may be dissimilar. In order to resolve this, it is necessary to obtain relevant information from exposure conditions that pro-vide adequate controls. Auditory rearrangement produced by functional ro-tation of the interaural axis by <b>pseudophones</b> (a binaural microphone/earphone array worn on the head), represents an exposure condition with suitable con-trols. Intermanual transfer of adaptation to rearranged ear-hand coordination produced after exposure to a 30 Â° shift of the interaural axis was therefore investigated. FINDINGS Except for one exposure condition, changes in ear-hand coordination that occur to compensate the distortion induced by the <b>pseudophones,</b> fail t...|$|R
2500|$|The album's first single, [...] "Beverly Hills", {{became a}} hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. [...] "Beverly Hills" [...] was {{nominated}} for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single off Make Believe was [...] "We Are All on Drugs". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing [...] "on drugs" [...] with [...] "in love" [...] and renaming the song [...] "We Are All in Love". In early 2006, {{it was announced that}} Make Believe was certified platinum, and [...] "Beverly Hills" [...] was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] by Gwen Stefani. Make Believes third single, [...] "Perfect Situation", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. [...] "This Is Such a Pity" [...] was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release. The Make Believe tour also found the band using additional instruments onstage, adding piano, synthesizers, <b>pseudophones,</b> and guitarist Bobby Schneck.|$|R
