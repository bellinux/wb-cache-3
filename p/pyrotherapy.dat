50|$|<b>Pyrotherapy</b> {{was also}} {{employed}} in psychiatry. Of note {{here is the}} use of sulfozinum and pyrogenal that was relatively widespread in Soviet psychiatry.|$|E
50|$|Methods of {{treating}} patients included deliberate hypoglycaemia, electric shocks and lobotomy. Other treatments were to sedate patients during {{large portions of}} the day, to bathe them in frigid or very hot water and also <b>pyrotherapy</b> - causing high fever through exposure to certain bacteria, sometimes leading to unconsciousness.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyrotherapy</b> (artificial fever, {{therapeutic}} fever) is {{a method}} of treatment by raising the body temperature or sustaining an elevated body temperature (caused by a fever). In general, the body temperature was maintained at 41° Celsius(105° Fahrenheit) [...] Many diseases were treated by this method {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. In general, it was done by exposing the patient to hot baths, warm air, or (electric) blankets.|$|E
50|$|The main work {{pursued by}} Wagner-Jauregg {{throughout}} his life {{was related to the}} treatment of mental disease by inducing a fever, an approach known as <b>pyrotherapy.</b> In 1887 he investigated the effects of febrile diseases on psychoses, making use of erisipela and tuberculin (discovered in 1890 by Robert Koch). Since these methods of treatment did not work very well, he tried in 1917 the inoculation of malaria parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called general paresis of the insane), caused by neurosyphilis, at that time a terminal disease. It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis. Thus, from 1917 to the mid 1940s, malaria induced by the least aggressive parasite, Plasmodium vivax, was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of <b>pyrotherapy).</b> This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. This discovery earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927. His main publication was a book titled Verhütung und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria (Prevention and treatment of progressive paralysis by malaria inoculation) in the Memorial Volume of the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, (1931). The technique was known as malariotherapy; however, it was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.|$|E
50|$|It was {{observed}} that sometimes patients who developed high fevers were cured of syphilis. Thus, {{for a brief}} time malaria was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of <b>pyrotherapy).</b> This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. Malaria as a treatment for syphilis was usually reserved for late disease, especially neurosyphilis, and then followed by either Salvarsan or Neosalvarsan as adjuvant therapy. This discovery was championed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg, who won the 1927 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of neurosyphilis. Later, hyperthermal cabinets (sweat-boxes) were used for the same purpose. These treatments were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin, and its widespread manufacture after World War II allowed syphilis to be effectively and reliably cured.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To make a {{thorough}} historical review {{about the use}} of sulfozine therapy in Soviet, post-Soviet and Western psychiatry, and to show both its repressive and disciplinary use and its therapeutic utility, to reach an objective conclusion on its use and value, and to present two treatment-resistant clinical cases in which remission was obtained only after sulfozine use, while all other biological methods tried, together with standard psychopharmacotherapy, have failed in these cases. Methodology. We have performed a deep historical literature search in the libraries of Tel-Aviv University, Medical Faculty, and Stavropol State Medical University, and in PubMed. The data we have found regarding sulfozine use, both repressive and therapeutic, are then presented there. Together with such historical data, we also present and describe two clinical cases we have met in our practice. Results. Results we have obtained by this historical review and review of the cases presented, definitely show that <b>pyrotherapy</b> (including sulfozine therapy) wasn’t just an unscientific, cruel and exclusively repressive or disciplinary method of therapy, but also was - and perhaps still can be - an useful therapeutic method of overcoming treatment resistance. Practical implications. Our results can be applied in psychiatry and substance use medicine, especially in treatment-resistant subpopulations...|$|E
