5|$|Eaton's <b>pintail</b> has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen <b>pintail)</b> of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet <b>pintail)</b> of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern <b>pintail.</b> Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern <b>pintail</b> has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's <b>pintail</b> is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's <b>pintail,</b> A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pintail</b> or {{northern}} <b>pintail</b> (Anas acuta) is a duck {{with wide}} geographic distribution that breeds {{in the northern}} areas of Europe, Asia and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton's <b>pintail</b> {{is considered to be}} a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the large}} dabbling duck genus Anas, the {{northern}} pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, {{such as the}} yellow-billed <b>pintail</b> (A. georgica) and Eaton's <b>pintail</b> (A. eatoni). The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus Dafila (described by Stephens, 1824), an arrangement supported by morphological, molecular and behavioural data. The famous British ornithologist Sir Peter Scott gave this name to his daughter, the artist Dafila Scott.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} migration {{movements and}} chronology between Northern <b>Pintails</b> (Anas acuta) marked with dorsally mounted satellite transmitters and <b>pintails</b> marked only with tarsus rings. During weekly intervals of spring and autumn migration between their wintering area in Japan and nesting areas in Russia, the mean distance that ringed <b>pintails</b> had migrated {{was up to}} 1000 km farther than the mean distance radiomarked <b>pintails</b> migrated. Radiomarked <b>pintails</b> were detected at spring migration sites on average 9. 9 days (90 % CI 8. 0, 11. 8) later than ringed <b>pintails</b> that were recovered within 50 km. Although ringed and radiomarked <b>pintails</b> departed from Japan on similar dates, the disparity in detection of radiomarked versus ringed <b>pintails</b> at shared sites increased 7. 7 days (90 % CI 5. 2, 10. 2) for each 1000 km increase in distance from Japan. Thus, <b>pintails</b> marked with satellite transmitters arrived at nesting areas that were 2500 km from Japan on average 19 days later than ringed birds. Radiomarked <b>pintails</b> were detected at autumn migration stopovers on average 13. 1 days (90 % CI 9. 8, 16. 4) later than ringed birds that were recovered within 50 km. We hypothesize that dorsal attachment of 12 – 20 g satellite transmitters to Northern <b>Pintails</b> increased the energetic cost of flight, which resulted in more rapid depletion of energetic reserves and shortened the distance <b>pintails</b> could fly without refueling. Radiomarked <b>pintails</b> may have used more stopovers or spent longer periods at stopovers. causing their migration schedule to diverge from ringed <b>pintails.</b> We urge further evaluation {{of the effects of}} dorsally mounted transmitters on migration chronology of waterfowl...|$|R

40|$|Natural and {{anthropogenic}} Iberian wetlands {{in southern}} Europe {{are well known}} for supporting large numbers of migratory Palaearctic waterbirds each winter. However, information on the geographical origin of dabbling ducks overwintering in these wetlands is scarce and mostly limited to data from ringing recoveries. Here, we used intrinsic isotopic markers to determine the geographical origin {{of male and female}} Northern <b>Pintails</b> Anas acuta and Eurasian Teal Anas crecca in Extremadura, inland Iberia, a key site for overwintering dabbling ducks. Additionally, we fitted six Northern <b>Pintails</b> with GPS-GSM tags to complement the data derived from stable isotope analysis. Most (> 70 %) first calendar-year Northern <b>Pintails</b> were assigned to regions above 55 °N, flying 2600 – 5600 km from their main natal regions to Extremadura. Mean values of d 2 Hf varied significantly between male and female Northern <b>Pintails,</b> suggesting that the sexes had different geographical origins. Data from tagged adult Northern <b>Pintails</b> supported the isotopic data, one male flying more than 5000 km to the coast of the Pechora Sea (Russia). Most (> 70 %) first calendar-year Eurasian Teal were assigned to the region between 48 ° and 60 °N, travelling 1500 – 4500 km to arrive in Extremadura. Male and female Eurasian Teal showed marginal differences in mean values of d 2 Hf. In migratory dabbling ducks, pairing typically occurs on the wintering grounds, and ducks in their first winter can breed the following spring. For Northern <b>Pintails,</b> pair formation in Extremadura could occur between individuals with different geographical origins, which could contribute to the genetic variability of their offsprin...|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} <b>pintail</b> is {{a popular}} species for game shooting because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} <b>pintail</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, but it has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the <b>pintail</b> sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other Anas ducks.

5|$|<b>Pintail</b> nests and chicks are {{vulnerable}} to predation by mammals, such as foxes and badgers, and birds like gulls, crows and magpies. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats. Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake <b>pintail</b> looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E

5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern <b>pintail</b> (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern <b>pintail,</b> horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year.

5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern <b>pintail</b> and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern <b>pintail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern <b>pintail,</b> leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
