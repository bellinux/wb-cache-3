5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to do something different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the company's {{developers}} are given much creative freedom. Uninvolved staff members can {{comment on the}} games' designs. Price considered game design a kind of social design, in which the team solve problems together. <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> trust {{is an essential part}} of a game's development, and that honest communications between staff members can ensure the correct direction of games. Price also said admitting mistakes can help maximize creativity, and that the company's leaders should be approachable by staff members.|$|E

Following Crean's death in 1815, his widow continued to run the property, though with a mortgage of £4000. It was the need to pay off this mortgage that led to the hotel being sold in 1822, when it was purchased by a Joseph Ellis for £11,022.|$|R
25|$|Following Politico's {{reporting}} on the matter, <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that he would stop taking taxpayer-funded private jet flights pending a formal review by his department's inspector general. President Trump {{said that he was}} unhappy about Price's expenditures, but declined to state whether he would fire him. <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> later that September that he would reimburse taxpayers for $51,887, which he calculated as the cost of his seat on the more than $400,000 worth of charter flights. He also vowed to discontinue the use of private charter flights for his travel. Later that day, it was revealed that the expenditures for Price's charter and military flights were higher than $1 million, including flights taken by Secretary Price and his wife to Europe and Africa. Politico also noted that Price had, in June 2017, defended a proposal to cut $663,000 from HHS's $4.9 million annual travel budget.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to questions {{as to whether or}} not vaccines cause autism, Price stated in January 2017 “I think the science in that instance is that it does not”. <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> in March 2017 that it should be up to individual states to determine whether vaccinations should be required - a position that is in keeping with current U.S. law, which does not require vaccinations on a federal level. All fifty states do however, have laws requiring that children in public schools be vaccinated.|$|E

Meanwhile, Boise developer Larry Leasure proposed a shopping mall, named Westpark, at the intersection of Cole and Franklin Roads, but the mall was on hold due to zoning and access problems. <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> he might consider dropping the Cloverdale project if Leasure would agree to sell the Westpark site to him when the issues were resolved.|$|E

25|$|In August 1975, {{with the}} Leafs still {{controlling}} his NHL rights, Keon {{jumped to the}} World Hockey Association, signing {{a deal with the}} Minnesota Fighting Saints reportedly worth $300,000 over two seasons. The head coach of the Saints was Harry Neale, an old friend of Keon's. The team, and Keon, played well, but struggled badly financially. With 21 games left in the season, the team folded. Keon was expected to return to the NHL and {{was not included in the}} dispersal sale of Saints players to other WHA teams. The NHL's New York Islanders wanted Keon, but needed to negotiate a deal for his NHL rights with the Leafs. Again, the Leafs' asking <b>price</b> (<b>said</b> to have been a first-round draft pick) was too high, and a disappointed Keon signed with the WHA's Indianapolis Racers in March 1976.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the tension}} between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the {{following}} year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, [...] "I knew you would think so." [...] Years after Reeves's death, <b>Price</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "...I realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance.

Insomniac agreed, resulting in most of the Ratchet & Clank engine technology being developed in-house by Insomniac, but some very important renderers were those developed by Naughty Dog. Looking back on the agreement, Ted <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Naughty Dog's generosity gave us a huge leg up and allowed us to draw the enormous vistas in the game."

500|$|The game's {{plot was}} well received. Reviewers praised the game's {{cinematics}} and voice acting. Geddes said {{the story was}} good, but not on par with those of Bungie's Halo games, and {{that most of the}} characters were stereotypical and somewhat unlikable. Critics noted that for a strategy game, the campaign was rather short, with only 15 missions; Nate Ralph of Wired completed each in fewer than 40 minutes. Jon Wilcox of Total Video Games wrote [...] "there's an ebb and flow" [...] to the gameplay, with [...] "lengthy chapters cut with shorter punchy ones or time-based missions, all together creating a surprisingly compelling experience". Wilcox said the additions of performance-based medals added replay value to the campaign. <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that, although the story and mission structure of the game was fairly standard, levels that were [...] "rote" [...] in other RTS games seemed more substantial in Halo Wars. Reviewers such as Geddes, Wilcox, and Patrick Kolan of IGN UK said that the lack of a Covenant campaign was an unfortunate omission.|$|E
500|$|Although <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that no ballads were {{included}} in the album, critics opined that the downtempo pop song [...] "Everything is Beautiful" [...] was penned like one. [...] "Aphrodite", the title track of the album, is a nineties-influenced dance-pop song which features a [...] "foot-stomping" [...] beat and [...] "military drummed" [...] instrumentation, similar to that of a marching band. Stuart Price likened the song to Janet Jackson for its [...] "'Rhythm Nation'-esque qualities." [...] The song, one of Minogue's two collaborations with Pallot that were kept on the track list, is penned like a dance anthem through which Minogue [...] "brags" [...] about her sexual prowess. It was met with critical acclaim by most music critics, and was declared {{to be one of the}} strongest tracks on the album. Minogue wrote the melancholic seventh track [...] "Illusion" [...] with Price. [...] "Better than Today", the first track to be recorded for the album and the second collaboration with Pallot, is a [...] "breezy summertime" [...] pop song with influences of electropop and country music. It was complimented as likeable and a stand-out, but criticised for its monotony.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century WNO gave more than 120 {{performances}} a year, with a repertoire, generally, of eight full-scale operas. Its regular audience figures totalled over 150,000 annually, in ten principal venues, three of them in Wales and seven in England. During this period the company was criticised for being insufficiently Welsh. A local politician, Adam <b>Price,</b> <b>said</b> that WNO ought to have a Welsh musical director; Alun Hoddinott said in 2004, [...] "WNO has put on perhaps four or five Welsh operas over 20 years. ... They just seem to have an anti-Welsh music bias. I am sad that they do not do something for Welsh composers, especially young ones." [...] A more positive view of WNO came from Scotland, where the two main newspapers, The Scotsman and The Herald, greeted a visit from the company in 2005 with enthusiastic praise, contrasting the flourishing of opera in Wales with its neglect by politicians in Scotland and the consequent decline of Scottish Opera. In 2010 WNO commissioned Gair ar Gnawd ("Word on Flesh"), by Pwyll ap Siôn and Menna Elfyn, with words in Welsh, described as [...] "a contemporary story about Wales today ... inspired by the translation of the Bible".|$|E

25|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} 18th century, the {{pressing}} need to bring coal cheaply to Glasgow from the plentiful Monklands coalfield had been met by {{the construction of the}} Monkland Canal, opened throughout in 1794. This encouraged development of the coalfield but dissatisfaction at the monopoly <b>prices</b> <b>said</b> to be exacted by the canal led to the construction of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M), Scotland's first public railway; it opened in 1826. Development of the use of blackband ironstone by David Mushet, and the invention of the hot blast process of iron smelting by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 led to a huge and rapid increase in iron production and demand for the ore and for coal in the Coatbridge area.|$|R
500|$|In 1929, Smythe decided, in {{the midst}} of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. Their then home, the Arena Gardens, which they shared with the Marlboros, had been built in 1912 and seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were {{regularly}} filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $350,000, a <b>price</b> <b>said</b> to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from Sun Life for half of the expected $1 million cost and launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named Maple Leaf Gardens (MLG). A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each ($ in [...] dollars), with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased. Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. To fund construction of the building, workers were paid 20% of their salary in MLG stock. Construction started on June 1, 1931, and MLG was opened five months and two weeks later, on November 12, 1931, at a cost of $1.5 million ($ in [...] dollars). The Marlboros also moved to the new arena. [...] Bickell was named the first president of MLG.|$|E
500|$|Ed Fries, head of Microsoft Studios' {{publishing}} {{division at}} the time of acquisition, said that the company attempted to preserve Rare's culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft. Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an [...] "imperceptible" [...] start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing with each other. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change [...] "positive", saying that Microsoft's capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft for ruining Rare. Fansite Rare-Extreme documented {{a day in the life}} at Rare in 2008 with two employees showing a 9 till 5 work schedule. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare's works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to [...] "recreate the glory years", but their skills had become outdated and were no longer [...] "applicable in today's market". Duncan insisted that there were still a lot of talented people working at Rare, and they will have a [...] "bright future".|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, <b>Price</b> <b>said</b> that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol."

It is found that the economic norm in the Japanese gasoline market over the period 1992 to 2003 is strategic complements, that is, 'Do it, since everyone else is doing it'. It is suggested that some of the fall in gasoline <b>prices</b> <b>said</b> to result from successful deregulation should really be attributed to the production expansion derived from this strategic complementarity. ...|$|R
