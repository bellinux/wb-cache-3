Using these methods, preliminary parametric studies were conducted on both generic and actual HPOTP (high pressure oxygen turbopump) models. In particular, a novel modified harmonic balance/alternating Fourier transform (HB/AFT) method was developed and used to conduct a preliminary study {{of the effects of}} <b>fluid,</b> <b>bearing</b> and <b>seal</b> forces on the unbalanced response of a multi-disk rotor in the presence of bearing clearances. The method makes it possible to determine periodic, sub-, super-synchronous and chaotic responses of a rotor system. The method also yields information about the stability of the obtained response, thus allowing bifurcation analyses. This provides a more effective capability for predicting the response under transient conditions by searching in proximity of resonance peaks. Preliminary results were also obtained for the nonlinear transient response of an actual HPOTP model using an efficient, newly developed numerical method based on convolution integration. Currently, the HB/AFT is being extended for determining the aperiodic response of nonlinear systems. Initial results show the method to be promising...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic <b>fluid</b> from the <b>seal</b> clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|R

40|$|Igneous rocks {{occurring}} along convergent plate {{margins are}} significantly depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE). The geochemical signature of these rocks {{is thought to}} result from complex melt formation processes in-volving aqueous solutions, which stem from dehydration of the subducted slab. In these processes, HFSE retention may be controlled {{by the presence of}} accessory phases such as zircon and rutile, which can strongly fractionate HFSE (e. g. Brenan et al. 1994). However, the effective mobility of the HFSE is also dependent on the stability of these phases in the P-T-X space. Recently, we presented new data on the solubility of rutile in aqueous fluids acquired at in-situ conditions using diamond anvil cells and synchrotron radiation micro-XRF. The rutile solubility in Na-Al-Si <b>bearing</b> <b>fluids</b> is considerably enhanced in comparison to water and increased with the Na/Al ratio of the fluids, reaching more than 4000 ppm Ti in a fluid containing 30 wt % Na 2 Si 3 O 7 (Manning et al. accepted).
