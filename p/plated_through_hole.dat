5000|$|Double-sided flex {{circuits}} are flex circuits {{having two}} conductor layers. These flex circuits can be fabricated {{with or without}} plated through holes, though the <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one side only, the circuit {{is defined as a}} [...] "Type V (5)" [...] according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole,</b> terminations for electronic components are provided for {{on both sides of the}} circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a mousepad to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the failure}} {{mechanism}} of a <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> (PTH) {{is essential for}} a complete picture of their life span, and hence for the continued electronic reliability prediction and development of high performance printed circuit boards. This paper presents the efficacy of establishing a correlation between interconnect stress test (IST) and accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) data on standard high performance coupons. In accord with the observation in PTH micro-sectioning, a PTH failure mechanism is proposed based on the thermal expansion-induced shearing at the copper-resin interface. The PTH cycle to failure data from the two methodologies, IST and ATC, are correlated. In terms of the glass transition temperature, a linear relationship exists between two different data sets. It is also demonstrated that the base material thermal property and PTH sizes are the two essential factors determining the reliability of a PTH. Furthermore, a life stress model is created to predict the life time of a coupon at a particular temperature level. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

As different material has different material property, when the organic substrate is exposed to thermal excursion in the manufacturing process, the substrate warps. In this project, both experimental and simulation study were carried out {{in order to have}} a better understanding on the substrate warpage behaviour during the solder reflow process. In the experimental analysis, substrate warpage throughout the solder reflow process was measured by using shadow moirÃ©. Besides that, the thermally induced warpage due to the temperature rise was obtained by subtracting the measured warpage from the initial warpage. Finite element analysis was performed to predict the thermally induced warpage during the solder reflow process. Both results from the experiment and simulation were compared in order to validate the finite element models. A parametric study of the impact of design parameters and material properties on substrate warpage during the solder reflow process was performed.

40|$|Plastic {{substrate}} {{provides a}} cost effective solution to BGA assembly with high density I/Os. It also {{acts as a}} buffer to the mismatch of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between die and printed circuit board, releasing thermal stress. To meet the new challenge from the high reflow temperatures due to the use of Pb-free solder, substrates made of high performance engineering plastic materials with sophisticated microstructures are increasingly employed in the packaging industry. However, we have limited knowledge on many newly invented substrates, for instance, their thermal and mechanical properties, their performance under difference conditions including temperature and stresses, particularly the structure-property relationships. With insufficient database, packaging engineers have difficulty in package structure design, performance simulation and service life prediction. In this study, five different plastic substrates manufactured for Pb-free PBGA assembly were tested. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEW and X-Ray analysis were employed to disclose the material compositions, microstructure and filler loading. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the substrates were determined at room temperature by tensile tests.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the factors that enhance conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation in printed wiring boards. The variables studied were (1) flux formulation, (2) conductor spacing, (3) operating voltage, and (4) temperature. A Weibull distribution of failure times due to CAF was observed. A novel test circuit was designed and implemented that allowed the mean time to failure to be determined for boards processed with three different fluxes, at 0. 5 mm and 0. 75 mm conductor spacings and at 150 V and 200 V. The boards were aged at 85 %RH and a temperature of 75 °C, 85 °C or 95 °C. It was found that the flux formulation affected the rate of CAF formation. A modified linear aliphatic polyether flux with a chloride activator had a significantly different activation energy than control printed wiring boards or those boards processed with a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux or a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux with a bromide activator. The addition of bromine to a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux decreased the rate of CAF formation as compared to poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol without a halide activator. The inter-relation between voltage and conductor spacing was quantified as a L 4 /V 2 relationship for the <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> test pattern used in this study. 325 V/mm was found to be a critical voltage gradient for the formation of CAF. The maximum temperature of the reflow profile also greatly enhances CAF formation and decreases the mean time to failure. Microscopic analysis showed distinct differences in CAF morphology between the various processed boards. Control boards had small halo-like CAF formations around a separated fiber / epoxy interface. CAF that formed on boards processed with poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol or poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol with a bromine activator had a stratified appearance that penetrated well into the epoxy. Boards that were processed with the modified linear aliphatic polyether with chlorine activator had a striated morphology that also penetrated into the epoxy. All CAFs were consistently copper and chlorine containing despite the use of a bromine containing flux. Electron diffraction revealed that a CAF observed in this study was synthetic atacamite. Stainless steel (i. e., iron, nickel, and chromium) residues were also observed as a result of drill bit breakage during PTH formation. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Laura J.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three separate}} studies that examined electronic components using numerical modeling approaches. The use of modeling techniques provided {{a deeper understanding}} of the physical phenomena that contribute to the formation of cracks inside ceramic capacitors, damage inside <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>holes,</b> and to dynamic fracture of MEMS structures. The modeling yielded numerical substantiations for previously proposed theoretical explanations. Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCCs) mounted with stiffer lead-free solder have shown greater tolerance than tin-lead solder for single cycle board bending loads with low strain rates. In contrast, flexible terminations have greater tolerance than stiffer standard terminations under the same conditions. It has been proposed that residual stresses in the capacitor account for this disparity. These stresses have been attributed to the higher solidification temperature of lead free solders coupled with the CTE mismatch between the board and the capacitor ceramic. This research indicated that the higher solidification temperatures affected the residual stresses. Inaccuracies in predicting barrel failures of <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are suspected to arise from neglecting the effects of the reflow process on the copper material. This research used thermo mechanical analysis (TMA) results to model the damage in the copper above the glass transition temperature (Tg) during reflow. Damage estimates from the hysteresis plots were used to improve failure predictions. Modeling was performed to examine the theory that brittle fracture in MEMS structures is not affected by strain rates. Numerical modeling was conducted to predict the probability of dynamic failure caused by shock loads. The models used a quasi-static global gravitational load to predict the probability of brittle fracture. The research presented in this dissertation explored drivers for failure mechanisms in flex cracking of capacitors, barrel failures in <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>holes,</b> and dynamic fracture of MEMS. The studies used numerical modeling to provide new insights into underlying physical phenomena.

In other formats, such as homogeneous stripline, it can be much thicker. For printed antennae, that are conformal to the device shape, flexible, hence very thin, substrates are required.

Since this mode cannot be avoided by operating below it, and multiple modes are undesirable, it needs to be suppressed. It is an odd mode, meaning that the electric potentials on the two return conductors are equal and opposite. Thus, it can be suppressed by bonding the two return conductors together.

This paper discusses the effect of the steady-state operating temperature, as controlled by parameters such as the coolant inlet temperature, on the fatigue life of electronic assemblies subjected to thermal cycling resulting from off-on power cycling. The power cycling fatigue life depends on the steady-state operating temperature Ts, {{as well as on the}} temperature range ΔT in the thermal cycle. The power cycling durability of copper <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> in circuit boards is very sensitive to the steady-state PTH operating temperature, because the strain ranges are in the portion of the copper S-Nf (strain vs. number of cycles to failure) curve that is nearly horizontal.

Since the PWMLB failure in question are induced by a thermal stress, and since the poorer grades of Type E materials used in these structures are susceptible to premature failure under thermal stress, the use of elevated temperature rupture and creep rupture testing is proposed as a means for screening copper foil, or its PTH equivalent, in order to eliminate the problem of Type E copper microcracking in advanced PWMLBs...|$|R

The present study is intended to evaluate press-fit connections using various lead-free finishes on compliant pins and PTH’s and then compare to tin-lead finish. The lead-free finishes for the compliant pins are plated with matte and bright pure tin, and the lead-free finishes for the PTH’s are electroplated Au, OSP, and immersion tin, Au, and Ag finishes. In the design of experiments (DOE) of the current study, single pin tests were used to obtain the DOE outputs of insertion and retention forces for eye-of-the-needle (EON) compliant pins in PTH’s. For all three EON finishes (two pure tin and one tin-lead), the DOE results show that finished PTH size is the most important factor to determine the insertion force. The insertion force is a strong inverted linear function of finished PTH size (i. e., a larger force is required for a smaller finished PTH size). The impact from pin installation/repair cycle is the second factor behind the finished PTH size. The finishes of EON and PTH are only minor factors for the insertion force.

Low-cost FR- 4 circuit materials have been in use for a wide range of circuits for decades. FR- 4 is glass-reinforced epoxy laminate material. Its performance is predictable and reliable, and it can be processed with basic fabrication methods. However, FR- 4 exhibits a very high dissipation factor, which translates into high dielectric losses for circuits at microwave frequencies. Because of its loss characteristics, FR- 4 is typically not used for pure RF/microwave circuits, but has been used in some high-frequency hybrid multilayer PCBs for various reasons. FR- 4 is available in standard grade and with high glass transition temperature (Tg), which is the temperature at which the modulus of the material will change dramatically. Such temperature changes can impact the reliability of <b>plated</b> <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> (PTHs) <b>through</b> the laminate, as used to interconnect different circuit layers in a multilayer PCB. Some high-Tg FR- 4 materials provide good stability with the processing temperatures required for many circuit fabrication tech...|$|R
