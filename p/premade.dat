5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a series of}} training missions, a single-player campaign with <b>premade</b> missions, a deathmatch mode in which the player fights increasingly difficult and outnumbered battles against the computer, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|In a {{first for}} the series, Days of Ruin {{includes}} online multiplayer over Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, {{as well as a}} feature for players to share their own custom map designs and download maps made by others (custom maps and sharing custom maps is a feature present in all Advance Wars games). Over 150 <b>premade</b> maps are included in the game for use in local multiplayer, and designed for two, three, and four-player matches. Multiplayer games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is their turn. It is also possible to set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the early}} tokens were created by {{companies}} such as Dowst Miniature Toy Company, which made metal charms and tokens designed to be used on charm bracelets. The battleship and cannon were also used briefly in the Parker Brothers war game Conflict (released in 1940), but after the game failed on the market, the <b>premade</b> pieces were recycled into Monopoly usage. Hasbro recently adopted the battleship and cannon for Diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} coffeehouse chain Starbucks {{began as}} a modest business roasting and selling coffee beans in 1971, by three college students Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl. The first store opened on March 30, 1971 at the Pike Place Market in Seattle, followed by a second and third {{over the next two}} years. Entrepreneur Howard Schultz joined the company in 1982 as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing, and pushed to sell <b>premade</b> espresso coffee. The others were reluctant, but Schultz opened Il Giornale in Seattle in April 1986. He bought the other owners out in March 1987 and pushed on with plans to expand—from 1987 to the end of 1991, the chain (rebranded from Il Giornale to Starbucks) expanded to over 100 outlets. The company has 16,600 stores in over 40 countries worldwide.|$|E
25|$|While {{the feature}} film {{made use of}} new sets and props, Dwyer reused {{previous}} Star Trek props or made new ones out of <b>premade</b> materials where possible rather than {{spend more money on}} entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements. The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from The Next Generation, with others added in deliberate nods to past episodes. In addition to sets used on The Next Generation, other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for , and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes were repurposed from the sets of The Hunt for Red October. Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Trading Card Game is a {{collectible}} {{card game}} with {{similarities to other}} card games, like [...] [...] The game was designed to portray the VS System rules {{exactly the same as}} the physical version, created by baseball card manufacturer Upper Deck Entertainment. [...] Players start each match with a <b>premade</b> deck of cards, from which they draw a number of cards to form a hand. [...] Cards in the hand can be subsequently put into play, and each card represents a character or ability that is played against similar cards possessed by the opponent.|$|E
500|$|The {{score for}} Seiken Densetsu 3 was {{composed}} by Hiroki Kikuta, {{who had previously}} composed the music for Secret of Mana as his first video game score. Kikuta performed the sound selection, editing, effect design, and data encoding himself. Just as he did for Secret of Mana, Kikuta spent nearly 24hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "three-dimensional". Similarly, rather than use <b>premade</b> MIDI samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own MIDI samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super Famicom {{so that he would}} know exactly how the pieces would sound on the system's hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between the original MIDI sampler and the SNES. The soundtrack's music has been described by Freddie W. of RPGFan as [...] "bouncy, energetic, flowing, and serene", and is noted for its use of piano and drums. He further called it a [...] "more refined and matured" [...] version of the Secret of Mana soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} manufacturing, extrusion found application in food processing of instant foods and snacks, along with its already known uses in plastics and metal fabrication. [...] The main role of extrusion was originally developed for conveying and shaping fluid forms of processed raw materials. Present day, extrusion cooking technologies and capabilities have developed into sophisticated processing functions including: mixing, conveying, shearing, separation, heating, cooling, shaping, co-extrusion, venting volatiles and moisture, encapsulation, flavor generation and sterilization. Products such as certain pastas, many breakfast cereals, <b>premade</b> cookie dough, some french fries, certain baby foods, dry or semi-moist pet food and ready-to-eat snacks are mostly manufactured by extrusion. It {{is also used to}} produce modified starch, and to pelletize animal feed.|$|E
2500|$|When a user makes a building, model, or {{any other}} kind of object in Revit, they may use Revit's {{rendering}} engine to make a more realistic image of what is otherwise a very diagrammatic model. This is accomplished by either using the <b>premade</b> model, wall, floor, etc., tools, or making her or his own models, walls, materials, etc. Revit 2010 comes with a plethora of predefined materials, each of which can be modified to the user's desires. The user can also begin with a [...] "Generic" [...] material. With this, the user can set the rotation, size, brightness, and intensity of textures, gloss maps (also known as shinemaps), transparency maps, reflection maps, oblique reflection maps, hole maps, and bump maps, as well as leaving the map part out and just using the sliders for any one (or all or none) of the aforementioned features of textures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of hydrogels {{are attached to}} the fibre, one exception being the fibre optic-based sensor made by Itsubayashi’s group to measure glucose in fish (health indicator), which used a dialysis membrane as the support for the hydrogel. To be more specific, it relied on a GOx oxygen-ruthenium quenching assay where the protein was mixed with AWP (azide-functionalized polyvinyl alchool, a photocrosslinkable polymer) and cross-linked to a dialysis membrane that was rolled around a <b>premade</b> ruthenium oxygen probe (ocean optics) and inserted into an 18-gauge needle with eight holes on the side [...] (akin to a recorder). In such a set-up, the integrity of the protein has no effect on the sensor, unless below a certain concentration. As a consequence, the destruction or inaccessibility of a fraction of the protein is not problematic, which is in contrast to [...] or environmentally sensitive sensing. However, the response speed of this sensor is slow and requires a mathematical prediction to be applied to the measurement.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exception}} to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally {{is seen in the}} previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a <b>premade</b> oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically. [...] As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials, nanoparticle formulation and the creation of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a {{hook and loop}} fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a protective padding of roll cotton or a <b>premade</b> quilted pad. [...] The bandage is started {{on the outside of}} the leg, in the middle of the cannon bone, then wrapped down to either the fetlock or the hoof, depending on the purpose for which it is used, then back up to just under the knee, then back to the center of the cannon just above the starting point, ending {{on the outside of the}} leg. [...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable stretchable wrap that sticks to itself, or with washable fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a hook and loop closure. [...] Bandages may also be taped with medical tape to help them stay on.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} graphical {{computer games}} were severely limited by memory constraints. This forced content, such as maps, to be generated algorithmically on the fly: there simply {{was not enough}} space to store {{a large amount of}} <b>premade</b> levels and artwork. Pseudorandom number generators were often used with predefined seed values in order to create very large game worlds that appeared to be <b>premade.</b>|$|E

50|$|Restaurants {{with the}} highest volume of traffic, such as McDonald's, often opt to use <b>premade</b> milkshake {{mixtures}} that are prepared in automatic milkshake machines. These machines are metallic cylinders with beaters that use refrigeration coils to freeze <b>premade</b> milkshake mixtures into a drinkable texture. The number of different flavors that restaurants with automatic milkshake machines can serve {{is limited by the}} number of different tanks in their milkshake machines, so such fast food restaurants usually offer fewer flavors of milkshakes.|$|E
