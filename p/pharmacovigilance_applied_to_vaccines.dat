The productivity gap describes the situation whereby the invested resources within an industry do not match the expected product turn-over.

The objective is to calculate risk profiles for vaccines targeting human infectious diseases.

These currently available virus-based influenza vaccines {{are widely used}} in the clinic, but the vaccine production {{takes a long time}} and a huge number of embryonated chicken eggs. To overcome the imperfection of egg-based influenza vaccines, epitope-based peptide vaccines have been studied as an alternative approach. Here, we formulated an efficacious peptide vaccine without carriers using phosphodiester CpG-DNA and a special liposome complex. Potential epitope peptides predicted from the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the H 5 N 1 A/Viet Nam/ 1203 / 2004 strain (NCBI database, AAW 80717) were used to immunize mice along with phosphodiester CpG-DNA co-encapsulated in a phosphatidyl-β-oleoyl-γ-palmitoyl ethanolamine (DOPE) :cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHEMS) complex (Lipoplex(O)) without carriers. We identified a B cell epitope peptide (hH 5 N 1 HA 233 epitope, 14 amino acids) that can potently induce epitope-specific antibodies. Furthermore, immunization with a complex of the B cell epitope and Lipoplex(O) completely protects mice challenged with a lethal dose of recombinant H 5 N 1 virus.

40|$|Manuscript abstract: The {{immune system}} can {{recognize}} virtually any antigen, yet T cell responses against several pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{are restricted to}} {{a limited number of}} immunodominant epitopes. The host factors that affect immunodominance are incompletely understood. Whether immunodominant epitopes elicit protective CD 8 + T cell responses or instead act as decoys to subvert immunity and allow pathogens to establish chronic infection is unknown. Here we show that anatomically distinct human granulomas contain clonally expanded CD 8 + T cells with overlapping T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. Similarly, the murine CD 8 + T cell response against M. tuberculosis is dominated by TB 10. 44 - 11 -specific T cells with extreme TCRβ bias. Using a retrogenic model of TB 10. 44 - 11 -specific CD 8 + T cells, we show that TCR dominance can arise because of competition between clonotypes driven by differences in affinity. Finally, we demonstrate that TB 10. 4 -specific CD 8 + T cells mediate protection against tuberculosis, which requires interferon-γ production and TAP 1 -dependent antigen presentation in vivo.

40|$|Background: Many novel {{vaccines}} {{can cover}} {{only a fraction}} of all antigenic types of a pathogen. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the presence of interactions between vaccine strains and others is complicated by the interacting transmission dynamics among all strains. The present study investigated how the VE estimates measured in the field, based on estimated odds ratio or relative risks, are scaled by vaccination coverage and the transmission dynamics in the presence of cross-protective immunity between two strains, i. e. vaccine and non-vaccine strains. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two different types of epidemiological models, i. e. with and without re-infection by the same antigenic type, were investigated. We computed the relative risk of infection and the odds ratio of vaccination, the latter of which has been measured by indirect cohort method as <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> effectiveness study of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The VE based on the relative risk was less sensitive to epidemiological dynamics such as cross-protective immunity and vaccination coverage than the VE calculated from the odds ratio, and this was especially the case for the model without re-infection. Vaccine-induced (cross-protective) immunity against a non-vaccine strain appeared to yield the highest impact on the VE estimate calculated from the odds ratio of vaccination. Conclusion: It is essential to understand the transmission dynamics of non-vaccine strains so that epidemiological methods can appropriately measure both the direct and indirect population impact of vaccination.

It is known that the immunocompetence of the infected host is an important determinant for the outcome of infections with alphaherpesviruses. The recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors is an essential, very early step in the innate immune response to pathogens. In recent years, it has been discovered that viral DNA is a strong inducer of the innate immune system. The viral genome can be recognized in endosomes by TLR 9 and intracellularly, both in the cytosol and in the nucleus, {{by a variety of}} DNA sensors, the best documented being cGAS, RNA Pol III, IFI 16, and AIM 2. These DNA sensors use converging signaling pathways to activate transcription factors, such as IRF 3 and NF-kB, which induce the expression of type I interferons and other inflammatory cytokines, and to activate the inflammasome. This review summarizes the recent literature on the innate DNA sensing of alphaherpesviruses, the mechanisms of activation of the different sensors, their methods of signal transduction, and their physiological role in defense against herpesviral infection. We discuss how the viral DNA becomes accessible to the sensors, how these recognition systems are evaded by the viruses, how DNA sensing can be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> design, and what challenges await this field of research in the future...|$|R

Unfortunately, current vaccines reduce clinical disease and shedding, but are of limited efficacy and do not provide long-term protective immunity. Several strategies have been followed to mine the MAP genome for virulence determinants that could be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> and diagnostic assay development. In this study, a comprehensive mutant bank of 13, 536 MAP K- 10 Tn 5367 mutants (P > 95 %) was constructed and screened in vitro for phenotypes related to virulence. This strategy was designated to maximize identification of genes important to MAP pathogenesis without relying on studies of other mycobacterial species that may not translate into similar effects in MAP. This bank was screened for mutants with colony morphology alterations, susceptibility to D-cycloserine, impairment in siderophore production or secretion, reduced cell association, and decreased biofilm and clump formation. Mutants with interesting phenotypes were analyzed by PCR, Southern blotting and DNA sequencing to determine transposon insertion sites. These insertion sites mapped upstream from the MAP 1152 -MAP 1156 cluster, internal to either the Mod operon gene MAP 1566 or within the coding sequence of lsr 2, and several intergenic regions.

30|$|NMR {{and surface}} plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR), among other technologies, show that MPER adopts an α helical conformation partially {{embedded in the}} viral membrane, consisting of two independent domains separated by a flexible hinge (Sun et al., 2008; Song et al., 2009). These two segments show different membrane-interacting attributes such that the C-terminal domain {{is embedded in the}} membrane, and the N-terminal domain is more exposed. Owing to amphiphilic characteristics of the C-terminal domain, the hydrophobic residues are buried in the membrane, whereas the polar residues are solvent-exposed (Huarte et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Song et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2013). Moreover, MPER exhibits different conformations when bound by antibodies (Fig.  1). As shown in Figure  1, the crystal structure of 2 F 5 Fab in complex with its epitope peptide reveals that the 664 DKW 666 core motif forms a β turn conformation (Bryson et al., 2001). In contrast, the crystal structure of Fab 4 E 10 in complex with its epitope peptide was found to form an α helical conformation from D 674 to K 683 (Cardoso et al., 2005; Cardoso et al., 2007). Similar to 4 E 10, the crystal structure of Fab 10 E 8 in complex with its epitope peptide also forms an α helical conformation (Huang et al., 2012). These results indicated that MPER is natively flexible, indicating that more than one structure is associated with neutralization and, at the same time, implying that multiple conformations of MPER immunogens may be favorable to the induction of bNAbs. However, it remains puzzling whether some kind of conformation, or several kinds, can be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> design.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Virus-specific {{cellular}} immune responses play {{a critical}} role in virus clearance during acute or chronic HBV infection. Currently, the commercially available HBV vaccine is combined with alum adjuvant, which stimulates mainly Th 2 immune responses. Therefore, development of new therapeutic HBV vaccine adjuvants and immune strategies that also promote Th 1 and CTL responses is urgently needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To improve the immunity induced by the novel HBSS 1 HBV vaccine, we evaluated the ability of adjuvants, including alum, CpG and polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C) ], to enhance the response when boosted with the recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine rAdSS 1. The immune responses to different adjuvant combinations were assessed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISpot and cytokine release assays. Among the combinations tested, a HBV protein particle vaccine with CpG/alum and poly(I:C) /alum priming combinations accelerated specific seroconversion and produced high antibody (anti-PreS 1, anti-S antibody) titres with a Th 1 bias. After boosting with recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine rAdSS 1, both groups produced a strong multi-antigen (S and PreS 1) -specific cellular immune response. HBSS 1 immunisation with poly(I:C) /alum priming also generated high-level CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses in terms of Th 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL- 2). CONCLUSIONS: The protein-vaccine HBSS 1 with mixed poly(I:C) /alum adjuvant priming, followed by a rAdSS 1 vaccine boost, maximises specific antibody and Th 1 -biased cellular immune responses. This regime might prove useful in the development of HBV therapeutic vaccines. Furthermore, this promising strategy might be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccines</b> against other persistent infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis...|$|R

In this paper we have investigated the fine specificity, clonal composition and HLA class II restriction of CD 4 + T cell clones specific for an immunodominant epitope spanning amino acids 91 – 110 of the 16 -kDa protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Twenty-one of the tested 28 clones had a Th 1 profile, while seven clones had a Th 0 profile. None of the clones had a Th 2 profile. While the TCR AV gene usage of the clones was heterogeneous, a dominant TCR BV 2 gene family was used by 18 of the 28 clones. The CDR 3 regions of BV 2 + T cell clones showed variation in lengths, but a putative common motif R-L/V-G/S-Y/W-E/D was detected in 13 of the 18 clones. Moreover, the last two to three residues of the putative CDR 3 loops, encoded by conserved BJ sequences, could {{also play a role}} in peptide recognition. Antibody blockade and fine restriction analysis using HLA-DR homozygous antigen-presenting cells established that 16 of 18 BV 2 + peptide-specific clones were DR restricted and two clones were DR-DQ and DR-DP restricted. Additionally, five of the 18 TCRBV 2 + clones recognized peptide 91 – 110 in association with both parental and diverse HLA-DR molecules, indicating their promiscuous recognition pattern. The ability of peptide 91 – 110 to bind a wide range of HLA-DR molecules, and to stimulate a Th 1 -type interferon (IFN) -γ response more readily, encourage the use of this peptide as a subunit vaccine component...|$|R

Using microengraving, an integrated single-cell analysis method, we analyzed a cohort of subjects infected with WNV – recently infected and post-convalescent subjects – and efficiently identified four novel WNV neutralizing antibodies. We also assessed the humoral response to WNV on a single-cell and repertoire level by integrating next generation sequencing (NGS) into our analysis. The results from single-cell analysis indicate persistence of WNV-specific memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells in post-convalescent subjects. These cells exhibited class-switched antibody isotypes. Furthermore, the results suggest that the antibody response itself does not predict the clinical severity of the disease (asymptomatic or symptomatic). Using the nucleotide coding sequences for WNV-specific antibodies derived from single cells, we revealed the ontogeny of expanded WNV-specific clones in the repertoires of recently infected subjects through NGS and bioinformatic analysis. This analysis also indicated that the humoral response to WNV did not depend on an anamnestic response, due to an unlikely previous exposure to the virus.

Our study of how immunodominance, biased TCR repertoires, and protection are inter-related, provides a new way to measure the quality of T cell immunity, which if <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> evaluation, could enhance our understanding of how to elicit protective T cell immunity.

40|$|The {{study of}} the initial phase of the {{adaptive}} immune response after first antigen encounter provides essential information on the magnitude {{and quality of the}} immune response. This phase is characterized by proliferation and dissemination of T cells in the lymphoid organs. Modeling and identifying the key features of this phenomenon may provide a useful tool for the analysis and prediction of the effects of immunization. This knowledge can be effectively exploited in vaccinology, where it is of interest to evaluate and compare the responses <b>to</b> different <b>vaccine</b> formulations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} construct a stochastic model based on branching process theory, for the dissemination network of antigen-specific CD 4 + T cells. The devised model is validated on in vivo animal experimental data. The model presented has been <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the <b>vaccine</b> immunization context making references to simple proliferation laws that take into account division, death and quiescence, but it can also be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> any context where it is of interest to study the dynamic evolution of a population.

40|$|A vaccine {{capable of}} {{protecting}} at-risk persons against infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii {{could reduce the}} substantial global burden of human cryptococcosis. Vaccine development has been hampered though, by lack of knowledge as to which antigens are immunoprotective {{and the need for}} an effective vaccine delivery system. We made alkaline extracts from mutant cryptococcal strains that lacked capsule or chitosan. The extracts were then packaged into glucan particles (GPs), which are purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls composed primarily of β- 1, 3 -glucans. Subcutaneous vaccination with the GP-based vaccines provided significant protection against subsequent pulmonary infection with highly virulent strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii. The alkaline extract derived from the acapsular strain was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the most abundant proteins were identified. Separation of the alkaline extract by size exclusion chromatography revealed fractions that conferred protection when loaded in GP-based vaccines. Robust Th 1 - and Th 17 -biased CD 4 (+) T cell recall responses were observed in the lungs of vaccinated and infected mice. Thus, our preclinical studies have indicated promising cryptococcal vaccine candidates in alkaline extracts delivered in GPs. Ongoing studies are directed at identifying the individual components of the extracts that confer protection and thus would be promising candidates for a human vaccine. IMPORTANCE: The encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and its closely related sister species, Cryptococcus gattii, are major causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised persons. This study reports on the preclinical development of <b>vaccines</b> <b>to</b> protect at-risk populations from cryptococcosis. Antigens were extracted from Cryptococcus by treatment with an alkaline solution. The extracted antigens were then packaged into glucan particles, which are hollow yeast cell walls composed mainly of β-glucans. The glucan particle-based vaccines elicited robust T cell immune responses and protected mice from otherwise-lethal challenge with virulent strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii. The technology used for antigen extraction and subsequent loading into the glucan particle delivery system is relatively simple and can be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> development against other pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} the field of synthesizing and biologically evaluating of a novel class of carbohydratebased vaccines. The new vaccines consist of a multi- modular structure which allows <b>applying</b> the <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> a whole variety of pathogenes. This method allows preparing vaccines against all pathogens expressing immunogenic carbohydrate antigens. As conjugation of antigenic carbohydrates to proteins is not required the conjugate vaccine is particularly heat stable. No refrigeration is required, a major drawback of protein-based vaccines...|$|R

Public health ethics so far has failed to facilitate meaningful dialogue between the opposing sides. When stripped of its emotional charge, the debate can be framed as a contest between competing ethical values. This framework can be conceptualized graphically as a conflict between autonomy on the one hand, which militates against government intrusion, and beneficence, utilitarianism, justice, and nonmaleficence on the other, which may lend support <b>to</b> intervention. When <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the HPV <b>vaccine,</b> this framework would support a mandate based on utilitarianism, if certain conditions are met and if herd immunity is a realistic objective...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of Ag-specific central (T(CM)) and effector (T(EM)) memory CD 4 + T lymphocytes remains poorly characterized in vivo in humans. Using CD 154 {{as a marker}} of Ag-specific CD 4 +T cells, we studied the differentiation of memory subsets following anti-hepatitis B immunization. Hepatitis B surface Ag (HBs) -specific memory CD 4 +T cells were heterogeneous and included T(CM) (CCR 7 +CD 27 +) and T(EM) (CCR 7 (-) CD 27 (+/-)). HBs-specific T(CM) and T(EM) shared the capacity to produce multiple cytokines, including IL- 2 and IFN-gamma. Several years postimmunization, approximately 10 % of HBs-specific memory CD 4 + T cells were in cycle (Ki 67 +) and the proliferating cells were CCR 7 +. These {{results suggest that the}} model of functional specialization of T(CM) and T(EM) cannot be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> protein <b>vaccine</b> Ags and support the concept that T(CM) are capable of self-renewal and contribute to maintain the pool of memory cells.
