30|$|Rod {{load reducer}} is a {{downhole}} device installed at certain depth between the well {{head and the}} pump. With dual solid plungers, it can produce a hydraulic feedback force to reduce the polished rod load. As shown in Fig.  3, a rod load reducer comprises dual <b>plungers,</b> a <b>barrel</b> and some small components. There is channel in dual plungers so that the fluid can pass through the device.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tip of the}} {{electric}} foil terminates in a button assembly that generally consists of a <b>barrel,</b> <b>plunger,</b> spring, and retaining screws. The circuit is a [...] "normally closed" [...] one, meaning that at rest {{there is always a}} complete power circuit; depressing the tip breaks this circuit, and the scoring apparatus illuminates an appropriate light. Color-coding is used: white or yellow indicates hits not on the valid target area, and either red or green indicate hits on the valid target area (red for one fencer, green for the other).|$|R
40|$|Infusion {{of fluids}} and drugs {{at very low}} rates may be {{necessary}} in neonatal intensive care. Marked haemodynamic fluctuations occurring during the infusion of inotropes have been shown To {{be due to the}} sticking of the <b>plunger</b> in the <b>barrel</b> of syringes used in syringe drivers. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration has recommended the use of volumetric or peristaltic pumps in these circumstances. We tested a number of infusion systems and found that 1. some syringes give continuous flow at low rates, and would be suitable for the delivery of inotropes, and 2. some infusion pumps provide non-continuous flow at low rates, and would not be satisfactory for the infusion of inotropes...|$|R
50|$|The carpuject is {{a syringe}} device for the {{administration}} of injectable fluid medication. It was patented by the Sterling Drug Company, which became the Sterling Winthrop, after World War II. It is designed with a luer-lock device to accept a sterile hypodermic needle or to be linked directly to intravenous tubing line. The product can deliver an intravenous or intramuscular injection {{by means of a}} holder which attaches to the <b>barrel</b> and <b>plunger</b> to the <b>barrel</b> plug. Medication is prefilled into the syringe barrel. When the plug {{at the end of the}} barrel is advanced to the head of the barrel it discharges and releases the contents through the needle or into the lumen of the tubing.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} type {{and amount of}} solvent on {{lubricant}} which is used in disposable medical devices are investigated in this article. Two kinds of common solvent, n-Hexane and n-Heptane, are used. The mechanical behavior of syringe has shown that n-Heptane has better mixing ratio and also more effective spray process in the barrel of syringe than n-Hexane because of similar solubility parameter to silicon oil. The results revealed that movement of <b>plunger</b> in the <b>barrel</b> increases when pure silicone is used because non-uniform film is created {{on the surface of}} barrel, and also, it seems that the form of silicon is converted from oil to gel due to sterilization process. The results showed that the convenient mixing ratio of solvent/lubricant oil is 80 / 20...|$|R
40|$|The plunger of an {{aircraft}} {{was found to}} have fractured by overload. It appears that the fracturing took place during removal of the plunger from the housing. There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue, stress corrosion cracking etc. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for the failure. It is reported that following a seizure, the plunger and the housing surfaces were polished and reassembled before the incidence took place. Hence the evidences causing the seizure of the plunger were lost and {{it was not possible to}} find out the exact cause of failure. However, since scoring marks were observed on both plunger and the housing, there is a possibility that foreign particles got entrapped in the annular space between the <b>plunger</b> and the <b>barrel</b> leading to seizure. This needs to be established to incorporate any remedial measures for prevention of recurrence of similar failure. Probably, the testing of hydraulic oil sample, if collected, would help in this regard...|$|R
50|$|Next {{called to}} testify was Dan Anderson, chief {{toxicologist}} at the coroner's office. He has 21 years' experience in this field. He tested blood and urine taken from Jackson in UCLA and at autopsy on June 26, 2009. Blood taken from a femoral vein showed propofol (2.6 μg/ml), lidocaine (0.84 μg/ml) and lorazepam (0.169 μg/ml). Blood taken from Jackson's heart showed propofol (3.2 μg/ml), lidocaine (0.68 μg/ml), diazepam (<0.1 μg/ml), lorazepam (0.162 μg/ml), midazolam (4.6 μg/ml) and a hemoglobin percentage of 5.1%. Vials of blood taken from Jackson at UCLA were found to contain propofol (4.1 μg/ml). Other results included liver (lidocaine (0.45 μg/ml), propofol (6.2 μg/ml)), stomach (lidocaine (1.6 μg/ml), propofol (0.13 μg/ml)), urine (jug found in bedroom and more than 500ml collected at autopsy) (lorazepam, lidocaine, midazolam, propofol and ephedrine), vitreous humour (propofol (0.4 μg/ml)). Propofol was found in all 8 specimen samples. Also tested were the 10cc syringe and <b>plunger,</b> the syringe <b>barrel,</b> the fluid in the syringe and the IV tubing (propofol and lidocaine found). No alcohol, barbiturates, cocaine, sedative hypnotics, marijuana, methamphetamine, opiates, codeine, morphine, hydrocodone, or Demerol {{were found in the}} samples.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any skin preparation are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper skin preparation and conductive gel application. However, a series of skin preparation procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 spring contact probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe head, <b>plunger,</b> spring, and <b>barrel.</b> The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 spring contact probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|R
