5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification. Riders won points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more <b>points</b> <b>that</b> mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner of the points classification won the red jersey.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|For the season, the Bruins gave Orr a solid gold puck, {{one of four}} {{they gave}} out to Bruins players – {{to each of the}} four Bruins who scored over 100 <b>points</b> <b>that</b> season – Esposito, Orr, Johnny Bucyk and Ken Hodge. Orr later gave his puck to Alan Eagleson. In 2007, Eagleson sold the puck in an auction of memorabilia for C$16,500.|$|E

5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann <b>points</b> <b>that</b> {{there have}} been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders <b>points</b> <b>that</b> the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E

5|$|As a {{founding}} member of the Association Française pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Lemoine presented what became his best-known paper, Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle at the Association's 1874 meeting in Lille. The central focus of this paper concerned the point which bears his name today. Most of the other results discussed in the paper pertained to various concyclic <b>points</b> <b>that</b> could be constructed from the Lemoine point.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data <b>points</b> <b>that</b> suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E

The 60 <b>points</b> <b>that</b> Valverde won were enough to secure the overall victory in the team's competition, as well as {{increasing}} his own margin of victory in the individual classification. Pinot's third-place finish earned him 70 points and moved him up to tenth place in the World Tour rankings, while the success of the Italian riders moved Italy ahead of both Colombia and Great Britain to finish second behind Spain in the national rankings.|$|E

The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was by mountain man James Clyman in 1845.|$|E
5|$|In {{football}}, Ward {{was only}} the second African-American to win a varsity letter for the Michigan Wolverines football team, lettering in 1932, 1933, and 1934. In 1934, a controversy developed when Georgia Tech refused to play if Ward took the field, and university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Teammate Gerald R. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team {{in response to the}} university’s decision. After being excluded from the Georgia Tech game, Ward went on to score all 12 of Michigan's <b>points</b> <b>that</b> year outside of the Georgia Tech game, without another Wolverine even having an extra point or a field goal.|$|E
