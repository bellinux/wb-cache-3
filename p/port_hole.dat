5|$|There is {{a plaque}} at Pembroke St Mary Pembrokeshire to Lieut Richard Edward Lewis Treweeks the Navigating Officer of Natal, son of Major R.H. Treweeks {{who was also}} lost on 30 December. One known {{survivor}} was that of Chief Stoker Griffiths of St Anne's Farm Pembroke, Pembrokeshire who had escaped through a <b>port</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Essentially, {{the house}} is cast in the Italianate style. Its oreil roofs and their {{bracketed}} eaves, the asymmetrical arrangement of lines and geometric shapes on bay windows and porches, and the <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> attic window are all indicative of Italianate style. Gothic revival elements originally included both the Joliet stone trimming and the medieval spears attached {{to each of the}} three vergeboard peaks. The spears have since been removed.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the hard}} work by Anthem, the {{producers}} made [...] "Kush" [...] and [...] "Requiem" [...] into bottle episodes, to give the visual effects team a break. Instead, other forms of special effects were used. To create the Himalayan feel of [...] "Kush", the production crew used wind machines and paper snow. However, the fake snow became {{a problem for the}} cast, as they suffered from bloodshot eyes and scratchy throats when exposed to it. Aquariums were placed outside each <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> of the set in [...] "Requiem". To complete the effects where Druitt teleports, Heyerdahl would walk out of the shot while every other cast member has to stay still, until the directors signal them to react; the shot of Heyerdahl walking out of frame would later be cut. Another effect involving Heyerdahl is a scene between both his characters, Bigfoot and Druitt, in [...] "Revelations". To complete the shot, Heyerdahl had to film two different shots: one with him as Druitt talking to nothing, and another with him as Bigfoot talking to nothing. When both characters can be seen walking together, a stand-in would replace Heyerdahl as Bigfoot.|$|E
25|$|Propellers, condensers, hinges and <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> {{were often}} made from {{non-ferrous}} metals such as brass and phosphor bronze, {{which do not}} corrode easily.|$|R
50|$|In late 1948, BCPA took {{delivery}} {{of the first of}} four Douglas DC-6 aircraft, outfitted as Pullman-type sleepers, bundling board options with small <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> bedside. Each aircraft was named for one of the four sailing vessels of Captain Cook, Resolution, Discovery, Adventure and Endeavour.|$|R
50|$|Prince's Fort, {{circular}} in shape, {{was constructed}} of heavy logs. It was 150 ft {{in diameter and}} 15 ft high. <b>Port</b> <b>holes</b> were cut for use by riflemen, and it {{was surrounded by a}} ditch, the dirt from which was thrown against the walls to parapet height.|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I {{glanced out the}} <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> as the bow swung past the line of sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our {{starboard}} quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now and I {{had no idea what was}} going on.|$|E
60|$|October 31.--My weak lungs, {{combined}} with the exciting episodes of the voyage, have shaken my nervous system {{so much that the}} most trivial incident affects me. I can hardly believe that I am the same man who tied the external iliac artery, an operation requiring the nicest precision, under a heavy rifle fire at Antietam. I am as nervous as a child. I was lying half dozing last night about four bells in the middle watch trying in vain to drop into a refreshing sleep. There was no light inside my cabin, but a single ray of moonlight streamed in through the <b>port</b> <b>hole,</b> throwing a silvery flickering circle upon the door. As I lay I kept my drowsy eyes upon this circle, and was conscious that it was gradually becoming less well-defined as my senses left me, when I was suddenly recalled to full wakefulness by the appearance of a small dark object in the very centre of the luminous disc. I lay quietly and breathlessly watching it. Gradually it grew larger and plainer, and then I perceived that it was a human hand which had been cautiously inserted through the chink of the half-closed door--a hand which, as I observed with a thrill of horror, was not provided with fingers. The door swung cautiously backwards, and Goring's head followed his hand. It appeared in the centre of the moonlight, and was framed as it were in a ghastly uncertain halo, against which his features showed out plainly. It seemed to me that I had never seen such an utterly fiendish and merciless expression upon a human face. His eyes were dilated and glaring, his lips drawn back so as to show his white fangs, and his straight black hair appeared to bristle over his low forehead like the hood of a cobra. The sudden and noiseless apparition had such an effect upon me that I sprang up in bed trembling in every limb, and held out my hand towards my revolver. I was heartily ashamed of my hastiness when he explained the object of his intrusion, as he immediately did in the most courteous language. He had been suffering from toothache, poor fellow! and had come in to beg some laudanum, knowing that I possessed a medicine chest. As to a sinister expression he is never a beauty, and what with my state of nervous tension and the effect of the shifting moonlight it was easy to conjure up something horrible. I gave him twenty drops, and he went off again with many expressions of gratitude. I can hardly say how much this trivial incident affected me. I have felt unstrung all day.|$|E
50|$|The plasma vessel, {{built of}} 20 parts, {{is on the}} inside, {{adjusted}} to the complex shape of the magnetic field. It has 254 <b>ports</b> (<b>holes)</b> for plasma heating and observation diagnostics. The whole plant is built of five near-identical modules, which were assembled in the experiment hall.|$|R
50|$|A Spinner {{is a type}} of {{bioreactor}} {{which features}} an impeller, stirrer or similar device to agitate the contents (usually a mixture of cells, medium and products like proteins that can be harvested). The vessels are usually made out of glass or stainless steel with <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> to accommodate sensors, Medium input or gas flow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1967, 46 Mark II boats, with a {{modified}} deck house set further back from the bow. The newer boats also had round <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> (replacing larger sliding windows) in the aft superstructure. From 1969 through 1972, 33 Mark IIIs, which were a larger version of the Mark IIs, arrived in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Finally Captain Pete is unamused {{and puts}} Mickey to work peeling potatoes. In the potato bin, another parrot {{appears in the}} <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> and laughs at him again. The mouse throws a peeled potato at him, {{knocking}} him into the river below. The film ends with Mickey laughing.|$|E

5000|$|The Riverboat {{was owned}} by Bernie & Patricia (a.k.a. Sola, a {{well-known}} artist) Fiedler. Located in a basement, its decor was modelled after {{the interior of a}} boat, featuring <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> windows and intimate booths. Legend has it that American protest singer Phil Ochs wrote one of his best-known songs, [...] "Changes", on the back porch.|$|E
50|$|A {{sleeve valve}} {{takes the form}} of one or more {{machined}} sleeves. It fits between the piston and the cylinder wall in the cylinder of an internal combustion engine, where it rotates and/or slides. <b>Ports</b> (<b>holes)</b> {{in the side of the}} sleeves come into alignment with the cylinder's inlet and exhaust ports at the appropriate stages in the engine's cycle.|$|R
50|$|Shannon now {{opened fire}} on Chesapeakes maindeck with her after guns firing through Chesapeakes <b>port</b> <b>holes.</b> Many of Chesapeakes crew were killed or wounded; two thirds of her gun crews were already casualties. Chesapeake’s wheel was then shot away and her {{helmsman}} killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The pool is {{surrounded}} by <b>Port</b> <b>Holes</b> Miniature Golf (a nine-hole Peter Pan-themed miniature golf course), Community Hall (an air-conditioned room with board games, table tennis, and arts and crafts), Anchors’ A-Weigh fitness center, Eb and Flo’s rentals, and Rub Dubs massage. The Blinker's Arcade was previously offered {{with a variety of}} classic and updated arcade games, but has since been removed as of April 2016.|$|R

50|$|The Æolus left Jervis Bay for Sydney on the 23rd with a SW wind, {{then put}} back in and brought anchors up in Darling Roads at 6 am the same day. During the {{afternoon}} the wind blew in heavy squalls from the WNW to WSW, and at about 3pm on the 24th she parted her anchors and went ashore at the farmer's <b>port</b> <b>Hole</b> in the Wall. No lives were lost.|$|E
50|$|A {{bass reflex}} system (also {{known as a}} ported, vented box or reflex port) {{is a type of}} {{loudspeaker}} enclosure that uses a <b>port</b> (<b>hole)</b> or vent cut into the cabinet and a section of tubing or pipe affixed to the port. This port enables the sound from the rear side of the diaphragm to increase the efficiency of the system at low frequencies as compared to a typical closed box (sealed-box) loudspeaker or an infinite baffle mounting.|$|E
50|$|Equivalent {{implementations}} {{of modern}} {{variable valve timing}} and variable lift are impossible due to the fixed sizes of the <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> and essentially fixed rotational speed of the sleeves. It may theoretically be possible to alter the rotational speed through gearing that is not linearly related to the engine speed, however it seems this would be impractically complex even compared to the complexities of modern valve control systems.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the fall}} as an excuse, the priest {{promises}} Moulin {{that he has}} a device to insure his salvation. He tries to get Moulin to sign over his savings to him, but Moulin wants to see the device in action first. The priest reveals a tank with several <b>port</b> <b>holes.</b> Moulin gets inside, and the priest puts on a show to simulate a trip to Heaven, exploiting Moulin's poor eyesight.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{is painted}} black with the ship's {{name and the}} Trust's website painted in white at the bow and across the stern. In addition, a large silver fern is painted {{on either side of}} the bow beneath the name. A {{stainless}} steel rubbing strake runs the length of the vessel and circular <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> are visible above the waterline. A wooden rail runs around the edge of the entire deck.|$|R
50|$|Among {{those killed}} were 35 American {{soldiers}} from the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division Artillery who were traveling from Hokkaidō as an advance party {{to set up a}} new camp (Camp Younghans) at Higashine, Yamagata, near Sendai. One soldier survived when he was swept through a <b>port</b> <b>hole.</b> Another, 2nd Lt. George A. Vaillancourt, Battery C, 99th Field Artillery Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division, was posthumously awarded the Soldier's Medal, the highest non-combat medal at the time, for his courage during the tragedy. The football field at Camp Younghans was dedicated to Lt. Vaillancourt on September 24, 1955.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Light Objects" [...] (pillboxes) {{were simple}} hollow boxes with 1 or (typically) 2 machine gun positions, a {{retractable}} observation periscope, grenade tubes (small tube that leads outside), hand operated air blower, {{and a solid}} inner door at 90° to a steel bar outer door. The machine gun was mounted {{near the end of}} the barrel, so that the <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> was only large enough for the bullets and a scope to see through, unlike most other designs where a large opening is used. A heavy steel plate could be slid down to quickly close the tiny hole for added protection.|$|E
50|$|One who {{successfully}} completes either the CPS Boating Course (called Piloting until 1972) or the CPS PCOC Course becomes {{a member of}} the organization. Full members are then permitted to fly the CPS flag on their vessels and receive six issues of Canadian Yachting magazine, four of which contain the member publication, The <b>Port</b> <b>Hole.</b> In Quebec, members receive four issues of L’Escale Nautique magazine, which contain the French member publication, Le Hublot. The members also have the opportunity to take a number of advanced and elective courses. Throughout the years a number of member benefits have been developed, including the ability to purchase a CPS Members Insurance policy, which offers a discount based on the courses members have taken.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name was}} revived in February 1958 when the world's first nuclear-powered {{aircraft}} carrier was laid down as the eighth Enterprise; this ship was commissioned in November 1961. Also nicknamed the [...] "Big E", various artifacts and mementos were kept aboard from her predecessor. The <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> in the captain's in-port cabin and conference room are only one example. She was inactivated and removed from service on 1 December 2012 after being in the fleet for 51 years. Due to needs involving reactor removal, she cannot {{be turned into a}} memorial. At her inactivation, it was announced that the ninth ship to bear the name Enterprise would be the planned , CVN-80. It has not been confirmed what, if any, artifacts from USS Enterprise (CV-6) will be incorporated into this next generation aircraft carrier, although a time capsule containing mementos from both CV-6 and CVN-65 will be presented to the first captain of the new Enterprise. The aforementioned <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> aboard the CVN-65 will be removed and returned to the Boston Navy Yard Museum.|$|R
5000|$|That {{same month}} {{brothers}} Charles and William Bullock {{made the first}} permanent non-native settlement in the county {{on the north side}} of the South Solomon River in what is now Tilden Township. They constructed a double cabin with <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> surrounded with a log enclosure for their horses and the [...] "Bullock Ranche" [...] became the terminus for all early homestead and hunting parties in northwest Kansas over the next two years.|$|R

5000|$|Most people [...] say the {{attraction}} is 'very claustrophobic'. This {{could be because}} {{the attraction}} is very dark inside and consists of many compact corridors with minimal light and room for single-file movement only. For example, in {{one section of the}} attraction, the group is suddenly submerged into darkness. When the lights suddenly turn back on, the scenery appears slightly different, meant to leave the group unsure of where to go or what to do next. At the end of the attraction is a cafe bar known as the 'Horror Bar' which pitches a favourite haunt for drinkers and family members to watch 'victims' in the group return through a <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> door, disguised as a bookcase, after fleeing the last scene.|$|E
5000|$|As {{transducer}} C.I.P. {{almost exclusively}} uses {{one type of}} Piezoelectric sensor (named [...] "channel sensor") made by the Swiss company Kistler that requires drilling of the cartridge case before firing the proofing cartridge in a specially made test barrel. The Kistler ballistic pressure measurement sensor 6215 has a maximum working pressure of [...] and is mounted recessed inside the cartridge case (the face of high-pressure sensor does not contact the cartridge case) and requires that the test cartridge case have a hole drilled in it prior to testing. The test cartridge must be inserted into the chamber {{in such a way}} that the hole in the test cartridge case lines up with a gas <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> that channels the gas pressure from the cartridge case to the face of the sensor. The measurement accuracy of the pressure measurements with 21st century high-pressure sensors is expected to be ≤ 2%.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{pneumatic}} siren, the stator is {{the part}} which cuts off and reopens air as rotating blades of a chopper move past the <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> of the stator, generating sound. The pitch of the siren's sound {{is a function of}} the speed of the rotor and the number of holes in the stator. [...] A siren with only one row of ports is called a single tone siren. A siren with two rows of ports is known as a dual tone siren.|$|R
