25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW <b>pilot</b> <b>bearing</b> could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E

50|$|For instance, a gear {{mounted on}} a shaft might use a male spline on the shaft that matches the female spline on the gear. The splines on the pictured drive shaft match with the female splines {{in the center of}} the clutch plate, while the smooth tip of the axle is {{supported}} in the <b>pilot</b> <b>bearing</b> in the flywheel. An alternative to splines is a keyway and key, though splines provide a longer fatigue life.|$|E
5000|$|Spring 1933: A {{control tower}} and {{associated}} wireless station were completed, the first at a municipal airport outside London, {{and able to}} communicate with aircraft in flight and give <b>pilots</b> <b>bearings</b> from the airfield. The tower is still operational and {{is believed to be the}} oldest in Europe still in use for its original purpose.|$|R
50|$|Bronze {{also has}} very low {{friction}} against dissimilar metals, making it important for cannons prior to modern tolerancing, where iron cannonballs would otherwise {{stick in the}} barrel. It is still widely used today for springs, bearings, bushings, automobile transmission <b>pilot</b> <b>bearings,</b> and similar fittings, and is particularly common in the bearings of small electric motors. Phosphor bronze is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.|$|R
5000|$|Smith was a {{qualified}} helicopter pilot. He {{and his girlfriend}} (later his wife) Sarah Greene were injured on 10 September 1988 when the Robinson R22 Beta helicopter he was <b>piloting</b> (<b>bearing</b> the personal registration G-SMIF) crashed in Gloucestershire. Smith reported apparent unrecoverable loss of engine power whilst circling to reconnoitre an unfamiliar landing site. Both passengers survived, although Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch neither criticised nor exonerated Smith {{in relation to the}} crash (it being beyond its remit to do so), concluding simply that [...] "...examination of the helicopter flight control, fuel, engine control, dynamic systems and the engine itself revealed no failure or unserviceability that could have resulted in a loss of rotor speed." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mainshaft}} extends {{outside the}} case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars. Front wheel drives generally have the engine and transmission mounted transversely, the differential {{being part of the}} transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main bearings, and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a <b>pilot</b> <b>bearing</b> holds the shafts together. The gears and clutches ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.|$|E
50|$|When {{the engine}} was adapted {{for use in the}} Alfetta in 1972, this necessitated a new oil pump and a change away from the finned sump used in the 105-series cars. While this was an {{aesthetic}} loss it may have been beneficial in other ways, as some owners reported that the old sump kept the engine and oil so cool that in cold weather it was sometimes necessary to block off the radiator airflow to raise the coolant temperature enough for the interior heater to be effective. Since the Alfetta also used a rear-mounted transaxle, {{there was no need for}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>bearing</b> in the engine.|$|E

5000|$|A {{military}} navigation {{team will}} nearly always consist of several people. [...] A military navigator might have bearing takers {{stationed at the}} gyro repeaters on the bridge wings for taking simultaneous bearings, while the civilian navigator must often take and plot them himself. [...] While the military navigator will have a bearing book and someone to record entries for each fix, the civilian navigator will simply <b>pilot</b> the <b>bearings</b> on the chart as they are taken and not record them at all.|$|R
50|$|The San Francisco Bar Pilots Association {{bought the}} {{schooner}} in 1931 on the Atlantic Coast {{and brought the}} vessel to San Francisco for modification and operation as the <b>pilot</b> vessel California <b>bearing</b> {{the name of an}} earlier vessel of the Association. The vessel was the largest schooner operated by the San Francisco Bar Pilots who operated her in peacetime and through wars until 1972 as the last sailing vessel in the United States to serve as a pilot vessel.|$|R
5000|$|Hans U. Farner was an {{innovative}} Swiss aircraft designer whose footlaunched canard ultralight sailplane had briefly reached production in 1966. [...] In November 1974 he filed a patent for a novel control system, particularly suitable for canards. This suggested mounting the canard on a slender tube which slid snugly within a second long forward tube that, {{together with a}} pod containing an engine, <b>pilot</b> and <b>bearing</b> mainplanes, formed the fuselage. Extension of the canard-carrying tube by means of fore and aft control column movement increased the canard's moment arm and increased pitch. The angle of attack of the canard was automatically altered as this happened. Rotating the tube about its long axis by rudder pedal movement turned the canard away from the horizontal and caused yaw, removing {{the need for a}} vertical rudder. Wing mounted ailerons controlled roll in the usual way.|$|R

40|$|A joint {{program was}} {{undertaken}} by the NASA Lewis Research Center and the Army Aviation Systems Command to restore by grinding those rolling-element bearings which are currently being discarded at aircraft engine and transmission overhaul. Three bearing types were selected from the UH- 1 helicopter engine (T- 53) and transmission for the <b>pilot</b> program. No <b>bearing</b> failures occurred related to the restoration by grinding process. The risk and cost of a bearing restoration by grinding programs was analyzed. A microeconomic impact analysis was performed...|$|R
50|$|If a pilot {{chose to}} flee a {{superior}} force, or {{was coming down}} with a damaged machine, it was critical to spend what little time he might have {{going in the right}} direction. This rule sounds as though it is stating the obvious, but Boelcke found it necessary to include it. More than a few pilots came down behind enemy lines because they got confused and lost their way. In World War I, aerial navigation was done mostly by sight. Taking regular note of landmarks helped a <b>pilot</b> get his <b>bearings</b> quickly, perhaps making the difference between safety and captivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{broadcast}} band receiver {{in all of}} these command sets is intended to host a homing adapter for the Navy ZB/YE homing system. The homing adapter demodulates a signal near 246 MHz that is modulated with a {{broadcast band}} carrier. The output is sent to the broadcast band receiver tuned to the modulating frequency to further demodulate the carrier for voice messages or for a Morse code letter indicating to the <b>pilot</b> his <b>bearing</b> from the homing transmitter. All broadcast band receivers came with a power adapter to supply power to the homing adapter. The adapter under the Navy nomenclature system is the ZB-series. The identical unit under JAN nomenclature is the AN/ARR-1. This system was used by both the Navy extensively and the Army much less so. To put the system into operation on the aircraft, the beacon band receiver would be replaced in the rack by the broadcast band receiver. The antenna post is connected to the output of the homing adapter, and a power cable is connected from the homing adapter to the broadcast band receiver. The normal control that had been used for the beacon band receiver also serves this homing system without further reconfiguration.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effects of}} channel {{response}} estimation error of a frequency-flat timevarying channel on system capacity. Using a blockfading channel model, where the block length corresponds to the channel coherence time, we consider two pilot based approaches for the estimation. The first approach uses a single pilot symbol per block with variable power, while the second approach uses more than one symbol per block with constant power per symbol. For both cases, we {{study the effects of}} the estimation error on the effective signal-to-noise ratio and the resulting system capacity. We also evaluate the impact of the estimation error on a symbolby-symbol detection scheme with no error correction. Our results show that the first pilot-based approach is less sensitive to the fraction of power allocated to the pilot. Further, both schemes performed quite well under optimum power allocation between the <b>pilot</b> and information <b>bearing</b> signal, more so in the case of long channel coherence times. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Type 'T' {{was not a}} {{development}} of the Bristol Boxkite but did {{use some of the}} experience gained with the Boxkite. It was designed by George Challenger, with the assistance of practical advice from Captain Bertram Dickson, a prominent pilot of the day. It had the same [...] "Farman" [...] configuration as the Boxkite, differing principally in having an enclosed nacelle to house the <b>pilot.</b> The structure <b>bearing</b> the front elevator also differed substantially: the elevator was mounted lower down, level with the lower wing, and the undercarriage skids were continued forward and upwards to form part of the elevator mounting. The rear-mounted twin rudders were balanced, unlike those of the Boxkite. The first aircraft (Bristol No. 45) was built to compete in the 1911 Circuit de l'Europe race, with Maurice Tabuteau as pilot, and was powered by a [...] Gnome Gamma rotary engine. Tabateau put up a creditable performance, and completed all of the race's nine stages. Four more aircraft were built for 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race. These differed from the design of No. 45 in having a modified nacelle and rudders placed further out, away from the slipstream of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|About 1850-51, {{the upper}} {{anchorage}} at Whampoa Reach, below Canton, was {{a sight to}} be remembered by those who loved to look at beautiful ships, and the 'tea-fleet' was gathered waiting for 'the new crop.' There, moored in line, were the Sam Russell, the Sea-Serpent, the Challenge, the Flying Cloud, the Sea Witch, {{and half a dozen}} others, bright with paint and varnish and gilding, and their bottoms well cleaned of barnacles by the swift muddy current of fresh water ... They scrubbed copper, holystoned decks, squared the yards by the lifts and braces, and hoisted and lowered colors in unison with the American man-of-war which happened to be stationed there ..."But one day, in the 'cool weather,' there would come a sudden change. Our clipper friends had men aloft, bending sails ... and all readiness was made for sea. About noon the great covered chop-boats came down the stream, with immense chattering of men and all sorts of fuss ... Stages were rigged, and the chests and half-chests came on board and were stowed away like magic, for the ship's capacity had been exactly measured beforehand, and each chest or half-chest fitted into place like a piece in a Chinese puzzle. These large ships were thus loaded in a few hours. Each chest had two slips of bamboo ... As they came over the gangways one slip was seized by an officer of the vessel, the other by a Chinese comprador, and thus 'tally' was kept. The crew of the vessel had no need to go into the hold, the Chinese stevedores made all snug; and then the hatches were put on and the hatch-covers well battened down, while, without delay, sail was made, the anchor weighed, and the Chinese pilot took charge to get her ... to sea as soon as possible; for in no business was time more synonymous with money than in the race with the 'new crop.'"It was a sight to see the handling of those ships as they [...] "backed and filled" [...] and tided down the Reaches, sometimes almost grazing the quarter of a vessel at anchor; and, again, just escaping the tail of a mud-bank, while the grizzled old pig-tailed <b>pilot</b> took his <b>bearings,</b> squinted aloft, and in his own pidgeon-English said, 'Haul down jib! ... Shiver the mizzen-topsail! Throw her flat aback!' ...|$|R
