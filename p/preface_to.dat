5|$|Shortly after {{publication}} of <b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> Plato, Havelock accepted {{a position as}} chair of the Classics Department at Yale University. He remained in New Haven for eight years, and then taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of <b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> Plato to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
5|$|His poetic style, {{influenced}} {{from early}} on by Lamartine, was infused with Classicism during his middle age, before he again adopted Romantic tenets.

5|$|Thirty poems {{attributed}} to Narihira {{were included in}} the early 10th-century Kokinshū, and many more in later anthologies, but the attributions are dubious.

He was also included in Fujiwara no Kintō's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that}} he had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E

A <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader through the garden is a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes.|$|E

5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

5|$|A record exists of a {{performance}} of The Tempest on 1 November 1611 by the King's Men before James I and the English royal court at Whitehall Palace on Hallowmas night. The play {{was one of the}} six Shakespearean plays (and eight others for a total of 14) acted at court during the winter of 1612–13 as part of the festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth with Frederick V, the Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine. There is no further public performance recorded prior to the Restoration; but in his 1669 <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Dryden/Davenant version, John Dryden states that The Tempest had been performed at the Blackfriars Theatre. Careful consideration of stage directions within the play supports this, strongly suggesting that the play was written with Blackfriars Theatre rather than the Globe Theatre in mind.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information {{about the history of the}} church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his <b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E

5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E
5|$|The Wedding Day {{was started}} as his third play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of The Wedding-Day. It was refused by John Rich to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by David Garrick. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the play in his Miscellanies (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended the leads, Millamour and Charlotte, for Robert Wilks and Anne Oldfield. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.|$|E
