40|$|Application. Timing of {{prescribed}} {{burning in the}} Southeastern U. S. can be critical when used to enhance seedbeds for natural regeneration of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Since the majority of loblolly <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> are disseminated before January during average seed years on Coastal Plain sites, prescribed winter burns conducted after that date are likely to destroy most <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> deposited in the upper litter layer of the forest floor. Abstract. Stratified loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seeds were placed at three depths in a reconstructed forest floor and subjected to simulated prescribed winter burns. Within the forest floor, <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> were placed at the L/upper-F interface, upper-F/lower-F interface, and lower-F/mineral-soil interface. Wind was generated by electric box-fans. Seeds that survived the burns were transferred to moist sand flats for 30 -day germination tests. About 96 % of seeds placed at the two upper layers in the forest floor were either destroyed by the fires or failed to germinate. Germinative capacity of seeds placed at the lower-F/mineral-soil interface averaged 79 % as compared to 97 % for unburned control seeds.

50|$|The {{sugar pine}} has been {{severely}} {{affected by the}} {{white pine blister rust}} (Cronartium ribicola), a fungus that was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1909. A high proportion of sugar pines has been killed by the blister rust, particularly {{in the northern part of}} the species' range that has experienced the rust for a longer period of time. The rust has also destroyed much of the western white pine and whitebark pine throughout their ranges. The U.S. Forest Service has a program (see link below) for developing rust-resistant sugar pine and western white pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild. The Sugar Pine Foundation in the Lake Tahoe Basin has been successful in finding resistant sugar <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> trees and has demonstrated that it is important for the public to assist the U.S. Forest Service in restoring this species. However, blister rust is much less common in California, and Sugar, Western White and Whitebark pines still survive in great numbers there.|$|E
50|$|The thick-billed parrot {{likes to}} nest in tree cavities, {{especially}} old woodpecker holes. In parts of its existing range, dead or living quaking aspens are the dominant tree selected for nesting. It mainly feeds on seeds from various pine species. Mexican white pine {{appears to be}} a preferred species but the seeds of Douglas fir, Apache pine, Chihuahua pine, and yellow pine are also taken. The species is strongly dependent on the supply of conifer cones, breeding at the peak of <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> production. The species is nomadic, following the variations of cone abundance. To a much lesser extent, they also feed upon acorns and pine buds. They are adept fliers, and historical accounts describe the birds sleeping in one mountain range, and crossing vast distances to feed in another mountain range each day. They deal with deep snow by hanging upside-down and climbing on the bare underside of a snow-covered branch in order to access cones.|$|E

The communists deployed their 1st Regiment to attract the attention of the nationalist 48th Division while the 2nd Regiment outflanked the defenders from the right and attacked from the rear, successfully taking the peak and dispersed the defenders. With the favorable landscape, it was the nationalists turn to be blockaded and there was nothing the pursuing nationalist force could do to stop the enemy.|$|E

40|$|Pine {{plantations}} near Perth, Western Australia {{have provided}} an important food source for endangered Carnaby’s Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) since the 1940 s. Plans to harvest these plantations without re-planting will remove this food source by 2031 or earlier. To {{assess the impact}} of pine removal, we studied the ecological association between Carnaby’s Cockatoos and pine using behavioural, nutritional, and phenological data. Pine plantations provided high densities of seed (158 025 seeds ha 21) over a large area (c. 15 000 ha). Carnaby’s Cockatoos fed throughout these plantations and removed almost the entire annual crop of pine cones. Peak cockatoo abundance coincided with <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> maturation. <b>Pine</b> <b>seed</b> had energy and protein contents equivalent to native food sources and, critically, is available in summer when breeding pairs have young offspring to feed.

40|$|Chinese <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> {{orchards}} are in {{a period}} of transition from first-generation to advanced-generations. How to effectively select populations for second-generation seed orchards and significantly increase genetic gain through rational deployment have become major issues. In this study, we examined open- and control-pollinated progeny of the first-generation Chinese <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> orchards in Zhengning (Gansu Province, China) and Xixian (Shanxi Province, China) to address issues related to phenotypic selection for high volume growth, genetic diversity analysis and genetic distance-based phylogenetic analysis of the selections by simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and phylogenetic relationship-based field deployment for advanced-generation orchards. In total, 40, 28, 20, and 13 superior individuals were selected from the large-scale no-pedigree open-pollinated progeny of Zhengning (ZN-NP), open-pollinated families of Zhengning (ZN-OP), open-pollinated families of Xixian (XX-OP), and control-pollinated families of Xixian, with mean volume dominance ratios of 0. 83, 0. 15, 0. 25, and 0. 20, respectively. Phylogenetic relationship analysis of the ZN-NP and XX-OP populations showed that the 40 superior individuals in the ZN-NP selected population belonged to 23 families and could be further divided into five phylogenetic groups, and that families in the same group were closely related. Similarly, 20 families in the XX-OP population were related to varying degrees. Based on these results, we found that second-generation Chinese <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> orchards in Zhengning and Xixian should adopt a grouped, unbalanced, complete, fixed block design and an unbalanced, incomplete, fixed block design, respectively.

In each orchard, the degree of feeding preference and avoidance among selected clones was documented and quantified. We tested three hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: (1) seeds of preferred clones have greater nutritional quality or energy content; (2) cone armature differed between preferred and avoided clones; or (3) preferred clones have lower quantities of deterrent compounds present in cone tissue. Hypothesis i was tested using cones collected from threc preferred and two avoided clones within a loblolly <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> orchard. We found no consistent differences in total number of seeds per cone, viable seeds per cone, seed weight per cone, average weight per seed, energy content per seed. and energy content per cone between preferred and avoided cones. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were tested using cones collected from four preferred and four avoided clones within a slash <b>pine</b> <b>seed</b> orchard. We found a strong positive association between spine length and cone avoidance. Avoided cones had significantly higher concentrations of myrcene, a-phellandrene, p-phellandrene, B-caryophyllene, and a-humulene but lower concentrations of a-pinene.

40|$|Past {{research}} indicates that whitebark <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> are a critical food source for Threatened grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In recent decades, whitebark pine forests have declined markedly due to pine beetle infestation, invasive blister rust, and landscape-level fires. To date, no study has reliably estimated the contribution of whitebark <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> to the diets of grizzlies through time. We used stable isotope ratios (expressed as δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and δ 34 S values) measured in grizzly bear hair and their major food sources to estimate the diets of grizzlies sampled in Cooke City Basin, Montana. We found that stable isotope mixing models that included different combinations of stable isotope values for bears and their foods generated similar proportional dietary contributions. Estimates generated by our top model suggest that whitebark <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> (35 ± 10 %) and other plant foods (56 ± 10 %) were more important than meat (9 ± 8 %) to grizzly bears sampled in the study area. Stable isotope values measured in bear hair collected elsewhere in the GYE and North America support our conclusions about plant-based foraging. We recommend that researchers consider model selection when estimating the diets of animals using stable isotope mixing models. We also urge researchers {{to use the new}} statistical framework described here to estimate the dietary responses of grizzlies to declines in whitebark <b>pine</b> <b>seeds</b> and other important food sources through time in the GYE (e. g., cutthroat trout), as such information could be useful in predicting how the population will adapt to future environmental change...|$|R
