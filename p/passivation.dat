5|$|It is {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated that}} hydrogen passivates electrically active boron and phosphorus impurities. As {{a result of}} such <b>passivation,</b> shallow donor centers are presumably produced.|$|E
5|$|Pure SiC is colorless. The brown {{to black}} {{color of the}} {{industrial}} product results from iron impurities. The rainbow-like luster of the crystals {{is caused by a}} <b>passivation</b> layer of silicon dioxide that forms on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. <b>Passivation</b> can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. <b>Passivation</b> can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal resists sulfuric and {{phosphoric acid}} but not {{hydrochloric}} or nitric acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent <b>passivation</b> {{of the product}} salt. Organic acids, such as acetic acid, dissolve lead {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plumbites.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to <b>passivation).</b>|$|E
5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because <b>passivation</b> stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, {{the formation of}} an oxide layer (<b>passivation)</b> stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the <b>passivation</b> layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, <b>passivation</b> can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric <b>passivation</b> gives {{titanium}} excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (<b>passivation).</b> A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|In the {{chromate}} conversion coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This <b>passivation</b> and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the {{chromate conversion}} coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.|$|E
5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent <b>passivation</b> from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and chemical barrier in manufacturing integrated circuits, to electrically isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a <b>passivation</b> layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (<b>passivation).</b> Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|<b>Passivation</b> is {{primarily}} determined by metallurgical and environmental factors. The effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix diagrams, {{but many other}} factors are influential. Some conditions that inhibit <b>passivation</b> include high pH for aluminium and zinc, low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel, high temperature for titanium (in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal, rather than the electrolyte) and fluoride ions for silicon. On the other hand, unusual conditions may result in <b>passivation</b> of materials that are normally unprotected, as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar. Exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often circumvent <b>passivation</b> mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} to nitric acid in <b>passivation</b> of stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chromium}} (Cr), iron (Fe), and aluminium (Al) readily dissolve in dilute nitric acid, the {{concentrated acid}} forms a metal-oxide layer {{that protects the}} bulk of the metal from further oxidation. The formation of this protective layer is called <b>passivation.</b> Typical <b>passivation</b> concentrations range from 20% to 50% by volume (see ASTM A967-05). Metals that are passivated by concentrated nitric acid are iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and aluminium.|$|E
25|$|For some thinly coated {{workpieces}} a chromate <b>passivation</b> is necessary. Finally, the workpiece, whether passivated or not, is dried.|$|E
25|$|Bluing is a <b>passivation</b> {{process that}} {{produces}} a layer of Fe3O4 {{on the surface of}} steel to protect it from rust.|$|E
25|$|<b>Passivation</b> {{refers to}} the {{spontaneous}} formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act {{as a barrier to}} further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. <b>Passivation</b> in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.|$|E
25|$|Metals can be {{coated with}} paint or other less {{conductive}} metals (<b>passivation).</b> This prevents the metal surface from {{being exposed to}} electrolytes. Scratches exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. The region under the coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the anode of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1990s two duplex (ferritic-austenitic) {{stainless}} steels were introduced (DP28W, jointly developed by Toyo Engineering and Sumitomo Metals Industries and Safurex, jointly developed by Stamicarbon and Sandvik Materials Technology (Sweden).) These let manufactures drastically {{reduce the amount}} of <b>passivation</b> oxygen. In theory, they could operate with no oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Very low {{temperature}} melting glasses, fluid at 200–400°C, were developed for sealing applications for electronics. They can consist of binary or ternary mixtures of thallium, arsenic and sulfur. Zinc-silicoborate glasses {{can also be used}} for <b>passivation</b> of electronics; their coefficient of thermal expansion must match silicon (or the other semiconductors used) and they must not contain alkaline metals as those would migrate to the semiconductor and cause failures.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder as a gun {{propellant}} {{suffered from}} several weaknesses inherent to its composition. It {{was subject to}} <b>passivation</b> by moisture and was awkward to load and ignite in a weapon. Sulfur oxides and moisture produced corrosion on metal gun components and the smoke gave away {{the position of the}} shooter. The development of cartridges and explosive primers were a major improvement in the use of gunpowders in the field.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium alloys often {{undergo a}} surface treatment. Electrochemical {{conditions}} in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal <b>passivation</b> processes take over to protect the damaged area.|$|E
25|$|Anti-reflection {{coatings}} {{are then}} typically applied {{to increase the}} amount of light coupled into the solar cell. Silicon nitride has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface <b>passivation</b> qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with <b>passivation</b> air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Many {{structural}} alloys corrode merely {{from exposure}} to moisture in air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result, methods to reduce {{the activity of the}} exposed surface, such as <b>passivation</b> and chromate conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However, some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallinity}} of the produced tungsten layers can {{be controlled}} by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which the main <b>passivation</b> material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.|$|E
25|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. At standard temperature and pressure, it is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, <b>passivation</b> can occur, similarly to uranium and plutonium. At high temperatures, it is easily attacked by oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, the halogens, and sulfur. It can also form binary compounds with carbon and phosphorus. When thorium dissolves in hydrochloric acid, a black insoluble residue, probably ThO(OH,Cl)H, is left behind, similarly to protactinium and uranium.|$|E
25|$|Strong bases attack aluminium. Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium aluminate. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further <b>passivation</b> such as anodizing or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium oxide is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin <b>passivation</b> layer of aluminium oxide (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising. A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|E
500|$|The main {{disadvantage}} {{of iron and}} steel is that pure iron, {{and most of its}} alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way, a cost amounting to over 1% of the world's economy. Painting, galvanization, <b>passivation,</b> plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection. The mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The pure {{element is}} {{relatively}} stable in air in bulk form, due to <b>passivation</b> of a protective oxide (...) film that forms on the surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10µm when yttrium is heated to 750°C in water vapor. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or turnings {{of the metal}} can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400°C. Yttrium nitride (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000°C in nitrogen.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium is a medium-hard, ductile, steel-blue metal. Some sources {{describe}} vanadium as [...] "soft", {{perhaps because}} it is ductile, malleable and not brittle. Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses of the elements (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is oxidized in air at about 933K (660°C, 1220°F), although an oxide <b>passivation</b> layer forms even at room temperature.|$|E
