50|$|Some vendors (AST and NEC) {{supported}} eight, {{instead of}} the standard four, <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> entries in their custom extended Master Boot Record (MBR), and they adapted MS-DOS to use {{more than a single}} <b>primary</b> <b>partition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{versions}} of DOS do not assign the drive letter, beginning with C:, {{to the first}} active <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> recognized upon the first physical hard disk, but on the first <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> recognized of the first hard disk, {{even if it is}} not set active.|$|E

50|$|The total {{data storage}} {{space of a}} PC HDD on which MBR {{partitioning}} is implemented can contain at most four <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> or alternatively three <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> and an extended partition. The Partition Table, located in the master boot record, contains 16-byte entries, each of which describes a partition.|$|R

5000|$|Starting <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> on head 1 (instead of head 0) {{has another}} advantage. It allows bit-identical cloning of these <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> to logical drives, making {{completely}} normal (usual) logical drives. That is, the EBRs of the logical drives {{are at the}} beginning of a cylinder, the logical drive begins on the very next head, and the logical drive ends on a cylinder boundary. However this author has not tested installing or booting operating systems from <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> beginning on the head 1, which were not the first partition. (The first partition usually begins on head 1 because this cylinder begins with the master boot record.) ...|$|R

50|$|The MBR <b>partition</b> IDs for <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> {{that are}} {{subdivided}} using BSD disklabels are A5h (386BSD and FreeBSD), A6h (OpenBSD), and A9h (NetBSD).|$|R

50|$|The latest beta (v2.44 beta) {{provides}} a workaround {{to overcome the}} limitation of 4 <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> in a single drive, thus permitting up to 30 primary (and therefore bootable) partitions.|$|R

5000|$|Ranish Partition Manager {{can be used}} {{to create}} a (manual) backup of both the <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> table and the [...] "extended partition" [...] (table).|$|E
5000|$|Various {{programs}} {{are able to}} create a [...] "backup" [...] of both the <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> table and the logical partitions in the extended partition.|$|E
50|$|Using this {{technique}} {{it is possible}} to convert logical drives to <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> and vice versa. This is an experimental technique that may have problems in certain situations (see section below).|$|R
50|$|The same PC {{hard drive}} can have both BSD disklabel {{partitions}} and the MS-DOS type logical <b>partitions</b> in separate <b>primary</b> <b>partitions.</b> FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems can access both the BSD disklabel subdivided partition and the MS-DOS type Extended/Logical partitions.|$|R
50|$|A {{parallel}} {{development in}} MS-DOS / PC DOS which allowed {{an increase in}} the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions on a hard disk. To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced in PC DOS 3.2 (1986), the extended partition (EBR), which is a container for an additional partition called logical drive. Since PC DOS 3.3 (April 1987), there is another, optional extended partition containing the next logical drive, and so on. The MBR of a hard disk can either define up to four <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> or an extended partition in addition to up to three <b>primary</b> <b>partitions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> {{contains}} one file system. In DOS and all early {{versions of}} Microsoft Windows systems, Microsoft required {{what it called}} the system partition {{to be the first}} partition. All Windows operating systems from Windows 95 onwards can be located on (almost) any partition, but the boot files ( [...] , , , etc.) must reside on a <b>primary</b> <b>partition.</b> However, other factors, such as a PC's BIOS (see Boot sequence on standard PC) may also impose specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS.|$|E
5000|$|... 50 GB of free {{hard drive}} space on a <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> for a [...] "desktop" [...] {{installation}}, or 20 GB for a [...] "server" [...] installation (TrueOS) ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to storing GRUB in the MBR is keeping Windows' or other generic PC boot code in the MBR, and installing GRUB or another bootloader into a <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> {{other than that}} of Windows, thus keeping the MBR neutral. Operating system selection at boot time consequently depends on the bootloader configured within the <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> that has the boot or [...] "active" [...] flag set on its partition table entry, which could be a bootloader of DOS, OS/2, eComStation, Blue Lion and/or BSD, in addition to Linux and/or Windows.|$|E
50|$|Allows sector-precise editing of <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> logical drives, and EBR {{extended}} partitions (type 05). A particularly rare {{feature of}} RPM {{is that it}} shows exactly where extended boot records are, advises the user of where they should be, and allows the user to put them anywhere.|$|R
5000|$|This {{also makes}} it easy to write down the {{location}} of a partition (in cylinders), delete it from the partition table, and later re-add it to the partition table, to make the partition visible again. This is used in multi-boot systems, where more than four <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> are required.|$|R
5000|$|It {{can display}} {{a maximum of}} 64 lines. This makes it {{impossible}} to add a partition when the partition table has approximately 3 <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> plus an [...] "extended partition" [...] with 28 logical drives. Logical drives require two lines minimum. Free spaces between drives usually use a line each.|$|R
50|$|The system {{partition}} is a <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> {{that contains}} the boot loader, a piece of software responsible for booting the operating system. This partition holds the boot sector and is marked active.|$|E
5000|$|With DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2, {{a common}} {{practice}} is to use one <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> for the active file system that will contain the operating system, the page/swap file, all utilities, applications, and user data. On most Windows consumer computers, the drive letter C: is routinely assigned to this <b>primary</b> <b>partition.</b> Other partitions may exist on the HDD {{that may or may}} not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data. (Microsoft drive letters do not correspond to partitions in a one-to-one fashion, so there may be more or fewer drive letters than partitions.) ...|$|E
50|$|Because RPM shows {{all of this}} {{information}} and shows the entire drive in a CHS format, {{it is easy to}} see whether the entire extended and <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> tables, conform to a standard CHS alignment.|$|E
50|$|The MSR {{should be}} located after the EFI System Partition (ESP) and any OEM service partitions, {{but it must}} be located before any <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> of {{bootable}} Windows operating systems. Microsoft expects an MSR to be present on every GPT disk, and recommends it to be created as the disk is initially partitioned.|$|R
50|$|On disks {{using the}} typical PC master boot record, the device numbers of primary and the {{optional}} extended partition are numbered 1 through 4, while the indexes of any logical partitions are 5 and onwards, {{regardless of the}} layout of the former partitions (their parent extended partition {{does not need to be}} the fourth partition on the disk, nor do all four <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> have to exist).|$|R
50|$|DriveSetup is a harddisk {{partitioning}} {{tool that}} allows the user to create, delete and initialise partitions. It gives a graphical representation of all partitions on devices which are chosen in the device list below the graph. The maximum number of <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> which may be extended or can be logical partitions is limited to four. Partitions can be mounted or unmounted by using some commands after choosing a partition from the list.|$|R
5000|$|Assign {{subsequent}} drive {{letters to}} the first <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> upon each successive physical hard disk drive. DOS versions prior to 5.0 will probe for only two physical harddisks, whereas DOS 5.0 and higher support eight physical harddisks.|$|E
5000|$|... gpart {{tries to}} guess {{partitions}} from any device {{that can be}} partitioned, even a file. If the <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> table has been lost, overwritten or destroyed the partitions still exist on the media but the operating system cannot access them.|$|E
5000|$|Assign a {{drive letter}} to the first active <b>primary</b> <b>partition</b> {{recognized}} upon the first physical hard disk. DOS 5.0 and higher will ensure that this will become drive letter C:, so that the boot drive will either have drive letter A: or C:.|$|E
50|$|If {{partitions}} {{to be used}} by pre-DOS 3.31 {{issues of}} DOS need to be created by modern tools, the only criteria theoretically necessary to meet are a sector count of less than 65536, and the usage of the old partition ID (0x04). In practice however, type 0x01 and 0x04 <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> should not be physically located outside the first 32 MiB of the disk, due to other restrictions in MS-DOS 2.x, which could not cope with them otherwise.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>primary</b> <b>partitions,</b> {{which are}} all {{described}} by a single partition table within the MBR, and thus limited in number, each EBR precedes the logical partition it describes. If another logical partition follows, then the first EBR will contain an entry pointing to the next EBR; thus, multiple EBRs form a linked list. This means the number of logical drives that can be formed within an extended partition is limited only {{by the amount of}} available disk space in the given extended partition.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard PC disk partition scheme that uses a master boot record (MBR), UEFI also works with a new partitioning scheme called GUID Partition Table (GPT), which is free {{from many of the}} limitations of MBR. In particular, the MBR limits on the number and size of disk partitions (up to four <b>primary</b> <b>partitions</b> per disk, and up to 2 TiB [...] per disk) are relaxed. More specifically, GPT allows for a maximum disk and partition size of 8 ZiB [...]|$|R
