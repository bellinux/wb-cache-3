Special <b>point</b> <b>plot,</b> entered with , added an intensity character to the coordinate that defocussed the beam {{and allowed the}} points to have various brightnesses.|$|R

50|$|Noted screenwriting teacher Syd Field {{discusses}} <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> in his paradigm, popularized in {{his book}} Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting. There he proposes that a well-structured movie has two <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> within a three-act structure. The first <b>plot</b> <b>point</b> occurs 20 to 30 minutes into the film (assuming a standard 120-minute running time), and the second one occurs 80 to 90 minutes into the film. The first <b>plot</b> <b>point</b> ends Act I and propels the story into Act II; likewise, the second <b>plot</b> <b>point</b> ends Act II and propels the story into Act III.|$|R
40|$|Detection and {{monitoring}} childhood growth disorders requires the correct use of growth charts. A {{check on the}} accuracy of every <b>point</b> <b>plotted</b> on Gairdner-Pearson growth charts of premature infants in a hospital paediatric department was carried out. Errors beyond set limits were recorded. Of 611 <b>points</b> <b>plotted</b> on the growth charts of 50 premature infants who were at least 1 year of age {{at the time of}} the study, there were 173 (28. 5 %) <b>points</b> <b>plotted</b> in error. Altogether 94. 7 % of the errors occurred when plotting the age along the horizontal (X) axis of the growth chart, irrespective of whether weight, length, or head circumference was being measured. There was no evidence that the errors caused appreciable changes in clinical management. Potential sources of error identified were failure to adjust for prematurity correctly, inaccuracy in calculating age, and the use of the logarithmic scale. These errors could be serious and it is important that there should be greater vigilance in using growth charts. The use of age calculators or improved chart design is recommended. Assessment of the use of other growth charts in different settings is also suggested...|$|R

50|$|The Cortex System {{also uses}} <b>Plot</b> <b>Points,</b> which {{increase}} characters' survivability and give players {{greater control over}} events in the game.

50|$|Character {{creation}} in the Serenity Role Playing Game (2005) is point-based and players can use <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> to influence die rolls; {{this use of}} <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> has become standard for games based on dramatic licenses. In the Cortex System, players are encouraged to roleplay their disadvantages during play and are rewarded with <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> for doing so; thoughmost of Cortex is a traditional RPG system, the interrelation of <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> and complications was a trend toward the indie side of game design. In the Smallville Roleplaying Game, <b>plot</b> <b>points</b> have become a central resource; they're not only available {{through the use of}} complications but they are also usable to power superpowers, meaning that PCs build up problems, then solve them when super powers come out, much like the TV show.
