40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the 2004 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress mandated that GAO examine and report on the oversight of <b>prime</b> <b>contractors</b> by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the oversight of subcontractors by the <b>prime</b> <b>contractors.</b> Contract quality assurance oversight is intended to assess whether contractors are capable of and are providing supplies or services that meet contract quality and technical requirements. Providing effective oversight is challenging. DCMA recognizes {{that the risk of}} nonconforming parts reaching end users exists, given the diversity of contracts, parts, and products used to meet weapon systems requirements and uses a risk management process to guide its efforts. For fiscal year 2003, government quality assurance oversight was required for approximately 273, 000 contracts. GAO determined (1) whether DOD provided quality assurance oversight and enforcement over its spare parts <b>prime</b> <b>contractors,</b> (2) if <b>prime</b> <b>contractors</b> provided quality assurance oversight over their subcontractors, and (3) how DOD held <b>prime</b> <b>contractors</b> accountable for overseeing the subcontractors' work. To address these objectives, GAO judgmentally selected and reviewed 15 contracts awarded to 11 <b>prime</b> <b>contractors</b> by the services and the Defense Logistics Agency. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD provided one technical comment, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. ...|$|R

They and the backup crew for the mission, Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, were flying to St. Louis from their normal training base in Houston, Texas, for two weeks of simulator training for rendezvous and docking procedures at McDonnell Aircraft, the <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the Gemini spacecraft. It was a routine flight they had made many times previously.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>contractor</b> Lockheed Martin Aeronautics {{manufactured}} {{the majority}} of the airframe and performed final assembly at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia; program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provided additional airframe components as well as avionics integration and training systems. F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

Westland was subsequently the <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the Black Arrow, and assembled {{the first and second}} stages at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Bristol Siddeley produced the first and second stage engines at a factory in Ansty, Warwickshire. The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight, where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at High Down. Bristol Aerojet produced the third stage in Somerset, while the Explosives Research and Development Establishment produced its solid propellant in Waltham Abbey, Essex. The Rocket Propulsion Establishment, based in Westcott, Buckinghamshire, was responsible for the design and integration of the stage.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami Tunnel project {{involved}} {{the design and}} widening of the MacArthur Causeway by one lane in each direction {{leading up to the}} tunnel entrance, the relocation of Parrot Jungle Trail, and the reconstruction of roadways on Dodge Island. The tunnel itself has two side by side tubes carrying traffic underneath the cruise ship channel of the Government Cut shipping lane. Jacobs Engineering Group was responsible for the design of the roadways, Langan Engineering & Environmental Services was the geotechnical engineer, and Bouygues was the <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the tunnel project itself. Chosen due to their key involvement {{in the construction of the}} Channel Tunnel, a major tunnel in Europe, the selection of Bouygues was also met with controversy and protested by the Cuban exile community in Miami, due to the company's involvement with locally opposed construction projects in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The German government, for {{political}} reasons, preferred the An-70-based solution. During a separate German Ministry of Defence {{evaluation of the}} An-7X, the aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to the A400M designed by the military branch of Airbus. According to AirTruck, the Defence Ministry estimated the An-7X to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival, would provide industrial benefits as Germany would receive substantial workshare, and was deemed to be technically superior, due mainly to its new propfan technology; however, a Defence Ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached. On the other hand, DASA preferred the A400M, and refused to be the <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the An-70 if {{it was to be}} chosen. In the meantime, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK, were tentative members of the FLA programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft; Russia and Ukraine themselves were looking to acquire 210 An-70s. Other contenders for the FLA were the C-17 and C-130J. In April 2000, the German government, the strongest supporter of the An-70, stated that it was committed to buying the same aircraft as the other countries. In the end, the A400M was chosen for the FLA project; had the An-70 been chosen, fifty percent of the aircraft would have been manufactured by Airbus.|$|E

40|$|To be {{the lowest}} bidder in {{procurement}} auctions, <b>prime</b> <b>contractors</b> commonly solicit subcontract bids at the bid preparation stage. A remarkable {{feature of the}} subcontract competition is that "winning is not everything"; the lowest subcontractor gets a job conditional on his <b>prime</b> <b>contractor's</b> successful bid. This paper makes the first attempt to establish a model for such pre-award subcontract competitions included in procurement auctions. I find that subcontractors strategically provide larger discounts on their bids in response to increasing competition among <b>prime</b> <b>contractors.</b> I thus clarify that the behavior results in an endogenous downward shift {{in the distribution of}} bidders' private information in the downstream auction as the number of rivals increases, or the reservation price drops. The result has a striking impact on the analysis of optimal reservation price and empirical identification of the bidder's cost distribution in procurement auctions. ...|$|R
