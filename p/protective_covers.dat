5|$|In 1940, Hearst {{decided to}} give the monastery away. The {{government}} of Francisco Franco requested that it be returned to Spain, but Hearst refused. In August 1941, Herbert Fleishhacker, director of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, convinced Hearst to give the stones to the City of San Francisco {{in exchange for the}} city's payment of his $25,000 storage debt. Hearst stipulated the stones be used to construct a group of museum buildings adjoining the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. The city moved the crates from the warehouse to store them outdoors behind the museum and the Japanese Tea Garden, allotting only $5,000 for trucking and for building rough sheds and <b>protective</b> <b>covers.</b> The museum plan was estimated to cost $500,000, but that amount was not available. Morgan prepared several layouts for the city to approve, each with a different arrangement of the buildings than in Spain. However, in December 1941, the U.S. was drawn into World War II and the museum plans were shelved. Picking up the project in 1946, the city paid Morgan to construct a scale model of the complex of buildings which was to be the Museum of Medieval Arts, a West Coast version of The Cloisters in New York.|$|E

A few years later a third version of the system was being produced, the GDF-003, which was broadly similar to the GDF-002, but included some enhancements like self-lubricating weapons and integrated <b>protective</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|E

William Reisman, who began a 27-year tenure as rector that same year, modernized and redecorated many of the buildings, adding <b>protective</b> <b>covers</b> for the stained-glass windows. He also began adult education classes at the church and updated Chorley's history to the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Lockheed Martin {{successfully}} {{conducted the}} first test flight of a prototype NetFires Loitering Attack Missile (LAM) at Eglin Air Force Base, on 11 November 2002. The LAM vertically launched flawlessly, transitioned to stable flight and performed several maneuvers during the short flight test. Test objectives were successfully achieved. The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher. Control surfaces and a pivoting wing deployed as planned as the missile began its programmed assent-phase roll and pitch maneuver. <b>Protective</b> <b>covers</b> on the forward dome, scoring camera and turbojet inlet were ejected properly and engine start sequence began as scheduled. Turbojet ignition sequence completed approximately five seconds after launch, and the engine came up to speed as the prototype approached apogee. For the next eight minutes, the LAM prototype executed preprogrammed maneuvers over the Eglin test range, demonstrating impressive stability and validating aerodynamic performance, navigation and autopilot performance design parameters.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel {{closed in}} 2002 {{and due to}} the risk of {{crumbling}} stonework it has been under scaffolding and <b>protective</b> <b>covers</b> since. In 2012 planning permission was granted for plans to restore the building into a luxury hotel. Works to the exterior began in October 2012 and it is planned to open the building as a hotel in 2019. In May 2017 it was announced that hotel operator Principal Hotel Company would work with the owners to open a 180 bedroom hotel with rooftop pool in 2019.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the hotel}} closed in August 2002, the {{building}} fell into disrepair {{and the poor}} quality stonework on the building's façade began to crumble. After some of the stonework fell onto the pavement in Colmore Row, the building was surrounded with scaffolding and <b>protective</b> <b>covers</b> to protect the public. Escalating maintenance costs led to the proposal by the owners to demolish the building in 2003. The proposal was dropped when the building was listed as a Grade II* listed building in 2004. The building then continued to lay vacant (except for the shops fronting Colmore Row) {{as the cost of}} repairing and restoring the building was deemed as too high or not even feasible due to the poor state of the exterior stonework.|$|E
