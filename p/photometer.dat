5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German {{astronomer}} Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed a}} custom <b>photometer</b> {{to measure the}} reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's <b>photometer.</b> They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German astronomer Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English astronomer Edward W. Maunder in 1875, but would later come into question.|$|E
5|$|Most importantly, the High Speed <b>Photometer</b> was {{replaced}} with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC {{was replaced}} with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added coprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.|$|E

With a new design of <b>photometer,</b> he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and had quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E
30|$|We have {{developed}} three airglow temperature <b>photometers</b> with cooled-CCD detectors. The <b>photometers</b> measure rotational temperatures using the airglow emissions of OH and O 2 near the mesopause region (altitude: 80 s- 100 km). The <b>photometers</b> also measure six other airglow and auroral lines at wavelengths of 557.7, 630.0, 777.4, 589.3, 427.8, and 486.1 nm. The CCD detectors {{are used to}} distinguish the emission lines in these airglow bands, similarly to those used by the Spectral Airglow Temperature Imagers (SATI). In this paper, we describe {{the configuration of the}} <b>photometers,</b> their calibration, the data processing to extract rotational temperatures and emission intensities from the measured airglow spectra, as well as the initial deployment at Platteville, Colorado (40.2 °N, 255.3 °E), when their observations were compared with the concurrent and nearly collocated observations by a sodium lidar.

The optical part of the payload is called the Multi-Spectral Modular Imaging Array (MMIA) and {{consists of}} a combination of a camera units and <b>photometers.</b> The Modular X- and Gamma-ray Sensor (MXGS) is a coded aperture based gamma ray imaging system. The payload is to be own on the ISS to measure the TLE's which are associated with electrical discharges in the atmosphere above 10 km and commonly associated with lightning events on the Earth. Three primary types of TLE's will be studied: SPRITES, ELVES and HALOES. There will be six <b>photometers</b> measuring photon fluxes in specific narrow band and broad band channels between 145 nm and 740 nm. The six <b>photometers</b> will be mounted into three MMIA units each containing two <b>photometers.</b> Two MMIA modules will be pointed towards the Earth Limb and on MMIA to the Nadir.

5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM <b>photometer</b> at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements.

In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E

The development of the photoelectric <b>photometer</b> allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A.

40|$|NIST has {{recently}} established a detectorbased luminous intensity unit (candela, cd), which {{is derived from}} the NIST absolute cryogenic radiometer. Subsequently, the luminous flux unit (lumen, lm) and the luminance unit (cd/m 2) have been established based on the detector-based candela, and now all the NIST photometric units are tied to the cryogenic radiometer. The illuminance unit is realized and maintained on five standard <b>photometers.</b> The large dynamic range of the standard <b>photometers</b> eliminates the need for maintaining many working standard lamps of various wattages. The luminous intensities of lamps are determined from the illuminances measured with these <b>photometers</b> and the distances measured with a linear encoder system. Transfer <b>photometers</b> and illuminance meters are calibrated by direct comparison with the standard <b>photometers</b> with no distance measurements involved. The luminous flux unit is realized using an absolute integrating sphere method newly developed at NIST. The luminance unit is realized on an integrating sphere source, which is used for calibration of other luminance sources and luminance meters.

It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed <b>Photometer</b> to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E

40|$|The {{main source}} of error in {{retrieving}} aerosol optical thicknesses using sun photometry comes from {{the determination of the}} TOA voltages. The degradation of interference filters is the most important source of the long-term changes in the cross-calibrations. Although major improvements {{have been made in the}} design of the filters (interference filters fabricated using ion-assisted deposition), the filters remain the principal factor limiting performance of the sun <b>photometers.</b> Degradation of filters necessitates frequent calibration of sun <b>photometers</b> and frequent measurements of the filter transmission or the relative system response. The degradation of the filters mounted on the CIMEL sun <b>photometers</b> have been monitored since 1993 by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) project. The decay reported by Holben et al. for the first two years of a CIMEL#s operation is between 1 and 5 %. Nevertheless, the filters mounted on CIMEL instruments are regularly replaced after two years of use. The cross-calibration technique consists of taking measurements concurrently with the uncalibrated and the reference sun <b>photometers.</b> While analyzing measurements, the quality of the calibration has to be checked, using the following considerations: (1) any cirrus clouds suspected to be masking the sun, during the calibration period, need to be reported and the corresponding data set removed; and (2) the stability of the day needs to be checked.
