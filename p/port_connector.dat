50|$|<b>Port</b> <b>{{connectors}}</b> may be male or female, but female connectors {{are much}} more common. Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer, so it was common to use female connectors for the fixed side of an interface.|$|R

50|$|Generally, serial <b>port</b> <b>connectors</b> are gendered, only {{allowing}} connectors to {{mate with}} a connector of the opposite gender. With D-subminiature connectors, the male connectors have protruding pins, and female connectors have corresponding round sockets. Either type of connector can be mounted on equipment or a panel; or terminate a cable.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though few}} {{consumer}} products provide an explicit JTAG <b>port</b> <b>connector,</b> the connections are often {{available on the}} printed circuit board as a remnant from development prototyping and/or production. When exploited, these connections often provide the most viable means for reverse engineering.|$|E

50|$|The Toshiba T1000 was {{a laptop}} {{computer}} manufactured by the Toshiba Corporation in 1987. It had a similar specification to the IBM PC Convertible, with an 4.77 MHz 80C88 processor, 512 kB of RAM, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD. Unlike the Convertible, it includes a standard serial port and parallel <b>port,</b> <b>connectors</b> for an external monitor, and a real-time clock.|$|R
50|$|This {{device is}} capable of {{allowing}} the user to enter and edit several pages of text - and by connecting a printer to the RS-232 serial <b>port</b> <b>connector,</b> documents can be printed {{without the aid of}} a separate computer.It was first sold in the UK in most mailorder shops in computing magazines such as YOUR COMPUTER from Spring/Summer 1983 and cost around £400-£500 (equivalent to around £1500 in 2014).|$|E
50|$|In {{the rear}} of the machine were its {{expansion}} ports, mostly for providing access to its built-in cards. The standard DE-9 joystick connector doubled as a mouse interface, compatible with the same mice used by the Lisa and early Macintosh computers. Two serial ports were provided primarily to support a printer and modem, and a floppy <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> supported a single external 5.25-inch drive (and later “intelligent” devices such as 3.5-inch drives and hard disks). A Video Expansion port provided rudimentary signals for add-on adapters but, alone, could not directly generate a video signal (Apple produced an LCD and an RF-modulator for this port; the latter shipped with early IIcs). A <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> tied into an internal 12 V power converter for attaching batteries; this is where the infamous external power supply (dubbed “brick on a leash” by users) that was included plugged in. The same composite video port found on earlier Apple II models remained present; however, gone were the cassette ports and internal DIP-16 game port.|$|E
50|$|POST {{cards are}} {{inserted}} into an expansion slot, {{and are available}} in ISA (also supporting EISA), PCI, parallel port, and other variants (Mini PCIe, for laptop computers, is supported by some cards, but with restrictions). A typical card for desktop computers has both an ISA interface on one edge, and PCI on another; a card for laptop computers has both a miniPCI and a parallel <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> (plus USB to supply power).|$|E
50|$|Apple {{discontinued}} the III in October 1983 {{because it}} violated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, and the FCC required {{the company to}} change the redesigned computer's name. It introduced the Apple III Plus in December 1983 at a price of US$2995. This newer version includes a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear <b>port</b> <b>connectors,</b> 55-watt power supply, 256 KiB RAM as standard, and a redesigned, IIe-like keyboard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the UML 1. 4 metamodel that facilitates the description of software architectures. To this end, concepts like views, <b>ports,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and protocols are introduced, and the UML’s subsystem concept is adapted. The approach is inspired by ROOM and IEEE P 1471, using an explicit metamodeling approach for clarity. This paper should be seen as input for the discussion on the UML 2. ...|$|R
50|$|Essentially a bookshelf-style case {{lying on}} its side, a {{miniature}} HTPC replicates {{the look of}} other smaller-than-rack-sized home theatre components such as a DVR or mini audio receiver. The front panel interface is emphasized, with the optical disc drive rotated relative to the case {{in order to maintain}} horizontal mounting, and more motherboard <b>port</b> <b>connectors</b> (such as for USB) are routed to the front panel, they normally are as powerful as PC desktops.|$|R
50|$|The Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) {{is a small}} {{form-factor}} serial <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> {{developed by}} Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It uses {{a modified version of}} the 6P6C modular connector with the latch displaced off-center so standard modular connectors found on Ethernet cables or phone jacks cannot accidentally be plugged in. MMJ connections are used on Digital minicomputers, such as the PDP-11, VAX and Alpha systems, and to connect terminals, printers, and serial console servers.|$|E
50|$|The Handbook had 640 KiB of RAM, a 20 MB hard drive, and a {{monochrome}} blue-white CGA-compatible display. The unit {{could be}} {{powered by a}} rechargeable NiMH battery or six AA batteries in a special battery pack. The rechargeable batteries were unusual {{in that they are}} able to be charged without actually being in the laptop. A floppy disk was attached through a proprietary parallel <b>port</b> <b>connector.</b> A tremendous engineering effort went into the design of the HandBook's keyboard. It featured 17.8 mm center-to center key spacing and 2 mm travel for a firm feel.|$|E
50|$|In mid-2004, Game Park {{introduced}} the backlight unit (BLU). The new BLU LCD was {{compatible with the}} NLU (and FLU) and provided superior screen display in poor lighting conditions. At the end of 2004, Game Park also released a second version of the BLU, which had a different LCD to the first version BLU units. The new BLU+ LCD was not 100% compatible with the original LCD screen and so software required special handling to support both LCD versions.The backlight could be disabled by holding the SELECT button for 5 seconds. The BLU models also had a slightly different USB <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> and better quality micro switches for the controller.|$|E
50|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{essential}} {{parts of a}} typical 2-port vector network analyzer (VNA). The two ports of the device under test (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The test <b>port</b> <b>connectors</b> provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable connector adaptors A1 and A2 respectively.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the back}} of the device you could also find an eight-pin DIN {{connector}} for a cassette recorder with which you could load programs at 2400 bit/s. Then two connectors for video output, an RCA connector RF output and an eight-pins DIN connector that could output NTSC or RGB video. The JR-200UP variant outputs composite PAL and RGB. Two other connectors provided a centronics compatible printer port, (supported by Basic with LPRINT, LLIST and HCOPY, a [...] "screen dump" [...] command) and an expansion interface port. The expansion <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> also had signal lines for an RS232 serial connection which Basic supported with several commands, but its main use was to connect a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive.|$|E
50|$|The DCC-175 Service Manual {{shows that}} in the recorder, the cable was {{connected}} to the I²S bus that carries the PASC bitstream, and it is also connected to a dedicated serial port of the microcontroller, to allow the PC to control the mechanism and to read and write auxiliary information such as track markers and track titles. The parallel <b>port</b> <b>connector</b> of the cable contains a custom chip created especially for this purpose by Philips Key Modules, as well as a standard RAM chip. Philips made no detailed technical information available to the public about the custom chip and therefore it is impossible for people who own a DCC-175 but no PC-link cable to make their own version of the PC-link cable.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the first USB standard in 1996, was aimed squarely at the sort of roles provided by the game port, but initially had little market impact. The {{introduction of}} the iMac, which was based almost entirely on USB expansion, began a rapid expansion of USB in the market. This led both to new gaming devices using USB, {{as well as the}} profusion of adaptors. For instance, the 1997 Microsoft Precision Pro joystick was re-introduced in a version that used a game <b>port</b> <b>connector,</b> but also included a USB adaptor in the box. The rapid takeover of USB meant that this was superfluous when the Precision Pro 2 was released the next year in 1998. By 2000, game ports were purely for backward compatibility with now outdated devices.|$|E
50|$|A {{parallel}} port {{is a type}} of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. The name refers to the way the data is sent; {{parallel port}}s send multiple bits of data at once, in parallel communication, as opposed to serial interfaces that send bits one at a time. To do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and <b>port</b> <b>connectors,</b> and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports which only require one data line.|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of personal computers and laptops consider parallel to be a legacy port {{and no longer}} include the parallel interface. Smaller machines have less room for large parallel <b>port</b> <b>connectors.</b> USB-to-parallel adapters are available that can make parallel-only printers work with USB-only systems.There are PCI (and PCI-express) cards that provide parallel ports. There are also some print servers that provide interface to parallel port through network. USB-to-EPP chips can also allow other non-printer devices {{to continue to work}} on modern computers without a parallel port.|$|R
50|$|Some {{miniaturized}} {{electronic devices}} use 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm jacks as serial <b>port</b> <b>connectors</b> for data transfer and unit programming. This technique is particularly common on graphing calculators, {{such as the}} TI-83 series, and some types of amateur and two-way radio, though in some more modern equipment USB mini-B connectors are provided in addition to or instead of jack connectors. The second-generation iPod Shuffle from Apple has one TRRS jack which serves as headphone, USB, or power supply, depending on the connected plug.|$|R
