40|$|The {{propensity}} of an attenuated strain of {{feline infectious enteritis}} (<b>panleucopaenia)</b> virus to spread from vaccinated cats affected with intercurrent feline respiratory disease to unvaccinated in-contact cats was eradicated by further passaging of the vaccine virus in tissue culture. No virus was recovered from, and no antibody {{was found in the}} sentinel cats in contact with seven vaccinated animals. Thus, a further 27 passages of the vaccine virus in tissue culture has eliminated the spread factor...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{developing}} a living attenuated feline infectious enteritis (<b>panleucopaenia)</b> vaccine, {{it was found that}} respiratory disease-infected cats newly inoculated with this vaccine spread vaccine virus to respiratory disease-infected in-contact controls. These in-contact controls were able to infect other cats with which they were placed in contact so that after five natural transmissions in this way and two oral administrations and subsequent re-isolations, reversion to virulence became evident. It is clear that before general release of a new living feline infectious enteritis vaccine, there must be satisfactory evidence that concurrent infection will not affect the safety of the modified antigen...|$|E
40|$|When ten cats were {{infected}} orally with undiluted or a 10 - 1 dilution of virulent {{feline infectious enteritis}} (<b>panleucopaenia)</b> virus, all developed severe leucopaenia followed {{by the development of}} demonstrable antibody, but none died. Eighteen of 29 cats given a 10 - 2 dilution of virus died of the disease. Three of the survivors had white blood cell counts of less than 4000 and three had counts between 4000 and 6000 cells. Although the remaining five animals never had individual counts of less than 6000 cells, the geometric means of these counts showed that a marked depression in the leucocyte counts had occurred. All surviving cats developed antibody...|$|E
40|$|Isolation {{of viruses}} {{from the central}} nervous system (CNS) of cats was {{attempted}} using an explant culture technique and subsequent co-cultivation with Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) or Vero cells. Feline syncytia-forming virus was isolated from the CNS of 11 of 16 cats where the initial co-cultivation was with CRFK cells. Feline <b>panleucopaenia</b> virus was isolated from the CNS of 2 adult cats. Co-cultured cells from the CNS of 3 cats contained eosinophilic cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. The cytoplasmic inclusions consisted of tubular structures, 16 - 18 nm in diameter and up to 500 nm in length, which were similar in morphology to paramyxovirus nucleocapsids. The 3 co-cultured cells with cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions showed haemadsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes. The possible identity of these structures, and their association with a previously described primary focal demyelinating lesion in the CNS of cats, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|I) This paper {{evaluates the}} effects of the {{artificial}} introduction offcline <b>panleucopaenia</b> (FPL) as a primary control measure ofa feral cat population on the sub-Antarctic Marion Island (46 54 'S, 3 T 4 S'E). (2) The population decreased from an estimated 3409 cats in 1977 (introduction of control factor) to 615 (S. E. = 107) ca ts during 1982, suggesting an annual rate of decrease 0129 %. (3) Litter size decreased and the age structure changed significantly because ofa decrease in subadult numbers. Age specific mortality rates were higher but followed the same pattern as in 1975 because there were fewer subadults but the same age structure of adults. (4) The intrinsic rate of increase, as suggested by the survival and fecundity schedules of the: population, was higher in 1975 owing to a greater proportion of adults and a higher fecundity in age class II. (5) Antibody titres ofFPL were lower in 1982 than in 1978 which illustrates that FPL did afTect the cat population but is no longer spreading effectively. FPL was independent of feline herpes (FVR), an endemic disease of the cat population. and FPL was, therefore, directly responsible for the decrease in cat population density. (6) During 19 R 2 the cat population showed a decrease of 8 % year-I, whieh indicates stabilizing of the negative growth rate. This observation was supported by lower titres of FPL...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} a {{serological}} study examining the antibody responses generated in cats following administration of a trivalent feline vaccine (feline calicivirus [FCV], feline herpesvirus [FHV] and feline <b>panleucopaenia</b> virus [FPV]; Versifel CVR) in combination with an inactivated rabies vaccine, in compliance with European Pharmacopoeia requirements to support new product registrations, are presented. Nine week old cats were allocated {{to one of three}} groups, 10 cats per group. Group 1 received the CVR vaccine on days 0 and 21, group 2 received the rabies vaccine on day 21 and group 3 received the CVR vaccine on day 0 and the CVR vaccine reconstituted with the rabies vaccine (i. e., administered simultaneously) on day 21. Blood samples were collected from each animal, on days 0, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49; and antibody titres determined using haemagglutination inhibition assay or virus neutralisation test. FHV and FPV antibody responses in the group 3 combination administration were considered non-inferior to the responses in the group 1 CVR-only at all time points (days 28, 35, 42 and 49). However for FCV, group 3 was considered non-inferior to the responses in group 1 on days 28, 35 and 42; but not on day 49. For rabies, group 3 was only considered non-inferior to the responses in group 2 on day 49; an apparent inferiority was observed on days 28, 35 and 42. However, in all cases cats that received the combination administration seroconverted with antibody titres at a magnitude shown in other studies to be protective against virulent challenge, and also at a titre deemed adequate by the European Pharmacopeia monograph 04 / 2013 : 0451 (Rabies vaccine [inactivated] for Veterinary use). In conclusion, the data show that combining these two separate vaccines in one administration has limited impact on their ability to generate serological responses, and that these responses are still of a magnitude previously demonstrated to be protective...|$|E
