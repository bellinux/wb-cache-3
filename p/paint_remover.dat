50|$|Caustic <b>paint</b> <b>removers,</b> {{typically}} {{sodium hydroxide}} (also known as lye or caustic soda), work by {{breaking down the}} chemical bonds of the paint, usually by hydrolysis of the chain bonds of the polymers forming the <b>paint.</b> Caustic <b>removers</b> must be neutralized or the new finish will fail prematurely.

It is also an ingredient in adhesives, <b>paint</b> <b>removers,</b> typewriter correction fluids and spot removers. TCE is further used as a chemical building block to make other chemicals.

50|$|Chemicals cause from 2 to 11% of all {{burns and}} {{contribute}} {{to as many as}} 30% of burn-related deaths. Chemical burns can be caused by over 25,000 substances, most of which are either a strong base (55%) or a strong acid (26%). Most chemical burn deaths are secondary to ingestion. Common agents include: sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners, sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach, and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in <b>paint</b> <b>remover,</b> among others. Hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure. Formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells.|$|E
50|$|Butanone is an {{effective}} and common solvent and is used in processes involving gums, resins, cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose coatings and in vinyl films. For this reason it finds use {{in the manufacture of}} plastics, textiles, in the production of paraffin wax, and in household products such as lacquer, varnishes, <b>paint</b> <b>remover,</b> a denaturing agent for denatured alcohol, glues, and as a cleaning agent. It has similar solvent properties to acetone but boils at a higher temperature and has a significantly slower evaporation rate. Unlike acetone, it forms an azeotrope with water, making it useful for azeotropic distillation of moisture in certain applications. Butanone is also used in dry erase markers as the solvent of the erasable dye.|$|E

40|$|Plaster and compo {{are both}} {{materials}} used for cast architectural ornamentation. Preserving, repairing, and in-kind replacing cast architectural ornamentation {{is necessary to}} maintain the integrity of a space. Plaster and compo are visually and texturally very similar materials. Compo was invented to be a less costly substitute for plaster. Whereas the two materials are easily mistaken for one another, they are chemically quite different. The ingredients and methods used to create the two separate materials exemplify this difference. Understanding the differences is key to successfully preserving the ornaments and, thus, the spaces {{in which they are}} located. Repairing plaster with compo or compo with plaster can lead to the destruction of cast architectural ornaments. Furthermore, chemical <b>paint</b> <b>removers</b> that are safe to use on plaster can deteriorate compo.

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} answers the most {{frequently}} asked health questions (FAQs) about trichloroethylene. This information is important because TCE {{has the potential to}} cause negative health effects. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. What is trichloroethylene? Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a nonflammable, colorless liquid with a somewhat sweet odor and a sweet, burning taste. It is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts, but it is also an ingredient in adhesives, <b>paint</b> <b>removers,</b> typewriter correction fluids, and spot removers. Trichloroethylene is not thought to occur naturally in the environment. However, it has been found in underground water sources and many surface waters {{as a result of the}} manufacture, use, and disposal of the chemical. What happens to TCE when it enters the environment? • Trichloroethylene dissolves a little in water, but it can remain in ground water for a long time. • Trichloroethylene quickly evaporates from surface water, so it is commonly found as a vapo...|$|R
