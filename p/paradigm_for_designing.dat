40|$|Today, the {{dominant}} <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> congestion {{control in the}} Internet {{is based on the}} notion of TCP friendliness. To be TCP-friendly, a source must behave {{in such a way as}} to achieve a bandwidth that is similar to the bandwidth obtained by a TCP flow that would observe the same round-trip time (RTT) and the same loss rate. However, with the success of the Internet comes the deployment of an increasing number of applications that do not use TCP as a transport protocol. These applications can often improve their own performance by not being TCP-friendly, which severely penalizes TCP flows. To design new applications to be TCP-friendly is often a difficult task. The idea of the Fair Queuing (FQ) paradigm as a means to improve congestion control was first introduced by Keshav. While Keshav made a fundamental step toward a new <b>paradigm</b> <b>for</b> the <b>design</b> of congestion control protocols, he did not formalize his results so that his findings could be extended <b>for</b> the <b>design</b> of new congestion control protocols.
