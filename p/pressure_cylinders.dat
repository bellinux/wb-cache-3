Among most efficient strategies for reducing Diesel knock are modifications of engine parameters used for controlling combustion processes. This work aims at giving guidelines when controlling these processes to improve customers combustion noise perception.

We use cyclic Wiener filters allowing realistic overall Diesel noise re-synthesises from <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> signals. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> are split into elementary components, leading to different types (and patterns) of physically admissible modifications.

30|$|The {{miniaturization}} of the magnetometer {{system can}} be achieved by downsizing the magnetometer system itself and also by saving power consumption in the electrical circuit.

We assumed a titanium <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> of inner diameter 36  mm for a standard model of our magnetometer system as the goal of the miniaturization, because it is the minimum size to contain the commercially available high-capacity DD-size lithium battery, which has been commonly used in conventional seafloor systems.
