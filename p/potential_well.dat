5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E

30|$|However, the <b>potential</b> <b>wells</b> used {{in these}} works were defined by the same method as Sattinger [7] and their results were similar. Until Liu [20] firstly {{introduced}} the theory {{of a family of}} <b>potential</b> <b>wells,</b> described the structure of <b>potential</b> <b>wells</b> and the estimates of the depth of <b>potential</b> <b>wells.</b> And he firstly found the phenomenon of vacuum isolating of solutions for nonlinear evolution equations. The study of applications about a family of <b>potential</b> <b>wells</b> has attracted more and more attention [20 – 25]. For instance, Liu and Zhao [21] not only proved the global existence and nonexistence of solutions, but they also obtained the vacuum isolating of solutions of the initial boundary value problem for semilinear hyperbolic equations and parabolic equations.|$|R

For the same reason, it also serves to provide uniform semiclassical approximations near {{a turning point in}} the WKB approximation, when the potential may be locally approximated by a linear function of position.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a two {{degree of freedom}} Hamiltonian system {{constructed}} from two planar Morse potentials.

In addition, the model has an index one saddle between the <b>potential</b> <b>wells.</b> We study the dynamical mechanisms underlying transport between the two <b>potential</b> <b>wells,</b> with emphasis {{on the role of}} the flat region surrounding the wells.

25|$|Dark matter {{provides}} {{a solution to}} this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first.

25|$|The finite <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> {{problem is}} mathematically more {{complicated}} than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at {{the walls of the}} well.

25|$|Nabarro–Herring creep is {{strongly}} temperature dependent. For lattice diffusion of atoms {{to occur in}} a material, neighboring lattice sites or interstitial sites in the crystal structure must be free. A given atom must also overcome the energy barrier to move from its current site (it lies in an energetically favorable <b>potential</b> <b>well)</b> to the nearby vacant site (another <b>potential</b> <b>well).</b> The general form of the diffusion equation is D = D0exp(E/KT) where D0 has a dependence on both the attempted jump frequency {{and the number of}} nearest neighbor sites and the probability of the sites being vacant. Thus there is a double dependence upon temperature. At higher temperatures the diffusivity increases due to the direct temperature dependence of the equation, the increase in vacancies through Schottky defect formation, and an increase in the average energy of atoms in the material. Nabarro–Herring creep dominates at very high temperatures relative to a material's melting temperature.|$|E
25|$|Reaching Mercury from Earth poses {{significant}} technical challenges, {{because the}} planet orbits so {{much closer to}} the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun’s gravitational <b>potential</b> <b>well.</b> Starting from the Earth’s orbital speed of 30km/s, the change in velocity (delta-v) the spacecraft must make to enter into a Hohmann transfer orbit that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun's <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> becomes kinetic energy; requiring another large delta-v to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, Mariner 10 and MESSENGER, both by NASA, have visited Mercury so far.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s several {{investigations}} studied polyhedral magnetic fields {{as a possibility}} to confine a fusion plasma. The first proposal to combine this configuration with an electrostatic <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> {{in order to improve}} electron confinement was made by Oleg Lavrentiev in 1975. The idea was picked up by Robert Bussard in 1983. His 1989 patent application cited Lavrentiev, although in 2006 he appears to claim to have (re)discovered the idea independently.|$|E
25|$|The Klein paradox, {{discovered}} by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further quantum mechanical {{objections to the}} notion of an electron confined within a nucleus. Derived from the Dirac equation, this clear and precise paradox showed that a high-energy electron approaching a potential barrier has a high probability of passing through the barrier, or escaping, by transforming to a particle of negative mass. Apparently, an electron could not be confined within a nucleus by any <b>potential</b> <b>well.</b> The meaning of this paradox was intensely debated at the time.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{specifically}} in quantum mechanics, a coherent {{state is the}} specific quantum state of the quantum harmonic oscillator, often described as a state which has dynamics most closely resembling the oscillatory behavior of a classical harmonic oscillator. It was the first example of quantum dynamics when Erwin Schrödinger derived it in 1926, while searching for solutions of the Schrödinger equation that satisfy the correspondence principle. The quantum harmonic oscillator and hence, the coherent states, arise in the quantum theory {{of a wide range}} of physical systems. For instance, a coherent state describes the oscillating motion of a particle confined in a quadratic <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> (for an early reference, see e.g.|$|E

25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led to complex post hoc distortions of {{the shape of the}} <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> to fit experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real nuclei. Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point {{energy is}} {{fundamentally}} {{related to the}} Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative {{at a point in}} space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the <b>potential</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the above}} models, the nucleons may occupy orbitals in pairs, due to being fermions, which allows to explain even/odd Z and N effects {{well-known}} from experiments. The exact nature and capacity of nuclear shells differs {{from those of}} electrons in atomic orbitals, primarily because the <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> in which the nucleons move (especially in larger nuclei) {{is quite different from}} the central electromagnetic <b>potential</b> <b>well</b> which binds electrons in atoms. Some resemblance to atomic orbital models may be seen in a small atomic nucleus like that of helium-4, in which the two protons and two neutrons separately occupy 1s orbitals analogous to the 1s orbital for the two electrons in the helium atom, and achieve unusual stability for the same reason. Nuclei with 5 nucleons are all extremely unstable and short-lived, yet, helium-3, with 3 nucleons, is very stable even with lack of a closed 1s orbital shell. Another nucleus with 3 nucleons, the triton hydrogen-3 is unstable and will decay into helium-3 when isolated. Weak nuclear stability with 2 nucleons {NP} in the 1s orbital is found in the deuteron hydrogen-2, with only one nucleon in each of the proton and neutron potential wells. While each nucleon is a fermion, the {NP} deuteron is a boson and thus does not follow Pauli Exclusion for close packing within shells. Lithium-6 with 6 nucleons is highly stable without a closed second 1p shell orbital. For light nuclei with total nucleon numbers 1 to 6 only those with 5 do not show some evidence of stability. Observations of beta-stability of light nuclei outside closed shells indicate that nuclear stability is much more complex than simple closure of shell orbitals with magic numbers of protons and neutrons.|$|E
