In 1978, {{a national survey}} of 1,049 married {{women between the ages of}} 68 and 78 were interviewed between the months of March and July in order to investigate low fertility during the 1920s and 1930s and the women of childbearing age during those decades. In addition to the general purpose, the study was designed to gather information to test specific hypotheses concerning demographic and socioeconomic differentials in fertility, the prevalence of contraceptive practice and the methods employed, the extent to which subfecundity and sterility may have contributed to low fertility, and the timing patterns and childbearing pace of the time. The interview collected information on each respondent's family planning, contraception usage, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history,</b> fecundity, infertility, fertility, and maternal and infant health.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of planned pregnancies {{has long been}} a goal of women’s reproductive health researchers and advocates within the United States. However, almost half (49 %) of all pregnancies in the U. S. are unintended (Finer and Henshaw, 2006). The goal of this research is to increase understanding of intentionality, from expanding upon established antecedents of pregnancy intention to examining the effect of pregnancy intention on the utilization and evaluation of reproductive health services. The first study examined the relationship between pregnancy intention and satisfaction with prenatal and hospital-based labor and delivery care. Results revealed that women with unwanted pregnancies {{were more likely to report}} lower satisfaction with their prenatal care provider, their provider’s communication skills, and with their perceived sense of control during labor and delivery. The second study examined the potential for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> as an antecedent of pregnancy intention in a nationally representative sample of women ages 15 - 44. Separate analyses were further conducted to examine if these hypothesized relationships changed as women aged. <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>history,</b> in particular a history of prior unwanted pregnancy, was found to be significantly associated with an increased likelihood of subsequent unintended pregnancies. Conversely, women with a history of younger age at first pregnancy and/or pregnancy loss were less likely to report their pregnancies as unintended. When analyzed separately by age group, the relationship between <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> and pregnancy intention were generally strongest for women ages 30 - 44. The final study tested the relationship between pregnancy intention, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history,</b> and the utilization of pregnancy prevention services, specifically utilization of contraception during the interval between pregnancies and the election of post-pregnancy tubal sterilization. <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> was found to be significantly associated with the contraceptive use. Women who first became pregnant before age 30 were more likely to utilize contraception in the pregnancy interval, while a history of both unwanted pregnancy and pregnancy loss were negatively associated with this outcome. The relationship between <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history,</b> pregnancy intention, and the evaluation and utilization of reproductive health services, further complicated by influence of age, supports the view of intentionality as a complex and potentially influential construct...|$|E

Objective: We investigated how systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) values and the presence of severe SPAP relate to gender, menopausal status, and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> in SPAH patients. Methods: Seventy-nine patients diagnosed with SPAH from 2000 to 2009 were assessed and 66 were enrolled in the study. Information about age, menopausal status, pregnancy, echocardiography-derived SPAP, and invasive mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was collected from medical records. The relation between values of SPAP and mPAP and their agreement for severe disease were assessed.

Results: Moderate correlation and good agreement for severe disease were found between mPAP and SPAP. Mean SPAP values were similar for men and women. A trend toward higher values of SPAP was found for non-menopausal women compared to men.

Data were available from a study of female radiographers. Analyses were carried out on 3053 women with a total of 6993 pregnancies. Women reporting problems with conception or previous fetal losses had an increased risk of a pregnancy ending in a fetal death. In particular, women with primary or secondary infertility had an approximately fourfold increase in risk compared with women who reported no difficulties [odds ratio (OR) : 3. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : (3. 02, 5. 07) ]. This relationship was independent of pregnancy order and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> and was more marked in older maternal ages. The effect of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> was cumulative and possibly multiplicative in effect, with a threefold increase in the risk of losing a third pregnancy following two previous losses [OR: 3. 19; 95 % CI: (1. 60, 6. 35) ].

We implemented RMM in two phases, and conducted an independent evaluation of phase one after 21 months of implementation. We present results of the phase two validation that covers the full project time span, and compare the results {{to those of the}} phase one validation. We assessed the completeness of the counts of births and deaths and the accuracy of disaggregated U 5 MR from the community-based method against a retrospective full <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history</b> for rolling twelve-month periods after the independent evaluation. We used full pregnancy histories collected through household interviews carried out between November 2013 and January 2014 as the validation data source. Health Surveillance Agents (HSAs) across the 160 catchment areas submitted routine reports on pregnancies, births, and deaths consistently. However, for the 15 -month implementation period post-evaluation, average completeness of birth event reporting was 76 %, whereas average completeness of death event reporting was 67 % relative to that expected from a comparable <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history.</b> HSAs underestimated the U 5 MR by an average of 21 % relative to that estimated from a comparable <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history.</b> On a medium scale, the community-based RMM method in Malawi produced substantial underestimates of annualized U 5 MR relative to those obtained from a full <b>pregnancy</b> <b>history,</b> despite the additional incentives and quality-control activities.
