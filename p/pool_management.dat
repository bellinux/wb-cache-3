The second traditional scheme for common <b>pool</b> resource <b>management</b> is privatization, in which resources are tangibly divided and exclusively managed and consumed by individual entities.

OASIS not only inherents two features from COPE, opportunistic listening and opportunistic coding, but also introduces a new one, opportunistic information dissemination, which aggressively encodes as many packets as possible even if packets {{are not going}} to be received by their next hops. In addition, we point out that packet <b>pool</b> <b>managements</b> and packet information exchanges are critical in the implementation. Simulation results show that OASIS has network throughput about 1. 4 times of traditional unicast forwarding, and the improvement is about 1. 2 times of the improvement achieved by COPE.

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} suggests that ethnic interactions damage cooperation {{in the provision of}} public goods, yet very few studies of collective action in common <b>pool</b> resource <b>management</b> have found strong evidence for the effects of ethnic diversity. Research on both public goods and common <b>pool</b> resource <b>management</b> that does find negative ethnic effects on cooperation tend to ignore the importance of interethnic relationships, particularly ethnic inequality, stratification, or dominance. This study presents data from agricultural villages in Tamil Nadu&# 039;s Palani Hills to test the importance of a range of ethnic effects using caste interactions in a traditional irrigation system. I provide corroborating evidence of a negative cooperative effect of ethnic diversity, but also demonstrate that factors of ethnic dominance such as hierarchical stratification and demographic dominance strongly determine outcomes in collective irrigation management. I argue that the most important measure of equity, irrigation access, is socially, technologically, and institutionally embedded, and demonstrate that the distribution of irrigation channels is explained by measures of inequality, such as wealth inequality, Dalit status, and demographic dominance...|$|R

50|$|SYMPHONY is a {{callable}} library which implements both sequential {{and parallel}} versions of branch, cut and price to solve MILPs. A branch, cut and price algorithm {{is similar to}} a branch and bound algorithm but additionally includes cutting-plane methods and pricing algorithms. The user of the library can customize the algorithm in any number of ways by supplying application-specific subroutines for reading in custom data files, generating application-specific cutting planes, or applying custom branching rules, resulting in a customized branch and cut algorithm. Most components of the algorithm, e.g., search tree management, management of linear programming solution, cut <b>pool</b> <b>management,</b> and communication management, are internal to the library and need not be touched by the user. The executables can be built in any number of configurations ranging from completely sequential to fully parallel with independently functioning cut generators, cut pools, and LP solvers. The distributed version currently runs in any environment supported by the PVM message passing protocol. The same source code can also be compiled for shared-memory architectures using any OpenMP compliant compiler.|$|E

A Monte Carlo simulation to simulate the impact on risk and expected losses on the number of insurance policies sold is implemented with the use of simulation software.
