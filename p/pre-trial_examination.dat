2500|$|Traditionally, the {{allegedly}} afflicted {{girls are}} said to have been entertained by Parris' slave, Tituba. (She supposedly taught them about voodoo in the parsonage kitchen in early 1692, although there is no contemporary evidence to support this.) A variety of secondary sources, starting with Charles W. Upham in the 19th century, typically relate that a circle of the girls, with Tituba's help, tried their hands at fortune telling. They used the white of an egg and a mirror to create a primitive crystal ball to divine the professions of their future spouses and scared one another when one supposedly saw the shape of a coffin instead. The story is drawn from John Hale's book about the trials, but in his account, only one of the girls, not a group of them, had confessed to him afterward that she had once tried this. Hale did not mention Tituba as having any part of it, nor did he identify when the incident took place. But the record of Tituba's <b>pre-trial</b> <b>examination</b> holds her giving an energetic confession, speaking before the court of [...] "creatures who inhabit the invisible world," [...] and [...] "the dark rituals which bind them together in service of Satan", implicating both Good and Osborne while asserting that [...] "many other people in the colony were engaged in the devil's conspiracy against the Bay." ...|$|E
50|$|Prior to trial, most {{proceedings}} in non-criminal {{courts are}} conducted via papers {{filed in the}} court, often through lawyers. In limited jurisdiction courts, {{it is not uncommon}} for an initial appearance to be made in person at which a settlement is often reached. In general jurisdiction state courts, {{it is not uncommon for}} all pre-trial matters to be conducted outside the court, with attorneys negotiating scheduling matters, <b>pre-trial</b> <b>examinations</b> of witnesses taking place in lawyer's office through depositions, and a settlement conference conducted by a private mediator at the mediator's office.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elicit the pathogenetic response of Hygrophila spinosa in homoeopathic potencies on healthy human volunteers. Methodology: The drug Hygrophila spinosa was proved by the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) through randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled method. The proving was conducted at three centres viz. Central Research Institute (H), [CRI (H) ] Noida, Drug Proving Unit [DPU], Bhubaneswar and Regional Research Institute (H) [RRI (H) ], Kolkata. The drug was proved in two potencies (6 C and 30 C) on 48 apparently healthy volunteers who were selected after conducting <b>pre-trial</b> medical <b>examinations</b> by the medical specialists and routine laboratory investigations. 32 of them where kept on interventional drug trial and remaining took placebo. At CRI (H), NOIDA, 56 dose schedule (i. e. 56 doses of drug/placebo were consumed in each batch) was followed while at DPU, Bhubaneswar and at RRI (H), Kolkata, 12 dose schedule (i. e. 12 doses of drug/placebo were to be consumed in each batch) was followed. The symptoms generated during the trial period were noted by the volunteers and elaborated by the Proving Masters which were compiled at Homoeopathic Drug Proving-cum-Data Processing cell of CCRH headquarters after decoding. Results: Out of 32 provers who were on interventional drug trial, only 14 manifested symptoms. The drug was able to produce symptoms in both the potencies. 92 symptoms appeared during the drug trial from various locations. Conclusion: The drug pathogenesis evolved indicates its therapeutic use for urticaria, frontal sinusitis, conjunctivitis, stomatitis, gastroenteritis, nausea (morning sickness), intermittent fever etc...|$|R
