50|$|There are {{specific}} types of <b>palletizers</b> including the row-forming which were introduced in the early 1950s.

40|$|Abstract — Modern {{palletizing}} {{systems are}} designed mainly for performance and flexibility. In today’s competitive scenario, {{the cost of}} palletizing system,its installation lead time and its proper integration with material transport system present inside the plant are the factors of major concern for any industrial engineer. At {{the same time the}} system he designs, should be flexible enough to accommodate some basic anticipated changes with minimum setup time. Industrial Robots and Automated Inline <b>Palletizers</b> are widely used in industries for the palletizing operation. But neither of these provides a complete solution. Eg Automated Inline <b>Palletizers</b> are fast enough but cannot handle situations involving 1. drastic changes in carton sizes and 2. different pallet layer configurations. It is because of lack of programmability. On the contrary, robots are programmable but consumes programming downtime. The present paper proposes a model of an entire palletizing cell which is not only cost effective, but also flexible enough to accommodate frequent changes in sizes of cartons with almost negligible setup time and therefore negligible downtime. The paper describes the schematic configuration of proposed model as well as it explains how this model conquers the limitations of present available palletizing facilities mentioned above...|$|R

50|$|While {{directing}} the U.S. Naval Ordnance Materials Handling Laboratory at the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot, Hingham, Massachusetts during World War II, Cahners started a newsletter called The <b>Palletizer,</b> taking {{its name from}} the pallet, then a relatively new technology used to move goods on and off ships and around bases. Cahner was an important technical contributor to the nascent field of materials handling, inventing and patenting a 'four-way pallet' which became the military and later industry standard.

40|$|Abstract—This article {{presents}} a newly developed robotized <b>palletizer</b> control configuration {{consisting of a}} graphical application running on a human-machine interface (HMI) touch screens, a PLC program, and a servo system that executes <b>palletizer</b> reconfiguration and makes high-speed robotic palletizing possible. The servo system of the <b>palletizer</b> allows the PLC to reconfigure the <b>palletizer</b> automatically, based on the configuration data, and to control the product feed to the robots that execute the palletizing function. This allows the robots to handle several boxes {{at a time and}} therefore achieve high-speed palletizing. Significant downtime reduction during batch changes is achieved due to simplification of operator tasks, which makes the configuration and control method ideally suitable for production environments with frequent batch changes. Packaging and materials handling industries may be financially benefited using this configuration and control method. These include low <b>palletizer</b> downtime, high <b>palletizer</b> throughput, low training costs, no rework due to configuration errors and wider availability of potential operators...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{of a typical}} high-speed robotic palletizing process involving two robots using queuing theory {{with the aim of}} providing design guidelines of such a system for dynamic material flows. Under this concept, the two robots are integrated into packaging process by pre-positioning the quickly moving cartons as materials flow on the conveyor, and the specific patterns are formed at a <b>palletizer</b> that is usually located {{at the end of the}} production line. The <b>palletizer</b> stocks the patterned materials on the pallet for delivery or storage. This type of machine is becoming the dominant paradigm in the modern highspeed material handling industries, although its existing design seldom takes the material flow property into consideration. The entire palletizing process is modeled as a One Job-Two Machine model with the queuing theory, and both the stochastic features of arrival and service processes are extracted from the production process using the operational parameters. The established model offers scientific insight into such a highspeed palletizing system. With the theoretical prediction of the performance calculated from this mathematic model, main working parameters can be determined and the design of high-speed palletizing system can be optimized to successfully handle various types of dynamic material flows...|$|E

Sawyer linear stepper motor is chosen because of its high reliability and high position accuracy without any feedback. As a result, a highly flexible <b>palletizer</b> is built using Sawyer linear motor. The stepper motor driver {{is replaced by a}} digital servo motor driver using power amplifier with digital signal processing electronics.

40|$|Plastic {{beverage}} containers {{are often}} {{produced by the}} blow molding of preforms made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) resin. As the bottles leave the blow molding machines, they are conveyed to a <b>palletizer</b> to be stacked for storage. During this conveying, bottles sometimes stick together causing backups or jams. This study attempted to determine if common processing parameters cause changes in the surface tension of the polymer. Initially, several contact angle techniques were tested to determine the optimal technique {{to be used for}} the remaining experiments. From these initial tests, the Harmonic Mean method was selected to determine the surface tension of the polymers. Flat parts were injection molded from both copolymer and homopolymer resins and aged at room temperature and humidity for two months. The surface tension of these parts was measured during several intervals throughout this storage time. The surface tensions of both materials dropped slightly for the first week of storage before leveling off to 44 - 47 ii dynes/cm. Varying the injection molding conditions did not seem to cause the surface tension to change drastically. Some additional materials were aged for three weeks a...|$|E

Robotic simulation is used to visualize entire robotic application system, to simulate the movement of robot arm incorporated with components consist in its environment and to detect collision between the robot and components. This paper presents result of a project in implementing a computer based model to simulate Okura A 1600 <b>palletizer</b> robot. The application uses Okura A 1600 robot for palletizing bags {{at the end of}} the production line and focuses on pick-and-place application.

The project simulates the robot?s first four joints, namely as the Waist, Shoulder, Elbow and Waist and focuses on the position of the robot?s end effector, regardless its orientation. Development of the model is using Workspace 5 as a simulation tool. Two types of methodology are used, which are the methodology for developing the robotic workcell simulation model and the methodology for executing the robotic simulation. The output of the project will be a three-dimensional view of robot arm movement based on series of predefined Geometry Points, layout checking and robot?s reachability by generating working envelope, collision and near miss detection, and monitoring on the cycle time upon completing a task.
