5|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} member Big Ten {{institutions}} will return at least 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> offensive production during the 2009–10 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, unless underclassmen declare for the 2009 NBA Draft.

The Buckeyes could return 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> scoring contingent next season. All five first-team All-Conference honorees were sophomores and are all projected to return as juniors. Overall, the Big Ten could return 80.5 percent of its offensive production from 2008 to 2009, and no team should lose {{more than half of}} its total scoring unit next year.|$|E

5|$|By 1961, workers' basic wages {{had risen}} {{to an average of}} about 73 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> total {{earnings}}; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earnings as their basic wage. There was also a reduction in the overall level of quota overfulfillment—with quotas raised, many could not meet their own personal quota. The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E

5|$|A {{major change}} {{was made in}} the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> normal earnings.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair.

Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment to swing back to the right.

50|$|The 1971 census {{revealed}} {{that there were}} 616,700 farms in Haiti, and that an average holding of 1.4 hectares consisted of several plots of less than 1 hectare. Haitians, however, most commonly measured their land by the common standard, a carreau, equal to about 1.3 hectares, or 3.2 acres. The survey concluded that the largest farms made up only 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> {{the total number of}} farms and that they comprised less than 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the total land. It also documented that 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> farmers owned <b>their</b> land, although some lacked official title to it. Twenty-eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> all farmers rented and sharecropped land. Only a small percentage of farms belonged to cooperatives.

Denmark {{evacuated}} nearly all its Jews to nearby, neutral Sweden; the Danish resistance movement, {{with the assistance of}} many Danish citizens, evacuated 7,220 of the country's 7,800 Jews by sea to Sweden in vessels ranging from fishing boats to private yachts. The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's Jewish population to avoid capture by the Nazis.

The bill requires that 50 percent of automobiles made in 2014, 80 percent in 2016, and 95 percent in 2017, would be manufactured and warranted to operate on non-petroleum-based fuels, which includes existing technologies such as flex-fuel, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, plug-in electric and fuel cell.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
5|$|In the wilderness, males seldom {{live longer}} than 10 to 14 years, as {{injuries}} sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can live more than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and {{a small number of}} adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are active primarily at night (nocturnal), although sometimes at twilight (crepuscular).|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E
