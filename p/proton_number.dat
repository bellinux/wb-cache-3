5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (<b>proton</b> <b>number</b> is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the <b>proton</b> <b>number</b> past 118, but that also greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its <b>proton</b> <b>number</b> of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|A filled shell {{would have}} [...] "magic numbers" [...] of {{neutrons}} and protons. This {{idea of a}} magic number derives from the counterpart of electron shells.

One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126– which would mean that the most stable spherical nuclides would be flerovium-298, unbinilium-304 and unbihexium-310.

Combined with UV-vis absorption analysis, {{it was found}} the co-adsorbents got to bind with TiO 2 more and more easily by increasing <b>proton</b> <b>numbers,</b> which in turn made dye loading amount get smaller and smaller. The as-prepared photoanodes were fabricated into solar cells, yielding impressively enhanced short-circuit current and cell efficiency except PPA which decreased the dye loading amount dramatically. The enhancement of charge recombination resistance and electron lifetime analyzed from EIS results revealed that the more prominent photovoltaic performance improvement with fewer protons was resulted by the more efficient inhibition of recombination between electrons in the conduction band of TiO 2 and the oxidized species in the electrolyte. Besides, regarding from the charge transport resistance, fewer protons are favorable for the negative shift of the conduction band level of TiO 2 and thus larger open-circuit yielding.
