60|$|For {{many days}} {{my mind was}} an empty husk, yet in a {{constant}} torment of longing, daydream, despair, and self-reproaches. Everything I looked at had but one meaning--that she was not there. I did not dare to admit into my heart a hope of the future, since it would be treason to the absent. There was an ecstatic mournfulness even {{in the sight of}} the January sun, the greening fields, the first scarcely <b>perceptible</b> <b>signals</b> of a new year. And when one morning I awoke early and heard, still half in dream, a thrush in all but darkness singing of spring, it seemed it was a voice pealing in the empty courts of paradise. What ridiculous care I took to conceal my misery from Mrs Bowater. Hardly a morning passed but that I carried out in a bag the food I couldn't eat the day before, to hide it away or bury it. But such journeys were brief.|$|E
40|$|System {{and method}} for visual and audible {{communication}} between a central operator and N mobile communicators (N {{greater than or}} equal to 2), including an operator transceiver and interface, configured to receive and display, for the operator, visually perceptible and audibly <b>perceptible</b> <b>signals</b> from each of the mobile communicators. The interface (1) presents an audible signal from each communicator as if the audible signal is received from a different location relative to the operator and (2) allows the operator to select, to assign priority to, and to display, the visual signals and the audible signals received from a specified communicator. Each communicator has an associated signal transmitter that is configured to transmit at least one of the visual signals and the audio signal associated with the communicator, where at least one of the signal transmitters includes at least one sensor that senses and transmits a sensor value representing a selected environmental or physiological parameter associated with the communicator...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of our {{research}} works related {{to the study of}} thick-film multiwall carbon nanotube/tin oxide nanocomposite sensors of propylene glycol (PG), dimethylformamide (DMF) and formaldehyde (FA) vapors derived using hydrothermal synthesis and sol-gel methods. Investigations of response/recovery characteristics in the 50 - 300 oC operating temperature range reveal that the optimal operating temperature for PG, DMF and FA vapor sensors, taking into account both high response and acceptable response and recovery times, are about 200 and 220 oC, respectively. A sensor response dependence on gas concentration in all cases is linear. The minimal propylene glycol and dimethylformamide gas concentrations at which the <b>perceptible</b> <b>signal</b> was registered by us were 13 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe core {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to introduce a general neat scheme based on soft vector clustering for the dithering of multidimensional signals that works in any space of arbitrary dimensionality, on arbitrary number and distribution of quantization centroids, and with a computable and controllable quantization noise. Dithering upon the digitization of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional signals disperses the quantization noise over the frequency domain which renders it less <b>perceptible</b> by <b>signal</b> processing systems including the human cognitive ones, so it has a very beneficial impact on vital domains such as communications, control, machine-learning, etc. Our extensive surveys have concluded that the published literature is missing such a neat dithering scheme. It is very desirable and insightful to visualize the behavior of our multidimensional dithering scheme; especially the dispersion of quantization noise over the frequency domain. In general, such visualization would be quite hard to achieve and perceive by the reader unless the target multidimensional signal itself is directly perceivable by humans. So, we chose to apply our multidimensional dithering scheme upon encoding true-color images – that are 3 D signals – with palettes of limited sets of colors to show how it minimizes the visual distortions – esp. contouring effect – in the encoded images...|$|R
40|$|How are meanings, of {{expressions}} in {{a natural}} human language, related to concepts? And how is semantic composition related to conceptual composition? I assume that concepts are mental symbols that can be combined in certain ways (see, e. g., Fodor [1975, 1986, 2003]), and that children lexicalize concepts in acquiring a language (see, e. g., Bloom [2000]). 1 Many concepts, which can be constituents of thoughts, are somehow indicated with words that can be constituents of sentences. But this assumption is compatible with many hypotheses about the concepts lexicalized, linguistic meanings, and the relevant forms of composition. One familiar suggestion is that lexical items simply label the concepts they lexicalize, and that composition of lexical meanings mirrors composition of the labeled concepts, which exhibit diverse adicities. This makes it tempting to say that names label singular concepts— mental tags for particular things—which can saturate the concepts labeled with verbs, where these predicative (unsaturated) concepts may be monadic or polyadic. As we’ll see, while the adicities of lexicalized concepts are not obvious, {{there are many ways}} of developing the familiar suggestion in detail. But attending to these details invites an alternative proposal according to which (i) lexicalization is a more creative process in which available concepts are used to introduce formally distinct concepts that are uniformly monadic, and (ii) phrases signify conjunction of monadic concepts, as opposed to saturation of one concept by another. From this perspective, semantic composition is rooted in a conjunctive operation that may be available to other animals, but lexicalization is {{not simply a matter of}} pairing concepts with <b>perceptible</b> <b>signals</b> (and/or certain grammatical information). This proposal may initially seem odd. But perhaps it should be our null hypothesis, given that young humans have a distinctive talent for lexicalization. ...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{speed limits}} {{are part of}} the latest traffic {{management}} pilot program in the Netherlands in order to adjust real-time driver speed to the circumstances of the road condition. The general objective of this literature review is to understand the effectiveness of dynamic speed limits in terms of perception, as little is yet known how people perceive changes in dynamic speed limits in relation to prevailing road conditions. Dynamic speed limits are displayed on information carriers with the intention to change the drivers’ speed. A number of previous studies on change detection, such as Rensink (2002 a), have shown that ‘under a wide variety of conditions we can be amazingly blind to changes, failing to see them even when they are large, repeatedly made and anticipated’. This phenomenon has been reverted to in literature as change blindness (Rensink, 2002 a). Dynamic speed limits displayed on information carriers compete {{with a wide variety of}} other types of information as previous studies have shown the human information-processing system is limited in its ability to deal with the amount of information displayed (Wickens et al., 2004). Dynamic speed limits are considered road information. They are intended to inform drivers about the status of the road and the goal is that drivers should adapt to them in real-time. In this paper a framework is suggested to help researchers distinguish between route information, road information, road user information and driving unrelated information. This literature review shows that information especially prone to change blindness, is information that lacks <b>perceptible</b> transient motion <b>signals</b> when changing (e. g. due to masking or gradual change), is not relevant for the task at hand, or violates expectations about objects of significance for performing the task at hand. Both transient motion signals attracting attention, as well as the task at hand, influence the visual search needed to build an internal representation of the environment. Based on the current literature review, it can be concluded that detection of changes in dynamic speed limits will suffer from gap-contingency masking and changes in semantic identity. It remains unclear whether repetition of successive information carriers will reduce the chance of detection of changes in dynamic speed limits. Detection of these changes might be increased as they are necessary to maintain an appropriate speed; this is part of the driving task. In conclusion, some drivers will not detect changes in dynamic speed limits, but it remains unclear to what extent this will be the case. Subsequent research should establish the extent of the change blindness effect and whether it can be reduced to increase situation awareness and the effects of dynamic traffic management...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of an approach to concatenative speech synthesis using the Titne-Domain Pitch-Synchronous OverLap-Add (I'D-PSOLA) signal processing algorithm. Concatenative synthesis systems make use of pre-recorded speech segments stored in a speech corpus. At synthesis time, the `best' segments available to synthesise the new utterances are chosen from the corpus using {{a process known as}} unit selection. During the synthesis process, the pitch and duration of these segments may be modified to generate the desired prosody. The TD-PSOLA algorithm provides an efficient and essentially successful solution to perform these modifications, although some perceptible distortion, in the form of `buzzyness', may be introduced into the speech signal. Despite the popularity of the TD-PSOLA algorithm, little formal research has been undertaken to address this recognised problem of distortion. The approach in the thesis has been developed towards reducing the perceived distortion that is introduced when TD-PSOLA is applied to speech. To investigate the occurrence of this distortion, a psychoacoustic evaluation of the effect of pitch modification using the TD-PSOLA algorithm is presented. Subjective experiments {{in the form of a}} set of listening tests were undertaken using word-level stimuli that had been manipulated using TD-PSOLA. The data collected from these experiments were analysed for patterns of co- occurrence or correlations to investigate where this distortion may occur. From this, parameters were identified which may have contributed to increased distortion. These parameters were concerned with the relationship between the spectral content of individual phonemes, the extent of pitch manipulation, and aspects of the original recordings. Based on these results, a framework was designed for use in conjunction with TD-PSOLA to minimise the possible causes of distortion. The framework consisted of a novel speech corpus design, a signal processing distortion measure, and a selection process for especially problematic phonemes. Rather than phonetically balanced, the corpus is balanced to the needs of the signal processing algorithm, containing more of the adversely affected phonemes. The aim is to reduce the potential extent of pitch modification of such segments, and hence produce synthetic speech with less <b>perceptible</b> distortion. The <b>signal</b> processingdistortion measure was developed to allow the prediction of perceptible distortion in pitch-modified speech. Different weightings were estimated for individual phonemes,trained using the experimental data collected during the listening tests. The potential benefit of such a measure for existing unit selection processes in a corpus-based system using TD-PSOLA is illustrated. Finally, the special-case selection process was developed for highly problematic voiced fricative phonemes to minimise the occurrence of perceived distortion in these segments. The success of the framework, in terms of generating synthetic speech with reduced distortion, was evaluated. A listening test showed that the TD-PSOLA balanced speech corpus may be capable of generating pitch-modified synthetic sentences with significantly less distortion than those generated using a typical phonetically balanced corpus. The voiced fricative selection process was also shown to produce pitch-modified versions of these phonemes with less perceived distortion than a standard selection process. The listening test then indicated that the signal processing distortion measure was able to predict the resulting amount of distortion at the sentence-level after the application of TD-PSOLA, suggesting that it may be beneficial to include such a measure in existing unit selection processes. The framework was found to be capable of producing speech with reduced perceptible distortion in certain situations, although the effects seen at the sentence-level were less than those seen in the previous investigative experiments that made use of word-level stimuli. This suggeststhat the effect of the TD-PSOLA algorithm cannot always be easily anticipated due to the highly dynamic nature of speech, and that the reduction of perceptible distortion in TD-PSOLA-modified speech remains a challenge to the speech community. ...|$|R
