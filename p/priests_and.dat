Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> deacons, {{as long as they were}} married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E

5|$|East Timorese animist {{belief systems}} {{did not fit}} with Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity.

5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara.
