40|$|Research {{data for}} this paper is {{available}} on request from Steve Rothberg (s. j. rothberg@lboro. ac. uk). A new laser Doppler vibrometry scanning head is proposed based on a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> optical <b>wedges.</b> A comprehensive mathematical model is developed and used to demonstrate how the wedges can be configured to scan point-by-point, in a line, in a circle, and in {{a combination of the}} two such that a straight line scan could be performed on a structure during rotation. Inevitable misalignments are incorporated into the model and considered quantitatively for the circular tracking application. Certain advantages are apparent over systems based on dual mirrors and a Dove prism in terms of lower apparent velocities at low rotation orders. A scanning head design for the circular tracking application is presented, together with experimental data showing good agreement between predicted and measured apparent velocities caused by misalignments...|$|R

40|$|The {{visual field}} map is {{produced}} by mapping the active voxels of the visual cortex to a circular region corresponding to the points of the circular image. Activation of the voxels is determined by matching the fMRI time series to a time series based on a complex visual stimulus consisting <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> and rings expanding from the center to the boundary of the disk. Each scan (pre-surgical, post-surgical) produces {{a different set of}} points due to due to noise in the fMRI response to the visual target, hemodynamic variability and variability in the position of the head between scans and. A spatial-temporal non-homogeneous Poisson process is used to model the density of the active voxels. The differential density of the voxels reflects the differences in density of the optical sensors in the retina from the center to the periphery. Two types of changes may occur post-surgery: (1) thinning of the response or (2) actual “holes ” in the visual response. Using data obtained from healthy patients, surgery was simulated with full scans as well as known masks (18 o to 90 o wedges) as well as randomly thinned areas (180 o and 360 o), we examined the sensitivity and specificity of different spatial methods for identifying pre-post surgical changes: (1) nearest neighbor, (2) emptiness measures, (3) spatial intensity measures and (4) goodness of fit to an empirical mode...|$|R

This is used to show how certain atmospheric conditions can lead to commonly observed forest fire behavior. Using short line fires, simu-lations show that with moderate winds, the fire line inter-acts with the updraft ahead of it causing the fire line to curve forward into a conical shape. Other experiments show that when ambient winds change with height, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> updrafts at the curved fire front can touch down within the fire and break up the fire line. We also demonstrate 'dynamic fingering', in which the rotating columns near the fire front intensify to tornado strength and can result in rapid and strong increases in the fire spread rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{behavior}} of a vortex generated between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> cylinders in a freestream is investigated using a three-dimensional numerical simulation. The cylinders are coaxially arranged with their axes normal to the flow. By changing the freestream velocity while keeping the <b>rotating</b> speed <b>of</b> the cylinders constant, {{it is found that}} the state of the vortex can be classified into three patterns. When the freestream velocity is small, the vortex is bent and stretched in the direction oblique to the freestream. The mechanism that allows the vortex between the two cylinders to stay at the same position without being washed away by the freestream is presented. It is also shown that with the increase in the freestream velocity, the circulation of the vortex decreases until the circulation becomes zero and the vortex is split into two. ...|$|R

50|$|Whenever possible, astronomers will {{schedule}} {{their observations}} around {{the times of}} culmination, when celestial objects are highest in the sky. Likewise, sailors will not shoot a star below 20° above the horizon. If observations of objects near the horizon cannot be avoided, {{it is possible to}} equip an optical telescope with control systems to compensate for the shift caused by the refraction. If the dispersion is also a problem (in case of broadband high-resolution observations), atmospheric refraction correctors (made from <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> glass prisms) can be employed as well. Since the amount of atmospheric refraction {{is a function of the}} temperature gradient, temperature, pressure, and humidity (the amount of water vapor, which is especially important at mid-infrared wavelengths), the amount of effort needed for a successful compensation can be prohibitive. Surveyors, on the other hand, will often schedule their observations in the afternoon, when the magnitude of refraction is minimum.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} pitch/yawchannels {{autopilot}} for a 155 mm dual-spin canard-guided projectile at one single operating point, using a signal-based H-infinity control method. The proposed concept is composed of a course correction fuse which incorporates the trajectory correction modules and two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> canards. This fuse is nosemounted and roll-decoupled from the aft part which contains the payload and is rapidly-spinning in order to provide the projectile airframe with gyroscopic dynamic stability. Complete and exact nonlinear and linearized dynamics are given and extended to consider parametric uncertainties. A 1 DoF H-infinity controller of fixed order and fixed structure is synthesized, for which the actual sensor position is taken into account, closed-loop performance is optimized and the lowest possible complexity is sought. This controller is then compared to a 1 DoF full order H-infinity controller. Finally, robust stability is assessed using structured singular value and Monte Carlo analyses...|$|R

We adopt a slight deviation from the Fractal Spacetime of Matos-Tajmar with fractionary Dimensions because in the formalism of General Relativity {{it is difficult to}} conceive a Einstein Tensor with fractionary Dimensions(fractionary scripts).

40|$|Shape {{perception}} {{is important for}} object recognition. However, behavioral {{studies have shown that}} rigid motion also contributes directly to the recognition process, in addition to providing visual cues to shape. Using psychophysics and functional brain imaging, we investigated the neural mechanisms involved in shape and motion processing for dynamic object recognition. Observers discriminated between <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotating</b> novel objects in which the 3 -dimensional shape difference between the pair was systematically varied in metric steps. In addition, the objects rotated in either the same or the different direction to determine the effect of task-irrelevant motion on behavior and neural activity. We found that observers' shape discrimination performance increased systematically with shape differences, as did the hemodynamic responses of occipitotemporal, parietal, and frontal regions. Furthermore, responses in occipital regions were only correlated with observers' perceived shape differences. We also found different effects of object motion on shape discrimination across observers, which were reflected in responses of the superior temporal sulcus. These results suggest a network of regions that are involved in the discrimination of metric shape differences for dynamic object recognition...|$|R
40|$|Rotation {{invariance}} {{has been}} studied in the computer vision community primarily {{in the context of}} small in-plane rotations. This is usually achieved by building invariant image features. However, the problem of achieving invariance for large rotation angles remains largely unexplored. In this work, we tackle this problem by directly compensating for large rotations, as opposed to building invariant features. This is inspired by the neuro-scientific concept of mental rotation, which humans use to compare <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotated</b> objects. Our contributions here are three-fold. First, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect image rotations. We find that generic CNN architectures are not suitable for this purpose. To this end, we introduce a convolutional template layer, which learns representations for canonical `unrotated' images. Second, we use Bayesian Optimization to quickly sift through a large number of candidate images to find the canonical `unrotated' image. Third, we use this method to achieve robustness to large angles in an image retrieval scenario.
