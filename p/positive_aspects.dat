5|$|While Dhumavati {{generally}} {{is associated with}} only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn tells about her <b>positive</b> <b>aspects,</b> too. She is often called as bestower of boons and tender-hearted. Her hymn says that she lives {{in the midst of}} women and is worshipped by them. Her hymn sings of her as the giver of children.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Sasaki's {{architectural}} firm Sasaki Associates, Inc. {{found in the}} February 2010 master plan that the campus's seismic risk, uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, {{and a desire to}} build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus's users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of the physical campus as well as the campus life experience.|$|E
5|$|This {{traditional}} approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which {{focus on the}} <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of Byzantine culture and legacy. Averil Cameron regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution {{to the formation of}} the medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries. The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of the classical knowledge, as important contributors to the modern European civilization, and as precursors of both the Renaissance humanism and the Slav Orthodox culture.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican members on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{works of}} {{the last years of}} the century include {{incidental}} music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's Pelléas et Mélisande (1898) and Prométhée, a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at Béziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Opéra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter. From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for Le Figaro, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of a work.|$|E

5|$|The Girl {{made its}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December. Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of the <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal {{of him as a}} sexual predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) and Nora Brown (widow of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E

25|$|Asian Americans are {{sometimes}} {{characterized as a}} model minority in the United States because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic, a respect for elders, {{a high degree of}} professional and academic success, a high valuation of family, education and religion.

25|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of Auckland {{life are}} its mild climate, {{plentiful}} employment and educational opportunities, {{as well as}} numerous leisure facilities.

25|$|Leopold II {{remains a}} {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Democratic Republic of Congo. His statue in the capital Kinshasa was removed after independence. Congolese culture minister Christophe Muzungu decided to reinstate the statue in 2005. He noted that {{the beginning of the}} Free State had been a time of some economic and social progress. He argued that people should recognize some <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of the king as well as the negative; but hours after the six-metre (20ft) statue was installed near Kinshasa's central station, it was officially removed. The same workers took it down.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} direct ways humans are {{interacting}} with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although there are risks to this activity, and {{this has become a}} controversial topic. On the one hand there are many <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes.|$|E

25|$|Alfred {{commissioned}} Bishop Asser {{to write}} his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's <b>positive</b> <b>aspects.</b> Later medieval historians, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth, also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By {{the time of the}} Reformation Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great' rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries. The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment {{of the rule of law}} as supporting their own ideals.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{first and}} conceptually {{simplest}} is degree centrality, which {{is defined as}} the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others. When ties are associated to some <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{harshness}} (both mental and physical) {{of the environment}} in which operatives have to perform, the writing tends not to romanticize any potentially <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> of the organization or of most of the series' characters (excluding Nikita, Birkoff or Walter, and, at times, Michael at his most vulnerable). The series generally exudes a dark tone in keeping with the organizational philosophies, the counterterrorist (frequently dangerously violent) situations, and the requisite tactics used by operatives of Section One. Unlimited operational resources for missions coupled with human propensity to hide ulterior motives and individual personal moral relativism lead to widespread intra- and interdepartmental infighting and recurrent secret alliances, backstabbing, blackmail and abuses of power between and among the characters, especially among those in the highest levels of power: Operations, Madeline, and George.|$|E
