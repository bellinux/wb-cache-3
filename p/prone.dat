5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{flanked by}} areas <b>prone</b> to {{flooding}} between {{the point where it}} enters Schuylkill County and its mouth. The tributary Stony Run also flows through some areas <b>prone</b> to flooding and a few areas near Trexler Run are susceptible to flooding as well. Other small areas <b>prone</b> to flooding are scattered throughout the watershed of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Most {{recently}} Cain had represented Australia in the 2016 Rio Paralympics. He {{competed in}} the Mixed 10 m air rifle standing SH2 and the Mixed 10 m air rifle <b>prone</b> SH2. Cain did not medal, placing 26th in the standing event and 33rd in the <b>prone</b> event.|$|E

5|$|An area <b>prone</b> to {{cyclones}} {{and storm}} surges, Sitakunda {{was affected by}} cyclones in 1960, 1963, 1970, 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1997; the cyclones of 29 May 1963, 12 November 1970, 29 April 1991 made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Cain started {{competing}} in 2007, {{and made the}} Australian national team the same year. During Australia's 2009 domestic series, the Australia Cup, an invitation-only series for the top shooters in the country, he earned a bronze, silver and gold medal. That year, he made his national team debut at an international event when he represented Australia at the 2009 ISSF World Cup in South Korea. By early 2010, {{he was looking for}} a sponsor to assist with costs for his international competitions. He set a personal best of 598 out of 600 in the SH-2 <b>prone</b> air event at the 2010 World Cup in Germany, and not long after, set a new personal best when he shot 599 at the same event at the 2010 World Cup in France. He came in first at the 2010 Oceania Shooting Federation Continental Championship. At the 2010 IPC World Shooting Championships in Zagreb, he came in first in the SH-2 <b>prone</b> air event by setting a world record of 600 points, a perfect score. At the 2011 Great Britain International, he finished second in the 10m air rifle <b>prone</b> event. He competed in the United States-hosted International Paralympic Committee World Cup in 2011, finishing fourth in the R5 Air Rifle <b>Prone</b> event with a score of 599. He earned a gold medal in the team event with teammates Jason Maroney and Bradley Mark. In 2012, he trained up to six days a week. At the Australian nationals, he finished second in the <b>prone</b> event behind New Zealander Michael Johnson, and third in the standing event behind fellow Australian Bradley Marks and Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} <b>prone</b> to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also <b>prone</b> to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was {{eventually}} sent to Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan to help form the first Air Force Rifle Team and trained at Palm Beach Air Force Base in West Palm Beach, Florida {{during the winter}} months. His next international stop was the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he took home gold in the 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> position with 60 (individual and team) and 40 shots (individual) and the bronze in the 300 m standard rifle (individual) and 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> position with 40 shots (team). He then traveled to the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> event and finished 12th {{in a field of}} 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions tournament. Upon his return to the United States, he discovered that he had been promoted to the rank of Captain.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{somewhat}} <b>prone</b> to hip and elbow dysplasia, especially the larger dogs, {{though not as}} much as some other breeds. Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{flanked by}} areas <b>prone</b> to {{flooding}} during a 100 year flood {{from the mouth of}} Negro Hollow upstream to its headwaters. Negro Hollow and its unnamed tributaries are also surrounded by areas <b>prone</b> to flooding during a 100-year flood for much of their length. Both of the unnamed tributaries of Messers Run are surrounded by such areas for the majority of their length.|$|E
5|$|Nash - {{a junior}} premier of the {{floating}} city of Vane, often <b>prone</b> to rash decisions and occasionally despair.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{averaged}} a career shooting accuracy of 78%. Her career {{average in the}} <b>prone</b> position was 88%, while her career average in the standing position was 67%. Her shooting results in the <b>prone</b> position were similar to other top contenders. The standing shoot had long been her weak point and her hit percentage was well below average in the World Cup field, although it had improved considerably in her later seasons.|$|E
5|$|The 1954 ISSF World Shooting Championships were {{dominated}} by the Soviet Union, but Jackson still managed to take home a gold medal {{as a member of}} the United States' 50+100 m rifle <b>prone</b> position team. He fared better at the 1955 Pan American Games, taking home gold medals in both the individual and team versions of the rifle, three positions and <b>prone</b> at 50 meters, as well as the team high power rifle, three positions at 50 meters. He married Nancy Ord in 1956 and began training for that year's Summer Olympics, where he again finished 12th in a field of 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions event and 31st in among 44 participants in the 50 m rifle <b>prone</b> tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} became <b>prone</b> to accidents {{over the}} following years, prompting the addition of safety features along the extended ramps.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} and follow-up treatments left Kennedy thinner, <b>prone</b> to seizures, weak and short on energy, and hurt his balance.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} found in captivity, and wild-caught individuals are generally nervous and <b>prone</b> to spitting. Captive-bred animals {{tend to be}} much more docile and calm when compared to their wild-caught counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Women and {{men have}} {{different}} {{experiences of the}} same illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression and dementia, and are more <b>prone</b> to urinary tract infections than men.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft Internet Explorer particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer {{did not follow}} web standards. It was <b>prone</b> to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more <b>prone</b> to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more <b>prone</b> to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The {{locomotives}} {{were often}} <b>prone</b> to wheelslip, and required very careful driving when starting a heavy train from rest, but once into their stride they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and being remarkably stable when hauling heavy expresses.|$|E
5|$|American Cockers {{are also}} <b>prone</b> to canine {{epilepsy}} {{and the related}} condition known as Rage Syndrome. The latter {{is a form of}} epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks. Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.|$|E
5|$|American {{vehicles}} used Drum brakes {{until the}} 1962 Studebaker Avanti - the first American production model with front wheel Disc brakes as standard equipment. These are less <b>prone</b> to fade {{and are the}} current standard of design.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also <b>prone</b> to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|Announced as Alien Fear in April 2012, {{the game}} was renamed to Alien Rage in May of the {{following}} year. The game was released on 24 September 2013 for Windows, 18 October 2013 for the Xbox 360, and 21 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3. Alien Rage was met with mixed to negative reviews upon release, with critics viewing the game as generic and <b>prone</b> to major glitches.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more <b>prone</b> to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, {{that makes them}} more <b>prone</b> to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be <b>prone</b> to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E
5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds are more <b>prone</b> to breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to {{reduce the likelihood of}} breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, <b>prone</b> to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E
5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found that American audiences were less attentive and more <b>prone</b> to outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E
5|$|Cain is an SH2-classified shooter {{competing}} in 10m air rifle <b>prone</b> and 10m air rifle standing events. He {{has been a}} Victorian Institute of Sport scholarship holder since 2008, {{and is a member}} of the Springvale Range Club. He is coached by Miro Sipek as an individual and when on the national team.|$|E
5|$|Cain was {{selected}} to represent Australia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in Mixed R5-10m Air Rifle Prone-SH2 and Mixed R4-10m Air Rifle Standing-SH2 shooting events. Competing on 3 September, he did not medal, finishing 27th in the standing event and 28th in the <b>prone</b> event.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under the}} age of {{fourteen}} were prohibited from seeing the film. There were reports of anti-Jewish violence after audiences viewed the film; in particular, teenagers seemed particularly <b>prone</b> to be instigated to violence by the film.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not <b>prone</b> to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
