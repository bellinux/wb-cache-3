5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as <b>permalloy,</b> elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as <b>permalloy.</b> These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum <b>permalloy.</b> The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E
25|$|GAV Swan is a six-wheeled terrain assault vehicle. Its {{full name}} is the Ground Assault Vehicle JL-723. It has a {{gyrostabilized}} platform {{so when it}} travels over rough terrain, the gunner platform is stabilized. The extended gunner's chair can rise up 3.6 meters above the vehicle to see over obstructions between the gun and the target, like the long neck of a swan, hence the name. This 6x6 is built for all terrain, and its <b>permalloy</b> armor and four turret-mounted sixty-millimeter rotary autocannons provide protection from the Pandoran environment. The wheels have little armor and are designed with a thick polymer alloy. Swans have a gyrostabilized system that rotates a full 360 degrees. Swans also have a roll bar and four rear headlights. Swans have redundant fuel cells in the rear. When the chair extends, the ammunition storage canister {{is located at the}} back.|$|E

50|$|<b>Permalloy</b> is a {{nickel-iron}} magnetic alloy, {{with about}} 80% nickel and 20% iron content.

Commercial <b>permalloy</b> alloys typically have relative permeability of around 100,000, compared to several thousand for ordinary steel.|$|E

50|$|This {{method of}} cable {{compensation}} {{declined in the}} 1930s, but by World War 2 many other uses for <b>Permalloy</b> {{were found in the}} electronics industry.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Permalloy</b> was {{initially}} {{developed in the}} early 20th century for inductive compensation of telegraph cables. [...] When the first transatlantic submarine telegraph cables were laid in the 1860s, {{it was found that}} the long conductors caused distortion which reduced the maximum signalling speed to only 10-12 words per minute. The right conditions for transmitting signals through cables without distortion were first worked out mathematically in 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. [...] It was proposed by Carl Emil Krarup in 1902 in Denmark that the cable could be compensated by wrapping it with iron wire, increasing the inductance and making it a loaded line to reduce distortion. However, iron did not have high enough permeability to compensate a transatlantic-length cable. After a prolonged search, <b>permalloy</b> was discovered in 1914 by Gustav Elmen of Bell Laboratories, who found it had higher permeability than silicon steel. [...] Later, in 1923, he found its permeability could be greatly enhanced by heat treatment. [...] A wrapping of <b>permalloy</b> tape could reportedly increase the signalling speed of a telegraph cable fourfold.|$|E
50|$|Most wire spring relays have a <b>permalloy</b> core, {{and require}} {{continuous}} {{power to maintain}} state. Some have a steel core, making them magnetically latching relays, similar to the ferreed and remreed types of reed relay.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum <b>permalloy</b> powder {{is made by}} {{grinding}} hot-rolled and embrittled cast ingots; then, {{the alloy}} is insulated and screened to a fineness of 120 mesh for use in audio frequency applications, and 400 mesh for use at high frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A {{family of}} {{specialized}} alloys exists for magnetic core applications. Examples are mu-metal, <b>permalloy,</b> and supermalloy. They can be manufactured as stampings or as long ribbons for tape wound cores. Some alloys, e.g. Sendust, are manufactured as powder and sintered to shape.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to high permeability, its other magnetic properties are low coercivity, near zero magnetostriction, and significant anisotropic magnetoresistance. The low magnetostriction {{is critical for}} industrial applications, allowing it {{to be used in}} thin films where variable stresses would otherwise cause a ruinously large variation in magnetic properties. Permalloy's electrical resistivity can vary as much as 5% depending on the strength and the direction of an applied magnetic field. Permalloys typically have the face centered cubic crystal structure with a lattice constant of approximately 0.355 nm in the vicinity of a nickel concentration of 80%. A disadvantage of <b>permalloy</b> {{is that it is not}} very ductile or workable, so applications requiring elaborate shapes, such as magnetic shields, are made of other high permeability alloys such as mu metal. <b>Permalloy</b> is used in transformer laminations and magnetic recording heads.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic - Magnetic {{recording}} heads use {{the principles}} of electromagnetism to coerce a paramagnetic recording medium, such as iron oxides, to orient in a readable manner such as magnetic tape. Record heads are constructed of laminated <b>permalloy,</b> ferrite, or sendust. As of 2006 this {{is by far the}} most dominant type of head in use.|$|E

50|$|The MFM {{can be used}} {{to image}} various {{magnetic}} structures including domain walls (Bloch and Neel), closure domains, recorded magnetic bits, etc. Furthermore, motion of domain wall can also be studied in an external magnetic field.

50|$|Instead of {{threading}} individual {{ferrite cores}} on wires, plated wire memory used {{a grid of}} wires coated with {{a thin layer of}} iron-nickel alloy (called <b>permalloy).</b> The magnetic field normally stored in the ferrite core was instead stored on the wire itself. Operation was generally similar to core, but could also be built with a non-destructive read that did not require refreshing.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{threading}} individual {{ferrite cores}} on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4 micrometre thick dots of <b>permalloy,</b> an iron-nickel alloy, deposited on small glass plates by vacuum evaporation techniques and a mask. The drive and sense lines were then added using printed circuit wiring over the alloy dots. This provided very fast access {{times in the}} range of 670 nanoseconds, but was very expensive to produce.|$|E
50|$|Many {{smartphones}} contain magnetometers; apps {{exist that}} serve as compasses. The iPhone 3GS has a magnetometer, a magnetoresistive <b>permalloy</b> sensor, the AN-203 produced by Honeywell. In 2009, the price of three-axis magnetometers dipped below US $1 per device and dropped rapidly. The use of a three-axis device means {{that it is not}} sensitive to the way it is held in orientation or elevation. Hall effect devices are also popular.|$|E
5000|$|For these reasons, Krarup cable {{was popular}} on shorter distances, where the {{distortion}} {{was not so}} high that loading coils had to be used, until the advent of <b>permalloy</b> cable superseded it. [...] The first cable to be laid with Krarup cable, indeed the first cable to be laid {{with any kind of}} continuous loading, was between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden) in 1902. This cable was engineered by Krarup himself.|$|E

These same four metals also produce smooth spheres about 2 μm across that explode when examined with an electron microscope. Copper, <b>permalloy,</b> and bismuth also make nanowires.|$|E

They constructed the cable by wrapping the copper conductors with annealed <b>permalloy</b> tape, a material that Elmen had discovered, thus inductively loading the cable.|$|E
50|$|These {{are made}} of thin strips of <b>permalloy</b> (NiFe {{magnetic}} film) whose electrical resistance varies with a change in magnetic field.
