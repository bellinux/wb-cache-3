5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The failure was {{due in part to}} the <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> of $9695, an extraordinary amount of money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, ODST {{became the}} top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Reviewers were divided {{on whether the}} relatively short campaign and included extras were enough to justify the game's US$60 <b>price</b> <b>tag.</b> The game was the top-selling title in the United States in September 2009, and sold more than 3million copies worldwide. Softpedia, Time, and Wired were among publications that declared the game one of the year's best.|$|E

The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> on the striker.

5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Saint Paul Public Schools {{purchased}} a {{parcel of land}} about a mile and half west of the Unidale Mall on University Avenue from 3M. Construction of the new facility was planned to start in 2005, costing $7 million. When construction bids were higher than expected, the <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> went up to $8 million and the project was postponed to allow for planning to reduce costs. Construction started in late November 2006 after price concerns had been resolved. The building opened in early December 2007, with a total cost of $7.5 million. It was dedicated one day before the two-year anniversary of Gordon Parks's death. He died on March 7, 2006; the building was dedicated on March 6, 2008.|$|E

At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> was too expensive.

5|$|In early 1994, Jacksonville Mayor Ed Austin {{proposed}} $49 {{million in}} renovations to Jacksonville's aging Gator Bowl Stadium {{in order to}} keep the stadium up to date for the annual Florida-Georgia rivalry game. After Florida and Georgia accepted the renovations, agreeing to play the rivalry game in Athens, Georgia during the renovations, Jacksonville investors proposed expanding the renovation plan in order to attract a National Football League team. The <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> was revised upward—to $121 million—and the city successfully attracted a team. Shortly after Jacksonville was awarded its new franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—the final plans were unveiled. The stadium would have additional luxury boxes, expanded seating, and upgraded facilities for teams and fans.|$|E
5|$|The Rampart Dam's {{large size}} had a {{correspondingly}} large <b>price</b> <b>tag.</b> The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4million (1970 dollars) on {{construction of the}} physical dam alone, another $492million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39billion in total. That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2million {{for the maintenance of}} fish and wildlife facilities.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also in the hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 season {{comprised}} {{mixed results}} for Alonso and his San Sebastián club. Alonso revelled in {{the opportunity to}} perform in Europe, appearing in all the team's games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League. The team struggled {{under the pressure of}} the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Lyon and finished 15th in La Liga. The combination of Alonso's outstanding performances and the team's poor league finish made a move away from Anoeta Stadium inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad. Madrid failed to meet the £13million <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> that José Luis Astiazarán, the Real Sociedad president, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate. Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at UEFA Euro 2004. Despite the fact that Alonso's appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby, who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.|$|E
