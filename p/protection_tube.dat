40|$|Abstract. Silicon {{nitrides}} {{are often}} used as ladles, stalks, heater element <b>protection</b> <b>tubes,</b> etc., in the metal casting industry. A low wettability for molten metals is required for these purposes since wetting by molten metals leads to adhesion of solidified metals, which causes several problems. Surface structure is known to affect wettability. Thus, the present study attempts to fabricate silicon nitrides with controlled surface structures. Silicon nitrides, whose surfaces were covered with ordered hemispherical protrusions, were fabricated by the slip-casting technique. The cast bodies were sintered, and subjected to wettability tests using molten metals. For comparison, silicon nitrides with as-sintered and polished surfaces were also prepared. The surface with protrusions exhibited a lower contact angle compared to the as-sintered and polished surfaces. The contact angle depended on {{the diameter of the}} hemisphere; it was the largest at a diameter of 0. 3 mm...|$|R

Methods Open C-shaped polyethylene shells were designed toprotect wounds and dressings on the dorsum of pigs used inresearch into negative pressure dressing-assisted wound healing. The shells were designed to resist trauma and contamination, tobe comfortable and expansible, and to facilitate tube fixation andmanagement. Strap fixation was optimised during experimentation. Efficacy was assessed by direct observation of dressing andwound <b>protection,</b> <b>tube</b> integrity and by macroscopic and microscopicassessments of wound healing. Results The shells effectively protected the wounds againstblunt and sharp trauma, were simple to remove and reapply, were well tolerated and allowed for growth of the pigs. Circumferentia lneck straps attached by lateral straps to the shells provedcritical. There was no wound infection or inflammation underlyingthe shells. Porting tubing via mid-dorsal holes in the shells andaffixing the tubing just cranial to these holes prevented tubedamage and traction, permitted tube management from outsidethe cages and allowed the pigs to move freely without becomingentangled.

40|$|Conventional fossil fired boilers {{have been}} {{retrofitted}} with low NO(sub) x burners {{in order for}} the power plants to comply with new clean air regulations. Due to the operating characteristics of these burners, boiler tube sulfidation corrosion typically has been enhanced resulting in premature tube failure. To protect the existing panels from accelerated attack, weld overlay coatings are typically being applied. By depositing an alloy that offers better corrosion resistance than the underlying tube material, the wastage rates can be reduced. While Ni-based and stainless steel compositions are presently providing protection, they are expensive and susceptible to failure via corrosion-fatigue due to microsegregation upon solidification. Another material system presently under consideration for use as a coating in the oxidation/sulfidation environments is iron-aluminum. These alloys are relatively inexpensive, exhibit little microsegregation, and show excellent corrosion resistance. However, their use is limited due to weldability issues and their lack of corrosion characterization in simulated low NO(sub) x gas compositions. Therefore a program was initiated in 1996 to evaluate the use of iron-aluminum weld overlay coatings for erosion/corrosion <b>protection</b> of boiler <b>tubes</b> in fossil fired boilers with low NO(sub) x burners.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{immersion test}} system built and operated at ORNL {{was found to}} successfully screen samples from numerous refractory suppliers, including both commercially available and experimental materials. This system was found to provide an accurate prediction of how these materials would perform in the actual gasifier environment. Test materials included mullites, alumino-silicate bricks, fusion-cast aluminas, alumina-based and chrome-containing mortars, phosphate-bonded mortars, coated samples provided under an MPLUS-funded project, bonded spinels, different fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinels with magnesia content ranging from 2. 5 % to about 60 %, high-MgO castable and brick materials, spinel castables, and alkali-aluminate materials. This testing identified several candidate material systems that perform well in the New Bern gasifier. Fusion-cast aluminas were found to survive for nearly one year, and magnesia-alumina spinels have operated successfully for 18 months {{and are expected to}} survive for two years. Alkali-aluminates and high-MgO-content materials have also been identified for backup lining applications. No other material with a similar structure and chemical composition to that of the fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel brick currently being used for the hot-face lining is commercially available. Other materials used for this application have been found to have inferior service lives, as previously discussed. Further, over 100 laboratory immersion tests have been performed on other materials (both commercial and experimental), but none to date has performed as well as the material currently being used for the hot-face lining. Operating experience accumulated with the high-temperature gasifier at New Bern, North Carolina, has confirmed that the molten alkali salts degrade many types of refractories. Fusion-cast alumina materials were shown to provide a great improvement in lifetime over materials used previously. Further improvement was realized with fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinel refractory, which appears to be the most resistant to degradation found to date, exhibiting over a year of service life and expected to be capable of over two years of service life. Regarding the use of refractory mortar, it was found that expansion of the current chrome-alumina mortar when subjected to black liquor smelt is likely contributing to the strains seen on the vessel shell. Additionally, the candidate high-alumina mortar that was originally proposed as a replacement for the current chrome-alumina mortar also showed a large amount of expansion when subjected to molten smelt. A UMR experimental mortar, composed of a phosphate bonded system specifically designed for use with fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel, was found to perform well in the molten smelt environment. Strain gauges installed on the gasifier vessel shell provided valuable information about the expansion of the refractory, and a new set of strain gauges and thermocouples has been installed in order to monitor the loading caused by the currently installed spinel refractory. These results provide information for a direct comparison of the expansion of the two refractories. Measurements to date suggest that the fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinel is expanding less than the fusion-cast {alpha}/{beta}-alumina used previously. A modified liquor nozzle was designed and constructed to test a number of materials that should be more resistant to erosion and corrosion than the material currently used. Inserts made of three erosion-resistant metallic materials were fabricated, along with inserts made of three ceramic materials. The assembled system was sent to the New Bern mill for installation in the gasifer in 2005. Following operation of the gasifier using the modified nozzle, inserts should be removed and analyzed for wear by erosion/corrosion. Although no materials have been directly identified for sensor/thermocouple <b>protection</b> <b>tubes,</b> several of the refractory material systems identified for lining material applications may be applicable for use in this capacity. Results of the modeling studies suggest that the temperature distribution is higher {{at the bottom of the}} gasifier than previously thought. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the refractory temperature in the gasifier by changing the liquor spray. Also, modeling showed that because of the strong swirl, a separation zone could be formed at the corner of the conical wall where it meets the vertical barrel wall, and some the liquor droplets could be suspended in this zone. The accumulation of droplets in this area could cause instabilities in the performance and also in corrosion of the refractory...|$|R

The primary {{objective of the}} research is to identify overlay compositions which can be deposited in a crack-free condition and provide corrosion protection in moderately reducing environments. In the current phase of work, Fe-Al alloy weld overlays were produced by depositing commercially pure aluminum wire on to low carbon steel substrates using Gas Tungsten Arc Welding. A systematic variation of the wire feed speed and current, two major factors affecting dilution, resulted in a variation in aluminum contents of the welds ranging from 3 [...] 42 wt% aluminum. The aluminum content was observed to increase with wire feed speed {{and a decrease in}} the current. The aluminum content was also found to affect the cracking susceptibility of the overlays. At 10 wt% aluminum, few to no cracks were observed in the deposits. Above this value, cracking was prevalent throughout the weld. In addition, two types of microstructures were found correlating to different concentrations of aluminum. A homogeneous matrix with second phase particles consisting of coarse columnar grains was found for low aluminum concentrations.

40|$|A 5 -year {{study of}} the {{reforestation}} of a semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem with Pinus halepensis is presented. Reforestation of Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems is challenging {{as a result of}} harsh environmental conditions and historical human exploitation leading to degradation. New techniques have to be developed in order to increase survivorship and growth that integrates nursery and field treatments. A total of 60 treatments resulting from 12 site × 5 plant preparation techniques were tested. Plant preparation consists of mycorrhizing in nursery, extra fertilizing in nursery, planting in containers in the nursery, planting in the field with a polypropylene tube, and control plants (bred in plastic bags). Soil preparation consists of hole, subsoiling without amendment, subsoiling with composted organic amendment added in the surface or in the furrow of plantation and subsoiling with fresh organic amendment added in the surface or in the furrow of plantation. Each one of these treatments was tested with a hydrophilic acrylic copolymer and without it. Survivorship was very high (0. 91) given the prevailing environmental conditions. Subsoiling promoted higher survival than holes, and plants bred in containers had lower levels of survivorship than control ones. Protecting seedlings with polypropylene tubes had no effect on survivorship. The most effective treatment for promoting growth was organic amendment, the effect of which increased until the fourth year. <b>Protection</b> with <b>tubes</b> was very effective in increasing height, although only in the short-term. Subsoiling also promoted faster growth than holes, although the effect was less noticeable after 3 years and was, in any case, less effective than organic amendment. Other treatments promoting faster growth were the use of fresh organic waste as opposed to composted waste and its incorporation in the plantation furrow rather than as a layer on the surface. The addition of hydrophilic acrylic copolymer reduced growth during the first months of the reforestation. The fertilization of plants in the nursery and inoculation with spores of mycorhyzal fungi did not improve seedling growth. Plants bred in containers performed worse than control plants bred in individual plastic bags. The findings suggests the importance of nutrient supply in semiarid environments, an aspect that has been previously neglected in favor of water supply. Organic amendments reinforce both and can be recommended as long as adequate environmental controls are in place. This work was supported by the Spanish National Plan of RþD (Project AGF 99 - 1132).

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of anthropogenic CO(2 -) driven ocean acidification (OA), coastal waters are becoming increasingly challenging for calcifiers due to reductions in saturation states of calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) minerals. The response of calcification rate {{is one of the}} most frequently investigated symptoms of OA. However, OA may also result in poor quality calcareous products through impaired calcification processes despite there being no observed change in calcification rate. The mineralogy and ultrastructure of the calcareous products under OA conditions may be altered, resulting in changes to the mechanical properties of calcified structures. Here, the warm water biofouling tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, was reared from larva to early juvenile stage at the aragonite saturation state (Ω(A)) for the current pCO(2) level (ambient) and those predicted for the years 2050, 2100 and 2300. Composition, ultrastructure and mechanical strength of the calcareous tubes produced by those early juvenile tubeworms were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoindentation. Juvenile tubes were composed primarily of the highly soluble CaCO(3) mineral form, aragonite. Tubes produced in seawater with aragonite saturation states near or below one had significantly higher proportions of the crystalline precursor, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and the calcite/aragonite ratio dramatically increased. These alterations in tube mineralogy resulted in a holistic deterioration of the tube hardness and elasticity. Thus, in conditions where Ω(A) is near or below one, the aragonite-producing juvenile tubeworms may no longer be able to maintain the integrity of their calcification products, and may result in reduced survivorship due to the weakened <b>tube</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R

The overall nutrient profile of fortified foods consumed remained favourable, i. e. higher in starch and dietary fibre and lower in fat and saturated fat, with polyunsaturated fat, sugars and Na in proportion to energy. Women, particularly those of childbearing age, remained the key beneficiaries of voluntary fortification practices in Ireland. Continued voluntary fortification of foods has increased <b>protection</b> against neural <b>tube</b> defect-affected pregnancy by folic acid and maintained the beneficial impact on the adequacy of Fe intake. Increased consumption of fortified foods did not contribute to an increased risk of intakes exceeding the tolerable upper intake level for any micronutrient. Recent increases in voluntary fortification of foods in Ireland have made a favourable nutritional impact on the diets of adults and have not contributed to an increased risk of adverse effects...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of anthropogenic CO 2 -driven ocean acidification (OA), coastal waters are becoming increasingly challenging for calcifiers due to reductions in saturation states of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) minerals. The response of calcification rate {{is one of the}} most frequently investigated symptoms of OA. However, OA may also result in poor quality calcareous products through impaired calcification processes despite there being no observed change in calcification rate. The mineralogy and ultrastructure of the calcareous products under OA conditions may be altered, resulting in changes to the mechanical properties of calcified structures. Here, the warm water biofouling tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, was reared from larva to early juvenile stage at the aragonite saturation state (Omega A) for the current pCO 2 level (ambient) and those predicted for the years 2050, 2100 and 2300. Composition, ultrastructure and mechanical strength of the calcareous tubes produced by those early juvenile tubeworms were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoindentation. Juvenile tubes were composed primarily of the highly soluble CaCO 3 mineral form, aragonite. Tubes produced in seawater with aragonite saturation states near or below one had significantly higher proportions of the crystalline precursor, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and the calcite/aragonite ratio dramatically increased. These alterations in tube mineralogy resulted in a holistic deterioration of the tube hardness and elasticity. Thus, in conditions where Omega A is near or below one, the aragonite-producing juvenile tubeworms may no longer be able to maintain the integrity of their calcification products, and may result in reduced survivorship due to the weakened <b>tube</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{aluminum}} automotive condenser {{was designed}} to exhibit high corrosion resistance in the seawater acetic acid test (SWAAT) combining zinc coated microchannel tubes and fins made with AA 4343 /AA 3003 (Zn) /AA 4343 brazing sheet. Electrochemical measurements in SWAAT solution were carried out under laboratory conditions using tube-fin assembly and individual fin and tube samples withdrawn from the condenser core. The aim was to gain information on the protective role of the zinc sacrificial layer and about changes in corrosion behavior {{as a function of}} immersion time. External corrosion of the tube-fin system was simulated by immersion of mini-core samples under open circuit conditions. The corrosion rate increased rapidly during the first 6  h and slowly afterwards. The short time behavior was related to the dissolution of the oxide film and fast dissolution of the outermost part of the zinc diffusion layer. With the aid of cross-sectional depth corrosion potential profiles, it was shown that as the sacrificial layer gets dissolved, the surface concentration of zinc decreases and the potential shifts to less negative values. The results of galvanic coupling of tube and fins in a mini-cell showed that the tube became the anode while the fins exhibited cathodic behavior. An evolution in the galvanic interaction was observed, due to the progressive dissolution of the sacrificial zinc layer. The difference of uncoupled potentials between tube and fins decreased from 71  mV to 32  mV after 84  h of galvanic coupling. At the end of such period there was still a part of the zinc sacrificial layer remaining which would serve for <b>protection</b> of the <b>tube</b> material for even longer periods and there were indications of slight corrosion in the fins.

40|$|Extract] As {{one of the}} world's leading holiday destinations, the Hawaiian Islands are {{renowned for}} their {{tropical}} scenery, luxurious resorts, cultural and historical sites, laid-back lifestyle and diversity of outdoor recreational opportunities. Tourism and outdoor recreation are firmly linked with Hawai'i's iconic geologic features (King, 2010). The volcanic origins of the Hawaiian Islands has produced many well known and well marketed geomorphological attractions across the Hawaiian Islands including Diamond Head Crater, Haleakala, Molokini Crater, Hanauma Bay, Mauna Kea, the Na Pali Coast and the volcanoes of the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park - Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Ongoing volcanic activity on the Big Island of Hawai'i attracts visitors {{from all over the}} world to view active lava flows and volcanic landscapes. However, few visitors are familiar with Hawai'i's unique underground volcanic attractions - its lava tube caves. This chapter introduces lava tube tourism on the Big Island (also known as Hawai'i Island or the Big Island of Hawai'i) and how small group adventure tours assist in promoting lava <b>tube</b> <b>protection</b> and conservation by fostering personal experiences with these unique environments. The chapter begins with a brief orientation to Big Island volcanoes and describes the processes which form lava tubes. The diverse values possessed by Big Island lava tubes are introduced and the human activities threatening these sites are presented. Key lava tubes open to the public and the types of tours offered by entrepreneurial cave entrance owners are discussed. The chapter concludes with a case study of the Pua Po 'o adventure tour conducted by Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park staff and highlights how small group adventure tours can successfully transfer to tour participants the appreciation of, and conservation attitudes towards, Hawaiian lava tubes...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To assess longitudinal changes in folate status in South Australian children and adolescents during fortification of food with folic acid. Methods: Sixty-nine children and adolescents (age 12. 8 ± 2. 3 years), 47 with diabetes and 22 healthy controls, had their folate status assessed {{at the beginning of}} 1999 and again after a mean 1. 1 ± 0. 23 years. Intake of folate at baseline was assessed with a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Results: Baseline red cell folate (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) was 756 ± 294. 5 nmol/L and remained constant at follow up at 736 ± 299 nmol/L (P = 0. 55) in the whole group. Serum folate increased from 24. 4 ± 6. 3 nmol/L to 27. 2 ± 8. 8 nmol/L (P = 0. 002). Children with diabetes showed a significant increase in serum folate (from 26. 3 ± 5. 7 − 30. 1 ± 7. 9, P < 0. 001) and stable red cell folate (835. 8 ± 278. 6 and 808. 6 ± 296. 7, P = 0. 51) between baseline and the second samples, while controls showed stable serum (20. 4 ± 5. 7 and 21. 1 ± 7. 7, P = 0. 7) and red cell folate (586. 6 ± 255. 9 and 579. 8 ± 240. 1, P = 0. 92). A third sample collected in 17 subjects after a further 9 ± 1. 3 months showed a further increase in serum and red cell folate. Mean folate intake at baseline was 301 ± 129 µg/day, below the mean recommended for prevention of neural tube defects. Conclusions: Voluntary fortification of food with folate is associated with improved folate status in South Australian children and adolescents, but may not be sufficient at current levels to provide maximal <b>protection</b> against neural <b>tube</b> defects at a population level.
