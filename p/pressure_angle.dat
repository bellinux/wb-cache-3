40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears having {{circular}} flanks {{hold out}} a very promising {{future in the}} field of gearing for power transmission in very heavily loaded machineries. In order to optimize the profile parameters of these gears, a photoelastic investigation was carried out. Models of Wildhaber-Novikov gears made of photoelastic material, Araldite-D, were used in the investigation. Included were the models with various profile radii and fillet radii at different <b>pressure</b> <b>angles.</b> The flank and bending stresses of these gears were determined in each case and were compared with those of involute gears. From this investigation, it was concluded that the load-carrying capacity of circular-arc gears is 3. 5 times that of involute gears. It was found that with profile radius up to 1. 5 module, the bending stresses of these gears are lower than those of corresponding involute gears, under identical conditions of loading. It was observed that high <b>pressure</b> <b>angles,</b> when used for Wildhaber-Novikov gears having comparatively smaller profile radii, produce high flank stresses. Gears with larger profile radii, at smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> were seen to have a high value for the ratio of flank stress to the bending stress. On the other hand, gears with smaller profile radii, at higher <b>pressure</b> <b>angles,</b> were observed to have a smaller value for this ratio of stresses...|$|R

50|$|In {{spur gears}} and {{straight}} bevel gears, tooth profiles are considered {{only in a}} transverse plane, and the general terms profile angle and <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> are customarily used rather than transverse profile angle and transverse <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> In helical teeth, the profiles may be considered in different planes, and in specifications {{it is essential to}} use terms that indicate the direction of the plane in which the profile angle or the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> lies, such as transverse profile angle, normal <b>pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> axial profile angle.|$|E
50|$|Axial <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> and {{axial profile}} angle are the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> and the profile angle in an axial plane of a helical gear or a worm, or of a spiral bevel gear.|$|E

This force has components along the pitch line and the other along the line perpendicular to the pitch line. The force along the pitch line which is responsible for power transmission is proportional to the cosine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> The one which exerts thrust(perpendicular to the pitch line) is proportional to the sine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> So it is advised to keep the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> low.

A feasible non-symmetric tooth profile for application in helicopter transmissions is laid out as the best compromise among several conflicting factors. The non-symmetric tooth profile is then compared with the symmetric tooth profile studied previously. Based on the detailed comparisons it is concluded that the use of the non-symmetric tooth profile would severely limit the face width of the worm, consequently reduce the number of meshing teeth and cause much higher normal load on the individual gear teeth...|$|R

In gear manufacturing factories, tooth bearing development is still required {{in order to}} obtain good tooth bearing patterns.

5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> [...] : The {{complement}} of the angle between {{the direction that}} the teeth exert force on each other, and the line joining the centers of the two gears. For involute gears, the teeth always exert force {{along the line of}} action, which, for involute gears, is a straight line; and thus, for involute gears, the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is constant.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{practice}} {{is to make}} allowance for half the backlash in the tooth thickness of each gear. However, if the pinion (the smaller of the two gears) is significantly smaller than the gear it is meshing with then it is common practice to account {{for all of the}} backlash in the larger gear. This maintains as much strength as possible in the pinion's teeth. The amount of additional material removed when making the gears depends on the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of the teeth. For a 14.5° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> the extra distance the cutting tool is moved in equals the amount of backlash desired. For a 20° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> the distance equals 0.73 times the amount of backlash desired.|$|E
