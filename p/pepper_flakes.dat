5000|$|Chuan (pronounced [...] "chwan") {{are small}} pieces of meat roasted on skewers over charcoal, or sometimes, {{electric}} heat.

5000|$|The {{molecule}} {{is produced}} by some plants and is {{a contributor to the}} aroma of several plant-based foods. It is also seen to be produced in some forms of blue-green algae; however it is most frequently found in members of the genus Capsicum. Specifically, it is what gives a bell pepper, along with other peppers, their distinctive smell. [...] This is {{to such an extent that}} Grindstaff pyrazine is sometimes just called the [...] "bell pepper pyrazine." [...] The human nose can detect concentrations of this molecule below the part per trillion level making it one of the most odor intensive compounds on earth. Unlike capsaicin, which is produced and mainly stored in the placenta of the pepper, Grindstaff pyrazine is mainly contained in the flesh of the pepper. This is why dried <b>pepper</b> <b>flakes</b> and other spices derived from the seeds and placenta of peppers lack the aroma of what is thought of as a [...] "fresh pepper smell".|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} many {{different}} variations of manti in terms of shape and way of serving, the most praised type of Turkish manti is known as Kayseri mantisi, originally from Kayseri, an Anatolian city.

In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while boş mantı (‘empty dumpling’) lack filling entirely.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of Kentucky, where mutton is a common choice, or Southern Maryland, where the custom {{is to take the}} carcass of an entire bull and roast it over coals for many hours, pork is the popular choice of Southern style barbecue and features in other preparations like sausages and sandwiches. Among both African-Americans and European-Americans in the antebellum period, corn and pork were a staple of the diet. For breakfast, it is a feature of country sausage, which in turn are an ingredient in the Southern breakfast dish of biscuits and gravy. Head cheese is a popular sliced meat of the region, taken from the pig's head, and pickled pig's feet have always been a cheap snack since they were introduced by Scotch-Irish settlers; today they are often served in bars.. Baby back ribs, hog maw, cracklins, and even whole pig roasts in specially constructed ovens are found {{in all parts of the}} South, as are its two best known condiments, barbecue sauce and hot sauce, with hundreds of local variations. In Virginia and the Appalachians, the mainstay for special occasions is the country ham, often served for Christmas and cured with salt or hickory, with the Virginia recipe often feeding the hogs peanuts for finishing and giving the ham a distinct taste, and red <b>pepper</b> <b>flakes</b> in ham cured in Tennessee. Accompanying many meals is the southern style fluffy biscuit, where the leavening agent is sodium bicarbonate and often includes buttermilk, and for breakfast they often accompany country ham, grits, and scrambled eggs.|$|E
