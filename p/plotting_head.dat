40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{creation}} of a simplified software user intefaces that allow users to control mechanical devices. The software is based on the “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get ” (WYSIWYG) paradigm where the user manipulates a graphical model that the output of the mechanical devices will ultimately map to. CAD programs are a form of WYSIWYG software. Output from CAD programs are commonly used for outputing to engraving machines and pen plotters. If one considers that the command interpretation from the software to the mechanical device controls largely the movements of the engraving or <b>plotting</b> <b>head,</b> the same idea could be used to control a roving robot. The controller plots out the movements of the robot all before execution occurs. This sort of control is not difficult to understand and can be designed for use by students. In fact, a simple drawing program can be designed for use as a CAD program for an engraver and pen plotter and as a robot controller that can be used by elementary school students...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} on genetic variability, {{heritability}} and genetic advance for yield and yield contributing traits {{was conducted in}} 20 newly developed male sterile lines of pearl millet, developed at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur, {{during the rainy season}} of the year 2013. Significant genetic variability among genotypes was observed for all the traits studied i. e. days to flowering, plant height, ear head length, ear head girth, effective tillers per plant, ear head number, ear head weight, grain yield, 500 grain weight and panicle harvest index. Mean performance of all traits revealed that ms lines CZMS 0021 A and CZMS 0008 A had higher manifestation of most of the desired traits. High values of genotypic coefficients of variation and phenotypic coefficient of variation were observed for traits like grain yield per <b>plot,</b> ear <b>head</b> weight per <b>plot</b> and effective tillers per plant, indicating that these traits contributed significantly to the total variability. High heritability estimates were observed for grain yield per <b>plot,</b> ear <b>head</b> weight per <b>plot,</b> plant height and days to flowering. High genetic advance as percentage, was recorded for grain yield per <b>plot</b> and ear <b>head</b> weight per <b>plot.</b> Greater magnitude of heritability coupled with higher genetic advance for grain yield per <b>plot</b> and ear <b>head</b> weight/plot revealed additive genetic effects for inheritance of these traits, while, high heritability estimates with low genetic advance indicated the presence of non-additive gene action for days to flowering, plant height and ear head length...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To reduce pest attack, several biorational {{products}} are allowed {{for use on}} organic vegetables in Brazil. This study investigated eight biorational products applied singly or in combination against Spodoptera eridania Cramer in field plots of cabbage intercropped with coriander. The treatments were applied once a week over a 5 week period, beginning 34 days after transplanting. The evaluations consisted of counting the larvae of S. eridania {{on the day before}} and 7 and 21 days after spraying. The damage to leaves and cabbage head, the commercial weight of head and the percentage of head losses were evaluated. RESULTS: Leaf injury in plots treated with Beauveria bassiana and neem oil (Dalneem) yielded scores of 1. 3 and 2. 5 (scale ranging from 0 to 4) respectively, in comparison with a score of 3. 6 from untreated <b>plots.</b> <b>Head</b> weight losses were 6. 1, 5. 3 and 4. 9 % with an aqueous extract of neem leaves, neem oil and B. bassiana respectively, compared with 24. 6 % lost from untreated plots.

Massive desertions from several military camps - and among them, the Chinaimo camp - started just after Chao Phetsarath and his wife's visit along the Mekong River, in the Isan region. Police officers were {{wondering if the}} attack were committed on his instructions or simply on his behalf. In addition, investigations revealed that Bong Souvannavong - fervent supporter of Chao Phetsarath's return - had regular contact {{with members of the}} conspiracy. His son Boutsabong, would have informed the conspirators of the reception at Sananikone's, which had been although decided in the afternoon. Bong Souvannavong was then arrested and jailed on October 6. According to some conspirators testimony, this attack would be aimed at Phoui Sananikone, who was accused of the anti-Pathet Lao attitude and not having resisted Western pressures on the Geneva Agreements. For some of them, Kou Voravong's death would be first of all an error, which was then exploited to threaten pro-French government members, and for others, it would be a fatal consequence of his intense anti-subversive activity when he was Minister of the Interior, and for still others, that could be an extreme reaction of the French Government to his active anti-feudal militancy for a Laotian led administration.|$|R

30|$|The {{quantity}} {{and distribution of}} seepage water have now been monitored over 6 consecutive years. As a careful evaluation of seepage, hydraulic head and precipitation monitoring shows that seepage depends on many factors besides the hydraulic head inside the reservoir.

A quotient Q/h (amount of seepage water divided by hydraulic head) was introduced as a measure for the relative change of the overall rock mass permeability (Fig.  15). Q/h should remain approximately constant {{as long as the}} permeabilities and hydraulic boundaries in the system remain unchanged.
