50|$|For {{magnesium}} alloys, thixomolding uses {{a machine}} similar to injection molding. In {{a single step}} <b>process,</b> <b>room</b> temperature magnesium alloy chips are fed into {{the back end of}} a heated barrel through a volumetric feeder. The barrel is maintained under an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the magnesium chips. A screw feeder located inside the barrel feeds the magnesium chips forward as they are heated into the semi-solid temperature range. The screw rotation provides the necessary shearing force to generate the globular structure needed for semi-solid casting. Once enough slurry has accumulated, the screw moves forward to inject the slurry into a steel die.|$|E

40|$|Local {{transient}} hydrogen {{concentrations were}} evaluated inside a large <b>process</b> <b>room</b> when the hydrogen gas {{was released by}} three postulated accident scenarios associated with the process tank leakage and fire leading {{to a loss of}} gas confinement. The three cases considered in this work were fire in a room, loss of confinement from a process tank, and loss of confinement coupled with fire event. Based on these accident scenarios in a large and unventilated <b>process</b> <b>room,</b> the modeling calculations of the hydrogen migration were performed to estimate local transient concentrations of hydrogen due to the sudden leakage and release from a glovebox system associated with the process tank. The modeling domain represented the major features of the <b>process</b> <b>room</b> including the principal release or leakage source of gas storage system. The model was benchmarked against the literature results for key phenomena such as natural convection, turbulent behavior, gas mixing due to jet entrainment, and radiation cooling because these phenomena are closely related to the gas driving mechanisms within a large air space of the <b>process</b> <b>room.</b> The modeling results showed that {{at the corner of the}} <b>process</b> <b>room,</b> the gas concentrations migrated by the Case 2 and Case 3 scenarios reached the set-point value of high activity alarm in about 13 seconds, while the Case 1 scenario takes about 90 seconds to reach the concentration.

40|$|AZ 91 {{magnesium}} alloy {{has been successfully}} <b>processed</b> at <b>room</b> temperature by high–pressure torsion {{as well as at}} elevated temperatures. Ultrafine grains and nano–sized particles of ?–phase have developed with increasing number of turns. The hydrostatic pressure, the geometry of the processing zone and the unidirectional nature of torsional straining during the HPT processing have facilitated processing of AZ 91 alloy at room temperature. Extensive grain refinement and twinning segmentation of the coarse grains have been observed in the microstructures <b>processed</b> at <b>room</b> temperature and elevated temperatures, respectively. The twins have been observed at all processing temperatures during processing and their distribution was proportional to the processing temperature and number of turns. The morphology and distribution of the ?–phase have altered during processing, with fragmentation of coarse clusters of the ?–phase into nano–sized particles and the alignment of these particles in the direction of torsional strain being observed. Microstructural homogeneity has gradually developed at a relatively low number of turns using the lower processing temperature and continued with increasing number of turns. A significant improvement in the strength of the alloy has been found after HPT processing at all processing temperatures. The dislocation density has developed significantly for the alloy <b>processed</b> at <b>room</b> temperature rather than at elevated temperatures with increasing number of turns. An experimental Hall–Petch relationship has emphasized a significant dependence of the strength on grain size for the alloy <b>processed</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. The high–strain rate superplasticity, low–temperature superplasticity, and thermal stability of the processed alloy have been observed and attributed to the ultrafine–grained microstructures produced by HPT at room temperature and the dispersion of nano–sized ?–phase particles. Grain–boundary sliding was the main deformation mechanism during the high–strain rate superplasticity regime. Glide–dislocation creep accommodated by grain–boundary sliding was the deformation mechanism operating during the low–temperature superplasticity regime.

The content of SASM was ???constructed??? video created by melding multiple moving images with pre-existing photographs to create suspended narratives and simulacra. Its significance lies in its critique of societal relationships with the veracity of images in the context of web-base information technologies. How does a media saturated society compartmentalize imagery? To what extent does an audience rely on collective memory when interpreting visual language? How does the ???mediated memory??? affect our sense of self and culture? SASM was selected by the curatorial team at IMMA forming part of the Spring 2010 programme including solo shows by Philippe Parreno, Linda Benglis, and photography from MoMA New York exhibition. SASM was supported by a programme of public lectures, including a panel discussion, entitled ???From Process to Practice???, hosted by curator Valerie Connor. SASM innovates the use of experimental editing techniques to create ???constructed??? video works to create fictive identities and scenarios from a myriad of sources. It is unique in its use of this technique to reignite the debate about reality in documentation.

40|$|The Saltstone Sampling and Analyses Plan {{provides}} {{a basis for}} the quantity (and configuration) of saltstone grout samples required for conducting a study directed towards correlation of the Performance Assessment (PA) related properties of field-emplaced samples and samples processed and cured in the laboratory. The testing described in the saltstone sampling and analyses plan will be addressed in phases. The initial testing (Phase I) includes collecting samples from the <b>process</b> <b>room</b> in the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) and transporting them to Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) where they will cure under a temperature profile that mimics the temperature in the Saltstone Disposal Unit (SDU) and then be analyzed. SRNL has previously recommended that after the samples of fresh (uncured) saltstone are obtained from the SPF <b>process</b> <b>room,</b> they are allowed to set prior to transporting them to SRNL for curing. The concern was that if the samples are transported before they are set, the vibrations during transport may cause artificial delay of structure development which could result in preferential settling or segregation of the saltstone slurry. However, the results of this testing showed there was no clear distinction between the densities of the cylinder sections for any of the transportation scenarios tested (1 day, 1 hour, and 0 minutes set time prefer to transportation). The bottom section of each cylinder was the densest for each transportation scenario, which indicates some settling in all the samples. Triplicate hydraulic conductivity measurements on samples from each set of time and transportation scenarios indicated that those samples transported immediately after pouring had the highest hydraulic conductivity. Conversely, samples that were allowed to sit for an hour before being transported had the lowest hydraulic conductivity. However, the hydraulic conductivities of all three samples fell within an acceptable range. Based on the cured property analysis of the three samples, there is no clear conclusion about transporting the samples before they are set; however, experience with saltstone grout indicates the samples should sit and develop some structure before being transported to SRNL for curing...|$|E

40|$|Analytical, numerical, and {{experimental}} modeling methods are presented to predict deformation after the cure process of thin unsymmetric laminates for piezoelectric actuation. During fabrication, laminates deform to several post-cure room temperature shapes. Thin cross-ply laminates deform to a circular cylindrical post-cure shape while thicker laminates deform to a saddle shape. Post-cure shapes {{are dependent on}} ply orientation, thickness, and material properties. Because, CLT alone does not always predict the correct post-cure room temperature shape of the thin composite laminates, an extension of CLT with the Rayleigh-Ritz technique and potential energies are used to better predict these shapes. Finite element models are used to predict the post-cure room temperature shapes. Thin composite laminates are modeled coupling heat transfer and structural mechanics, which are necessary for modeling the cure process. Modeling the fabrication process captured important data such as residual stresses from the cure <b>process,</b> <b>room</b> temperature shapes, and bi-stability of the composite laminates.
