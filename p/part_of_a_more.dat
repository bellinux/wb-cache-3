5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (<b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, {{and if a}} green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

In this paper, we develop a new multiscale Fourier-based object description in 2 -D space using a low-pass Gaussian filter (LPGF) and a high-pass Gaussian filter (HPGF), separately. Using the LPGF, at different scales, represents the inner and central <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object <b>more</b> than the boundary.

For this purpose, an extensive laboratory testing programme was carried out to examine the effect of cement contents on the mechanical and physical properties of different treated soils.

The results constitute a preliminary useful guide to adapt the construction techniques in actual field applications...|$|R

50|$|Hägerstrand's {{father was}} a teacher at a remote {{elementary}} school and the family lived at the school. Hägerstrand recalled that his early education {{was based on the}} pedagogical ideas of Swiss educator Johann Pestalozzi. Several of Hägerstrand's students speculated that his holistic and visionary thinking was rooted in his early education: He was taught local geography, history and folklore at home in the Pestalozzi tradition which was being introduced at that time. Cartography, geology, botany and agronomy were all interrelated <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> holistic understanding <b>of</b> processes within <b>a</b> spatial area.

Roosevelt {{would go on to}} be the first Democratic president to win the black vote, in 1936. In 1934, Hawkins supported the more controversial 1934 California gubernatorial election of Upton Sinclair, a socialist. Although Sinclair lost, Hawkins defeated Republican Frederick Madison Roberts, the great-grandson of Sally Hemings and President Thomas Jefferson and the first African American in the California State Assembly. Hawkins would serve as a Democratic member of the Assembly from 1935 until 1963, by the time of his departure being the most senior member, like Roberts before him.|$|E

40|$|Biomechanics {{and motor}} control are {{discussed}} as <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> general science, physics of living systems.

Mechanics-based hypotheses in motor control, such as those originating from notions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> generalized motor program and internal models, are non-physical. The famous problem of motor redundancy is wrongly formulated; {{it has to be}} replaced by the principle of abundance, which does not pose computational problems for the central nervous system.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{consequences}} of macroeconomic policy for labor market outcomes {{in the presence of}} frictions. It shows how policy may be useful in overriding frictions, as well as how it might generate adverse outcomes. The analysis looks at the main tools of macroeconomic policy and pertains to both the non-stochastic steady state and to business cycle fluctuations. A partial-equilibrium, empirically-grounded model is used to simulate policy effects. It relies on <b>a</b> reduced-form VAR <b>of</b> the actual data to specify the stochastic behavior of exogenous variables, precluding the possibility that labor market results will be affected by misspecifications in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> general macroeconomic model. The key results are that policy has effects on the stochastic behavior of key variables - measures that reduce unemployment also reduce its persistence and increase the volatility of vacancies. Hiring subsidies and unemployment benefits have substantial effects on labor market outcomes, while employment subsidies or wage tax reductions are not very effective policy instruments...|$|R

25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E
