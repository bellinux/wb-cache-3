5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for <b>private</b> <b>sale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Firearm tracing {{starts at}} the {{manufacturer}} or importer and typically ends at the first <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> regardless if the private seller later sell to an FFL or uses an FFL for background checks. Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm {{at a flea market}} or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E
5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into {{both houses of}} the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the House bill could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E
50|$|Sotheby's links sellers with {{prospective}} buyers in private if sellers {{do not want}} a public auction. The identities of buyers and consignors are not disclosed. Sotheby's <b>Private</b> <b>Sales</b> works with clients with confidentiality and tailors the buying and selling process in a <b>private</b> setting. <b>Private</b> <b>Sales</b> accounted for 16.5% of all Sotheby's sales in 2011. That year, Sotheby's inaugurated a new gallery space called S2 at its York Avenue headquarters with a show of work by American abstract painter Sam Francis. Unlike Haunch of Venison, a gallery that Christie's bought in 2007, S2 is solely devoted to showcasing the auction house's <b>private</b> <b>sales.</b> The company reported $513 million in <b>private</b> <b>sales</b> {{in the first half of}} 2012, making commission revenues of $41.5 million on them. In 2013, Sotheby's opened a gallery for <b>private</b> <b>sales</b> close to its branch in London, in a five-story block at 31 George Street. The auction house also conducts <b>private</b> <b>sales</b> through its selling exhibitions of monumental sculpture at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, and at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.|$|R

5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the find}} was {{reported}} under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal {{are not covered by}} the act. The finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E

25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by <b>private</b> <b>sale</b> or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the layout}} {{designed}} by J. R.

The estate was completed in 1969. Reinforced concrete was the main material used due to its low cost and ease of use. 30% of the houses constructed were intended for <b>private</b> <b>sale,</b> an unusually high percentage, with most of the privately sold houses being around the Park Lane area of the estate. As well as residential properties, there was also a shopping centre in the eastern part of the estate, five schools, two churches and a swimming pool. There were some clear links to the aviation heritage of the site within the names of the roads, with the three main roads running the length of the estate being constructed on the runways of the airfield, and the 34 tower blocks that contained 2,000 flats. There were two major concentrations of tower blocks within the estate: fourteen along Farnborough Road, and the 'Centre 8', a group of 8 large tower blocks in the centre of the estate. The following is a list of the tower blocks constructed on the estate.|$|E
