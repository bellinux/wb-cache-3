40|$|A spirin is a trade name, {{owned by}} Bayer, for acetylsal-icylic acid (ASA). Although this name is {{considered}} generic in many countries, {{such as the}} United States, {{it is not in}} Canada.

Its basic mechanism of action was discovered by Vane, Bergstrom, and Samuelsson in the 1970 s, which resulted in their obtaining a Nobel prize in 1982.

40|$|ABSTRACT Members of the {{structurally}} diverse {{class of}} drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{have the ability}} to prevent or reduce the occurrence of colorectal, certain other gastrointestinal, and perhaps other cancers. The antic arcinogenic property of NSAIDs has been shown in epidemiological studies with humans and in experimental carcinogenesis studies with anfinals. In addition, clinical studies of the human disease familial adenomatous polyposis have demonstrated the efficacy of NSAIDs in mediating regression of colorectal adenomas. The mechanism of the anticarcinogenic effect of these drugs is not known, but most hypotheses have involved the common property of the NSAIDs to inhibit prostaglandin synthase (PHS) enzymes and thereby cause a subsequent reduction in levels of prostaglandins (PG) in tissue. Recent reports have questioned the role of PHS inhibition in the anticarcinogenic activity of NSAIDs by showing that some NSAID-related compounds that are not PHS inhibitors can induce the same anticarcinogenic changes in cell cycle and apoptotic response as the PHS inhibitors. In this review we will examine the evidence that NSAIDs are anticarcinogenic, the evidence supporting PHS as the target of NSAIDs, and the evidence for and against inhibition of PG synthesis as the mechanism of cancer prevention by NSAIDs. -Levy, G.

40|$|<b>Prostaglandin</b> endoperoxide <b>H</b> <b>synthases</b> 1 and 2, {{also known}} as cyclooxygenases (COXs) 1 and 2, convert arachidonic acid (AA) to <b>prostaglandin</b> endoperoxide <b>H</b> 2. <b>Prostaglandin</b> endoperoxide <b>H</b> <b>synthases</b> are targets of nonspecific nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs and COX- 2 -specific inhibitors called coxibs. PGHS- 2 is a sequence homodimer. Each monomer has a peroxidase and a COX active site. We find that human PGHS- 2 functions as a conformational heterodimer having a catalytic monomer (Ecat) and an allosteric monomer (Eallo). Heme binds tightly only to the peroxidase site of Ecat, whereas substrates, as well as certain inhibitors (e. g. celecoxib), bind the COX site of Ecat. Ecat is regulated by Eallo in a manner dependent on what ligand is bound to Eallo. Substrate and nonsubstrate fatty acids (FAs) and some COX inhibitors (e. g. naproxen) preferentially bind to the COX site of Eallo. AA can bind to Ecat and Eallo, but the affinity of AA for Eallo is 25 times that for Ecat. Palmitic acid, an efficacious stimulator of human PGHS- 2, binds only Eallo in palmitic acid/murine PGHS- 2 co-crystals. Nonsubstrate FAs can potentiate or attenuate actions of COX inhibitors depending on the FA and whether the inhibitor binds Ecat or Eallo. Our {{studies suggest that the}} concentration and composition of the free FA pool in the environment in which PGHS- 2 functions in cells, the FA tone, is a key factor regulating PGHS- 2 activity and its responses to COX inhibitors.

However, in the group of animals with a 2 -min ischemia and the tolerance group, in which a 2 -min bilateral carotid occlusion was followed 3 days later by a 6 -min ischemia, no hippocampal or cortical damage was detected. Accordingly, the JNK and COX- 2 mRNA levels remained unaffected.

We have studied the effects of acetaminophen on inducible and constitutive prostanoid biosynthesis in monocytes and platelets in vitro. To discriminate between the inhibitory effect of the drug on PGHS-isozymes vs PGE-synthases (PGESs), parallel measurements of PGE 2 and thromboxane (TX) B 2 were carried out. Since antioxidant enzymes and cofactors, present in plasma, may affect acetaminophen-dependent inhibition of prostanoids, comparative experiments in whole blood vs isolated monocytes were performed. Acetaminophen inhibited LPS-induced whole blood PGE 2 and TXB 2 production, in a concentration-dependent fashion [IC 50 μM (95 % confidence intervals) : 44 (27 – 70) and 94 (79 – 112), respectively]. Therapeutic plasma concentrations (100 and 300 μM) of the drug more profoundly reduced PGE 2 than TXB 2 (71 ± 3 vs 54 ± 4 and 95 ± 0. 8 vs 78 ± 2 %, respectively, mean±s. e. mean, n= 6, P< 0. 01). Differently, in isolated monocytes stimulated with LPS, both PGE 2 and TXB 2 production was maximally reduced by only 60 %.

METHODS: Cultured bovine coronary microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to physiologic levels of 171 -estradiol (0. OnM [about 2. 7 pg/mL], 0. 1 nM [about 27 pg/mL], or 1. 0 nM [about 270 pg/mL]) for 4, 8, or 24 hours. Thromboxane (TXA 2), prostacyclin (PGI 2), and nitric oxide (NO) were measured as their stable metabolites, thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), 6 -keto prostaglandin Flu (6 -keto PGF 1 oJ, and nitrite (NO 2), respectively. RESULTS: Estradiol had no effect on nitrite production. However, exposure to 0. 1 nM and 1. 0 nM estradiolfor 24 hours reduced TXB 2 production to 67 ± 16 % and 69 ± 12 % of control, respectively. Furthermore, 0. 1 nM and 1. 0 nM estradiol also reduced production of 6 -keto PGF,, to 35 ± 19 % and 17 ± 11 % of control, respectively. <b>Prostaglandin</b> <b>H</b> <b>synthase</b> expression was not altered by estradiol.

AANO 2 exhibited time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of peroxidase activity in both PGHS- 1 and - 2. The plot of kobs versus AANO 2 concentrations showed a hyperbolic function with kinact = 0. 045 s− 1 and Ki*app = 0. 019 μm for PGHS- 1 and kinact = 0. 057 s− 1 and Ki*app = 0. 020 μm for PGHS- 2. Kinetic analysis suggests that inactivation of PGHS by AANO 2 involves two sequential steps: an initial reversible binding event (described by Ki) followed by a practically irreversible event (Ki*app) leading to an inactivated enzyme. Inactivation was associated with irreversible disruption of heme binding to the protein. The inhibitory effects of AANO 2 were selective because other nitro-fatty acids tested, such as nitrooleic acid and nitrolinoleic acid, were unable to inhibit enzyme activity.

Both enzymes are homodimers, but the monomers often behave asymmetrically as conformational heterodimers during catalysis and inhibition. Here {{we report that}} aspirin maximally acetylates one monomer of human (hu) PGHS- 2. The acetylated monomer of aspirin-treated huPGHS- 2 forms 15 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid from AA, whereas the nonacetylated partner monomer forms mainly PGH 2 but only at 15 to 20 % of the rate of native huPGHS- 2. These latter conclusions {{are based on the}} findings that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac binds a single monomer of native huPGHS- 2, having an unmodified Ser 530 to inhibit the enzyme, and that diclofenac inhibits PGH 2 but not 15 -hydroperoxyeicosatraenoic acid formation by acetylated huPGHS- 2. The 18 R- and 17 R-resolvins putatively involved in resolution of inflammation are reportedly formed via aspirin-acetylated PGHS- 2 from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively, so we also characterized the oxygenation of these omega- 3 fatty acids by aspirin-treated huPGHS- 2. Our in vitro studies suggest that 18 R- and 17 R-resolvins could be formed only at low rates corresponding to less than 1 and 5 %, respectively, of the rates of formation of PGH 2 by native PGHS- 2...|$|R
