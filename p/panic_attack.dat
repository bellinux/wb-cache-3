5|$|In series five Adam hires a nanny, Jenny (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), to {{look after}} Wes while he takes part in operations. Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a <b>panic</b> <b>attack</b> after learning that Wes has briefly run away from home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation. In the series finale, Adam is revealed to be suicidally depressed, wishing he had died in Fiona's place. But after another <b>panic</b> <b>attack,</b> {{he is able to}} pull through, save fellow officer Ros Myers (Hermione Norris), and escape from the Thames Barrier before they both drown.|$|E

While the mechanism of how smoking increases <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder.

5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a <b>panic</b> <b>attack),</b> Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode.

Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} evidence that <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> are common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little is known if posttraumatic panic is comparable to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> observed in <b>panic</b> disorder (PD). Objective: This study examined the cognitive responses to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> in participants with PD and PTSD. Method: Participants with PD (n 22) and PTSD (n 18) were assessed on the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV and subsequently administered the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire and a measure of fears related to trauma memories. Results: Although participants {{did not differ in}} terms of catastrophic appraisals about somatic sensations, PTSD participants were more likely to experience fears about trauma memories and being harmed by trauma again during their <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> than PD participants. Conclusions: These findings suggest that although PTSD participants fear somatic outcomes during <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> their <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> are distinguished by a marked fear of trauma memories...|$|R

5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and hide from the Devil. Favorite was supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a <b>panic</b> <b>attack</b> and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) observes {{his car in}} her {{driveway}} and, not wishing her son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) to see it, drives it a {{few blocks}} away to conceal it. Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When he hesitates to do so without identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a <b>panic</b> <b>attack</b> until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} and psychopathological features of depressions with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> Patients and methods. A total of 100 in- and outpatients aged 18 to 60 years, who had been treated in the S. S. Korsakov Clinic of Psychiatry for mild and moderate depression with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> were clinically examined using the psychometric scales: the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Atypical Depression Diagnostic Scale, and the Sheehan Clinical Anxiety Rating Scale. Results. The clinical and psychopathological picture of depression with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> differed significantly in three identified groups of patients with neurotic depression (ND), recurrent depressive disorder (RDD), and bipolar affective disorder (BAD). NDs with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> were characterized by insignificant short-term symptoms of dreariness, indistinct anhedonia with the maximum manifestation of personality sensitivity, and a tendency to alcohol abuse. DDRs with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> were inherent in melancholic and dreary symptoms, anhedonia, classical circadian mood fluctuations, and the most marked reactivity of mood. Depressions with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> within BAD were typical of apathetic manifestations, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and alcohol craving. Conclusion. Depressions with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> have psychopathological features depending on whether they develop within ND, RDR, or BAD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This paper extends {{previous}} epidemiological findings linking <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> {{with future}} episodes {{of depression and}} examines whether this relationship is independent {{of the effects of}} gender and neuroticism. Methods: Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) DSM-IV diagnoses from a stratified multi-stage population survey of 10, 641 Australian adults were analysed using logistic regression {{to examine the relationship between}} lifetime <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> gender, neuroticism and mental disorders. Results: People who experienced full CIDI DSM-IV <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> more than 12 months ago were 4 times more likely to meet criteria for current Depressive Disorder than those who reported no <b>attacks.</b> Those with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> in the past 12 months were 13. 3 times more likely to report current Depressive Disorders. A similar pattern was also present for non-panic Anxiety Disorders (odds ratio = 7. 5 for lifetime, but not 12 -month <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> and 21. 46 for 12 -month <b>panic</b> <b>attacks)</b> and for Substance Use Disorders (2. 1 and 4. 6, respectively) suggesting a broader relationship with psychopathology than previously reported. For each of these groupings of mental disorders, <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> accounted for significant variability over and above the effects of gender, neuroticism, and comorbid Anxiety Disorders.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Panic</b> <b>attacks</b> are {{characterized}} with sudden attacks of anxiety with numerous somatic symptoms, such as palpitations, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vertigo. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> in patients with panic disorder, especially, to determine the specific relationship of somatic and neurological symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> in boundaries of somatic systems. Material and methods. The study sample consisted of 97 patients with primary diagnosis of panic disorder, without any acute, severe and unstable somatic illness. The presence and frequency of symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> were estimated by the Panic Disorder Questionnaire. Results. The study results indicate that the most frequent symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> were cardiological signs (heart pounding or racing) and trembling, followed by unsteady and fainting feeling symptoms, sweating, respiratory symptoms and gastroenterological symptoms. The results of correlation analyses indicate that symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> classified into cardio-vascular, gastro-enterological, respiratory and neuro-otological systems show statistically significant correlations. Conclusion. The results of analyses of symptoms of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> point to their intercorrelation. This specific association of the symptoms, if they are examined on their own in the patients, could lead to false clinical manifestation of some somatic illness. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze adequately and make the proper differential diagnosis of patients with panic disorder...|$|R
5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate).

40|$|Objective: One of the {{proposed}} revisions for DSM- 5 is to rate <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> as a separate dimension across all mental disorders. The idea is that <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> occurring outside <b>panic</b> disorder are a dimension predicting important clinical outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to validate the proposition for DSM- 5 that <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> have predictive value for overall psychopathology onset, course, and functioning. Method: Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a prospective population-based study. Using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (with classifications based on DSM-III-R), 5, 571 subjects were selected who had (1) no panic history, (2) a history of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> (but no <b>panic</b> disorder), (3) current <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> or (4) current panic disorder. The impact of panic status on the prevalence of anxiety, affective, alcohol, and any mental disorders; on the onset and persistence of these disorders during 3 -year follow-up; and on levels of functioning during 3 -year follow-up (as assessed with the 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey) was examined. Results: Current <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> outside the realm of panic disorder were associated with increased prevalence of mental disorders (? 2 3 = 490. 6; P <. 001), increased onset of mental disorders (hazard ratio = 4. 42; 95 % CI, 2. 88 - 6. 80), persistence of mental disorders (odds ratio = 2. 72; 95 % CI, 1. 53 - 4. 82), and impaired functioning during 3 -year follow-up (F = 69. 67; P <. 001). Although the impact was smaller than for panic disorder, the associations identified for <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> were consistent and significant and were, to a lesser extent, also found for a history of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> Conclusions: Given the consistent impact of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> on various aspects of psychopathology, the proposition to dimensionally rate <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> across all mental disorders may be of great value for clinical care. © Copyright 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc...|$|R

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to {{determine the}} relationship between self-reported respiratory and other lung disease and <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol/substance use disorders. Results: After adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbid mental disorders, and comorbid physical disorders, self-reported respiratory disease (ie, asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema) was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> (odds ratio, 1. 7; confidence interval, 1. 2 to 2. 4). Other self-reported lung disease was also associated with a significantly increased odds of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> (odds ratio, 2. 3; confidence interval, 1. 2 to 4. 2), and having both self-reported respiratory disease and another lung disease was associated with increased likelihood of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> (odds ratio, 4. 1; confidence interval, 1. 7, 9. 9).
