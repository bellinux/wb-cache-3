5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|A Ganapatya legend {{recalls how}} the creator-god Brahma, the preserver-god Vishnu and the dissolver-god Shiva, the Divine Mother Devi and the Sun-god Surya {{mediated}} at Morgaon {{to learn about}} their creator and their purpose of existence. Ganesha emerged before them in form of an Omkara flame and blessed them. Another legend records that when Brahma created his son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water pot. Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the pot. When Brahma tried to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E

5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out.

5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

25|$|Maple toffee: Also {{known as}} maple taffy. A popular springtime treat in maple-growing areas is maple toffee, where maple syrup boiled to a {{concentrated}} state is poured over fresh snow congealing in a toffee-like mass, and then eaten from a wooden stick used to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> from the snow.|$|E

25|$|Later that month, on January 20, in Horn Hill, Limestone County, Texas, Hardin {{claimed he}} {{killed a man}} in a gunfight after an {{argument}} at the circus. Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a saloon girl home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when he bent over to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens, {{the males}} rub off {{hormonal}} secretions onto {{the skin of}} the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball {{far down the}} field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching it with his toe, he might <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and run with it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed {{that it was not}} infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E
25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial {{the phone or}} <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E
25|$|The final daily {{original}} Peanuts {{comic strip}} was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained {{a note to}} the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.|$|E

25|$|When the cricket ball {{is inside}} the boundary, it is live. When the ball is {{touching}} the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball back in {{to the field of}} play rather than <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.|$|E
25|$|In the UK and Ireland, to {{coincide}} with the game's launch, GameStop exclusively sold the 320GB 'Classic White' PlayStation 3 system in stores across Ireland and the UK, since GameStop obtained the exclusive right to sell the console on September 9, 2011. The console was bundled with two 'Classic White' DualShock 3 controllers, and launched on November 1; one day before the launch of Uncharted 3 in Europe. For mainland UK buyers the console was only available online, while buyers in Ireland could <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in their local store. The console was also sold in GameStop stores in Europe, Micromania and EB Games Australia and e-commerce sites from November. In North America, {{to coincide}} with the game's launch, a limited edition hardware offering featured a 320GB 'Charcoal Black' PlayStation 3 system, a 'Charcoal Black' DualShock 3 controller, a free month of PlayStation Plus, and a copy of Uncharted 3.|$|E
25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E
