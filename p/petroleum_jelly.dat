5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b> Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene (PS) offers {{excellent}} {{clarity and}} stiffness at an economical cost. It {{is commonly used}} with dry products including vitamins, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jellies,</b> and spices. Styrene does not provide good barrier properties, and exhibits poor impact resistance.|$|R
50|$|Grease is a semisolid lubricant. Grease {{generally}} {{consists of}} a soap emulsified with mineral or vegetable oil. The characteristic feature of greases is that they possess a high initial viscosity, which upon the application of shear, drops to give the effect of an oil-lubricated bearing of approximately the same viscosity as the base oil used in the grease. This change in viscosity is called shear thinning. Grease is sometimes used to describe lubricating materials that are simply soft solids or high viscosity liquids, but these materials do not exhibit the shear-thinning properties characteristic of the classical grease. For example, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jellies</b> such as Vaseline are not generally classified as greases.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the use of}} personal lubricants for sexual intercourse is limited and has primarily focused on condom compatibility and breakage, with only recent limited assessment of lubricant safety and possible epidemiologic implications. This article discusses the global evidence of lubricant compatibility with latex condoms and biological safety of lubricants, as well as documentation of lubricant use and current guidelines for HIV prevention programming in Africa. Data on lubricant compatibility with condoms are less available than commonly realized, and many lubricant products may not have been thoroughly tested for safety due to flexible regulatory environments. Recent laboratory and study findings from microbicides research also suggest that some water-based lubricants may have safety issues. Some African populations are using several types of lubricants, especially oil-based <b>petroleum</b> <b>jellies,</b> and receive little evidence-based guidance. More research is needed from the medical community to guide prevention programming...|$|R
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly,</b> {{petrolatum}} or soft paraffin is a semi-solid {{mixture of}} hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. The raw material for <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> was discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist from New York. In 1870, this product was branded as Vaseline <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Jelly.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves like, {{is the usual}} guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> will dissolve in gasoline because both <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, dissolve in ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve in gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|E

25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort; since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical antacid suspensions. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of wanting}} to {{eliminate}} them, Rockefeller saw himself as the industry's savior, [...] "an angel of mercy" [...] absorbing the weak and making the {{industry as a whole}} stronger, more efficient, and more competitive. Standard was growing horizontally and vertically. It added its own pipelines, tank cars, and home delivery network. It kept oil prices low to stave off competitors, made its products affordable to the average household, and, to increase market penetration, sometimes sold below cost. It developed over 300 oil-based products from tar to paint to <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> to chewing gum. By the end of the 1870s, Standard was refining over 90% of the oil in the U.S. Rockefeller had already become a millionaire ($1 million is equivalent to $ in [...] dollars).|$|E
500|$|The {{contest between}} St-Pierre and Penn {{was a source}} of {{significant}} controversy. In between rounds one and two, as well as round three, one of St-Pierre's cornermen, Phil Nurse, was seen applying <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> (brand name Vaseline) on the shoulder and the back of St-Pierre by members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). Vaseline is used to aid cuts in boxing as well as MMA, but applying it to parts of the body other than the face is illegal because of the element of grappling in the sport. A fighter that is [...] "slippery" [...] {{as a result of the}} vaseline will have an added advantage, because friction and grip are compromised. UFC President Dana White addressed the issue during a radio appearance in Boston, Massachusetts. He indicated that he did not believe the vaseline influenced the outcome of the fight, but still expected Nurse to be punished.|$|E
2500|$|British and German {{propellant}} charges {{differed in}} packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b> It {{was a good}} propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly.</b> While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite. [...] While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the cradle}} cap is not severe, it could simply be combed out gently after bathing. The {{softened}} scales {{can then be}} brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done very gently, this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. [...] Applying <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. [...] The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning. [...] Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|E
2500|$|This {{meant that}} about 75 times the {{propellant}} would immediately ignite {{when exposed to}} flash, {{as compared to the}} U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (RP C/12, handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition. [...] German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: centralite. This was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.|$|E
2500|$|The fight ended {{after the}} fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, {{requested}} that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted {{that he could not}} recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because [...] "I was probably borderline knocked out or something." [...] During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp. Dana White said it was unfortunate GSP's dominant win was overshadowed by the cornerman controversy. [...] "Do I think that he got greased? Yeah, I do," [...] White told The Canadian Press prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. [...] "Absolutely, 100 per cent, I think that that guy was rubbing grease on him. Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{same year}} on December 18, 2012 a jury awarded a $23 million {{settlement}} to a 14-year-old {{boy who had}} been molested repeatedly by his fifth grade teacher at Queen Anne Place Elementary School in the Mid-Wilshire area, {{one of the largest}} awards {{in the history of the}} school system. Forest Stobbe, a long time veteran teacher of Queen Place Elementary pleaded no contest to two counts of lewd acts on a child and repeated sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. The boy in question was 10 at the time of the abuse. At the time of trial the boy's attorney, Stephen Estey, asked for a $25 million verdict citing the school district's history of negligence, ignoring, [...] "a number of red flags and complaints by other victims and as a result Stobbe grew bolder and inflicted a lifetime of harm on our defenseless client." [...] Although Stobbe had no official criminal record, the Jury ruled that the school district, [...] "should have heeded complaints that preceded the molestation." [...] A previous female student complained Stobbe fondled her buttocks, and two years prior to his arrest Stobbe had been seen with a female student alone in his car. Among the insurmountable evidence against Stobbe was a jar of <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> on his desk that tested positive for the boy's DNA. The Los Angeles Unified School District was found 30% liable for the damages, and was responsible for $6.9 million of the final settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Undeterred, though vilified for {{the first}} time by the press, Flagler and Rockefeller {{continued}} with their self-reinforcing cycle of buying competing refiners, improving the efficiency of his operations, pressing for discounts on oil shipments, undercutting his competition, making secret deals, raising investment pools, and buying rivals out. [...] In less than four months in 1872, in what was later known as [...] "The Cleveland Conquest" [...] or [...] "The Cleveland Massacre", Standard Oil had absorbed 22 of its 26 Cleveland competitors. Eventually, even his former antagonists, Pratt and Rogers, saw the futility of continuing to compete against Standard Oil: in 1874, they made a secret agreement with their old nemesis to be acquired. Pratt and Rogers became Flagler and Rockefeller's partners. Rogers, in particular, became one of Flagler and Rockefeller's key men {{in the formation of the}} Standard Oil Trust. Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Standard Oil. For many of his competitors, Flagler and Rockefeller had merely to show them the books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer. If they refused his offer, Flagler and Rockefeller told them they would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction.
