2500|$|He also {{possesses}} less commonly described powers, including abilities {{allowing him}} to [...] "home in" [...] to his place of origin in New Mexico; resist <b>psychic</b> <b>control,</b> or unwilling transformation; grow stronger from radiation or dark magic; punch his way between separate temporal or spatial dimensions; and to see and interact with astral forms. [...] Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related; his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits, since the bomb site was also {{the place where the}} Maestro's skeleton was and Maestro's spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation.|$|E
2500|$|... 2112: Fortean manifestations {{occur in}} the city and across the globe, as the {{subterranean}} Deros attempt to invade; an East Meg 2/MC1 Psi team stops them. Dredd resigns and takes the Long Walk, following doubts about the Judge System caused both by Kraken and his role in breaking up the Democratic March. Silver covers up Dredd's retirement and Kraken assumes Dredd's place. While in the Cursed Earth, Dredd is injured and rendered amnesiac by the Sisters of Death. Meanwhile, the Sisters of Death are able to psychically influence Kraken into helping them cross over into Mega-City One and to free the Dark Judges from limbo. The city is turned into a Necropolis – the Judges are under <b>psychic</b> <b>control,</b> with Silver abandoning his post and being turned into a zombie for Death's amusement; decay, disease, starvation and suicide are rampant; and the Dark Judges hold daily cullings. A handful of judges who escaped brainwashing, including Dredd and McGruder returned from their Long Walks, are able to banish the Sisters, execute Kraken and capture the Dark Judges (except Death and the Sisters), but not before 60 million citizens have been killed. McGruder assumes the post of Chief Judge again, but without a Council of Five. The Hunters Club organises the sponsored charity massacre [...] "Death Aid" [...] for Necropolis orphans. The anonymous figure later known as Tempest takes covert control of Mega-City One's criminal underworld.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} 'easy' {{about any of}} these phenomena," [...] I answered. [...] "As Richet says, they are absurd, but they are {{observed}} facts. It would not be fair to the spiritists to end the account of these sittings without frankly stating {{that there were many}} other phenomena very difficult to explain by Bottazzi's theory. There came a time, as he admits, when 'a mysterious entity behind the curtain, among us, almost in contact with us, was felt all the time.' This entity was supposed to be 'John King,' the <b>psychic's</b> <b>control.</b> This being, invisible for the most part, gave roses to those he liked, conversed freely, and in one case threw a bunch of flowers in the face of one of the sitters to whom Eusapia had taken a dislike. A little later 'John' presented a small drum from behind the curtain, and, when Galeotti tried to take it, 'John' pulled it out of his hands. Again he offered it, and Galeotti seized it, and the two fought for its possession with such violence that the drum was nearly torn to pieces." ...|$|R
50|$|Omen was blonde and had {{her eyes}} sewn shut; she could create illusions with her <b>psychic</b> powers and <b>control</b> peoples thoughts. This made her a {{valuable}} member of N.O.W.H.E.R.E., as she enforced Harvest's will amongst his henchmen and prisoners.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, Bottazzi {{declares}} the phantoms also {{conformed to}} this same law. He was determined upon educating 'John King,' and kept {{insisting that the}} invisible hands press the rubber ball, or lower the registry balance, or set the metronome going, and Eusapia repeatedly moaned: 'I can't find,' 'I can't see,' or 'I don't know how.' Once she complained that the objects were too far off--that she could not reach them!--all of which sustained Bottazzi in his belief that these activities were absolutely under her <b>psychic</b> <b>control,</b> just as the synchronism of movements convinced {{him that she was}} 'the physiologic factor in the case.' All of this is very exciting to me, for I have had the same feeling with regard to the several mediums whose activities I have closely studied. Bottazzi says, with regard to the results of the first two sittings: 'These first séances show that Eusapia needed to learn how to make these movements with which her invisible hands were unfamiliar, just as she would have had to learn to make them with her visible hands. You will all observe that he did not permit awe or superstitious reverence for the medium or her phantoms to balk his experiments.' A convinced spiritist who attended one of the séances was scandalized by the tone and character of the tests. These professors were continually bobbing up {{to see what was going}} on, disturbing conditions, stirring things up as with a spoon to see how it was all going on. They broke the chain of hands whenever they wanted to see what 'the spirits' were doing. In other words, these scientists were students, not devotees. They were experimenting, not communing with the dead." ...|$|E

"Not in this case; but at {{a sitting}} which {{followed}} this, during such time as I sat beside the <b>psychic</b> and <b>controlled</b> one hand, I plainly saw the supernumerary arm and hand dart forth and seize a pencil. I saw a hand very plainly cross my knee and grasp me by the forearm. All of this has its bearing upon this very curious phenomenon of the reproduction of 'E. A's.' youthful signature, which remained very puzzling to us all." ...|$|R

They teleported into the Grand Hall, killed Chief Judge Silver and took <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> over {{the minds of the}} judges.

5000|$|Part two, [...] "Electronic Revolution" [...] {{concerns}} {{the power of}} alphabetic non-pictorial languages to control people. It {{draws attention to the}} subversive influence of the word virus on humans and dangerous possibilities of using human voice as a weapon.

5000|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, the lyrics focus less on the classically Satanic themes of the band's early work, instead referring to occult and conspiracy theory concepts such as <b>psychic</b> powers, mind <b>control,</b> and alien tampering with human evolution.

50|$|In Mendoza in Hollywood, the {{botanist}} Mendoza and {{her companion}} Einar were thrown forward in time from 1863 to 1996 in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. This {{is supposed to}} be impossible, but Mendoza is a Crome generator, a <b>psychic</b> who cannot <b>control</b> her potential, and Laurel Canyon is a focus of Crome radiation (explaining its attraction for certain kinds of people over the years!).|$|R
50|$|The {{initiation}} ceremony, {{with certain}} regional variations, involved the initiate catching a male toad, hanging {{it from a}} thorn bush or pegging it to an anthill until its bones had been picked clean, and then carrying the bones on their person until dried. The bones were then thrown into a running stream on a full moon at midnight and all except one would be swept downstream. The remaining small fork-shaped bone when recovered would, through unspecified means, grant its holder <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> over horses.|$|E
5000|$|... "Expecting" [...] is episode 12 {{of season}} 1 in the {{television}} show Angel. Written by Howard Gordon and directed by David Semel, it was originally broadcast on January 25, 2000 on the WB network. In [...] "Expecting", Cordelia, having spent the night with her charming date, wakes up carrying a near-term pregnancy. Research reveals she and several other women bear the spawn of a Haxil Beast that uses men as sexual surrogates. Angel and Wesley {{must find a way}} to break the demon's <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> over its human incubators before they deliver - an ordeal likely to be lethal to the hosts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{duplicate}} bridge, sponsoring organizations often {{impose a}} number of restrictions on psychic bids. For example, psychs of strong artificial opening bids (such as strong two clubs) are not allowed by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL). In addition, if the partner is perceived to have bid abnormally due to taking account of a psych, then the score may be adjusted. Also, if the partnership has an agreement about a [...] "check bid" [...] or <b>psychic</b> <b>control,</b> used to verify the psych, such convention {{is referred to as}} a brown sticker and may be banned from certain levels of competition.|$|E
5000|$|According to James Randi, {{a skeptic}} who has debunked many claims of psychic ability and {{uncovered}} fraudulent practices, mediums who do cold readings [...] "fish, suggest possibilities, make educated guesses and give options." [...] Randi has a standing offer of $1 million US dollars {{for anyone who}} can demonstrate <b>psychic</b> ability under <b>controlled</b> conditions. Most prominent psychics and mediums have not taken up his offer.|$|R
5000|$|Stryfe {{appears as}} a boss in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse voiced by Daniel Riordan.

50|$|In Plamo Kyoshiro {{the players}} use <b>psychic</b> power to <b>control</b> the robots as avatars of {{themselves}} as if the model and the player were a single being. This concept {{was used as the}} basis of Mobile Fighter G Gundam, where fighters handle their robots as their bodies. The fire fist of Domon Kashu and the God Gundam with the face of Domon is an aspect taken from the manga.|$|R
5000|$|Roulette {{appears in}} the Necrosha event in New Mutants (vol. 3), {{along with the other}} {{deceased}} Hellions, having been resurrected by Selene's magic and the transmode virus. She again appears infected with the transmode virus in the [...] "Fight the Future" [...] arc of New Mutants (vol. 3). Her interest in Cypher was apparently more than just indulgence of her love of mischief; during the Necrosha storyline, when Roulette - resurrected by Selene - is temporarily possessed by Karma, interrupting Selene's <b>psychic</b> <b>control,</b> she reflects over Cypher's prone form that she used to 'think (she) loved' him.|$|E
5000|$|A brief battle {{ends with}} Weapon Brown {{defeated}} and imprisoned by Linus {{thanks to a}} quasi-sentient life form Linus has <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> over (which Linus refers to as his 'Security Blanket'), who is attempting to raise [...] "The Great Pumpkin". Astonishingly, he succeeds, but Weapon Brown breaks free of his confinement and destroys Linus' blanket. Shocked at {{the death of his}} weapon, Linus then falls victim to the Pumpkin itself, which kills Linus, Weapon Brown's younger sister, and the woman Weapon Brown has come to save. The sole survivors of the encounter are Weapon Brown and Snoop, who leave the Pumpkin Patch, their fates from that point on unknown.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after this, Jack Marlowe, Grifter and Agents Wax and Mohr {{set up a}} trap for Smith at UCLA. Wax {{tried to}} use his <b>psychic</b> powers to <b>control</b> the killer's mind, but his plan failed when Mohr {{attacked}} Smith. While Agent Wax was only injured, Mohr was cut in half by Smith's powers. The battle ended when Marlowe appeared to end Smith's killing spree: Spartan easily withstood Smith's beams, leaving Grifter to shoot Smith {{in the back of}} the head.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{is written}} in journal or diary form, and purports to be a self-written {{bioassay}} of the spirituality and the psychological effects obtained from smoking the leaves of salvia divinorum. It {{is written in}} the tradition of other bioassayers such as Alexander Shulgin's PiHKAL and Aldous Huxley's Doors of Perception, but with aggressively active engagements in the psychedelic environment. The author claims to use salvia to negotiate with and <b>control</b> <b>psychic</b> entities, which he refers to as [...] "Totem Pole People".|$|R
50|$|It is {{seen that}} the <b>Psychic</b> Beacon has <b>controlled</b> {{the minds of the}} President and General Ben Carville and several other key {{officials}} in the city, who surrender to the Soviets. However, a strike team is sent into the city and destroys the Psychic Beacon while encountering attacks by mind-controlled civilians, freeing the key officials from Soviet mind control and allowing them to be rescued. Despite this, Washington, D.C. still remains in Soviet hands, forcing the American government and military to relocate themselves to Canada to escape the threat of Soviet mind control.|$|R
50|$|In a final battle, Varnae — a {{previous}} Lord of Vampires {{who has already}} returned — takes <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> of King and directs him to kill his comrades. King stakes himself instead. Drake attempts to sacrifice his own life to kill Varnae, engineering an Exorcist-powered explosion. Blade, in self-defense, has already staked Taj Nital, his old comrade from The Tomb of Dracula (who had been turned vampiric between the two series). Blade survives and attends his teammates' funeral but encounters King again in the subsequent series Blade. There he learns King's plunge into a metal pole (rather than silver or wood) had fortuitously not killed him {{and that he had}} escaped the explosion. King also informs Blade that Drake was left scarred and crippled in both body and mind.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Wolverine is {{following}} a lead {{on a new}} mutant, arriving {{just in time to}} stop a crew of U-men from killing Angel Salvadore for her insect wings. Despite her reluctance in accepting her mutation, and anyone's help in coming to grips with it, she does follow Wolverine back to the Institute, where several squads of U-men are about to assault and slaughter the student body. Jean Grey, with help from her students, fends off the attack, eventually manifesting a phoenix raptor display in psychic dominance. Emma Frost and Cyclops escape from their captors, with Emma confronting John about the damage done to her cosmetically enhanced face, threatening to drop him from the highrise window his office sits in. John forces himself from Emma's grip, seemingly convinced by Martha Johansson, a floating brain in a jar John used to exert <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> of his captives.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, {{two teenage}} girls, Zella Hopp and Gertrude Leo, {{feeling that he}} had taken too much <b>psychic</b> <b>control</b> over their lives, had him charged with {{kidnapping}} (alleging that Leo had been prevented three times from leaving the institute) and briefly imprisoned. [...] Hopp reported that, for a pre-induction, Bernard had her strip and placed his hand upon her left breast, explaining that he was testing her heartbeat. [...] "I cannot tell you how Bernard got his control over me or how he gets it over other people. He is the most wonderful man in the world. No women seem able to resist him.... He had promised to marry me many times. But when he began the same thing with my little sister age sixteen I decided I would expose the whole matter. If it had only been myself I wouldn't have done it for the whole world." [...] Three months later, the charges were dropped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{backdrop}} of Gilgamesh is the fight between two opposing forces. One {{of the forces}} {{is known as the}} Gilgamesh, led by Terumichi Madoka (better known as Enkidu), and the other side is the Countess of Werdenberg and the three Orga-Superior children who live with her. In appearance, the Orga-Superior are indistinguishable from humans. However, they carry a special power known as [...] "Dynamis" [...] (a variation of the Greek [...] "Dunamus" [...] meaning [...] "strength" [...] "power" [...] especially [...] "miraculous power") which allows them to use <b>psychic</b> energy and <b>control</b> objects using only their mind. The overarching theme of Gilgamesh is one of choosing sides.|$|R
5000|$|With the Messiah {{dead and}} his {{rebellion}} crushed Squealer is defeated. Renouncing the name the humans gave him, Squealer is sentenced to perpetual torture of the [...] "Infinite Hell" [...] where {{his body is}} simultaneously regenerated and destroyed using psychic powers. However, Saki is troubled when Squealer explains the reasons behind his revolt, claiming that his people are human. Later, Saki learns from Satoru that the Monster Rats are the descendants of normal humans whose DNA had been altered with mole rat genes {{to make it easier}} for the <b>psychic</b> humans to <b>control</b> them, since they will not trigger Attack Inhibition and Death Feedback. Now feeling sorry for Squealer, Saki secretly puts him out of his misery.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} saved, but the United States {{is still in}} a {{precarious}} position. The Soviets, with the help from their <b>Psychic</b> Beacon, still <b>control</b> St. Louis {{and all of the}} Mississippi River south of the city, seriously handicapping movement between the western states and the eastern states. The Allies mount an attack on the city, destroying the Psychic Beacon and liberating the city. The Allies learn of a Soviet project to replicate the Allied Prism technology, a technology that creates massive beams of energy to destroy units, at a research base in Tulum, Mexico. A team of Navy SEALs is dispatched into the area to destroy the research facility and any prototype prism replicas. The mission is successful and the Allied Prism technology is not compromised.|$|R
