50|$|The basic aim of {{steering}} is {{to ensure}} that the wheels are pointing in the desired directions. This is typically achieved by a series of linkages, rods, <b>pivots</b> and <b>gears.</b> One of the fundamental concepts is that of caster angle - each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel; this makes the steering tend to be self-centering towards the direction of travel.|$|R
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage {{doors were}} bowed {{in cross section}} allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> points.|$|R
25|$|With the {{reverser}} in mid {{gear position}} since {{there should be}} no superimposed return crank motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the <b>pivot</b> in mid <b>gear</b> and of radius equal to the length of the radius rod. This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the radius rod.|$|R
2500|$|The {{retractable}} {{hand operated}} main landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivoted</b> upward to allow take offs and landings on {{water and the}} [...] wheel assemblies could also be jettisoned after take off, increasing range and performance, but necessitating a water landing. The Sperry Land and Sea Triplane was the first American aircraft {{to make use of}} retractable landing gear, developed by Sperry in 1915.|$|R

50|$|In 1963 Austin Baer, an MIT-trained engineer, {{earned a}} patent for his design of hinge leaves with intermeshed gears. In 1968, {{he earned a}} second patent for adding thrust {{bearings}} to the original design. All geared hinges today are based on this design, which distributes the doorâ€™s weight over the entire door length rather than concentrated on two or three spots as with butt or <b>pivot</b> hinges. The <b>gears</b> allowed fluid movement as {{the door opened and}} closed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{situations}} where a crosswind is present, the aircraft will drift laterally as it approaches the runway. This drift poses significant safety issues because safe {{operation of the}} undercarriage requires the body and track of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway at touch down. The landing gear designs of the [...] "pioneer era" [...] 1909 Bleriot XI, and the much later Cold War B-52 strategic jet heavy bomber, were designed and each built with an unusual feature to counteract the problem: with the B-52, all four of its landing gear bogies could be steered, allowing the aircraft to land with the wheels facing the direction of travel even if the nose was not pointed in the same direction. The Bleriot XI had <b>pivoting</b> main <b>gear</b> legs, which passively allowed the main gear wheels to castor together about each of their vertical axes as a unit to allow small-angle crosswind landings, with bungee-cord loaded rigging members between the lower ends of the main wheel forks, to bring the wheels back to a [...] "directly-ahead" [...] orientation after touchdown.|$|R
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage {{doors were}} bowed {{in cross section}} allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> points. Stronger undercarriage legs were raked 2inches (5.08cm) forward, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground and}} reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. During production of the Mk VIII and Mk IX a new undercarriage leg was introduced which had external v-shaped [...] "scissor-links" [...] fitted {{to the front of the}} leg; this also led to small changes in the shape of the undercarriage bay and leg fairings. Because the Spitfire was no longer to be used as a night fighter, the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with the}} earlier Bf 108, the new design was based on Messerschmitt's [...] "lightweight construction" [...] principle, which aimed to {{minimise}} the number of separate parts in the aircraft. Examples of this {{could be found in}} the use of two large, complex brackets which were fitted to the firewall. These brackets incorporated the lower engine mounts and landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> point into one unit. A large forging attached to the firewall housed the main spar pick-up points, and carried most of the wing loads. Contemporary design practice was usually to have these main load-bearing structures mounted on different parts of the airframe, with the loads being distributed through the structure via a series of strong-points. By concentrating the loads in the firewall, the structure of the Bf 109 could be made relatively light and uncomplicated.|$|R

5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "universal wing" [...] the new design was {{standard}} on the majority of Spitfires built from mid 1942. This wing was structurally modified to reduce labour and manufacturing time and {{it was designed to}} allow mixed armament options: A type, B type, or four 20 mm Hispano cannon. The undercarriage mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage doors were bowed in cross section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> points.

5000|$|The {{brand new}} F-100C was flown by Lt. Barty R. Brooks, {{a native of}} Martha, Oklahoma and a Texas A&M graduate, of the 1708th Ferrying Wing, Detachment 12, Kelly AFB, Texas. The {{aircraft}} {{was one of three}} being delivered from North American's Palmdale plant to George AFB, California, but the nose <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> pin worked loose, allowing the wheel to swivel at random, so he diverted to Edwards, which had a longer runway. On approach, at a high angle of attack, the fighter exceeded its flight envelope, and, too far into stall condition, lost directional control with fatal results. These scenes were inserted in the movie The Hunters, starring Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner, in the movie X-15 with actor Charles Bronson playing the unlucky pilot, and in the Made for TV film Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, although in The Hunters and in Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, the aircraft supposedly represented were respectively an F-86 and an F-5E. The incident was also commemorated in the fighter pilot song [...] "Give Me Operations" [...] (set to the tune of the California Gold Rush song [...] "What Was Your Name in the States?"): ...|$|R
5000|$|The Universal wing {{also took}} into account {{the fact that the}} Hispano cannon had been {{converted}} to belt-feed, a move which allowed each cannon to carry double the ammunition load, or 120 rpg in ammunition trays instead of 60 rpg as in the original drum-fed cannon of the F.Mk Vb. This also eliminated the need for under- and over-wing blisters to accommodate the large-diameter ammunition drum, instead only requiring a small blister to cover the electrical [...] "Chattellerault" [...] feed mechanism.The undercarriage mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage doors were bowed in cross section allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing <b>gear</b> <b>pivot</b> points.The stronger undercarriage legs were angled 2 inches (5.08 cm) forward when extended, making the Spitfire more stable on the ground and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. In addition the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted. Structural hard-points were added outboard of the wheel-wells, allowing racks to be fitted under each wing which were capable of carrying one 250 lb (113 kg) bomb each.|$|R
