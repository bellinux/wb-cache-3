25|$|The {{research}} effort suffered several blows in 2013. In January 2013, {{a quarter}} of MSU's tenure-track faculty told Cruzado {{that they did not}} see the university <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> hiring advanced faculty, improving research faculty salaries, improving laboratory space, or working {{to increase the number of}} graduate students—elements they said would go far to maintaining or improving the university's status as a high-activity research university. Research income for the 2012-2013 school year fell 16.6 percent to $93.7 million, which Cruzado said was due to federal budget cuts. On May 20, 2013, MSU's long-time Vice President for Research, Creativity and Technology Transfer, Thomas McCoy, left the university to take a similar position at the University of North Texas. Anne Camper, Associate Dean of the College of Engineering, was named interim vice president. That same month, an informal faculty poll showed that maintaining MSU's reputation as a high-activity research university was the highest priority of faculty. But tension between research faculty and non-research faculty was also very high. The number of graduate and doctoral students at the university also slipped. Graduate students (which included master's degree and doctoral degree students was 1,980 in 2010-2011, but just 1,888 in 2012-2013. The university strategic plan set a goal of 2,350 graduate students by 2019. The number of doctoral students was also inconsistent. There were 45 in 2010-2011, 56 in 2011-2012, but just 53 in 2013-2013. The strategic plan set a goal of 80 per year by 2019.|$|E
2500|$|The Knights' 1995–96 OHL season {{went down}} in history as the worst {{in the history of the}} Canadian Hockey League. The Knights set a new record for {{futility}} by finishing with nine points and a 3–60–3 record. The years following the so-called [...] "Knightmare" [...] season were improved, but the team was still a long way from the league's upper echelon. Meanwhile, the Ice House was falling apart as the Tarry family had stopped <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> it as a part of their lobbying the city of London for a new arena. However, the re-signing of former Head Coach Gary Agnew, and the signing of future NHLers Rico Fata and Tom Kostopoulos heralded a marked turnaround for the team's fortunes. In 1999, the Knights went on an unexpected playoff run, in which they defeated the number-one-in-the-CHL Plymouth Whalers in seven games in the quarterfinals and ultimately went all the way to the OHL championship, which they lost in seven games to the Belleville Bulls.|$|E

2500|$|A Swiss project, called [...] "Solartaxi", has circumnavigated the world. This is {{the first}} time in history an {{electric}} vehicle (not self sufficient solar vehicle) has gone around the world, covering 50000km in 18 months and crossing 40 countries. It is a road-worthy electric vehicle hauling a trailer with solar panels, carrying a 6 m² sized solar array. The Solartaxi has Zebra batteries, which permit a range of 400km without recharging. The car can also run for 200km without the trailer. Its maximum speed is 90km/h. The car weighs 500kg and the trailer weighs 200kg. According to initiator and tour director Louis Palmer, the car in mass production could be produced for 16000 Euro. Solartaxi has toured the World from July 2007 till December 2008 to show that solutions to stop global warming are available and to encourage people in pursuing alternatives to fossil fuel. Palmer suggests the most economical location for solar panels for an electric car is on building rooftops though, likening it to <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> a bank in one location and withdrawing it in another.|$|E

6000|$|... 148. I may {{interrupt}} {{myself for}} a moment to give you an instance of what I mean. The most wretched houses of the poor in London often pay ten or fifteen per cent. to the landlord; and I have known an instance of sanitary legislation being hindered, to the loss of many hundreds of lives, in order that the rents of a nobleman, derived from the necessities of the poor, might not be diminished. And it is a curious thing to me to see Mr. J. S. Mill foaming at the mouth, and really afflicted conscientiously, because he supposes one man to have been unjustly hanged, while by his own failure, (I believe, wilful failure)[A] in stating clearly to the public one of the first elementary truths of the science he professes, he is aiding and abetting the commission of the cruelest possible form of murder on many thousands of persons yearly, for the sake simply of <b>putting</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the pockets of the landlords. I felt this evil so strongly that I bought, in the worst part of London, one freehold and one leasehold property, consisting of houses inhabited by the lowest poor; in order to try what change in their comfort and habits I could effect by taking only a just rent, but that firmly. The houses of the leasehold pay me five per cent.; the families that used to have one room in them have now two; and are more orderly and hopeful besides; and there is a surplus still on the rents they pay after I have taken my five per cent., with which, if all goes well, they will eventually be able to buy twelve years of the lease from me. The freehold pays three per cent., with similar results in the comfort of the tenant. This is merely an example of what might be done by firm State action in such matters.|$|E
