40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has affected European pensions {{in both the}} short and longer term. Members of funded pension systems nearing retirement experienced a sharp contraction in pension wealth as equity markets fell. Market turmoil has damaged public trust in such schemes and has caused employers to revise their pension obligations. Countries running funded schemes based on a share of mandatory contributions are faced with rising transition costs as unemployment rises and tax bases shrink. Pressure on public expenditure has caused some governments to raise <b>pensionable</b> <b>ages</b> and even cut pensions in payment, while reducing future public pension obligations. Thus the crisis has forced politicians to address the consequences of societal ageing while exposing the fallibility of funded schemes {{as a source of}} pension security. Fundamental questions about the prolongation of working lives remain to be resolved...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} a Bill has been {{introduced}} into the Dail containing proposals for the inauguration of a contributory pensions scheme, it seems opportune to review the position generally in regard to the problem of old age and the methods of making financial provision for it through private channels. There have been developments in this sphere in recent years, and interest in it has grown for a variety of reasons. The increasing numbers of persons reaching <b>pensionable</b> <b>ages</b> have contributed to a greater awareness of the need for security and adequate standards of living in old age?an awareness no doubt quickened by the war. The consequent growth of pension schemes and arrangements calls for some study of their effect on the economy, and the fall in the value of money presents other problems, including the question as to whether pension schemes should be funded or not...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the issues raised}} by the proposed abolition of the mandatory retirement age {{as a result of the}} Equal Treatment Directive, 2000 / 78 /EC, and of proposed Age Discrimination in Employment Regulations. It argues that there are a number of distinctive retirement ages, namely, the contractual retirement <b>age,</b> the <b>pensionable</b> retirement <b>age</b> and the actual or normal retirement age. These may coincide or they may occur at different times, but it is only the contractual retirement age that is likely to be abolished by the Regulations. Their effect upon the retirement age will therefore be limited. As part of the research for this article a number of TUC affiliated trade unions were interviewed in order to gain an employee perspective of the issues surrounding the abolition of mandatory retirement ages...|$|R

25|$|Lynch's {{first term}} as Taoiseach also {{witnessed}} various reforms {{in areas such}} as welfare and education. In 1967, a redundancy payments scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three miles from the nearest school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of <b>pensionable</b> <b>age,</b> while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1918 {{his term}} {{of service in}} the police force was {{completed}} and he had reached <b>pensionable</b> <b>age.</b> However, the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee asked him to stay on in office, and he did so, until 1944. Around this time Richardson instigated the installation of a Police Out-Station at Kings Cross, Halifax, which was a mini replica of Harrison Road. This, he said, would benefit the police and, just as important, the local population, and set the scene for {{what was to become}} Neighbourhood Policing in the UK many years later. The first Police van for the Halifax Borough Police was purchased in 1920. Richardson supervised the purchase and modifications were made so that it could be used for various other purposes, not least of which was for use by The Coroner's court in Halifax. By 1922 Halifax had many theatres and cinemas. Richardson made and published a booklet regarding the safety of people in 'Queues at Licensed Places of Entertainment' involving their health, weather protection and creating crush room amongst other headings. This followed a tragedy in London when some people died in a cinema fire because the emergency doors opened inwards. Richardson ensured all such doors opened outwards from now on. From 16 January 1924 the Borough was granted the status of a 'Quarter Session town'. This affected procedure and routines for Richardson and his police/court work. From this time he was very active in a Prosecutors role in Court cases. In 1925 he wrote a book called 'The Evolution of the Police Force.' and also wrote a booklet 'Superannuation in the Police Force'.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining <b>pensionable</b> <b>age),</b> and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale), a Social Fund (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. A law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. A law of 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. A law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Richardson was {{entitled}} to retire in 1918 when he had reached <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> within the Police Force. He was persuaded by the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee {{at this time to}} remain in office. In 1938 he informed the Council that he wished to retire, but again he was persuaded to stay in office, as war seemed inevitable. In 1943, when it became apparent that the Second World War was going to be over fairly soon he officially gave notice to the Council {{that he was going to}} retire, giving three months notice dated from 13 September 1943. It was noted in the Halifax Police Force Officers and Constables Book, that Alfred Herbert Richardson, [...] "Joined 8th June 1903. Superannuated 31 October 1943." [...] The Watch Committee resolved that in recognition to the service he had given to the Authority, (40years) it granted he may relinquish the post on 31 October 1943. It immediately resolved that subject to Home Office approval the post would be advertised in the press by advertisement. Alfred Richardson took his last police parade in the courtyard of the Police Station in Harrison Rd. on 30 October 1943. He received much praise from the Halifax Special Constabulary and the Town Council in the various speeches made at this time, and in official meetings held before his day of departure. He had made no secret of the fact that he did not approve of women police and in fact none was appointed during his term of office. After his retirement it was nearly a full year before the first woman police officer was appointed at Halifax.|$|E
