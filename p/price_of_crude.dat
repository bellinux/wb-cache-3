40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to analyse causality between <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> corn, <b>crude</b> oil and ethanol. The analysis conducted in this paper is a dynamic one, and the data used consist <b>of</b> weekly futures <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> oil, corn, and ethanol from January 5, 2007 till April 11, 2014. The assessment of causal links between <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> corn, <b>crude</b> oil and ethanol is carried out {{with the use of}} rolling regression applied to augmented-VAR framework proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995). The application of the rolling regression procedures into the modified Wald (MWALD) causality test allows for the investigation of the persistence of stability in causal relations between analysed prices. The results obtained indicate that the linkages between energy prices and agricultural commodity prices change in the period analysed. The results of Granger causality tests reveal that in the analysed period the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> corn influences the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> energy (<b>crude</b> oil and ethanol). Also crude oil prices influence corn prices and ethanol prices. However, the influence <b>of</b> ethanol <b>prices</b> on <b>crude</b> oil prices and corn prices has not been observed. ...|$|R

25|$|With {{these two}} concepts, it {{appeared}} that existing cargo conversions of aircraft like the 747 would result in airlift prices just below the current <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>crude.</b> This was not particularly practical, but given the great improvements over initial concepts, further studies followed. The first of these considered adaptations of the existing 747F freighters, removing the jet fuel from the wings due to the short range (relying instead on tanks in the fuselage and tail). With the load on the wings reduced, cargo could be carried along the spans or in the wing tanks. With these changes, in mid-summer 1970 Boeing presented a plan that could deliver oil for $1.50 to $2.00 a barrel. The oil companies were not interested. At the time, a barrel sold for about $3.|$|E

By the season's end, J.R. and Cliff's situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother from running Wentworth Tool & Die, due to Cliff's embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff lies in a coma. J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody's fault but Cliff's for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and says she does not know if she can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies.

This debate was rooted in the persistent decline in the value of the United States dollar relative to other global currencies. The choice of currencies available to price crude oil was limited for OPEC because of the inadequate liquidity of most other currencies. With the recent emergence of the euro, the issue of choice <b>of</b> currency for <b>pricing</b> <b>crude</b> oil has emerged once again for policy discussion. The current paper is focused on the implications of a shift in the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> oil from United States dollar to euro on OPEC members. Winners and losers are identified based on economic gains and losses. It is concluded that while such a policy would incrementally benefit OPEC en bloc, it would result in a disadvantage for the countries whose major trading partner is the United States and, therefore, would not be a Pareto optimal solution.
