5|$|In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as {{the first}} person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female {{entertainer}} and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> but was not a billionaire. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire. In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the United States Office of War Information {{reported}} {{on interviews with}} 20 Korean comfort women in Burma which found that the girls were induced by the offer of <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> an opportunity to pay off family debts, easy work, {{and the prospect of}} a new life in Singapore. Many girls enlisted for overseas duty {{on the basis of these}} false representations, and were rewarded with an advance of a few hundred yen. Only some of these girls who had paid their debt were allowed to return to Korea.|$|E

25|$|Fisher wrote {{a letter}} of {{recommendation}} to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., resulting in Thomas' being hired for the Ziegfeld Follies. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she walked right up and asked for the job. She made her stage debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1915 on June 21, 1915. Thomas' popularity in the Follies led to her being cast in Ziegfeld's more risqué Midnight Frolic show. The Frolic was staged after hours in the roof garden of the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to bestow on the young and beautiful female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that German Ambassador Albrecht von Bernstorff {{had given her a}} $10,000 string of pearls.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the ancient}} writers and Jewish theologians (see above), Luther {{considered}} occult or magic practices {{to be in}} violation of this commandment, explaining that those who seek benefit in such ways “make a covenant with the devil, in order that he may give them <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> or help them in love-affairs, preserve their cattle, restore to them lost possessions, etc. For all these place their heart and trust elsewhere than in the true God, look for nothing good to Him nor seek it from Him.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One social {{stereotype}} of a Yorkshireman {{had a tendency}} to include such accessories as a flat cap and a whippet; this alludes to rural life. While the stereotype might not always ring true, the county certainly has an illustrious rural history; many of the now prominent West Yorkshire cities grew {{thanks in part to the}} wool industry. Another {{stereotype of}}ten heard in connection with Yorkshire workers is the proverb [...] "where there's muck, there's brass"; this refers to the widely held view that where one is willing to do unpalatable work, there is <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to be made.|$|E

60|$|After {{a moment}} a lady {{appeared}} behind him, walking softly, {{so as not}} to be heard. She was superbly dressed after the newest and the most costly Parisian design. The brooch on her bosom was a single diamond of resplendent water and great size. The fan in her hand was a master-piece of the finest Indian workmanship. She looked what she was, a person possessed <b>of</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> superfluous <b>money,</b> but not additionally blest with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> superfluous intelligence to correspond. This was the childless young widow of the great ironmaster--otherwise, Mrs. Glenarm.|$|R

[...] In the general election, he took the position that there was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in Richmond if adequately prioritized for transportation and pledged to cut waste from the state government, opposing tax increases for transportation improvements, such as funding for adding lanes to Interstate 95 or additional cars for the Virginia Railway Express, both of which were eventually achieved without an increase in transportation taxes.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires." [...] Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. [...] "Are you asking me how much money I have?" [...] he said. [...] "I got <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there {{in the back of the}} room." [...] Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image.

No one had seen him come and no one would miss him. We were both clean-shaven, and his hair was about the same length as my own. If I changed clothes with him, then Dr. Aloysius Lana would be found lying dead in his study, and there would be an end of an unfortunate fellow, and of a blighted career. There was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> ready <b>money</b> in the room, and this I could carry away with me to help me to start once more in some other land. In my brother's clothes I could walk by night unobserved as far as Liverpool, and in that great seaport I would soon find some means of leaving the country. After my lost hopes, the humblest existence where I was unknown was far preferable, in my estimation, to a practice, however successful, in Bishop's Crossing, where at any moment I might {{come face to face with}} those whom I should wish, if it were possible, to forget. I determined to effect the change.|$|R
2500|$|To {{gain the}} support of the Iranian public, Dunsterville made an effort to relieve the famine, caused partly by a drought and partly by Russian and Ottoman {{military}} operations in north-west Iran. The Dunsterville Mission had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and recruited local labour to repair roads. By a ruse, Dunsterville got the local grain merchants, mostly supporters of the Democratic Party and in the pay of the Germans, to stop hoarding, which proved very popular. The Democrats retaliated by claiming that the British had poisoned the wheat and sniped at the British in Hamadan but public support for the British increased as the famine relief measures took effect. The Dunsterville Mission was also able to establish an intelligence organisation that saw all telegrams and letters concerning the mission. After the Bicherakov Cossack detachment moved from Kermanshah to Kazvin and blocked the Jangalis from using the Teheran road, the mission was able to arrest the passage of German and Ottoman agents with local levies of Christian Assyrians for local order and security duties. The prisoners were guarded a party of the 1/4th Hampshire and the [...] "Irregulars", a military force was raised from the hill peoples of the north-west closer to the Ottoman border, to oppose an Ottoman move against the Persian road from Armenia.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} {{reports in the}} media of Atta and Shehhi going to Shuckum's Oyster Pub and Seafood Grill, a sports bar in Hollywood, Florida, on September 8, 2001. Atta, Shehhi, and a third unidentified man reportedly drank heavily and played the Golden Tee '97 arcade game there. The bartender said [...] "Atta drank vodka and orange juice, while Shehhi preferred rum and cokes, five drinks apiece. They were wasted [...]" [...] Manager Tony Amos described, [...] "The guy Mohamed was drunk, his voice was slurred {{and he had a}} thick accent." [...] Bartender Patricia Idrissi said the men argued over the bill, and when she asked if there was a problem, [...] "Mohamed said he worked for American Airlines and he could pay his bill." [...] Atta said, [...] "I have <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> I'm a pilot." [...] And he hauled a wad of $50 and $100 bills from his pocket, eventually leaving a $3 tip. However, Atta flew on US Airways Flight 2719 to Baltimore at approximately 3:15 p.m. on September 7 from Fort Lauderdale, and therefore could not have been at Shuckum's that evening. On September 8, Atta was in Laurel, Maryland, where he went to a Safeway grocery store to wire $2850 to Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad in Dubai, and sent another $5000 to Ahmed from a Giant Food store in Laurel on the same day. On September 9, Atta flew on to Boston.|$|E

50|$|Even {{during the}} years from 1975 to 1988, when darts was either booming and/or had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> prize <b>money</b> and {{television}} coverage, {{there was a certain}} discontent bubbling under the surface amongst some of the top players, particularly with John Lowe. These issues were about why players lost money whenever they played for their country, why players had no say whatsoever in the running of darts, and why players would be prevented from wearing their personal sponsors on their shirts during tournaments, and also forced to wear BDO sponsors. Lowe mentions in his autobiography, entitled Old Stoneface, that he was prevented from wearing his sponsor Unicorn on his shirt during tournaments, and was compelled to allow Unicorn's rivals Winmau to be put on his shirt instead for free. Lowe mentions that he and some other players would hold meetings with the BDO about these issues, but that nothing really changed. Due to the widespread television coverage and the prize money in darts at this time, any confrontations between the complainants and the BDO, never became too serious until 1988, when all remaining darts tournaments on television, except the World Championship, were getting cancelled after being held for the last time.|$|R
5000|$|A {{protracted}} {{legal and}} political battle ensued during which Taiwan sought an extradition of General Mow from Mexico, and the recovery of $6,400,000 million in US courts. General Mow never disputed that he embezzled the funds. He {{claimed to be a}} [...] "patriot, preserving all the millions for the people (of China), when they should cast off their present government." [...] Richard O'Connor from the Coronet Magazine commented, [...] "Meanwhile, he spread <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> their <b>money</b> around as a highly unofficial ambassador of good will." [...] It was reported that the Chiang Kai-shek government hired John Broady, an infamous private investigator, to find and recover the missing funds, and to extract General Mow from Mexico. The attempt of removing Mow from Mexico failed, and an attempt to bring some of the recovered security notes to New York ended with the shooting death of Clarence Sopman, a Broady associate, near Mexico City. In the end, General Mow was imprisoned in the Black Palace of Lecumberri, in a prison cell next to Leon Trotsky assassin Ramón Mercader, from 1951 until 1955. Allegedly he paid $350 per month to have [...] "luxury" [...] prison housing, including a valet, cook, and weekly conjugal visits by Agnes Kelly.|$|R

Power gamers are often mistaken for being a munchkin (role-playing games), players who find ways to cheat the game in order to bring characters to higher levels. When other players see high level characters they quickly assume they cheated because people regularly do not play video games in an intense manner. A power gamer follows the rules of the game and simply keeps playing longer than usual to gain more experience virtually as well as mentally. Some gamers become extremely attached to games that they are willing to sacrifice the enjoyment of playing to achieve the game's goals. Players become [...] "overpowered", meaning the game no longer poses a challenge to the player. People often say that power gamers have no life because all they do is play video games and lack as social life. On the contrary, when power gamers spend playing online games they still are included in social activities such as conversing and playing with other players and perhaps other power gamers. Power gamers can be seen as one of the few people who live their lives online due to technology such as computers and gaming consoles.|$|R
