ABSTRACT: In recent years natural biosurfactants have attracted attention because of their low toxicity, biodegradability, and ecological acceptability. Rhamnolipids is composed of rhamnose sugar molecule and ß-hydroxyalkanoic acid. Soil isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens was used to characterize substrate (Mustard oil, Soybean oil, Olive <b>oil,</b> Palm <b>oil,</b> <b>Sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> and Coconut oil) for highest rhamnolipid production. Highest yield of biosurfactants was obtained from Soybean oil as 7. 16 g/L by P. fluorescens. The estimated value of rhamnolipids was 0. 437 g/L using Soybean oil from P. fluorescens by Orcinol method. Bacterium was capable of emulsifying {{a wide range of}} vegetable oils. The emulsification activity was found stable up to 72 hours. Upon characterizing C:N ratio of higher rhamnolipid was obtained at C:N ratio of 40 (93. 75 %) for P. fluorescens using Soybean oil as carbon source and Ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. It was revealed that partially purified rhamnolipid of P. fluorescens showed highest emulsification at optimum temperature 4 °C for Palm <b>oil,</b> <b>Sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> and Coconut oil (90 % all), at pH 6 and pH 7 in Palm <b>oil,</b> <b>Sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> and Coconut oil (90 % all) and for 5 % NaCl concentration in palm oil (94. 44 %) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the composition of sterols in vegetable oils used in industrial frying operations, and sterols and sterol oxides in the fried potato products. The sterols and sterol oxides were enriched by saponification of oils and by solid phase extraction. Preparative thin layer chromatography, capillary gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were used to give qualitative and quantitative data. The results revealed that the content of desmethylsterols in palm <b>oil,</b> <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil,</b> high oleic <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil,</b> and rapeseed oil/palm oil blend were, 790, 4501, 3550, and 4497 ppm, respectively. Sitosterol was the major desmethylsterol in all samples. Palm oil also contained the lowest levels of total unsaponifiables. The sterols and unsaponifiable contents in <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> were, to some extent, higher than in higholeic <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil.</b> The compositions of sterols after two days of frying were neither markedly different in the oils nor in the potato products fried in these oils compared with the original oils.

Lipids extracted from French fries prepared in rapeseed oil/palm oil blend contained the highest levels of total sterol oxides, 191 ppm, and epoxides of both sitosterol and campesterol were the major contributors, together at a level of 172 ppm.

The underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms are poorly understood. We studied the arrhythmias and the electrophysiologic changes during regional ischemia in hearts from pigs fed a diet rich in fish oil. METHODS: Pigs received diets rich in fish <b>oil,</b> in <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil,</b> or a control diet for 8 weeks. Hearts were isolated and perfused. Ischemia was created by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Diastolic stimulation threshold, refractory period, conduction velocity, activation recovery intervals and the maximum downstroke velocity of 176 electrograms were measured in the ischemic zone. Spontaneous arrhythmias during 75 min of regional ischemia were counted. RESULTS: More episodes of spontaneous ischemia-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation occurred in the fish <b>oil</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> group than {{in the control group}}. More inexcitable myocardium was present in the ischemic zone in the group fed fish <b>oil</b> or <b>sunflower</b> <b>oil</b> than in the control group after 20 min of ischemia.

CONCLUSIONS: A diet rich in fish oil results in proarrhythmia compared to a control diet during regional ischemia in pigs.
