40|$|Elemental sulfur {{has been}} used to {{crosslink}} <b>poly(arylene</b> <b>ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> s. Evidence for crosslinking is presented in terms of rheological data of the melt. The effects of crosslinking on mechanical properties have been examined using tensile creep, stress-relaxation, and dynamic-mechanical properties in torsion. The crosslinking elevates the glass transition temperature (T//g), as measured by the maximum in the loss tangent, and reduces creep strain at temperatures above T//g. A new technique for monitoring cure is also presented. One of the advantages of this method for crosslinking <b>poly(arylene</b> <b>ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> s is that the crosslinking can be carried out both in the solid state and in the melt, the rate being dependent on the temperature (above T//g) of annealing...|$|E

40|$|Amine {{functional}} <b>poly(arylene</b> <b>ether)</b> sulfones {{were previously}} reported. Herein, the chemistry {{was extended to}} amorphous <b>poly(arylene</b> <b>ether)</b> <b>ketones</b> because of their higher fracture toughness values, relative to the polysulfones. It was demonstrated that the amino functional oligomers undergo a self-crosslinking reaction at temperatures above about 220 C. This produces an insoluble, but ductile network that has excellent resistance. A ketamine structure hypothesis was proposed and verified using solid state magic angle NMR. In most cases, the water generated upon ketamine formation is too low to produce porosity and solid networks are obtained. The stability of the ketamine networks towards hydrolysis is excellent. The chemistry was further demonstrated {{to be able to}} crosslink preformed nonfunctional <b>poly(arylene</b> <b>ether)</b> <b>ketones</b> if a difunctional amine was utilized.
