25|$|Deterrence: Theories of {{deterrence}} claim that by sentencing criminals to extremely harsh penalties, other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> considering criminal activities {{will be so}} terrified of the consequences that they will choose not to commit crimes out of fear. In reality, most studies show that high incarceration rates either increase crime, have no noticeable effect, or only decrease it by a very small amount. Prisons act as training grounds for criminal activity, form criminal social networks, expose prisoners to further abuse (both from staff and other prisoners), foster anti-social sentiments towards society (law enforcement and corrections personnel in particular), fragment communities, and leave prisoners with criminal records that {{make it difficult to}} find legal employment after release. All of these things can result in a higher likelihood of reoffending upon release.|$|E

25|$|Menelik II was {{the actual}} founder of modern Ethiopia. Before the {{centralization}} process he completed, Ethiopia had been devastated by numerous wars, {{the most recent}} of which was fought in the 16th century. In the intervening period, military tactics had not changed much. In the 16th century the Portuguese Bermudes documented depopulation and widespread atrocities against civilians and combatants (including torture, mass killings and large scale slavery) during several successive Aba Gedas' Gadaa conquests of territories located north of Genale river (Bali, Amhara, Gafat, Damot, Adal). Warfare in the region essentially involved acquiring cattle and slaves, winning additional territories, gaining control over trade routes and carrying out ritual requirements or securing trophies to prove masculinity. Wars were fought between <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{members of the same}} linguistic group, religion and culture, or between unrelated tribes. Centralization greatly reduced these continuous wars; minimizing the loss of lives, raids, destruction and slavery that had previously been the norm.|$|E

However, fasting blood sugar tests are crucial in making treatment decisions. The American Diabetes Association guidelines are similar to others in advising that the glycated hemoglobin test be performed at least twice a year in patients with diabetes who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control) and quarterly in patients with diabetes whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals.|$|E
500|$|In their {{analysis}} of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed {{the outline of a}} plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: [...] " [...] he would never be safe with that man around". Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not {{to be confused with the}} actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to be frightened off; Deakin agreed to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee—between £5,000 and £10,000 was suggested. Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton always said that he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered—too much, he said, simply to scare someone.|$|E

2500|$|Senior Obama {{administration}} officials said a flood of international and domestic clues suggested a plot involving more than one person.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Shahzad received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban. On May 6, The New York Times, quoting various American officials, said that evidence was mounting that Shahzad's alleged attempt was tied to the Taliban.|$|E

The hostages were flown to Cyprus and then to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Airport, where on 28 September they met President Nixon, who was conducting a State visit to Italy and the Vatican. Speaking to reporters that day, Nixon noted he had told the released captives that [...] "s a result of what they had been through... the possibility of reducing hijackings in the future had been substantially increased, because the international community was outraged by these incidents.

This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|R

50|$|Contemporary data on {{how many}} {{soldiers}} and civilians inhabited Nanking {{at the time of}} the massacre is contradictory and often unreliable.

Various recent estimates put the population of the city in December at as many as 500,000 civilians and 150,000 soldiers or as few as 200,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has also}} argued that Muslims should be {{prevented}} from building mosques in which to teach Jihad unless they have widespread approval from the local community. Cain campaigned for Muslims to be banned from building an Islamic Center at a site in Tennessee, claiming that it was [...] "an infringement and an abuse of our freedom of religion" [...] and [...] "just another {{way to try to}} gradually sneak Shariah law into our laws". Defending himself against the suggestion that this would be discrimination, during an interview he said: [...] "I'm willing to take a harder look at <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> terrorists, that's what I'm saying". [...] On July 18, 2011, Cain declared that communities in the United States had the [...] "right" [...] to ban mosques. He justified his view by arguing that Muslims are trying to promote Shariah law within the U.S, and also that his position did not amount to [...] "religious discrimination". CAIR said that his comments were unconstitutional and could give legitimacy to anti-Muslim bigotry. Southern Baptist Convention leader Richard Land also said that Cain had disregarded the constitutional rights of Muslims.|$|E

50|$|Even {{when the}} charges are more serious, {{prosecutors}} often can still bluff defense attorneys and their clients into pleading guilty to a lesser offense. As a result, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> acquitted {{because of lack of}} evidence, but also who are in fact truly innocent, will often plead guilty to the charge. Why? In a word, fear. And the more numerous and serious the charges, studies have shown, the greater the fear.

It would simply be a temptation to people to swim beyond the breakers. She went on, in a voice that the noise of the surf could not drown, to tell him that she hoped ten thousand more people would say the same thing to him, and to declare that he ought to have several boats outside during bathing hours, so that people could cling to some of them, and so, perhaps, save themselves from exhaustion on their return, and so that one, at least, could be kept free to succor the distressed.
