The new {{technologies}} {{will improve the}} feeling of being together in a shared mediated space and support interaction and collaboration between people who are separated in time or space. Immersive spaces 1. 0 is a software component for the COMPEIT presence system with a feature set that allows users to interact and perform shared actions in virtual spaces, simply using their web browser. The main features are called SharedSpace, a virtual 3 D environment which users can redesign and populate by scaling and rearranging their avatar-like live videostream representations; and PixelPresence which is an overlay technique that offers a pixelated view of a livestream, hereby adding an ambient and discrete <b>presence</b> <b>filter,</b> which indicates movement and subtly prompts users to enter a mediated interaction.   The COMPEIT presence system supports individuals and distributed groups who want to stay close with one another on a regular basis, ready to spontaneously interact in mediated and virtual space. Feedback from users and user requirements in WP 2 showed that people want to be subtly aware of what others are doing, and if they are at a particular place at a given time – which, of course, is quite different to keeping a videolink open 24 / 7. Whether the context is professional or social, ambient forms of presence are thus called for, in order to support gradation and, perhaps more importantly, to prompt users to join a shared virtual space.   QC 20160425 </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{awareness and}} knowledge of cigarette filter ventilation in a national probability sample of smokers of Ultra-light, Light, and regular cigarettes. DESIGN: Random-digit-dialling and computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used on a probability sample of daily cigarette smokers (ages 18 and above). SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 218 Smokers of Ultra-light cigarettes, 360 smokers of Light cigarettes, and 210 smokers of Regular cigarettes living in the continental United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of respondents indicating knowledge of the <b>presence</b> of <b>filter</b> vents {{and the consequences of}} behavioural blocking of vents. RESULTS: Many smokers had not heard about or seen the filter holes: 43 % (95 % CI = 36 to 50 %) of smokers of Ultra-lights, 39 % (95 % CI = 34 to 44 %) of smokers of Lights, and 47 % (95 % CI = 40 to 54 %) of smokers of Regulars. About two in three smokers either did not know of the existence of rings of small holes on the filters of some cigarettes, or did not know that blocking increases tar yields: 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Ultra- lights, 66 % (95 % CI = 61 to 71 %) of Lights, and 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Regulars. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers are generally unaware of the presence and function of filter vents-a major design feature subject to behavioural blocking by smokers and now present on most cigarettes in the United States. Smokers and policy-makers need to be informed about the <b>presence</b> of <b>filter</b> vents and how vent blocking increases tar and nicotine yields from ostensibly very low-yield cigarettes. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{processing}} of texture patterns {{has been characterized}} by a model that postulates a first-stage linear filter to highlight a component texture, a pointwise rectification stage to convert contrast for the highlighted texture into mean response strength, followed by a second-stage linear filter to detect the texture-defined pattern. We estimated the spatial-frequency bandwidth of the second-stage filter mediating orientation discrimination of orientation-modulated second-order gratings by measuring threshold elevation in the <b>presence</b> of <b>filtered</b> noise added to the modulation signal. This experiment yielded no evidence for frequency tuning. A second experiment, in which subjects had to detect similar second-order gratings while judging their modulation frequency, produced bandwidth estimates of 1 – 1. 5 octaves, similar to estimated bandwidths of first-order channels. We propose that an additional dominant-response-selection nonlinearity can account for these apparently contradictory results...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of a DVB-S 2 communication channel, it is necessary to remove the non-linear interferences induced by the power amplifier. Due to the <b>presence</b> of <b>filters</b> in the channel, this non-linear interference is also interference with memory. One of the most used techniques to cancel out the interferences in this case is the order p compensation. The order p compensation can be mathematically described as a recursive algorithm. The non- linear interference is supposed to be smaller after each step of the algorithm. However this is not always the case and it is necessary to define upper bounds on the system to ensure convergence of the algorithm. Upper bounds were already defined for general nonlinear systems, but are however very inaccurate for the case of a DVB-S 2 communication channel. In this paper, we will present two new methods to refine these upper bounds. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{field stress}} path {{experienced}} by a soil element during rain-induced slope failures is reproduced by injecting water in an initially unsaturated specimen under constant total stress conditions. The accumulation of injected moisture {{near the base}} of triaxial specimens causes non-uniformity in the specimen leading to progressive failure.

Water injection experiments were conducted and the behavior of specimens with and without the <b>presence</b> of <b>filter</b> paper was compared under constant shear stress. The use of helical filter paper ensured more uniform distribution of injected moisture, and reduced the discrepancy of moisture along specimen’s height by around 50 %. Improvement in moisture uniformity of the specimen also reduced the possibilities of progressive failure during water injection experiments. The helical filter paper technique was found to hold a strong potential for the reproduction of rain-induced landslide conditions in laboratory triaxial experiments...|$|R

The quality of power that is supplied is also gaining more importance. Power harmonics are called electrical pollution which will degrade {{the quality of the}} power supply. As a result, filtering process for these harmonics is needed in order {{to improve the quality of}} the power supply. Generally passive filters are used to suppress the harmonics of specific orders. Separate filters are required to suppress individual lower order harmonics. These usually consist of a bank of tuned LCfilters to suppress harmonics. The passive filters are performing better in the presence of load. In the absence of load or light loading conditions the <b>presence</b> of passive <b>filters</b> resulting in poor power quality.

Noise intensity was assessed with a sound level meter by placing a microphone near the right ear. Noise intensity and degree of discomfort were also assessed subjectively with a visual analogue scale. Results Inside the helmet noise exceeded 100 dB. Noise intensity was poorly affected by pressure support level and unaffected by the <b>presence</b> of HME <b>filters.</b> During NIV with nasal or facial masks the noise did not exceed 70 dB (i. e., noise was not louder than the usual noise background in ICU). Subjective evaluation of noise intensity mirrored objective measurements; however, the <b>presence</b> of HME <b>filters</b> {{was associated with the}} feeling of less noise inside the helmet.
