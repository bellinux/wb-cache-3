6000|$|In the two {{following}} cases, reversion {{comes into}} play and {{is determined by the}} position of the seed in the capsule. The Blue Imperial pea is the offspring of the Blue Prussian, and has larger seed and broader pods than its parent. Now Mr. Masters, of Canterbury, a careful observer and a raiser of new varieties of the pea, states (26/25. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1850 page 198.) that the Blue Imperial always has a strong tendency to revert to its parent-stock, and the reversion [...] "occurs in this manner: the last (or uppermost) pea in the pod is frequently much smaller than the rest; and if these small peas are carefully collected and sown separately, very many more, in proportion, will revert to their origin, than those taken from the other parts of the pod." [...] Again, M. Chate (26/26. Quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 74.) says that in raising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent to bear double flowers, by leaving {{only a few of the}} secondary branches to seed; but in addition to this, [...] "at the time of extracting the seeds, the upper portion of the pod is separated and placed aside, because it has been ascertained that the plants coming from the seeds situated in this portion of the pod, give eighty per cent of single flowers." [...] Now the production of single-flowering plants from the seed of double-flowering plants is clearly a case of reversion. These latter facts, as well as the connection between a central position and pelorism and <b>prolification,</b> show in an interesting manner how small a difference--namely, a little greater or less freedom in the flow of sap towards one part of the plant--determines important changes of structure.] ...|$|E
60|$|When the stamens are {{converted}} into petals, the plant becomes on the male side sterile; when both stamens and pistils are thus changed, the plant becomes completely barren. Symmetrical flowers having numerous stamens and petals {{are the most}} liable to become double, as perhaps follows from all multiple organs being the most subject to variability. But flowers furnished {{with only a few}} stamens, and others which are asymmetrical in structure, sometimes become double, as we see with the double gorse or Ulex, and Antirrhinum. The Compositae bear what are called double flowers by the abnormal development of the corolla of their central florets. Doubleness is sometimes connected with <b>prolification</b> (18/96. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 681.), or the continued growth of the axis of the flower. Doubleness is strongly inherited. No one has produced, as Lindley remarks (18/97. 'Theory of Horticulture' page 333.), double flowers by promoting the perfect health of the plant. On the contrary, unnatural conditions of life favour their production. There is some reason to believe that seeds kept during many years, and seeds believed to be imperfectly fertilised, yield double flowers more freely than fresh and perfectly fertilised seed. (18/98. Mr. Fairweather 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 406: Bosse quoted by Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 77. On the effects of the removal of the anthers see Mr. Leitner in Silliman's 'North American Journ. of Science' volume 23 page 47; and Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 84.) Long-continued cultivation in rich soil seems to be the commonest exciting cause. A double narcissus and a double Anthemis nobilis, transplanted into very poor soil, has been observed to become single (18/99. Lindley's 'Theory of Horticulture' page 3?3.); and I have seen a completely double white primrose rendered permanently single by being divided and transplanted whilst in full flower. It has been observed by Professor E. Morren that doubleness of the flowers and variegation of the leaves are antagonistic states; but so many exceptions to the rule have lately been recorded (18/100. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 626; 1866 pages 290, 730; and Verlot 'Des Varietes' page 75.), that, though general, it cannot be looked at as invariable. Variegation seems generally to result from a feeble or atrophied condition of the plant, and {{a large proportion of the}} seedlings raised from parents, if both are variegated, usually perish at an early age; hence we may perhaps infer that doubleness, which is the antagonistic state, commonly arises from a plethoric condition. On the other hand, extremely poor soil sometimes, though rarely, appears to cause doubleness: I formerly described (18/101. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 628. In this article I suggested the theory above given on the doubleness of flowers. This view is adopted by Carriere 'Production et Fix. des Varietes' 1865 page 67.) some completely double, bud-like, flowers produced in large numbers by stunted wild plants of Gentiana amarella growing on a poor chalky bank. I have also noticed a distinct tendency to doubleness in the flowers of a Ranunculus, Horse-chestnut, and Bladder-nut (Ranunculus repens, Aesculus pavia, and Staphylea), growing under very unfavourable conditions. Professor Lehmann (18/102. Quoted by Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 567.) found several wild plants growing near a hot spring with double flowers. With respect to the cause of doubleness, which arises, as we see, under widely different circumstances, I shall presently attempt to show that the most probable view is that unnatural conditions first give a tendency to sterility, and that then, on the principle of compensation, as the reproductive organs do not perform their proper functions, they either become developed into petals, or additional petals are formed. This view has lately been supported by Mr. Laxton (18/103. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 901.) who advances the case of some common peas, which, after long-continued heavy rain, flowered a second time, and produced double flowers.|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} this study, Jo sip Linardic, {{assistant}} of the Botanical department of the Faculty of Sciences at the University in Zagreb, began the investigations on the Adriatic Fucus in 1939. Fucus virsoides is an interesting endemic species in the Adriatic Sea, {{not only because of}} its ecologic properties, characteristic distribution on the north-east coast, but also because of its systematic value. Whilst many botanists consider it as a specific endemic species, the French algologue Sau- v a g e a u suspects its value as an independent species, and considers it as identic to the Atlantic species Fucus platycar- pus, var. spiralis. To solve correctly this important question of the systematic value of the Adriatic Fucus, it was necessary to investigate it from the morphological, ecological, chorological and finally systematical point of view. The author had finished his investigations at the end of 1940, and the manuscript was done {{at the beginning of the}} hard year 1941. Then began the invasion of Yugoslavia by the enemy’s army of which the author fell a martyr because of his political and national faith, when sentenced to death by a special occupator’s tribunal on 4. VIII. 1941., and so he gave his life for the national deliverance of his country. The redactor of »Acta Botanica« returned after the war to his position as the chief of the Botanical department of the University; he found the manuscript of Josiip Linardic in Croatian language preserved in the Botanical Institute. As the investigations were performed under his leading, he prepared this manuscript for print, and wrote this summary in English. I. In the first part of the paper there is shown in detail the morphology of thallus, which is differentiated and consists of three parts: basal disk with rhizoids, rounded stalk (stipes, cau- loid) bilateral leaf-blade of phyloid. The ramification is typically dichotom-dichopodial. The deviations from the regular dichopodium show only adventive branches, which grow on injured parts of the thallus. »Krypto- stomata« are described in details. The author considers them as organs for absorption of mineral foods. Kryptostomata develop by the reduction of conceptacula changing their reproductive function with that of feeding. In observing the development of the egg, it is found that from the egg develops the embryo by a gradual division analoguely to that known in other species of Fucus. On the thallus of Fucus can often be found <b>prolifications</b> on the bitten parts. These <b>prolifications</b> are described in other species of Fucus and also in the species Fucus virsoides (Meneg- hini, Forti, Vouk). The author could not find out exactly what causes the <b>prolifications,</b> but through some experiments in the aquarium he suspects that the thallus is bitten by a seahedgehog (Paracentrotus lividus). On the bitten parts begins the formation of <b>prolifications</b> the origin of which is shown in details. There are also described utricular anomal formation on the thallus, which have their origin in the schizogenous disruption of the tissue. The anatomical structure of the thallus is shown in details from the point of view of physiologic — anatomical systems. The functional division is still not carried out absolutely, so that some tissue — systems have two or more functions, one of those being of primary, and others of secondary value. Still there can be clearly differentiated the cortical — and vascular — (medular) and mechanical-system. The cortical- system consists of epidermis and cortex. The epidermis is very well and clearly developed in the inside of the cells very well differentiated with chloroplasts on the bottom, and with fuco- san-granules in the upper part of the cells. The epidermis has the function of secreting mucus on the surface. Immediatly underneath the epidermis is formed the primary cortex with some layers of cells. It has the assimilating function and from it spring out elements of mechanical tissue. In the lower, round parts of thallus is formed the secondary cortex. The primary cortex has its beginning in the epidermis. The vascular elements are placed in the center, and consist of cylindric, elongated cells. The membranes swell easily forming mucus, and they have pits in the cell-walls, they contain very few plastids and the assimilatory function is reduced, however they contain fucosan. Their function is to accumulate and conduct the assimilates. The hyphae are mechanical elements. Hyphae are long, thin, with tiny lumen, but with thickened membranes. They are mixed with vascular elements, and are concentrated toward the central rib, and especially in a greater number toward the basal disk. Protoplasts are reduced but still contain fucosan. With exact comparative investigations the author found out, that there are no differences between northern and southern forms, as J. Schiller states. II. In the second part of the study is shown in details the ecology of the algae, the relations to the temperature, the salinity, the movements of the sea and the light. The substratum is acting only as a mechanical factor, and not as a physiological one. The highest level of the high tide determines the upper limit of the vegetation-zone of the Fucus, and the lowest level of the low-tide determines its lower one. The Fucus is a typical plant living in the zone of high and low tide. The movements of the sea have a great influence upon the vegetation, so that the samples on unexposed places are always bigger than the ones exposed to the sea waves. The Adriatic Fucus avoides exposed coasts. J. S c h i 11 e r’s statement, that samples from southern coasts are smaller and weaker than the ones from the northern coasts, is not correct. Fucus is a plant adapted to the low and high tide, and dies in a constant culture in the water. In relation to the salinity Fucus virsoides is an euryhaline species with its optimum inclined more toward the average minimum. According to that, this algae can be defined as mi- kroeuryhalynic typus in the sence of Vouk’s theory of valences. It seeks places with sweetened water. Concerning the temperature, the Adriatic Fucus is an eurythermal algae with its optimum at the lower temperatures (mikroeurythermal Types). As the Adriatic Fucus is partly a terrestrial plant, for its life is important also the temperature of the air, and this is also a limiting factor, which determines its distribution to the south-western Mediterranean Sea. Concerning the light, the Adriatic Fucus is an eminently euryphotic i. e. makroeuryphotic algae, because its ecological optimum is nearer to the maximum. III. In the third part the author discusses the systematic position of the Adriatic Fucus. There is shown the whole history of this algae, which was for the first time described by Vitaliono Donati in 1750 as »virsoide«, according to which Agardh in 1868 gave its first diagnosis under the name of Fucus virsoides. From that time on, this algae has been described under different synonymes, but because of its priority the name of Fucus virsoides has been kept up. In spite of searching the etymology of the word »virsoide«, the author could neither find the meaning of this word nor anything positive about the etymology of this word. The author reexamined all the arguments on the basis of which Sauvageau had identified this species with Fucus platycarpus var. spiralis, and found as a result, that none of those arguments could be accepted and that the Adriatic Fucus had a right to be categorized as an independent species, as stated by Agardh. Sauvageau thinks that the Adriatic Fucus has its origin in the oceanic species Fucus platycarpus, which were occasionally distributed in the Adriatic Sea brought from the Atlantic Ocean, and means only a geographical disjunction of the Atlantic species of F. platycarpus var. spiralis. The author point out some essential differences between the species F. platycarpus and F. virsoides: 1. F. platycarpus has the ramification of the dichopodial sympodium, whilst the F. virsoides is a typical and regular di- chopodium. 2. There is a difference in the size between both species. Whilst F. platycarpus has the maximal size of 60 — 80 cm, F. virsoides grows usually till 20 — 28 cm. In the same way the segments of F. platycarpus are much wider than the ones of F. virsoides. 3. There is a difference in the receptacula of both species. In F. platycarpus receptacula are placed usually laterally on the shorter lateral branches or terminally in pairs. In F. virsoides receptacula are always placed terminally in pairs. 4. A considerable difference exists between both species in their area of distribution. F. virsoides is usually found on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea mostly to the South till Boka Ko- torska, whilst on the West coats of the North Adriatic it is found very seldom and only till Ancona. In all the other parts of the Adriatic Sea this Fucus is not found, the same as the related species F. platycarpus var. spiralis, which is distributed in the Atlantic coasts northern from Far Oar and Iceland and Canada and on the East from The Canarian isles. The reason that species did not enter Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea is probably the high temperature of the air during the summer-months. It is also significant, that F. virsoides, if it originates from the migration of the species F. platycarpus, is not found at all the North-West coasts of the Mediterranean Sea (Italy, France, Spain). The ecovalences of the species F. virsoides prevent its migration in the south Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea. The author thinks, that these both species were represented by one at the end of the tertiary period and in the early quartery-period. Only later by changing of the paleoclimatic and paleogeographic relations and by the formation of the Adriatic geosynclinalis in the diluvium, and by moving of the climate zone after the ice periods toward the North, began this undivided species its differentiation in two new ones. By the formation of new climatic-relations in the Mediterranean, respectively of the subtropic-mediterranean climate, the continuality of the earlier undivided area of the hypothetic species was broken. At last the author gives a new, with new arguments enlar- gened diagnosis of the Adriatic Fucus, and considers it as of full value of a separate, morphologically, ecologically and genetically well characterized endemic species. IV. The author studies the variability of the forms of the Adriatic Fucus, of which he has described several forms and varieties. Analyzing these forms, which have been recently described by Forti, on basis of abundant material from the whole coast from the most northern to the most southern point of the area, he gives lis folowing opinion about all known forms: f. normalis Schiffner gives an exact diagnosis of the typus. f. normalis major bene evoluta Schiffner, has not the value of a separate systematic unit. f. normalis basinudus Schiffner. has not the value of a separate systematic unit. f. normalis partim accedens ad var. subnudam Schiffner, has to be put off as a systematic unit, f. angusta Schiffner, form characterized with narrow segments, well differentiated from the normal form (f. normalis) and never appears mixed. f. angustior Schiffner has no diagnosis and has to be put off as a separate form. f. denudata Schiffner, form shows pathological denudation and cannot be considered as a separate systematic unit, var. subnuda Schiffner, the same as the above form has not the value of a separate systematic unit, var. subemersa minor Schiffner, this zonal variety cannot be considered as a separate systematic unit. var. acutiloba Forti, does not appear on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, but is a good morphological and geogra- phycal systematic unit. var. longifructus Forti, good characterized form with double or triple elongated receptacula. var. subvesiculosa Forti, this form with swollen receptacula which are not hollow, cannot be considered as a separate systematic form. f. australis Sehiffner, according to mentioned signs it cannot be considered as a separate systematic form, f. minúscula Linardić, a small, dwarfy form, only 2 — 4 cm. the author describes it as a separate form and gives his own diagnosis. According to that, from all the above mentioned forms only these can be kept as separate ones: var. acutiloba Forti, var. longifructus Forti, f. normalis Scliffner, f. augusta Sehiffner and f. minúscula Linardić. All the other forms have to be off as separate systematic forms either as varieties or as forms. V. In the last part about chorology of the Adriatic Fucus the author brings an exact list of all till now known localities of this algae, completing this list with his own statements and getting out of all that the area of distribution. Its center is the Trieste, Venetian- and Quarnero-Bay and the Croation Coast. The area elongates till Boka Kotorska on the east coast, and till Ancona on the west coast.

A pesquisa foi conduzida no Campo Experimental Pedro Arle, da Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros/SE. Foram utilizadas 95 ovelhas da raça SI com idade variando de dois a sete anos e peso médio de 45, 3 kg, criadas em regime semi-intensivo. As fêmeas foram inseminadas por laparoscopia (IL) com sêmen congelado de dois reprodutores das raças DP, SB e SI, formando assim três grupos genéticos: GG 1 : SI x SI, GG 2 : DP x SI e GG 3 : SB x SI. Observou-se que não houve associação entre taxa de fertilidade ao parto e o tipo de acasalamento, obtendo-se taxa média de 43, 16 %. A prolificidade média foi de 1, 19, não apresentando diferença significativa (P> 0, 05) entre grupos genéticos. Com base nos resultados, conclui-se que as ovelhas SI apresentaram razoável taxa de fertilidade ao parto, quando submetidas à Inseminação Artificial Laparoscópica em nível de campo, com indução do estro apenas pelo efeito macho; o efeito da heterose sobre a prolificidade pode ser desprezível.

Transpiration flow was not hindered by cavitation or tylosis in older culms, the low frequencies of these processes being bypassed via nodal plexi. Despite this, water content of plantlets declined over time and visual indications of water stress became apparent, suggesting that water supply via the determinate culm was not sufficient for the increasing transpirational demand of indeterminate plantlets.

They were given King grass (Pennisetum purpureophoides) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium Jacq.) leaf with ratio of 100 : 0 (Group A = control), 75 : 25 (Group B), 50 : 50 (Group C) and 0 : 100 (Group D). Forages were given 2. 5 - 3 % (dry matter) of liveweight. All groups were supplemented with 100 g/head/day concentrate (crude protein = 16 %), but during late pregnancy and lactation they were supplemented at 200 g/head/day. Results showed that feeding gliricidia 25 - 100 % of total forages improved body weight due to the increasing protein intake.

In the decision of these tasks, the important place can have use of green flower mutation. This mutation is of interest for breeding first of all {{in connection with the}} special durability of an attachment of fruits in flowers cluster and accordingly, in connection with prospect of creation of cultivars with high shedding resistance (2). On the other hand, the photosynthesis in petals of flower showes an additional source of assimilates and about the maximal approximation of this source to a place of consumption, creating favorable endogenous environment for display of optimum combinations of genes, influencing efficiency. For the first time green flower mutation at buckwheat had been described by E. S. Alekseeva (3). Except for green coloring of petals and high durability of attachment of fruits she marked significant deviations in structure of flowers, their <b>prolification</b> and very low fertility of plants.

The {{number of}} {{documents}} available in electronic format has grown dramatically in recent years, whilst {{the information that}} governments provide to the IAEA is not always complete or clear. Independent information sources can balance the limited government-reported information, particularly if related to noncooperative targets. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous in terms of source and language, and transforming them into information is therefore strongly linked to automatic textual analysis and synthesis, which are greatly related {{to the ability to}} master the problems of multilinguality. This paper describes a multilingual indexing, searching and clustering system, designed to manage huge sets of data collected from different and geographically distributed information sources, which provides language independent search and dynamic classification features. The automatic linguistic indexing of documents is based on morpho-syntactic, functional and statistical criteria. The lexical analysis is aimed at identifying only the significant expressions in the whole raw text: the system parses each sentence, cycling through all possible sentence constructions. Using a series of word-relationship tests to determine the context, the system returns the proper meaning for each sentence. Once reduced to its part of speech (POS) and functional-tagged base form, later referred to its language independent entry of a subject-specific multilingual dictionary, each tagged lemma is used as a descriptor and becomes a candidate seed for clustering. The automatic classification of results is based on the Unsupervised Classification schema. By Multilingual Text Mining, analysts can get an overview of great volumes of textual data having a highly readable grid, which helps them discover meaningful similarities among documents and find any nuclear <b>prolification</b> and safeguard-related information. Providing automatic and language-indipendent features for document indexing and clustering, Multilingual Text Mining helps international agents cut through the information labyrinth and successfully overcome linguistic barriers. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Development {{of vaccine}} against the African trypanosomiasis {{passes through the}} {{identification}} process of invariant component. This process targets the prevention of infection or diseases related to it. Immunity suppression in almost a universal feature of infection and represents probably {{an essential element of}} the host-parasite relationship. To highlight the mechanisms which can reduce the reactions of the specific T. antigen, we have studied the behaviour of the immune cells, including the activation by the cytokines, of a cattle infected by T. congolense. A <b>prolification</b> lymphatic specific trypanosome, as well as a secretion of (SFN-y), can be detected in the lymph node, which drains the site of the infection even before the first peak of parasitism (10 - 12 days post-infection). However, these reactions drop very rapidly to point zero at day 30 post-infection. This reaction loss of T. specific antigens is concomitant to an increase of the expression of IL- 10 mRNA. The transcription of IFNY, of IL- 2 is reduced on the contrary. These changes in the transcription of the mRNA of cytokines are also associated with the reduction of the existing monocytes, including nitricoxide (NO), by (IFN-y) or the production of TFNy. In monocyte culture originated from non-infected cattle, IL- 10 cuts out the secretion of (NO) and of TNF-y brought by IFNy. The addition of anti-body anti-IL 10 in monocytes cultures originated from infected cattle restores partially the secretion of NO, but has no effect on the production of TNF-y. At the end, {{it is possible that the}} increment of IL- 10 is implicated in the abolition of T-auxillary cells of 1 type and of cytokines inflammatory during the infection. We ignore if the abolition of the reactions protects the cattle of immune pathology or if it interferes with their capability of controlling the addiction...|$|E
40|$|The Foraminiferida {{represents}} one order of single-celled protists that live {{either on the}} sea floor (benthic) or within the surface water column (planktonic) of marine environments. The soft tissue (protoplasm) of foraminiferal cell is largely enclosed within a test mainly composed of secreted calcite minerals. This protozoan evolved a planktonic mode {{of life in the}} Middle Jurrasic in a neritic environment. The first morphologic <b>prolification</b> occurred in Albian time. The pattern of evolution in shell morphology can be viewed as the best example of iterative evolution. The three shell construction modes of Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene forms occurred during the time period from Cretaceous to Recent. The narrow adaptive temperature ranges of planktonic species have become useful tools in oceanographic studies. The nine living bioprovinces and three depth habitats are recognized worldwide. The living plankton foraminifers are divided into non-spinose and spinose categories, with subcategories based on other shell wall structures. These two groups differ from each other in such ecological features as depth habitats, presence of algal symbiont, trophic activity and reproduction cycle. More detailed sediment trap investigations of one or several year duration revealed a pattern of production and seasonal occurrence of each living plankton species. Many trap studies suggest a hypothesis that the subsurface-dwelling species become abundant when shoaling of thermocline occurs. The upwelling of nutrient rich, cool water available for primary production is related to shoaling of thermocline, which eventually controls the productivity in the overlying waters. For the past geologic interval, especially that of Quaternary, coiling ratios and species compositions of selected species have been used as a proxy of reconstructing paleotemperature. Furthermore, geochemical signals of oxygen-carbon isotopes and trace elements recorded in foraminiferal calcite shells provide an important tool for deducing such past oceanic conditions as nutrient, seawater temperature and discharge of river flux. The statistical analysis of faunal assemblages is, however, still a powerful method for the pre-Pleistocene time period because a potential for diagenetic alteration increases exponentially...|$|E
40|$|The braconid wasps {{represent}} one of {{the greatest}} family of the superfamily Ichneumonoidea inside Hymenoptera, to which we range Ichneumonidae and 8 small families, furthermore. The last catalogue of Braconidae enumerated 3731 species (Szépligeti, 1904). At present the number of the known species comprises all in all 13000. A new catalogue is published by Shenefelt since 1969. The plurality of the new braconid species are waited to discover outside Europe and North America on one hand and on the other the supposed number of the species living on the Earth is estimated about 30000. The modern classification distinguishes 20 subfamilies of Braconidae. The subfamilies mostly represent both taxonomical units and evolutionary trends (Tobias 1967, Papp 1974). The braconids arc primary parasites, neither secondary nor tertier braconid prasites are not known except Syntretus Först. There is not at all non-parasites braconid. They are parasitic exclusively during their Iarval stage, mostly in the larva of their hosts. True egg-parasites not among them. In their host-spectrum the caterpillars are predominate, the species of Opiinae-Alysiinae-Dacnbsinae are parasitic in different flies (Diptera), relatively small is the number of the braconid parasites of beetles and bugs. During their, parasitic life the braconids contribute a very important role in the terrestrial coenosae. In Szélenyi 2 ̆ 7,s (1955) biocoenological concept the braconids appear as two, structural elements (coetus) during a year incorporated in very much food-chain. In their instar stage as -obstant elements consuming animals (first of all caterpillars i. e. corrumpent elements), and in their imaginal stage as sustinent elements promoting the pollination of plants. The last role is much less significant than that of their obstancy. Highly important is their parasitic life in connection with that phenomenon of the coenosae which is named recently as biological circulation. Namely they take a high part in the checking of the <b>prolification</b> of their hosts over the quantity necessary. The plurality of the corrumpent elements posses a more or less series of entomophagous insects parasitizing them in their different developmental stege (i. e. from oval to imaginal stages). This phenomenon is disclosed as parasite-chain theory. In the, light of this theory it is necessary to study not only egg-parasites (relatively the most useful entomophagous insects) but instar, pupal, and imaginal parasites too. Recently was established that the most effective are the oligophagous parasites. On a global scale imported entomophagous insects were applied 228 occasions with any results (De Bach 1964). Of them braconids were applied, usually together with other entomophagous insects (1 - 4 species), 22 occasions. The results are as follows: 4 (19...|$|E
40|$|Many biotypes of the northern-hemisphere Arctic-Alpine grass Poa alpina L. {{reproduce}} asexually via <b>prolification</b> of the spikelet axis {{to produce}} dehiscing shoots. Although such pseudoviviparous plantlets {{are capable of}} photosynthesis, the source-sink characteristics of these synflorescence systems are unknown, including {{the degree to which}} plantlets are capable of providing for their own carbon requirements, or contributing to parental sinks. An initial anatomical investigation of the culm revealed that transpiration flow, as delimited by Lucifer Yellow tracer dye, was maintained despite advanced senescence (as evidenced by loss of chlorophyll and chloroplasts), with plantlet leaves driving transpiration flow. Transpiration flow was not hindered by cavitation or tylosis in older culms, the low frequencies of these processes beingbypassed via nodal plexi. Despite this, water content of plantlets declined over time and visual indications of water stress became apparent, suggesting that water supply via the determinate culm was not sufficient for the increasing transpirational demand of indeterminate plantlets. Photosynthetic rates within the paracladial zone, as determined by infrared gas analysis (IRGA), exceeded respiratory rates by 3 - 4 fold, indicating that plantlets were sources of carbon. 14 C tracer studies determined that the paracladial zone was not only as efficient at fixing carbon as the youngest fully expanded leaf, but that both organs exported carbon basipetally (c. f acropetal export from this leaf in seminiferous grasses). Distal plantlets fixed approx. 20 % more 14 C than proximal plantlets, by virtue of greater dry weight. Manipulative growth analysis of the paracladial zone suggests the operation of a system of apicaldominance, with distal plantlets becoming dominant over proximal plantlets. At dehiscence, distal plantlets were more likely to become established, and possessed relative growth rates more than ten times those of proximal plantlets. Paracladial heterogeneity was also apparent as an increased proportion of aborted spikelets on proximal paracladia. Data indicate that this abortion was, at least in part, a result of constraint imposed by the pseudostem on the developing synflorescence. When grown in conditions of differing resource availability (altered nutrient supply and atmospheric C 02 concentration), low nutrient availability in concert with elevated C 02 concentration induced particularly low photosynthetic nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies inboth parent and plantlet tissues. This occurred in concert with acclimatory loss of photosynthetic capacity leading to a decreased reproductive response of the plant; a product of the number of tillers in flower and the subsequent growth of attached plantlets. lt is predicted that in future climatic conditions Poa alpina will decline in habitats that include species which exhibit less acclimatory loss, no change, or an increase in photosynthetic capacity. These experiments alsorule out resource availability as a cause of heterogeneity within the paracladial zone. A direct study of the phytohormonal characteristics of the pseudoviviparous system is therefore proposed in order to elucidate the mechanism of control within the paracladial zone...|$|E
40|$|Great {{diversity}} {{is found in}} inflorescences of angiosperms. According to Troll {{this is due to}} the variation of two types only: the polytelic and the monotelic type. In the monotelic inflorescence, the apex of the inflorescence axis commonly ends with a terminal flower. This also applies to all the floral branches below the terminal flower. All of these branches, whether branched or not, proved to be homologous elements, and they are all referred to by the term ‘paracladia’ because these branches repeat the structure of the main axis of the flowering system. Accordingly, their ramifications are called paracladia of the 2 nd to nth order. Since by the presence of the paracladia the number of flowers in the flowering system is increased, they may be called ‘enriching branches’. Consequently the whole area which produces the enriching branches may be designated as an ‘enriching field’. In the lower part of the flowering shoot this zone is commonly preceded by a ‘field of inhibition’ within which the development of paracladia is inhibited more or less abruptly. The same zonation can be recognized in the individual paracladia if these are not reduced in any way. In perennials, the axillary buds at the base of the whole stem do not develop within the same season, but will give rise to the innovation shoots at the beginning of the following season. Therefore this area has to be distinguished as a ‘field of innovation’. The polytelic type of inflorescence probably has been derived repeatedly from the monotelic during the evolution of angiosperms by reduction of the terminal flower and specialization of the paracladia of the monotelic system. The distal elements are reduced to single lateral flowers or lateral cymes (partial florescences) which constitute elements of an apical system composed of lateral flowers. Instead of ending in a single flower, the floral axis thus terminates in a multi-flowered so-called polytelic ‘florescence’. The lower lateral branches repeat the structure of the main stem by producing (indefinite) florescences themselves and therefore may be termedparacladia (of the polytelic system). As in monotelic inflorescences the area of paracladia — the ‘enriching field’ — can be preceded by a ‘field of inhibition’ and, in perennial plants, by a ‘field of innovation’. Though generally we may confirm that the inflorescences of all species investigated (about 20 000 from nearly all angiosperm families) proved to be variations of one of the two fundamental types, it sometimes needs morphological experience to apply Troll’s system to woody plants of tropical regions. Difficulties may derive from prolepsis and syllepsis of the innovation shoots, <b>prolification</b> of the inflorescence axis and, abundantly, by the deficiency of clearly marked limits between sprouts growing in different seasons. In each of such cases, however, the homologous flower-bearing-elements can be identified by comparing their positions within the whole system of ramification. </p...|$|E
