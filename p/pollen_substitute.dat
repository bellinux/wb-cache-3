40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{different}} protein feeds on honey bees (Apis mellifera L), experiments were conducted in a completely randomized block design with 15 treatments and 4 replicates. The nutritional effects of different treatments on caged bees were studied through recording half-life time (50 % mortality). <b>Pollen</b> <b>substitutes</b> were soybean flour, soybean meal, bread yeast, wheat gluten, soybean flour + soybean meal, soybean flour + bread yeast, soybean flour + wheat gluten, soybean meal + wheat gluten, and wheat gluten + bread yeast. Pollen supplements were wheat gluten + pollen, soybean flour + pollen, soybean meal + pollen, bread yeast + pollen and two controls as pollen and honey. The nutritional effects of different protein sources provided by <b>pollen</b> <b>substitutes</b> and supplements were recorded on the amount of carcass protein and fatbody of honey bee workers in experimental colonies. The wheat gluten supplement and the soybean substitute showed the longest (60. 58 days) and the shortest (10. 53 days) half-life time of worker bees, respectively. The amount of food consumption in different treatments was not significantly different (P&gt; 0. 05). The greatest DM of worker bees (dry matter of carcass) was related to soybean (34 %) and the least related to yeast supplement (31. 54 %), which were significantly different (P&lt; 0. 05). The highest carcass protein belonged to wheat gluten supplement (22. 57 %) and the lowest was related to yeast supplement (20. 01 %). The greatest carcass fat was related to soybean supplement (4. 75 %) and the lowest to wheat gluten supplement (3. 84 %).

We compared the effects of these diets on honey bees by measuring diet consumption, bee development (egg hatch, pupation success, and pupal weight), and the protein content of emergent adult bees, their antioxidant status and the activity of their midgut digestive proteases. Bees consumed significantly more (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) natural pollen than any PS, and bees fed PS had similar diet consumption over the entire experimental period. However, the total protein intake was varied (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). PS with a protein level about 30 % was recognized as excellent quality diet for maximum body weight, highest protein content and antioxidant enzymatic activity, and PS with a protein rate about 35 % exerted the greatest effect on increasing percentage of hatch and percentage of pupation. All these results indicate that PS appeared to be a valuable proteinaceous food approximated to the pollen, and 30 ∼ 35 % of dietary protein level was optimal to maintain the colony development...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the biological value for the honey bee of <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> formulations the chemical makeup of which was supplemented with DL and L isomers of synthetic amino acids and thus upgraded to the standard of natural pollen from pollen loads. The following feed component made up the pollen substitute: potato protein 32 %, soybean cake 18 %, rapeseed cake 6 %, yeast Candida utilis 6 %, wheat flour 14, 8 %, maize grits 17. 5 %, soybean oil 3. 3 %, lecithin 0. 5 % polfamix W 1. 4 %, Vitazol AD 3 EC 0. 2 %, glucose with vitamin C 0. 1 %. Prior to be fed to bees, the <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> and pollen loads were mixed with powder sugar to bring protein level in all feeds to 21 %. Biological methods were used as the measure of the nutritional value of the feed to test the condition of bees. The condition of bees was expressed in terms of the size of pharyngeal glands, the size of the fat body and the number of haemocytes in haemolymph. The poorest developed pharyngeal glands and fat body were recorded in bees which were fed a non-supplemented <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute.</b> The highest number of haemocytes in haemolymph was recorded in bees which received <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> supplemented with all lacking L amino acids, the number being slightly lower when the amino acids were fed as DL isomers. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Bringing the amino acid composition of pollen substitutes with essential amino acids up to their level in natural pollen favourably influenced the nutritional value of the protein in terms of fat body size but the effect was weaker in terms of the development of pharyngeal glands.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} make an {{economic}} evaluation of a high performance modern beekeeping technology leading to an increased bee family capacity. The new technology removes the disadvantages of the traditional one utilising just natural picking based on Robinia, Lime, sunflower and wild flora, most of times deeply affected by unfavourable climate conditions (drought, rainfalls) and conducting to important bee losses during the winter season and mainly during the critical period till the next picking. The modern technology assures 75 % more bees per family, an increased queen laying capacity by 33 %,, a 50 % reduction of bee loss in winter season, by 20 % more honey, by 50 % more propolis, by 33 % more pollen, by 50 % more swarms, by 60 % more royal jelly and by 50 % more bee venom. The modern technology {{is based on a}} scientific feeding management applying a stimulating, completing and proteinic feeding (pollen cake and/or <b>pollen</b> <b>substitutes</b> such as: degreased powder milk 30 % and soya bean cake), involving peculiar costs ranking between USD 9. 73 - 10. 06 per family/year. The total bee rearing costs have been estimated at USD 17. 83 in average per family/year, of which: 55. 5 % feeding costs, 6. 8 % queen replacement cost, 3. 2 % treatments cost, 13. 5 % costs for supplying new frames and combs, 17. 4 % transportation costs for moving of bee families and the remaining of 3. 6 % labour costs. Taking into account a standard apiary (100 bee families of an increased power), a beekeeper can obtain an USD 12, 100. 4 annual income, by 55. 9 % higher than in case of the traditional beekeeping technology. As a conclusion, the new technology assures a higher biological and economical efficiency, USD 3, 350 profit gain that is a profit by 48 % higher than in case of the classic technology.

40|$|Unfavourable weather {{conditions}} after the queen starts with intensive oviposition during early spring may cause an imbalance {{in the division}} of tasks among worker bees in the bee colony. This can lead to slow spring development and poor exploitation of the main spring nectar flows. In order to accelerate the spring development, it is necessary, as a technological measure, to feed supplemental candy to bee colonies. In this research, the necessity of supplemental feeding, {{as well as the}} composition of candy (<b>pollen</b> and protein <b>substitute)</b> were analysed. Three groups of ten bee colonies each were formed - the control, unfed group, pollen candy fed and protein substitute candy fed. In the period from 22 / 02 / 2016 and 04 / 04 / 2016 three control measurements were performed during which the number of bees, the number of brood cells and weight of the bee colonies were determined. The research has shown that supplemental feeding of the bee colony in late winter in order to encourage the rapid spring development is justified. Namely, at the final measurements in April, the results showed differences between groups. The treated colonies had higher net hive weight, a greater number of bees and statistically significantly more brood cells.

40|$|AbstractMultiple {{stressors}} {{are currently}} threatening honey bee health, including pests and pathogens. Among honey bee pathogens, Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian found parasitizing the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) relatively recently. Honey bee colonies are fed <b>pollen</b> or protein <b>substitute</b> during <b>pollen</b> dearth to boost colony growth and immunity against pests and pathogens. Here we hypothesize that N. ceranae intensity and prevalence will be low in bees receiving high pollen diets, and that honey bees on high pollen diets will have higher survival and/or increased longevity. To test this hypothesis {{we examined the}} effects of different quantities of pollen on (a) the intensity and prevalence of N. ceranae and (b) longevity and nutritional physiology of bees inoculated with N. ceranae. Significantly higher spore intensities were observed in treatments that received higher pollen quantities (1 : 0 and 1 : 1 pollen:cellulose) when compared to treatments that received relatively lower pollen quantities. There {{were no significant differences in}} N. ceranae prevalence among different pollen diet treatments. Interestingly, the bees in higher pollen quantity treatments also had significantly higher survival despite higher intensities of N. ceranae. Significantly higher hypopharyngeal gland protein was observed in the control (no Nosema infection, and receiving a diet of 1 : 0 pollen:cellulose), followed by 1 : 0 pollen:cellulose treatment that was inoculated with N. ceranae. Here we demonstrate that diet with higher pollen quantity increases N. ceranae intensity, but also enhances the survival or longevity of honey bees. The information from this study could potentially help beekeepers formulate appropriate protein feeding regimens for their colonies to mitigate N. ceranae problems...|$|R

In the early spring, a total of 36 honey bee colonies of equal size and queen quality were randomly allocated into 6 groups. The six groups of honey bees were fed a basal diet with supplementation of ALA levels at 0 (group A), 2 (group B), 4 (group C), 6 (group D), 8 (group E), and 10 % (group F). In this study, there were significant effects of <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> ALA levels on the feeding amounts of the bee colony, colony population, sealed brood amount, and weight of newly emerged workers (P< 0. 05).

40|$|A cria ensacada brasileira é uma das piores enfermidades de abelhas Apis mellifera L. africanizadas, principalmente do Sudeste do Brasil. Ela afeta o desenvolvimento das larvas, após serem alimentadas pelas abelhas nutrizes com o pólen do barbatimão (Stryphnodendron polyphyllum e Stryphnodendron adstringens), ocasionando a morte entre os estágios de pré-pupa e pupa. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito do substituto de pólen na redução da mortalidade da cria ensacada brasileira durante o florescimento do Stryphnodendron adstringens. Foram utilizados dois tratamentos: as colmeias do tratamento 1 receberam semanalmente substituto de pólen (mistura de farinha de soja, fubá e farinha de trigo em proporções iguais). As colmeias do tratamento 2 não receberam o substituto de pólen, tendo como único alimento o pólen que encontravam na natureza. As colmeias alimentadas apresentaram diferença significativa de 93, 5 % de viabilidade de sobrevivência de cria em relação às não alimentadas, que apresentaram 80, 4 % de sobrevivência. A frequência de pólen S. adstringens nos coletores de pólen, no tratamento 1, foi 0, 21. Entretanto, no Tratamento 2, foi de 4, 38, indicando que as colmeias que não se alimentaram com o substituto apresentaram maior frequência do pólen dessa planta, quando comparadas com as que dispunham da dieta artificial. Esse manejo sugere que a oferta do substituto de pólen, antes e durante a florada do Stryphnodendron adstringens, é importante na redução dos efeitos da cria ensacada brasileira em enxames de abelhas africanizadas.

40|$|The multicoloured Asian {{ladybird}} Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), previously {{introduced as}} a {{biological control agent}} to control aphids populations, is now frequently considered as an intraguild predator, consuming other aphids natural enemies. The interactions between this exotic ladybird and other aphidophagous species present in Belgian agro-ecosystems are mainly asymmetric in support of H. axyridis. An aphidophages sampling has been performed between 2009 and 2011 in four agrosystems such as broad bean, wheat, corn and potato. The sampling method consisted in the counting of aphids and all developmental stages of aphidophages present in quadrats of 1 m² from April to September. Harmonia axyridis, the invasive coccinellid, was mainly observed in broad bean (21. 84 ± 6. 30 individuals/ 100 m²) and corn (70. 83 ± 6. 60 individuals/ 100 m²) with other aphidophages such as Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), Chrysoperla carnea sensus lato (Stephens), Coccinella septempunctata (Linné) and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Linné). In corn, our field data showed that immature stages and adults of H. axyridis were found throughout the summer. Adults were observed from mid-June {{to the beginning of}} September with two peaks, in the late June and in the beginning of August. The life history of larvae starts in late-June to the beginning of Augustus with only one peak (347. 91 ± 59. 99 individuals / 100 m²) in the beginning of July. The peak of H. axyridis arrives when no extraguild preys are present. At this moment, pupae of E. balteatus and C. septempunctata are the main food available to ensure the development of H. axyridis so that native aphidophages could be intraguild prey for H. axyridis. In the four crops, reproduction of H. axyridis starts after those of other aphidophages and so it does not benefit of available prey such as aphid: in corn and broad bean, C. septempunctata reproduce the first, in wheat it is E. balteatus and in potato it is C. carnea. That could be explained by several reasons: (1) H. axyridis reproduces firstly in arboreal habitats and after that comes in agrosystems, (2) the delay between aphidophage reproductions allows a reduction of interactions with other larvae during spring and therefore decrease mortality levels and (3) H. axyridis is able to use <b>pollen</b> as food <b>substitute</b> when no aphids are available.

40|$|Bumblebees are ecologically and {{economically}} important pollinators, {{and the value}} of bumblebees for crop pollination has led to the commercial production and exportation/importation of colonies on a global scale. Commercially produced bumblebee colonies can carry with them infectious parasites, which can both reduce the health of the colonies and spillover to wild bees, with potentially serious consequences. The presence of parasites in commercially produced bumblebee colonies is in part because colonies are reared on pollen collected from honey bees, which often contains a diversity of microbial parasites. In response to this threat, part of the industry has started to irradiate pollen used for bumblebee rearing. However, to date there is limited data published on the efficacy of this treatment. Here we examine the effect of gamma irradiation and an experimental ozone treatment on the presence and viability of parasites in honey bee pollen. While untreated pollen contained numerous viable parasites, we find that gamma irradiation reduced the viability of parasites in pollen, but did not eliminate parasites entirely. Ozone treatment appeared to be less effective than gamma irradiation, while an artificial <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> was, as expected, entirely free of parasites. The results suggest that the irradiation of pollen before using it to rear bumblebee colonies is a sensible method which will help reduce the incidence of parasite infections in commercially produced bumblebee colonies, but that further optimisation, or the use of a nutritionally equivalent artificial <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute,</b> may be needed to fully eliminate this route of disease entry into factories...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> diets are a {{valuable}} resource for maintaining strong and health honey bee colonies. Specific diets {{may be useful in}} one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy milk powder and albumin, and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer’s yeast and rice bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18 - 21 μg/μL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~ 37 - 49 μg/μL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100 % on diets D 1 and D 2, respectively, versus 83 and 60 % in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen substitutes during dearth periods and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.

40|$|Western {{honey bee}} (Apis mellifera L.) populations face declines {{commonly}} attributed to pesticide, pathogen, and parasite stress. One way beekeepers combat these stressors is by providing supplemental protein diets to honey bee colonies to ensure adequate colony nutrition. However Nosema spp., a microsporidian parasite of the honey bee, {{is thought to}} be associated closely with a colony’s nutritional intake, thus possibly negating any benefit the bees otherwise would have received from a nutritional supplement. Through three objectives, we examined how adult bees ’ consumption of wildflower pollen or commercial <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> diets affected Nosema levels in the bees’midguts.

All of the other protein diets raised the haemolymph protein levels significantly above that of the newly emerged bees (approximately 20 – 28 versus an initial 14 mg/ml haemolymph). The haemolymph protein levels of bees fed with these <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> diets were similar to those of bees fed on bee bread. The initial protein levels in the newly emerged bees were considerably higher than in previous studies done in Brazil, apparently because our study was conducted during the spring, when natural food sources are relatively abundant. Nevertheless, it was still possible to objectively compare the diets under these conditions. FAPESP 2007 / 07701 - 3 CNPqResearch Center on Biodiversity and Computing (Biocomp-USP...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} needs of bees are supplied by nectar carbohydrates and by protein {{and other nutrients}} in pollen but little is known of how bees achieve nutritional balance. Using newly emerged caged worker honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata), we investigated whether bees maintain their intake target when confined to pairs of imbalanced complementary diets varying in protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratio. Diets were formulated using three protein sources [casein, royal jelly or Feed-Bee® (a natural <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute)</b> ] and sucrose. Within each protein type, honeybees switched between complementary diets and converged on the same P:C intake target. However, this target differed between protein types: P:C ratios were 1 : 12, 1 : 14 and 1 : 11 on casein, royal jelly and Feed-Bee® diets, respectively. Except for an early peak in protein consumption on royal jelly diets, these strongly convergent ratios remained constant over the 14 day experiment. This is {{probably due to the}} absence of brood, reflected in relatively stable values measured for haemolymph protein concentration and hypopharyngeal gland activation in bees on Feed- Bee® diets. Performance of caged workers was also assessed in terms of survival and ovarian activation. Survival was highest on casein diets and lowest on Feed-Bee® diets but ovarian activation was highest on royal jelly diets and lowest on casein diets. This may be due to additional components in Feed-Bee® and royal jelly (e. g. fatty acids), which are needed to activate the ovaries but also reduce survival. Nutrient intake of broodless workers is directly related to their own physiological requirements, and the strong carbohydrate bias may reflect the high metabolic rate of honeybees even under resting conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} part of the global trend in {{functional}} food research and focuses on forming links between two important medicinal natural products for human health; medicinal plants and honey. The principal objective of this project was to produce a novel bioactive honey from medicinal plants using both conventional and alternative honey production methods under highly controlled conditions. Within this objective there were three sub-aims. The first was to select an appropriate medicinal plant for the work from three previously identified species, namely Korean mint (Agastache rugosa) (Fisch. &amp; C. A. Mey.) Kuntze, Revis. Gen. Pl. 2 : 511 (1891), Motherwort (Leonurus sibiricus) L., Sp. Pl. : 584 (1753) and Tulsi or Holy Basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) L., Sp. Pl. : 597 (1753). Tulsi has been well researched compared to the other two species that have had only a few studies regarding their activity as medicinal plants. Examination of all species showed that Tulsi had the highest number of volatile bio-active compounds compared to the other two species and also had a much longest flowering period. These three criteria led to Tulsi being chosen for the production of bioactive honey. The main idea was that if the antioxidant, antimicrobial or other properties transferred from the plants into honey during, rather than after, production it would be a useful alternative to many pharmaceutical products currently available with fewer side-effects. The second aim of the work was to undertake a detailed study of Tulsi to identify and investigate the compounds responsible for its antibacterial and antioxidant activity. These bioactive compounds were studied in the leaves, inflorescence, essential oil and for the first time, the nectar, using Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) Gas Chromatogram Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover, the essential oil extracted from Tulsi and the leaf extracts were examined for both antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. The third and final aim of the project was to produce bioactive honey from Tulsi using both traditional and alternative honey production methods under highly controlled conditions, examine its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and evaluate the factors contributing to their bioactivity. The end result of the study is a novel medicinal scientifically-validated honey, produced from a medicinal plant with high bioactivities. This product could, potentially add value to the therapeutic properties of both, the honey and medicinal plant industries. The value of honey may be increased if it is a scientifically-validated bioactive commodity. Medicinal plant growers will acquire a second income from the same plants. Examine the possibility of using the new bioactive honey as a local antibiotic agent instead of existing antibiotics especially with increasing microbial resistance to antibiotics such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The <b>pollen</b> <b>substitute</b> developed by this project provides a complex mixture which includes proteins, minerals, carbohydrates, and other nutrients to provide sufficient amounts of the requirements to enhance multiple generations of bees, which may help to overcome the serious issue of the dramatic decrease in numbers of bees worldwide...|$|E
