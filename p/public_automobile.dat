60|$|At last {{we did get}} {{together}} courage enough to drive twelve miles over the hills to Tarifa, but this courage was pieced out of the fragments of the courage we had lost for going to Cadiz by the <b>public</b> <b>automobile</b> which runs daily from Algeciras. The road after you passed Tarifa {{was so bad that}} those who had endured it said nobody could endure it, and in such a case I was sure I could not, but now I am sorry I did not venture, for since then I have motored over some of the roads in the state of Maine and lived. If people in Maine had that Spanish road as far as Tarifa they would think it the superb Massachusetts state road gone astray, and it would be thought a good road anywhere, with the promise of being better when the young eucalyptus trees planted every few yards along it grew big enough to shade it. But we were glad of as much sun as we could get on the brisk November morning when we drove out of the hotel garden and began the long climb, with little intervals of level and even of lapse. We started at ten o'clock, and it was not too late in that land of anomalous hours to meet peasants on their mules and donkeys bringing loads of stuff to market in Algeciras. Men were plowing with many yoke of oxen in the wheat-fields; elsewhere there were green pastures with herds of horses grazing in them, an abundance of brown pigs, and flocks of sheep with small lambs plaintively bleating. The pretty white farmhouses, named each after a favorite saint, and gathering at times into villages, had grapes and figs and pomegranates in their gardens; and when we left them and climbed higher, we began passing through long stretches of cork woods.|$|E

50|$|Schreyer led {{his party}} to a {{watershed}} electoral {{victory in the}} 1969 provincial election and was subsequently appointed by Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Richard Spink Bowles as his premier, in which position Schreyer served until 1977.

Following another election in 1973, Schreyer maintained his position as premier, though the council was this time less innovative, the only policy of note being the mining tax legislation implemented in 1974. Besides serving as premier, Schreyer was the appointed Minister of Finance between 1972 and 1975, and the minister responsible for Manitoba Hydro from 1971 to 1977. It was from those positions that Schreyer advised the Lieutenant Governor to authorise construction of hydroelectric works instead of coal and gas burning electricity generators, and also put forward legislation that simultaneously eliminated provincial health care premiums and implemented home care and pharmacare. Schreyer sometimes favoured policies distinct {{from those of the}} federal New Democratic Party; in 1970, he supported Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's direction of the Governor General to invoke the War Measures Act in response to the October Crisis in Quebec, despite the opposition of federal NDP leader Tommy Douglas.|$|E

40|$|Automobile {{systems and}} public {{transportation}} are often organized separately within government structure inhibiting a comparative analysis {{between the two}} modes. Further complicating the comparison is that in public transportation systems, not only is infrastructure but vehicles and operators are usually provided by government or contracted private sector partners, while in the automobile system, infrastructure is normally government owned but costs of vehicle ownership and operation and parking are private. However, these private actions have enormous costs. In total in FY 2004 - 05 in London, private automobile spending was over 14 times greater than <b>public</b> <b>automobile</b> spending, as public spending on the automobile was about £ 1. 4 billion while private spending on the automobile was about £ 20. 9 billion. For public transportation, public spending was about £ 2. 0 billion while private spending was about £ 2. 3 billion. On a normalized basis, when not including time costs, the automobile was 3. 7 times more expensive than public transportation on a per trip basis, and 2. 0 times more expensive on a per passenger-kilometer basis. When including time costs and segmenting trips by travel zone, we found that public transportation enjoys an advantage for all travel zone combinations, with the advantage being the greatest for trips between outer London and inner London and for trips within inner London. At the household level, we estimated that households well-served by public transportation spend 15 to 18 percent less out-of-pocket on transportation than the average London household, although these savings are outweighed by additional time costs. From our findings in this research, we see significant opportunity for the London region to achieve a more cost-efficient transportation system. First, measures should be pursued to increase the share of variable automobile costs {{as a percentage of}} total costs. Policy such as pay-as-you-drive insurance and road pricing or policy inducing greater awareness of parking costs would help shift the burden. Second, public authorities should consider the private expenditures on automobiles and parking, as they are relatively large compared to the public spending on automobiles, when allocating resources between transportation modes. by Tejus Jitendra Kothari.
