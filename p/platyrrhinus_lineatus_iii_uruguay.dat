40|$|The {{predation}} on vertebrates by birds, including bats, is {{very common}} in some families (Accipitridae, Falconidae, Tytonidae, Strigidae), constituting their main diet. For other families (except those that feed strictly on fish), it is occasional and sometimes a matter of opportunity. Here we recorded the predation on a bat (<b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus)</b> by the neotropical bird plush-crested jay (Cyanocorax chrysops). on July 26, 2009, around 11 : 00 am, we recorded an individual of C. chrysops taking part of a P. lineatus on its beak. This record occurred on Jacarezinho Farm (Valparaiso [long dash] SP). The prey species identification was done by visual observation, considering the bat size and its external morphology, especially {{by the presence of}} the white dorsal bright stripe. Probably, <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> behavior, which involves living together or in couples on tree canopies, made the capture by the plush-crested jay easier.

40|$|The bat species <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> and P. recifinus (Phyllostomidae: Stenodermatinae) are ecologically {{important}} {{because of their}} capacity for seed dispersal. P. recifinus is endemic to the Atlantic rain forest and is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. The lack of distinct morphological features makes identification of the two species a difficult task. This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that these are actually two distinct species by using PCR-RFLP of the mitochondrial cytocrome b gene. The results showed no shared haplotypes, demonstrating that these are, in fact, two distinct species.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the region of Londrina, Paraná, Brazil in three {{different}} areas: a primary forest, a disturbed primary forest and an open area. Within 207 hours of capture, 990 individuals were collected, 939 of them being fruit-eating bats. Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758), Sturnira lilium (Geoffroy, 1810), <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (Geoffroy, 1810) and Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818) were the four most collected species in a total of 899 individuals.

Observou-se concentração de partos próximos à estação chuvosa, coincidindo com a maior disponibilidade de alimento para os períodos de prenhez e lactação. Partos esporádicos ocorreram durante todo o ano. Entre 2002 e 2003, foi feita uma busca em diversos tipos de abrigos nas mesmas regionais. Os abrigos foram registrados, e as espécies encontradas foram somadas às já observadas na primeira parte deste estudo, bem como às citadas em diversas fontes bibliográficas e disponíveis em coleções acadêmicas, gerando um relato atualizado das espécies de morcegos já encontrados no município. A {{total of}} 316 bats were trapped using mist nets during 18 nights at nine strategic locations in Belo Horizonte between 1999 and 2001. The most predominant species were Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818), 55. 1 %, <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (Geoffroy, 1810), 24. 4 %, and Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766), 10. 1 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{described}} infracommunities, {{prevalence and}} mean {{intensity of infestation}} of ecotoparasite flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) on bats in an ecotone area of Cerrado as predominant vegetation, with influence of Atlantic Forest, in the southeast of Mato Grosso do Sul. In 36 sampling nights between April 2015 and August 2016 (23, 328 m². h), we captured 17 bat species, of which ten were infested, and 14 species of fly. The most abundant bats were the phyllostomids Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823), Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1776) and Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) and the most abundant flies were the streblids Trichobius longipes (Rudow, 1871), T. joblingi Wenzel, 1966 and Megistopoda aranea (Coquillett, 1899). Phyllostomus hastatus (Pallas, 1767) was the bat species that presented the highest infestation rate. <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (É. Geoffroy, 1810) and Desmodus rotundus (É.

40|$|Trypanosoma rangeli infects several {{mammalian}} orders but {{has never}} confidently {{been described in}} Chiroptera, which are commonly parasitized by many trypanosome species. Here, we described trypanosomes from bats captured in Central Brazil identified as T rangeli,. T. dionisii, T cruzimarinkellei and T cruzi. Two isolates, Tra 643 from <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> and Tra 1719 from Artibeus plamirostris were identified as T rangeli by morphological, biological and molecular methods, and confirmed by phylogenetic analyses. Analysis using SSU rDNA sequences clustered these bat trypanosomes together with T rangeli from other hosts, and separated them from other trypanosomes from bats. Genotyping based on length and sequence polymorphism of PCR-amplified intergenic spliced-leader gene sequences assigned Tra 1719 to the lineage A whereas Tra 643 was {{shown to be a}} new genotype and was assigned to the new lineage E. To our knowledge, these two isolates are the earliest T rangeli from bats and the first isolates from Central Brazil molecularly characterized.

O começo da época reprodutiva foi estimado 30 dias antes da data da captura da primeira fêmea grávida. Para determinação do término da época reprodutiva empregamos a data da captura da última fêmea lactante mais 40 dias. O total de 688 morcegos adultos foi analisado, sendo 58, 3 % representados por fêmeas. O maior número de capturas foi observado nos meses de fevereiro, janeiro e agosto. Machos com testículos escrotados foram observados em todos os meses. Fêmeas inativas sexualmente foram observadas com predominância em março e de maio a agosto. Fêmeas com fetos palpáveis foram observadas em todos os meses, exceto em abril, junho e julho com pico em agosto-outubro e janeiro-fevereiro. Fêmeas lactantes foram capturadas de novembro a junho, com pico em novembro e fevereiro. Fêmeas simultaneamente grávidas e lactantes foram capturadas em todos os meses exceto em junho, com pico em abril. O tamanho da época reprodutiva variou a cada ano, compreendendo de 8 a 12 meses, com média de 10, 6 meses.

The beginning of reproductive season was estimated 30 days before the date of capture of the first pregnant female. For determination {{of the end of}} the reproductive time we used the date of the capture of the last lactating female, added by 40 days. The total of 688 adult bats was analyzed, of which 58. 3 % were females. The largest numbers of captures was observed in the months of February, January and August. Males with descent testicles were observed in all of the months. Inactive females were observed in predominance in March and of May to August. Females with palpable fetuses were observed in all of the months except in April, June and July, with peak in August-October and January-February. Lactating females were netted from November to June, with peak in November and February.

40|$|Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818) and <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (Geoffroy, 1810) are phyllostomid bats {{that often}} coexist {{in the same}} local and consume the same feed. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to obtain data about feeding habits of the two species, {{relating}} to their capture times, in the land where is the Universidade Estadual de Londrina, northern Paraná. The samples were attained among September 2010 and May 2011, with 12 960 m 2 h of sampling effort. The results analysis contemplated the Shannon Index, Pielou Index and Schoener Index. 250 A. lituratus e 46 P. lineatus were captured, and while the first one consumed fruits from ten vegetable species, the second fed just three species, both preferring the Cecropia spp. and Ficus spp. genus. A. lituratus showed the higher capture peak 30 minutes after the sunset and was collected throughout the period. P. lineatus had its higher peak 01 h 45 min after nightfall and was captured in short periods. With these outcomes, is possible to imply that P. lineatus has a foraging peak, in the study place, 75 minutes after A. lituratus, avoiding straight competition. A. lituratus showed larger food diversity, indicating higher adaptative potential for this specie than for the other. Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818) e <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (Geoffroy, 1810) são morcegos filostomídeos que frequentemente coexistem num mesmo local e consomem o mesmo alimento. Assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi obter dados sobre os hábitos alimentares das duas espécies, relacionando-os com seus horários de captura, na região onde se encontra o campus da Universidade Estadual de Londrina no norte do Paraná. As coletas foram realizadas entre Setembro de 2010 e Maio de 2011, com um esforço amostral de 12 960 m 2 h. A análise dos resultados contemplou o uso do Índice de Shannon, Índice de Pielou e Índice de Schoener. Capturaram-se 250 A. lituratus e 46 P. lineatus, e o primeiro consumiu frutos de dez espécies vegetais, enquanto o segundo utilizou apenas três espécies, ambos dando preferência aos gêneros Cecropia spp. e Ficus spp. A. lituratus apresentou o maior pico de captura 30 minutos após o pôr-do-sol e foi coletado durante todo o período. P. lineatus teve seu maior pico 01 h 45 min após o anoitecer e foi capturado em pequenos períodos.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the behavior of}} the nucleolus, nucleolar structures and nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) during meiotic division in four species of phyllostomid bats that have different numbers and locations of NORs. Nucleoli began disassembly at leptotene, and the subcomponents released from the nucleolus were dispersed in the nucleoplasm, associated with perichromosomal regions, or they remained associated with NORs throughout division. In Phyllostomus discolor, a delay in nucleolus disassembly was observed; it disassembled by the end of pachytene. The RNA complexes identiied by acridine orange staining were observed dispersed in the nucleoplasm and associated with perichromosomal regions. FISH with rDNA probe revealed the number of NORs of the species: one NOR in Carollia per spicillata, one pair in <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> and P. discolor, and three pairs in Artibeus lituratus. During pachytene, there was a temporary dissociation of the homologous NORs, which returned to pairing at diplotene. The variation in the number (from one to three pairs) and location of NORs (in sex or autosomal chromosomes, at terminal or interstitial regions) did not seem to interfere with the nucleolar behavior of the different species because no variation in nucleolar behavior that could be correlated with the variation in the number and chromosomal location of NORs was detected...|$|R

40|$|Bats may exhibit {{different}} patterns of activity, considering aspects concerning niche dynamics {{as well as}} the establishment and permanence of the communities in the ecosystems. In this way, the present study analyzed the time and seasonal patterns of activity in different species of frequent phyllostomid bats in remnants of the stational semidecidual forest from the Upper Paraná River, Southern Brazil. Captures were performed between January and December, 2006, using 32 mist nets set above the soil along the nocturnal period during the four seasons of the year. The daily and seasonal patterns of activity of each species was modeled using generalized linear models with Poisson error. The best model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc). Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) did not exhibit a conspicuous time pattern, whereas A. lituratus (Olfers, 1818) was more frequent after the sixth hour and A. fimbriatus Gray, 1838 had an activity increase along the night. <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (E. Geoffroy, 1810) was registered during all sampling hours. Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy, 1810) were the most active during the first four hours. Concerning seasonal pattern, the highest activity of these species was verified during the summer. These data contribute to the information about the ecology of bats in the region, highlighting the high adaptive potential of the species studied in relation to the use of space throughout the night and in to variations in environmental conditions. Os morcegos podem exibir diferentes padrões de atividade, considerando-se aspectos relacionados à dinâmica de nicho e ao estabelecimento e permanência das comunidades nos ecossistemas. Assim, o presente estudo teve por objetivo investigar o padrão de atividade horária e sazonal em diferentes espécies de morcegos, frequentes em remanescentes de floresta estacional semidecidual do alto rio Paraná, sul do Brasil. As coletas foram realizadas entre janeiro e dezembro de 2006, com o auxílio de 32 redes armadas acima do solo, ao longo de todo o período noturno e nas quatro estações do ano. A análise dos dados contemplou o uso de modelos lineares generalizados Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) e distribuição de Poisson. Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) não exibiu um padrão horário conspícuo, enquanto A. lituratus (Olfers, 1818) foi mais frequente após a sexta hora e A. fimbriatus Gray, 1838 teve aumento da atividade ao longo da noite. <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (E. Geoffroy, 1810) foi registrado durante todas as horas de amostragem. Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) e Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy, 1810) foram mais ativos nas quatro primeiras horas. Em relação ao padrão sazonal, constatou-se maior atividade dessas espécies durante o verão. Esses dados contribuem com as informações acerca da ecologia dos morcegos na região e evidenciam o alto potencial adaptativo das espécies estudadas à variação de tempo e condições ambientais...|$|R

Due to the scarcity of researches about the chiropterofauna in this region, {{the present study investigated}} species richness and abundance of bats in remnants from the stational semidecidual forest of the Upper Paraná River, southern Brazil. Samplings were taken every month, from January to December 2006, using 32 mist nets with 8. 0 x 2. 5 m, resulting in 640 m²/h and totaling a capture effort of 87, 040 m²/h. In order to estimate the species richness, the following estimators were employed Chao 1 and Jack 2. During the study, a total of 563 individuals belonging to 17 species (Artibeus planirostris, Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus,</b> Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Myotis nigricans, Desmodus rotundus, Artibeus obscurus, Noctilio albiventris, Phylostomus discolor, Phylostomus hastatus, Chrotopterus auritus, Lasiurus ega, Chiroderma villosum, Pygoderma bilabiatum and Lasiurus blossevillii) were captured. The estimated richness curves tended to stabilize, indicating that most of the species were sampled. Captured species represented 10 % of the taxa recorded in Brazil and 28 % in Paraná State, revealing the importance of this area for the diversity of bats. These findings indicate the need to determine actions aiming to restrict human activities in these forest fragments, in order to minimize anthropogenic impacts on the chiropterofauna...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Generally, {{natural environments}} have been {{transformed}} into small forest remnants, with the conse-quent habitat loss and species extinction. The North Paraná State is not an exception, since only 2 to 4 % of the original ecosystem occurs in small fragments of Stational Semidecidual Forest. We studied the species richness and abundance of bats in two forest fragments from the Fazenda Congonhas, in Rancho Alegre city, Paraná State, Brazil. Four samplings were undertaken in a legally protected native area (107. 8 ha) and in a reforested area (11. 8 ha) between April 2007 and March 2008. Samplings began at nightfall and lasted six hours, during two consecutive nights in each location. The individuals were captured using eight mist nets, with the same capture effort in both environments. A total of 397 individuals, 14 species and 10 genera were captured in the native area; while in the reforested area, 105 individuals, six species and four genera. Artibeus lituratus {{was the most common}} species in both fragments (n= 328, 65. 3 %), followed by Artibeus fimbriatus (n= 44, 8. 8 %) and Artibeus jamaicensis (n= 30, 6. 0 %).

40|$|Bats may exhibit {{different}} patterns of activity, considering aspects concerning niche dynamics {{as well as}} the establishment and permanence of the communities in the ecosystems. In this way, the present study analyzed the time and seasonal patterns of activity in different species of frequent phyllostomid bats in remnants of the stational semidecidual forest from the Upper Paraná River, Southern Brazil. Captures were performed between January and December, 2006, using 32 mist nets set above the soil along the nocturnal period during the four seasons of the year. The daily and seasonal patterns of activity of each species was modeled using generalized linear models with Poisson error. The best model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc). Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) did not exhibit a conspicuous time pattern, whereas A. lituratus (Olfers, 1818) was more frequent after the sixth hour and A. fimbriatus Gray, 1838 had an activity increase along the night. <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (E. Geoffroy, 1810) was registered during all sampling hours. Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy, 1810) were the most active during the first four hours. Concerning seasonal pattern, the highest activity of these species was verified during the summer. These data contribute to the information about the ecology of bats in the region, highlighting the high adaptive potential of the species studied in relation to the use of space throughout the night and in to variations in environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to verify {{the ability of the}} enzyme Alu I to cleave and/or remove {{satellite}} DNA sequences from heterochromatic regions in chromosomes of bats, by identifying the occurrence of modifications in the pattern of fluorescence in situ hybridization with telomeric DNA. The localization and fluorescence intensity of the telomeric DNA sites of the Alu-digested and undigested chromosomes of species Eumops glaucinus, Carollia perspicillata, and <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> were analyzed. Telomeric sequences were detected at the termini of chromosomes of all three species, although, in C. perspicillata, the signals were very faint or absent in most chromosomes. This finding was interpreted as being due to a reduced number of copies of the telomeric repeat, resulting from extensive telomeric association and/or rearrangements undergone by the chromosomes of Carollia. Fluorescent signals were also observed in centromeric and pericentromeric regions in several two-arm chromosomes of E. glaucinus and C. perspicillata. In E. glaucinus and P. lineatus, some interstitial and terminal telomeric sites were observed to be in association with regions of constitutive heterochromatin and ribosomal DNA (NORs). After digestion, these telomeric sites showed a significant decrease in signal intensity, indicating that enzyme Alu I cleaves and/or removes part of the satellite DNA present in these regions. These results suggest that the telomeric sequence is a component of the heterochromatin, and that the C-band- positive regions of bat chromosomes have a different DNA composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to show that displacements, {{promoters}} of genetic diversity in metapopulations, increase the probability of survival of bat species adapted to medium and long-distance flights. Samples were taken in four forest fragments, distributed in three municipalities in northern Paraná, and the maximum distance between the studied areas is 20 km. A monthly sampling was performed for each fragment, {{for the period of}} July 2008 to June 2009. We used eight nets for collection which remained open during the first four hours of the night, totalling 192 hours during a year of study. The marking occurred from October 2008 to March 2009 and was accomplished through the use of anodised metal rings of four different colours. One hundred and fifty individuals were banded and since the first capture, four displacements were recorded. After five months of collecting and marking, one Carollia perspicillata was found three km away. Two Artibeus lituratus were recorded about 20 km from the marking place: the first one after 22 months and the second one after 24 months. Additionally, one <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> was captured at about 20 km, after 26 months. As they moved around over considerable distances and are not monogamous, they mate with females of other fragments, exchanging genes and reducing or even avoiding inbreeding. Thus, populations of bats have the ability to increase genetic diversity in metapopulations, provided by displacements between the forest fragments. Species that behave like this are not vulnerable to isolation...|$|R
40|$|Among {{species of}} the Chiroptera, {{spermatogenesis}} and the fully differentiated spermatozoa differ in morphological and ultrastructural detail. This study therefore aimed to ultrastructurally characterize the spermatogenesis and the spermatozoa of Carollia perspicillata (Phyllostomidae) and compare the process with other species of bats and mammals. The differentiation of spermatogonia is similar to other bats and to Primates, with three main spermatogonia types: A(d), A(p), and B. Meiotic divisions proceed similarly to those of most mammals and spermiogenesis is clearly divided into 12 steps, {{in the middle of}} the range of developmental steps for bats (9 - 16 steps). The process of acrosome formation is similar to that found in <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus,</b> with the acrosome formed by two different types of proacrosomal vesicles. The ultrastructure of the spermatozoon is similar to other bats already described and resembles the typical mammalian sperm model; however, its morphology differs from other mammals such as marsupials and rodents, on account of a simpler spermatozoon head morphology, which indicates a pattern that is more closely related to the sperm cells of humans and other primates. Our data demonstrated that spermatogenesis in C. perspicillata presents great ultrastructural similarities to P. lineatus. This pattern is not surprising, because both species belong to the same family (Phyllostomidae); however, it is observed that C. perspicillata presents some characteristics that are more closely related to phylogenetically distant species, such as Myotis nigricans (Vespertilionidae), which is a fact that deserves attention.

40|$|We {{compared}} bat assemblages in semideciduous forest fragments in Brazilian Cerrado {{with those}} of eucalyptus plantations (Eucalyptus spp.). Specifically, we assessed differences in species richness, diversity, abundance, and species composition between habitat types and evaluated bat responses {{with respect to a}} variety of landscape characteristics and local-scale variables. Bats were sampled with mist nets in four replicates each of eucalyptus plantations and fragments of native Cerrado. Of the total of 209 individuals captured, 75 were caught in plantations and 134 in native forest areas. Cerrado assemblages were characterized by higher species richness, diversity, and evenness compared to those in eucalypt plantations. Gleaning animalivorous phyllostomids seem to be most sensitive to plantation forests, as they were not captured in this habitat. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated no strong separation between habitat types and {{there were no significant differences}} in species composition based on an analysis of similarities. The proportion of forest cover (both Cerrado and Eucalyptus) in the landscape was the only landscape-scale variable which had a significant influence on species composition. In contrast, species composition was unrelated to geographical distance between forest fragments. A generalized linear mixed effects model for the three most frequently captured species (Carollia perspicillata, Artibeus planirostris, <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus)</b> only showed significant differences in abundance for Artibeus planirostris, the species being more abundant in native Cerrado. Our results demonstrate the impoverishment of bat assemblages in eucalypt plantations and highlight the importance of examining the effects of habitat conversion at the individual species level as responses are often species-specific...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out with the {{objective}} of evaluating if the size of forest fragments affects the diversity of bat species. In order to do that, seven fragments were studied in Londrina, Paraná: five small fragments, whose areas varied between 1 and 10 ha; a fragment which is considered medium-sized (Parque Municipal Arthur Thomas - 85, 47 ha.); and a large fragment (Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy - 680 ha.). Thirty three species were collected. Ten species were common to all three types of fragments: Chrotopterus auritus (Peters, 1856), Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758), Artibeus fimbriatus Gray, 1838, Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818), <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (E.

Geoffroy, 1810), Vampyressa pusilla (Wagner, 1843), Eptesicus brasiliensis (Desmarest, 1819), and Myotis nigricans (Schinz, 1821). Eight species were only found in the large fragment: Noctilio albiventris Desmarest, 1818, Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766), Uroderma bilobatum Peters, 1866, Diaemus youngi (Jentink, 1893), Diphylla ecaudata Spix, 1823, Eptesicus furinalis (d'Orbigny, 1847), Histiotus velatus (I. Geoffroy, 1824) and Myotis levis (I. Geoffroy, 1824). Five were only found in the small fragments: Noctilio leporinus (Linnaeus, 1758), Phyllostomus discolor Wagner, 1843, Chiroderma villosum Peters, 1860, Eptesicus sp. e Rogheessa tumida H. Allen, 1866. Chiroderma doriae, which is threatened by extinction, was captured in the large fragment and in one of the small fragments; M. ruber, also threatened by extinction, was captured in the medium-sized and large fragments. We believe that the major cause for the loss of organic diversity is not rational exploitation, but the destruction of habitats, a result of the expansion of irrational human activities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the ecological relevance and great biodiversity of bats in Brazil. However, mountainous areas have been disproportionately less sampled, mainly in the Southeast. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify and compare the richness and diversity of Phyllostomidae, the most diverse bat family, in different forest types in Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, trying to understand the causes of possible differences. The Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca is inserted in the Serra da Mantiqueira's domain, in an Atlantic Forest region known as "Zona da Mata", state of Minas Gerais, with an altitudinal range between 1200 - 1784 meters. The study was conducted in two forest types, classified as "Nanofloresta Nebular" and "Floresta Nebular", whose respective data on richness and diversity were compared. The bats were captured with 8 - 10 mist nets for 14 months (April 2011 to May 2012) and four nights per month totaling 62, 171. 25 m 2 h of capture effort. A total of 392 captures (12 species) belonging to the Phyllostomidae family were obtained. The most abundant species were Sturnira lilium (59. 9 %), <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (11. 3 %), Artibeus lituratus (8. 7 %) and Carollia perspicillata (7. 6 %). The two sampled areas presented differences in bat richness, diversity and species composition, and this difference was predominantly influenced by S. lilium. It is likely that the observed difference in the assembly of bats between the two study sites depends on the variation in floristic composition. The records of A. lituratus and P. lineatus in a few months of the year and close to Ficus mexiae bearing ripe fruits suggests that at least these species move to the park for a few periods of the year in search of food resources, possibly moving through the altitudinal landscapes...|$|R

The Pantanal surveys were {{carried out in the}} Nhecolândia, Aquidauana, Miranda, and Paraguai sub-regions; the uplands surveys took place in the Maracaju, Bodoquena, and Urucum formations. Bat specimens were mist-netted over 376 nights in 35 sites, predominantly near fruiting trees, bat shelters, and forest patches. In the floodplain 46 species were recorded (n = 6, 292 individuals), and 44 species were found in the uplands (n = 2, 745 individuals). Six families were recorded: Phyllostomidae (30 species), Molossidae (12 species), Verpertilionidae (nine species) Noctilionidae (two species), Emballorunidae (two species) and Mormoopidae (one species). The bat fauna was predominantly composed of insectivore (32) and frugivore (15) species. The frugivorous Artibeus planirostris (n = 3, 101 individuals) was the commonest species in floodplain and uplands. Other common species were Myotis nigricans (n = 762), Molossus molossus (n = 692), Noctilio albiventris (n = 681), <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus</b> (n = 633), Sturnira lilium (n = 461), Carollia perspicillata (n = 451), Glossophaga soricina (n = 436), Artibeus lituratus (n = 320), and Desmodus rotundus (n = 281).

40|$|Os morcegos frugívoros são componentes fundamentais na manutenção e regeneração de florestas tropicais, pois ao se alimentarem, promovem a mobilidade das sementes dos frutos em que se alimentaram. Muito se discute sobre os efeitos da passagem das sementes no trato digestivo dos morcegos sobre a taxa e velocidade de germinação. O objetivo deste trabalho foi examinar a dieta das espécies de morcegos frugívoros na Estação Experimental de Itirapina para descobrir quais utilizam significativamente os frutos de Cecropia pachystachya. Foi testada a importância dos quirópteros na dispersão e germinação desta espécie de planta. Para isso, os morcegos foram capturados no período de agosto de 2005 a julho de 2006, suas fezes foram recolhidas e as sementes de C. pachystachya separadas. Os testes de germinação foram feitos para duas espécies de morcegos, Artibeus liuratus e <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus,</b> e suas taxas de germinação comparadas com amostras de sementes coletadas da planta (controle). Foram feitos cinco repetições com 30 sementes em cada gerbox para cada teste. Os testes foram realizados em câmaras germinadoras " Mangelsdorf", com temperatura de 25 °C, luminosidade e umidade constante por 40 dias. Houve uma alta porcentagem de germinação das sementes encontradas em A. lituratus (79, 3 %) e não diferiu estatisticamente das sementes controle (76 %). Esses resultados foram superiores a P. lineatus (52 %). Em relação ao Índice de Velocidade de Germinação (IVG), esse resultado foi semelhante, sendo 2, 73 para A. lituratus, 2, 66 para o controle e 1, 80 para P. lineatus. Com esse resultado, tem-se que a passagem das sementes de C. pachystachya pelos morcegos não aumentou a porcentagem, nem a velocidade de germinação delas, quando comparado com o controle, sendo até menor para P. lineatus. Com os resultados obtidos, conclui-se que, o efeito da passagem do trato digestivo dos morcegos na germinação pode sofrer influências que ainda precisam ser estudadas, mas não há como negar o beneficio da dispersão das sementes de C. pachystachya promovida por quatro espécies de morcegos {{no local}} estudado. Frugivorous bats are {{fundamental}} {{components in the}} maintenance and regeneration of tropical forests since they promote the mobility of the fruit seeds.

The goal of this work was to investigate the diet of frugivorous bat species at Estação Experimental de Itirapina to find out which species significantly use the fruits of the pioneer plants species Cecropia pachystachya. It was tested the importance of bats on the spread and germination of seeds from this plant species. For that, the bats were captured in the period from August 2005 to July 2006, their feces were collected and the seeds of C. pachystachya separated. The germination tests were made for two bat species, Artibeus liuratus and <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus,</b> and were compared with seeds collected directly from the plant (control). Five repetitions were made with 30 seeds in each gerbox for each test. The tests were conducted in " Mangelsdorf" germinators chambers, with temperature of 25 °C, luminosity and constant humidity for 40 days. There was a high germination percentage of the seeds found in A. lituratus (79, 3 %), and it did not differ statistically from the seeds control (76 %). These results were superior from P. lineatus (52 %). Regarding the Germination Speed Index (IVG), the results were similar, being 2, 73 for A. lituratus, 2, 66 for the control seeds and 1, 80 for P. lineatus. It was concluded that the passage of the seeds of C. pachystachya through the bats gut did not increase the percentage or the speed of germination, when compared with the control seeds, being smaller for P. lineatus. With the results obtained, it was concluded that the effects of the bats’ gut passage in the germination still needs further studies but the benefits of seed dispersion of C. pachystachya promoted by four bat species in the studied place cannot be refused...|$|R

Four samplings were undertaken in a legally protected native area (107. 8 ha) and in a reforested area (11. 8 ha) between April 2007 and March 2008. Samplings began at nightfall and lasted six hours, during two consecutive nights in each location.

A total of 397 individuals, 14 species and 10 genera were captured in the native area; while in the reforested area, 105 individuals, six species and four genera. Artibeus lituratus {{was the most common}} species in both fragments (n= 328, 65. 3 %), followed by Artibeus fimbriatus (n= 44, 8. 8 %) and Artibeus jamaicensis (n= 30, 6. 0 %).

The native area presented higher values of species richness (S= 14) and diversity (H’= 1. 4802) in comparison to the reforested area (S= 6, H’= 0. 57015). The t-test evidenced a significant difference between diversity among the sites (t= 7. 1075). Chao 1 index indicated that the sampling effort recorded approximately 78 % from the total species richness for the native area and 75 % for the reforested area. Therefore, the preservation of the forest fragment is essential since it provides habitat for a diverse community of bats. Forest management and reforestation actions may prevent drastic changes in the microclimate of neighboring areas within the forest fragment, and could allow the occupation of available niches in the area, by opportunistic and generalist species.

El área nativa presentó mayores valores de riqueza de especies (S= 14) y diversidad (H’= 1. 4802) en comparación con la reforestada (S= 6, H’= 0. 57015). El t-test evidenció una diferencia significativa en la diversidad de los sitios (t= 7. 1075). El índice Chao 1 indicó que el esfuerzo de muestreo registró el 78 % de la riqueza total de especies en la zona nativa y 75 % en la reforestada. Por lo tanto, la preservación del fragmento de bosque es esencial, ya que proporciona un hábitat para una diversa comunidad de murciélagos. Las acciones de manejo forestal y la reforestación pueden evitar cambios drásticos en el microclima de las áreas vecinas al fragmento de bosque y podría permitir la ocupación de nichos disponibles en la zona, por especies generalistas y oportunistas...|$|R
40|$|Between 1989 and 1995, twenty {{caves in}} the Distrito Federal area in mid-western Brazil were {{assessed}} for bat species richness, frequency, spatial distribution, behavior, reproduction and inter-specific cohabitation. The general {{state of conservation}} of the caves was also assessed. of the 20 caves studied, 12 were less than 100 m long, five between 100 m and 300 m, and three were longerthan 300 m. Twenty-two species of six different families were observed: 16 species belonged to Phyllostomidae, two to Vespertilionidae and Mormoopidae and one to Furipteridae and Emballonuridae. In this study, 17 species were characterized as Distrito Federal cave dwellers. The most prevalent were Desmodus rotundus, Glossophaga soricina and Carollia perspicillata. The least prevalent were Lonchorhina aurita, Pteronotus gymnonotus and Phylloderma stenops. Since some Anoura caudifer, <b>Platyrrhinus</b> <b>lineatus,</b> Myotis nigricans, Micronycteris minuta, and Eptesicus brasiliensis individuals were captured only while going into the caves early in the night, they were not considered cave dwellers. Even though, they probably use the caves as a daytime roosting place. Surprisingly, Lonchophylla dekeyseri, {{considered to be the}} only endemic bat species in the Cerrado ecosystem, was observed in three of the surveyed caves. Further biological studies are necessary to determine the biology of L. dekeyseri and the necessity of its conservation. The bat colonies observed were usually of a small size. Few colonies of D. rotundus and Anoura geoffroyi contained more than 300 individuals of both sexes. Only a inale group of L. aurita was observed in the Distrito Federal area. Twelve of the surveyed caves were hard to access and therefore well protected. Four of the caves received some public visitation, two were located near limestone mines, one was located near an urban area. and one had both public visitation and deforestation near its entrance. In this latter cave, no bats were observed after november 1994, probably due to the urbanization process. Special attention should be given to eight of the surveyed caves in any plan made for the conservation of cave bats in the Distrito Federal area. These caves host a high bat diversity (six or more species) and also shelter two rare and one endemic bat species...|$|R
