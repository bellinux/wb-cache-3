50|$|The Central Council of <b>Probation</b> <b>and</b> <b>After-Care</b> Committees is {{the body}} which co-ordinates {{probation}} services (which are generally organised on a county basis) in England and Wales and acts as their central representative to the UK Government.|$|R
50|$|The CCETSW was {{established}} on 1 October 1971 under the Health Visiting and Social Work (Training) Act 1962. It replaced the Central Training Council in Child Care, the Council for Training in Social Work, and the Recruitment and Training Committee of the Advisory Council for <b>Probation</b> <b>and</b> <b>After-Care,</b> <b>and</b> also took over certain {{functions of the}} Association of Psychiatric Social Workers and the Institute for Medical Social Work.|$|R
40|$|When {{probation}} emerged {{a century}} ago it was grafted onto a criminal justice system with well-established prisons. Nevertheless {{for the first time}} in British penal history it was possible to impose a Probation Order as an alternative to Victorian punishments. By the 1960 s, a time of change for <b>probation</b> (Whitehead <b>and</b> Statham, 2006), the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders published its report on after-care that had a significant impact on the relationship between <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> prisons (Home Office, 1963). By 1967 an expanding probation organisation became the <b>Probation</b> <b>and</b> <b>After-Care</b> Service which began to fill social work posts in remand, detention, and borstal allocation centres, thus drawing probation closer into the custodial orbit...|$|R
40|$|Probation {{services}} {{throughout the}} world have difficulty in assessing the risks and needs presented by offenders, in evaluating the effectiveness of supervision, and in enabling practitioners {{to assess the impact}} of their work with individual offenders. This paper describes how these problems are addressed by the comprehensive and relatively successful approach to evidence-based probation that has been developed since 1996 in the small <b>Probation</b> <b>and</b> <b>After-Care</b> Service of the British Channel Island of Jersey. In conclusion, the authors discuss whether such ap-proaches could work in other jurisdictions, and suggest that this depends partly on context. In particular, the example of England and Wales shows how potentially successful approaches can be frustrated by over-centralization, managerialism and the politicization of criminal justice...|$|R

40|$|IN 1963 we {{published}} {{the results of}} a study of 200 borstal boys interviewed on conviction in 1953 and 1955 (Gibbens, Marriage and Walker). The cohorts chosen consisted of every other boy sentenced to borstal training in the Metropolitan Police Area in 1953 and 1955 until 100 of each had been seen. In 1954 and 1956 the boys were interviewed and tested again in their training institutions, and their progress was discussed with their house-masters. Later their "blue books", with interesting records of <b>after-care</b> supervision <b>and</b> voluminous correspondence between governors, <b>probation</b> officers, <b>and</b> <b>after-care</b> authority, were made available. Their subsequent convictions, if any, were traced for 10 years and various observations made upon clinical prognosis and the Mannheim-Wilkins prediction (Gibbens and Prince, 1965). Their subsequent convictions have now been followed for 25 years, until early 1978, and the present paper reports the results. These are particularly interesting to the author, since many of the boys are remembered clearly; but whether others have reason to be interested is less certain. They relate to a past generation which had many unique features. The boys were born between 1932 and 1938, and in many cases suffered the disruption of evacuation in war-time. This was very varied. Evacuation occurred at different ages and for different periods; it did not necessarily affect those in the outer suburbs or boys later convicted in London who spent their childhood elsewhere. Nevertheless, half (50 - 5 per cent.) of the boys had lost contact with one or both parents or permanent substitutes for the whole of the first five years. Secondly, conscription was still in operation, a powerful but two-edged influence. Many of the eligible boys went straight into the army after borstal, usually joined the Royal Army Service Corps where they were taught to drive and repair vehicles, or to cook in the Army Catering Corps. They were discharged with a trade, and service provided an excellent way to bury their past and to come home with prid...|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{and describes}} major variables associated with recidivism and rehabilitation of male trial awaiting youth offenders. It {{is based on}} a study 2 that was undertaken by the author to investigate the problem specifically from the perspective of trial awaiting juvenile recidivists. Findings in the study revealed that financial gain, drug addiction and peer pressure were the major driving forces and motivating factors that influenced the respondents to become repeatedly involved in criminal behaviour. Lack of a stable source of income, denial of re-admission at school, rejection by family and friends and lack of stable home and accommodation were some of the major factors that made re-integration into the community difficult for the respondents during the period after their previous release. Re-integration <b>and</b> <b>after-care</b> services were identified as an area that is grossly neglected in the field of <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> in social work services generally. In view of the key findings of the study, recommendations are outlined with regard to proposed strategies for management and control of recidivism among male trial awaiting youth offenders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Historically, the {{efficacy}} of <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> parole policies and practices have been judged by the general public, politicians, and many professional insiders by sensationalised crimes involving individuals sentenced to community supervision. The <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> parole profession has not established mechanisms to clearly articulate its public value; doing so would foster the development of policies and practices that derive more from empirical research evidence and sound theory than political faddism. The failure within the <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> parole profession to come to broad agreement regarding desired outcomes and to establish evidence-based and/or theoretically-sound professional principles has created a policy lacuna that is too often filled by elected officials who lack {{an understanding of the}} history, science, <b>and</b> philosophy of <b>probation</b> <b>and</b> parole. <b>Probation</b> <b>and</b> parole agencies should focus on producing publicly-valued results and disseminating easily-understood information that justifies their important niche within America’s criminal justice system.
