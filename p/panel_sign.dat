50|$|A bilingual sign (or, by extension, a {{multilingual}} sign) is {{the representation}} on a <b>panel</b> (<b>sign,</b> usually a traffic sign, a safety sign, an informational sign) of texts {{in more than}} one language. The use of bilingual signs is usually reserved for situations where there is legally administered bilingualism (in bilingual regions or at national borders) or where there is a relevant tourist or commercial interest (airports, train stations, ports, border checkpoints, tourist attractions, international itineraries, international institutions, etc.). However, more informal uses of bilingual signs are often found on businesses in areas where there is a high degree of bilingualism, such as in areas where large concentrations of immigrants settle.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Germany {{changed the}} law that using the road is the standard. Roadside cycletracks can only made {{obligatory}} for safety reasons and must have minimum physical standards (width, straightness). The non-obligatory ones have to be visible by design, but no <b>panel</b> <b>sign</b> existed. Since beginning of 2014, {{there is the possibility}} to signpost bidirectional non-obligatory roadside cycletracks using additional panels. There are big differences among the local applications of these laws. Extreme cases are the two cities with the highest cycling rates: in Münster, on almost all cycletracks cyclists are obligated to use them if present, in Bremen more than 75% are not. In Bremen, some cycle tracks have been displaced by traffic calming on the carriageway or by cycle lanes. Also Berlin, Cologne, Munich and Hamburg are making campaigns to convert obligatory cycletracks to facilitative ones or to displace them by cycle lanes (especially Hamburg) ...|$|E

40|$|Crashworthy, work-zone, {{portable}} sign {{support systems}} accepted under NCHRP Report No. 350 were analyzed to predict their safety peformance {{according to the}} TL- 3 MASH evaluation criteria. An analysis was conducted to determine which hardware parameters of sign support systems would likely contribute to the safety performance with MASH. The acuracy of the method was evaluated through full-scale crash testing. Four full-scale crash tests were conducted with a pickup truck. Two tall-mounted, sign support systems with aluminum <b>sign</b> <b>panels</b> failed the MASH criteria due to windshield penetration. One low-mounted system with a vinyl, roll-up <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> failed the MASH criteria due to windshield and floorboard penetration. Another low-mounted system with an aluminum <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> successfully met the MASH criteria. Four full-scale crash tests were conducted with a small passenger car. The low-mounted tripod system with an aluminum <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> failed the MASH criteria due to windshield penetration. One low-mounted system with aluminum <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> failed the MASH criteria due to excessive windshield deformation, and another similar system passed the MASH criteria. The low-mounted system with a vinyl, roll-up <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> successfully met the MASH criteria. Hardware parameters of work-zone sign support systems that were determined to be important for failure with MASH include <b>sign</b> <b>panel</b> material, the height {{to the top of}} the mast, the presence of flags, sign-locking mechanism, base layout and system orientation. Flowcharts were provided to assist manufacturers when designing new sign support systems...|$|R

It shows Saint Barbara imprisoned in a tower by her pagan father, to preserve her from the outside world, especially from suitors he did not approve of. While there, she converted to Christianity, enraging her father and leading to her murder and martyrdom.|$|R

50|$|This <b>panel,</b> not <b>signed</b> nor dated, was looted by Napoleon Bonaparte {{and brought}} to Paris in 1808, being {{returned}} in 1815. It was painted {{at about the same}} time as The Peasant Wedding, that is, circa 1567. The sizes of the two paintings are the same and they may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life. They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental Italianate figures.|$|R
5|$|The father <b>panel</b> is <b>signed</b> {{and dated}} on both sides, {{in what may}} be the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|R
50|$|The Carmelite altarpiece {{was sold}} in 1818 and {{subsequently}} lost. It was found when the Asano Madonna was restored to its original state, revealing Lorenzetti's Carmelite altarpiece underneath. Two clues to restorers that the Asano Madonna {{was in fact the}} Carmelite altarpiece were the uncovering of Saint Elijah hidden under a later rendering of Saint Anthony for the Asano order, and the Carmelite colours of the costumes worn by the painted figures.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the loads on traffic <b>sign</b> <b>panels</b> in the current standards does not, in general, {{take into account the}} vehicle-induced loads, as explained by Quinn, Baker and Wright (QBW in what follows) (J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerodyn. 89 (2001) 831). On the other hand, a report from Cali and Covert (CC) (J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerodyn. 84 (2000) 87) indicates that in highway sign support structures, vehicle-induced loads have led to premature failures in some cases. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a mathematical model for the vehicle-induced load on a flat <b>sign</b> <b>panel,</b> simple enough to give analytical results, but able to explain the main characteristics of the phenomenon. The results of the theoretical model help to explain the behaviour observed in the experiments performed in previous studies...|$|R
50|$|This altarpiece (1348-1350), {{found in}} the Siena Cathedral, {{was one of four}} altarpieces {{commissioned}} by the Commune, that depict the four patrons saints of the city. The other three altarpieces: St Ansanus by Simone Martini, St Crescentious by Ambrogio Lorenzetti and St Savinus by Pietro Lorenzetti; were identified earlier because the <b>panels</b> were <b>signed</b> and dated, and because of 15th century inventories from the cathedral. However, none of these sources were consistent in mentioning the St Victor Altarpiece. It wasn’t until the late 16th century that previously lost inventories, made by Guigurta Tommasi, named Bulgarini as the painter of the St Victor altarpiece.|$|R
50|$|Although a gilden {{coach with}} or without painted <b>panels</b> was a <b>sign</b> of high social and governamental status, the {{position}} of the occupants of the coach determines the number of horses that draw the vehicle.

50|$|In 1993, the {{director}} of UDOT's District One, which included SR-69, requested a renumbering, due to problems with sign theft:"The SR-69 route signs have become a collectors' item for {{a large number of}} individuals, resulting in a large expense for us in replacing the signs. We suspect it is college students that are taking most of the signs, as there is a very significant loss in SR-69 <b>sign</b> <b>panels</b> during the college school year. We lose approximately 35 <b>sign</b> <b>panels</b> each year from this route. Often, the post is also damaged - requiring replacement. We do not experience losses anywhere close to this magnitude on any other route."The Utah Transportation Commission approved the request, changing the number from 69 to 38 (which had been unused since 1975) on October 15, 1993; signs were replaced in April 1994. No changes of any significance have been made since then.|$|R
