50|$|A <b>pedigreed</b> <b>animal</b> is {{one that}} has its ancestry recorded. Often this is tracked by a major registry.

40|$|Abstract Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) {{are used}} widely in {{biomedical}} research, and the genetics of their MHC (Mhc-Mafa) {{has become the}} focus of considerable attention in recent years. The cohort of Indonesian pedi-greed macaques that we present here was typed for Mafa-A,-B, and-DR, by sequencing, as described in earlier studies. Additionally, the DRB region of these animals was characterised by microsatellite analyses. In this study, full-length sequencing of Mafa-DPA/B and-DQA/B in these animals was performed. A total of 75 different alleles were observed; 22 of which have not previously been reported, plus 18 extended exon 2 alleles that were already known. Furthermore, two microsatellites, D 6 S 2854 and D 6 S 2859, were used to characterise the complexMafa-A region. Sequenc-ing and segregation analyses revealed that the length patterns of these microsatellites are unique for each Mafa-A haplotype. In this work, we present a pedigreed colony of approximately 120 cynomolgus macaques; all of which are typed for the most significant polymorphic MHC class I and class II markers. Offspring of these <b>pedigreed</b> <b>animals</b> are easily characterised for their MHC by microsatellite analyses on the Mafa-A and-DRB regions, which makes the cumbersome sequencing analyses redundant...|$|R

Conventional procedure of vasectomy required a long-term anesthesia and longer duration of hospitalization, which often result in stress, morbidity and mortality. A {{study was conducted}} to capture, neuter and release the deer with minimal hospitalization and stress by adopting three finger palpation technique of vas deferens and performing vasectomy through a key-hole incision. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on three spotted male deer and three sambar male deer, which were immobilized with a mixture of xylazine at the dose of 1. 00 mg/kg and ketamine at the dose of 5. 00 mg/kg. The vas deferens could be palpated as a piece of cooked spaghetti at the neck of the scrotum on the anterior aspect by three finger palpation technique and was able to fix the vas deferens between the thumb and middle finger. Through a key-hole incision of < 5 mm length, the vas deferens was exteriorized and resected using electrocautery and the skin incision was sealed with methyl methacrylate. The deer were released on the same day, and no post-operative complication was noticed. Conclusion: The study revealed that three finger palpation technique of vas deferens provided guidance for easy access to vas deferens for vasectomy in deer with less hospitalization, and the deer could be released on the same day...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the genetic composition of 3382 genetically characterized and <b>pedigreed</b> <b>animals</b> currently maintained under 3 different housing configurations at the California National Primate Research Center, including the indoor colony, outdoor ‘corn cribs,’ and half-acre field cages. Summary statistics based on 15 short tandem repeats strongly suggest significant effects of genetic drift, including {{the loss of}} allele diversity, among the enclosures within the housing facilities even though gene flow among the different housing units is actively promoted by colony management. Management methods of selectively harvesting female macaques to prevent overrepresentation of one or only a few matrilines and cross-fostering 1 -wk-old infants among breeding cages and corn cribs have been insufficient to prevent genetic subdivisions among the cages and corn cribs and to evenly distribute genetic diversity throughout the colony. In addition to promoting several colony management strategies recommended herein to effectively curb inbreeding and genetic differentiation, current attempts of infant cross-fostering and minimizing matriline fragmentation should be expanded. The inclusion of inbred or highly genetically homogeneous animals with diminished allele diversity in linkage and association studies will likely compromise the potential for identifying allele–disease associations, whereas the inclusion of macaques from different geographic origins or their hybrids (or both) in experimental research confounds interpretations of phenotypic differences, due to inflation of the genetic contribution to phenotypic variance...|$|R
40|$|In the double-muscled (DM) Belgian Blue beef (BBB) breed, {{caesarean}} section (CS) is being applied systematically as a management tool to prevent dystocia. As {{a matter of}} fact, CS is the only possible way of calving in the breed. High birth weight and a relatively small pelvic area are the main causes of dystocia and, in the DM-BBB breed, {{the reasons for the}} systematically applied CS. Selection for lower birth weight and larger pelvic sizes might reduce dystocia and routine CS. Few data on inner pelvic sizes of <b>pedigree</b> <b>animals</b> are available. Using external measurements to estimate the inner pelvic sizes might be an option to resolve this problem. In this study, animals of the DM-BBB breed were measured and weighed on farms and in abattoirs. External and internal pelvic sizes increased with live weight and age of the animals. Gender had a significant influence on inner pelvic traits. Increased muscular conformation was associated with decreased inner pelvic dimensions. Models with weight, gender, age, withers height and outer pelvic width (TcTc) can be used to estimate inner pelvic sizes (R- 2 between 0. 35 and 0. 77). The estimated inner pelvic sizes can then be used to genetically evaluate pelvic traits in the DM-BBB breed.

40|$|This paper evaluates an {{efficient}} implementation to multiply the inverse of a numerator relationship matrix for genotyped animals (A(22) (- 1)) by a vector (q). The computation {{is required for}} solving mixed model equations in single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) with the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG). The inverse can be decomposed into sparse matrices that are blocks of the sparse inverse of a numerator relationship matrix (A(- 1)) including genotyped animals and their ancestors. The elements of A(- 1) were rapidly calculated with the Henderson's rule and stored as sparse matrices in memory. Implementation of A(22) (- 1) q was {{by a series of}} sparse matrix-vector multiplications. Diagonal elements of A(22) (- 1) A, which were required as preconditioners in PCG, were approximated with a Monte Carlo method using 1, 000 samples. The efficient implementation of A(22) (- 1) q was compared with explicit inversion of A(22) with 3 data sets including about 15, 000, 81, 000, and 570, 000 genotyped animals selected from populations with 213, 000, 8. 2 million, and 10. 7 million <b>pedigree</b> <b>animals,</b> respectively.

Sequencing of the agouti signalling peptide in the agouti gene coding region revealed a 2-base pair deletion in black domestic cats.

40|$|At present {{there is}} a lack of {{information}} concerning the breeding methods practised by owners of pedigree dairy cattle in New Zealand. This deficiency is a serious handicap in attacking some of the major problems facing the dairy industry in this country. Since the emergence of the Dairy Board in 1936 as the main national force concerned with herd improvement a great deal has been achieved in the field of dairy cattle improvement and the evolution of a sire survey applicable to conditions obtaining in New Zealand is one of the major achievements of the Dairy Board. But many aspects of the pedigree industry which provides the majority of sires used in the Dominion remain to be elucidated. For example, the present scarcity of proven sires, and the more or less stationary level of production of commercial herds are some of the problems which have direct bearing on the pedigree section of the dairy industry. These facts alone illustrate the importance of the study of current breeding methods and of the pedigree system as it exists in New Zealand. Many investigations relating to dairy cattle breeding have been carried out overseas. Although many of the problems studied are encountered in New Zealand, the Dominion's typical grassland farming and the seasonal dairying associated with it limit the usefulness of such investigations. With more information becoming available breed societies are beginning to adjust themselves to a new phase of cattle breeding. The increasing emphasis on production as an aid to selection, and the acceptance of artificial insemination are two phases in which a change of attitude is desirable. The rapid growth of pedigree herds, the more frequent appearance of performance details in pedigrees and the increasing number of <b>pedigree</b> <b>animals</b> mated artificially each year illustrate this gradual change...|$|R
