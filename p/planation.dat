5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} <b>planation</b> surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine <b>planation</b> others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{influx of}} Filipinos into the United States was {{in large part}} due to social {{programs}} such as the pensionando program and the necessity for labor in certain areas such as California and Alaska. Laborers and farmers who migrated from the Philippines were known as the [...] "Manong" [...] Generation, an Ilocano term referring to an elderly person. [...] Filipino migrant workers began coming to the U.S. around the start of the 20th century; they were mostly men who worked in either California or Alaska. Some had worked in the sugar <b>planations</b> of Hawaii as well, but this occurred before Hawaii became a state. These men were referred to as the “Manong” generation, which is an Ilocano term designated for elderly people. For many Filipino laborers and workers during this time period, there was an emphasis on dressing well. This happened for multiple reasons. First, Filipino laborers looked to disassociate themselves from lower class citizens. Another reason included the desire to emulate Hollywood actors during the 1920’s and 1930’s. Filipinos were unable to rent or own homes in cities such as Los Angeles, so they spent their money on other things such as clothing. In living spaces, Filipinos were confined to upwards of fifteen to twenty tenants in a single room to save money. This allowed for Filipinos to spend their money on clothing instead of rent and other possessions instead. Also, Filipinos were portrayed as weak, submissive, unassertive, and eager to please; dressing well was perceived to counter those stereotypes. Despite earning meager wages, Filipino laborers bought nice clothing as a means to appear nicer than their pay would suggest. Lastly, another reason for the desire to dress well was to impress relatives back in the Philippines. Filipino laborers sent pictures of themselves in their suits in order to give them the impression they were quite successful in America.|$|R
40|$|We {{have all}} {{witnessed}} the flocking of starlings {{in the sky}} and the schools of fish that form in the ocean. This kind of organization of living creatures is not limited to those that we see, but also occurs for those that we don’t : swimming microorganisms. Suspen- sions of micro-swimmers exhibit a rich dynamics. Their behaviors can {{play an important role in}} the survival of the group, its development, the balance between species, their trophic strategies and even animal fertility. They can form coherent structures due to collective motion, mix the surrounding fluid or modify its rheological properties. Such diversity results from the complex interplay between swimming strategies, physiological processes, chemical reactions and hydrodynamic interactions. Fluid Mechanics is there- fore essential to understand and master the mechanisms involved in these phenomena. While experimental studies bring out new findings and, sometimes, provide physical ex- <b>planations,</b> modeling remains essential. Yet, including an accurate description of the micro-swimmers in a suspension containing thousands (nay millions) individuals, requires considering a wide range of coupled scales (from one micron 10 ^− 6 m to several millimeters 10 ^− 3 m). What happens on large scales depends on sophisticated mechanisms occurring two or three orders of magnitude below. Therefore, the multiscale modeling of such phenomena is still a major challenge for the state-of-the-art numerical methods. This thesis aims at providing a contribution in that direction. In a first part, we will show that reproducing swimming mechanisms at the scale of the micro-swimmer can be achieved with various models spanning different levels of complexity. We will then present our developments to incorporate these models in an efficient framework for large scale simulations. We will show how to simultaneously account for the Brownian motion of the smallest particles (10 ^− 6 m). Our code reproduces known results from the literature with the same accuracy, but at lower cost and at larger scales, thus bridging a gap between particle-based models, experiments and continuum formulations from kinetic theory. Using the capabilities afforded by our method, we eventually address two open problems in the experimental literature : the origins of orientational correla- tions between interacting self-propelled micro-droplets and the mechanisms at play in the nonlinear enhancement of Brownian particle diffusion in active suspensions...|$|R

When identified, morphoclimatic zones do usually lack sharp boundaries and tend to grade from one type to another resulting in that only the core of the zone has all expected attributes. Influential morphoclimatic zoning schemes are those of Julius Büdel (1948, 1963, 1977) and of Jean Tricart and André Cailleux (1965). Büdel's schemes stresses <b>planation</b> and valley-cutting in relation to climate, arguing the valley-cutting is dominant in subpolar regions while <b>planation</b> is so in the tropics. As such this scheme is concerned not only with processes but also with end-products of geomorphic activity.

The oldest <b>planation</b> surface is of early Palaeozoic age (PS 1); the second is Late Triassic (PS 2); {{and the third is}} of Early Cretaceous age (PS 3). The Oligocene Trap Volcanics buried a surface (PS 4) of early Tertiary age, which is now widely exposed by erosion as a surface that, where flat enough, is an exhumed <b>planation</b> surface.

Because there is no general method of delineation of <b>planation</b> surfaces, the main objective of the study was to find a suitable method for semi-automated recognition of flat landforms in the Aggtelek Karst, which should correspond to different phases of the Jósva River incision and therefore could be correlated to the multilevel cave system of the study area. Several methods for semi-automated landform classification were tested for recognition of flat surfaces in a relatively objective way. Slope gradient thresholding tool, and r. param. scale and r. geomorphon modules implemented in GRASS GIS were tested. As a result, the r. geomorphon module was proven as the most suitable method for delineation of relatively flat surfaces. Findings of the presented work can be used as a morphological indicator of the comprehensive reconstruction of evolution of the Aggtelek Karst and the Slovak Karst...|$|E
40|$|The Rebrnice area {{forms the}} north eastern {{slopes of the}} Upper Vipava Valley and is located between Karst plateau to the {{southwest}} and the Nanos plateau to the northeast. The Rebrnice slopes are geomorphologically defied by a thrust front of Mesozoic carbonates over Tertiary flsch deposits and are characterised {{by a variety of}} polygenetic landslides (being the most prominent geomorphological features). Among them, the three Šumljak sedimentary bodies of fossil landslides (approximately 0. 56 km² in area) comprise carbonate gravels and breccia. The most distinctive geomorphological element is the <b>planation</b> surface of the carbonate breccia blocks positioned in the hinterland of the Šumljak sedimentary bodies. Another feature is the presence of local escarpments (steep scarps) defiing the border between the <b>planation</b> surface in the hinterland and sedimentary bodies. Our research suggests that the whole area in the hinterland of the Šumljak sedimentary bodies form part of a deep-seated rotational landslide formed of carbonate breccia. On the basis of the dipping of the breccia beds, in particular parts of the rotational blocks, the rotation can reach up to 60 °. <b>Planation</b> surfaces developed above the curved, sliding plane in the central part and/or slightly outer part of the landslide. Steep scarps on the external parts of the <b>planation</b> surface represent the main scarps of the Šumljak sedimentary bodies. We propose that these bodies originated from the remobilization of material accumulated in outer parts of large-scale rotational slides and its transportation further downslope, mostly by rock avalanches...|$|E
40|$|Staircases of gravelly river terrace {{deposits}} in southern England occupy valleys typically underlain by frostsusceptible and brecciated bedrocks. The valleys {{developed during the}} Quaternary by alternating episodes of (1) brecciation, incision and <b>planation</b> through the bedrock, forming wide low-relief erosion surfaces; and (2) aggradation in braidplains of gravel a few meters thick that bury the erosion surfaces. A conceptual model to account {{for some of the}} terraces proposes that brecciation resulted from ice segregation in the ice-rich layer in the upper meters of Pleistocene permafrost, making them vulnerable to fluvial thermal erosion and therefore predisposing the bedrock to <b>planation.</b> The low gradients of the valleys were adjusted such that rivers transferred fine materials out of the basins but lacked the competence to remove gravel, which therefore accumulated within floodplains. The model challenges the prevailing view of incision during climate transitions. It attributes incision and <b>planation</b> to very cold and arid permafrost conditions, when rivers had limited discharges and hillslopes supplied limited volumes of stony debris into valley bottoms...|$|E
