50|$|In 2004, {{a remake}} of Stop The Express by Jetmans Dad took {{second place in the}} Retro Remakes competition.

Then this visitor {{had nothing to do}} but to walk in. The idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to <b>pick</b> this <b>knife</b> off the writing-table.

5000|$|... "When a man <b>picks</b> up a <b>knife,</b> there's an old memory {{from the}} {{collective}} unconscious that surfaces. A knife is an atavistic experience.

6000|$|He {{dropped the}} knife with a convulsive shudder, {{and turned his}} eyes on his {{sleeping}} sister and brother.

5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, <b>picks,</b> hammers, <b>knives</b> and awls.|$|R

Immediately after, the track's initials (BBHMM) flash on the screen before revealing a close-up of Rihanna's bloody face accompanied by tense, ambient sounds. The music video was inspired by Rihanna's real life experience with an accountant who cheated her of her money.|$|R
