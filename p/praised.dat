40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine how gender and age moderate the long-term and post-failure motivational consequences of person versus performance <b>praise.</b> In Study 1, fourth- and fifth-grade students (n = 93) engaged in a puzzle task while receiving either no <b>praise,</b> person <b>praise,</b> product <b>praise,</b> or process <b>praise.</b> Following a subsequent failure experience, behavioural measures indicated that product and process <b>praise</b> enhanced motivation and person <b>praise</b> dampened motivation for girls, but that there were few effects of <b>praise</b> on subsequent motivation for boys. In Study 2, a parallel procedure with preschool children (n = 76) showed that person, product, and process <b>praise</b> all enhanced motivation, relative to neutral feedback, for both girls and boys. Unlike the old adage, a <b>praise</b> is not a <b>praise</b> is not a <b>praise.</b> (Parsons, Kaczala, & Meece, 1982, p. 336) Conventional wisdom suggests that <b>praise</b> a powerful motivator, but the research literature is replete with contradictions about how it affects children’s motivation and achievement.

40|$|Children {{with low}} {{self-esteem}} are relatively {{unhappy with the}} kind of person they are. Adults might want to support them by <b>praising</b> their personal qualities (person <b>praise)</b> as opposed to their behavior (process <b>praise).</b> However, person <b>praise</b> implicitly conveys to children that their self-worth hinges on their performance. Thus, person <b>praise</b> may predispose children to feel ashamed following failure. In Study 1, we demonstrate that adults are inclined to give more person <b>praise</b> to children with low, compared to high, self-esteem. In Study 2, we demonstrate that person <b>praise</b> backfires among children with low self-esteem. Person <b>praise,</b> but not process <b>praise,</b> caused shame in the face of failure, especially among children with low self-esteem.

40|$|In {{an audio}} cueing system, {{a teacher is}} {{presented}} with randomly spaced auditory signals via tape recorder or intercom. The teacher is instructed to <b>praise</b> {{a child who is}} on-task each time the cue is presented. In this study, a baseline was obtained on the teacher's <b>praise</b> rate and the children's on-task behaviour in a Grade 5 class of 37 students. Children were then divided into high, medium and low on-task groups. Followinq baseline, the teacher's <b>praise</b> rate and the children's on-task behaviour were observed under the following successively implemented conditions: (l) Audio Cueing 1 : Audio cueing at a rate of 30 cues per hour was introduced into the classroom and remained in effect during subsequent conditions. A group of consistently low on-task children were delineated. (2) Audio Cueing Plus 'focus <b>praise</b> package': Instructions to direct two-thirds o£ the <b>praise</b> to children identified by the experimenter (consistently low on-task children), feedback and experimenter <b>praise</b> for meeting or surpassing the criterion distribution of <b>praise</b> ('focus <b>praise</b> package') were introduced. (3) Audio Cueing 2 : The 'focus <b>praise</b> package' was removed. (4) Audio Cueing Plus 'increase <b>praise</b> package': Instructions to increase the rate of <b>praise,</b> feedback and experimenter <b>praise</b> for improved <b>praise</b> rates ('increase <b>praise</b> package') were introduced. The primary aims of the study were to determine the distribution of <b>praise</b> among hi h, medium and low on-task children when audio cueinq was first introduced and to investigate the effect of the 'focus <b>praise</b> package' on the distribution of teacher <b>praise.</b> The teacher distributed her <b>praise</b> evenly among the hiqh, medium and low on-task groups during audio cueing 1. The effect of the 'focus <b>praise</b> package' was to increase the percentage of <b>praise</b> received by the consistently low on-task children. Other findings tended to suggest that audio cueing increased the teacher's <b>praise</b> rate. However, the teacher's <b>praise</b> rate unexpectedly decreased to a level considerably below the cued rate during audio cueing 2. The 'increase <b>praise</b> package' appeared to increase the teacher's <b>praise</b> rate above the audio cueing 2 level. The effect of an increased <b>praise</b> rate and two distributions of <b>praise</b> on on-task behaviour were considered. Significant increases in on-task behaviour were found in audio cueing 1 for the low on-task group, in the audio cueing plus 'focus <b>praise</b> package' condition for the entire class and the consistently low on-task group and in audio cueing 2 for the medium on-task group. Except for the high on-task children who did not change, the effects of the experimental manipulations on on-task behaviour were e quivocal.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect familiarity with a teacher had on student interpretations of teacher verbal <b>praise</b> in seventh and eighth grade choral ensembles. A stimulus tape was constructed of 16, 30 -second videotaped clips containing verbal <b>praise</b> of four teachers. Teachers identified their intent {{in the use of}} <b>praise</b> in each example. Students (n = 80) from the four choirs responded to the tape by labeling the <b>praise</b> in each clip as deserved or as one of three types of instructional <b>praise</b> (i. e., <b>praise</b> to encourage, {{to send a message to}} other students, or to seek student cooperation). Comparisons were made between choirs in labeling the <b>praise.</b> Comparisons were made also between each teacher's stated purpose in <b>praising</b> and the interpretations of choirs familiar and unfamiliar with the teacher. Choirs who were unfamiliar with the teacher differed from the teachers' own students in interpreting the praise: Students who knew a teacher labeled the <b>praise</b> as deserved in five clips, but unfamiliar choirs thought the <b>praise</b> served an instructional purpose. In four clips, choirs differed in their interpretations of the type of instructional <b>praise.</b> Students familiar with a teacher recognized their teacher's intent in <b>praising</b> in 12 of 16 clips. In some situations, familiarity with a teacher and context made a difference in detecting the teacher's purpose for <b>praising.</b> In five clips where teachers identified the <b>praise</b> as deserved, students unfamiliar with the teacher and context thought the <b>praise</b> was intended to encourage students. Students across choirs were particularly sensitive to a teacher's use of <b>praise</b> to send a message to other students. Students are keen observers of teacher <b>praise.</b> Findings suggest students discriminate between <b>praise</b> directed at the performance and <b>praise</b> used for instructional purposes, suggesting that observation instruments that rely on a single label for <b>praise</b> might miss important information.

50|$|The {{function}} of <b>praise</b> on child performance and motivation may likely vary as a {{function of}} age. Few studies have directly examined developmental differences in <b>praise,</b> though some evidence has been found. Henderlong Corpus & Lepper found person <b>praise</b> (as opposed to process <b>praise)</b> to negatively influence motivation for older girls (4th/5th grade), while for preschool-age children, there were no differences in the effects of process, person and product <b>praise,</b> though all three forms of <b>praise</b> were associated with increased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. In a different study, Henderlong found that for older children, process <b>praise</b> enhanced post-failure motivation more so than person <b>praise,</b> and person <b>praise</b> decreased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. Contrastingly, for preschool-age children process <b>praise</b> enhanced post-failure motivation more than person <b>praise,</b> but both were better than neutral feedback. Some posit that younger children do not experience the negative effects of certain types of <b>praise</b> because they do not yet make causal attributions in complex ways, and they are more literal in their interpretations of adult speech.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of <b>praise</b> on child behavior and motivation has {{also found to}} vary as a {{function of}} child gender.

For example, Koestner, Zuckerman & Koestner found that girls were more negatively influenced by <b>praise</b> that diminished perceived autonomy. Henderlong Corpus and Lepper found that process <b>praise</b> was more beneficial to motivation than person <b>praise,</b> but only for girls.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{identify}} the "effective ingredients" of evidence-based behavior therapies. We tested the effects {{of one of the most}} common ingredients in parenting interventions for preventing disruptive child behavior, referred to as labeled <b>praise</b> (e. g., "well done picking up your toys"), which is typically recommended in preference to unlabeled <b>praise</b> (e. g., "well done"). We compared the effects of labeled <b>praise,</b> unlabeled <b>praise,</b> and no <b>praise</b> on child compliance in two experiments. Experiment 1 included 161 4 to 8 year-old community sample children and tested immediate effects of <b>praise.</b> Experiment 2 included 132 3 to 9 year-old children with varying levels of disruptive behavior and tested immediate and two-week effects of <b>praise.</b> In Experiment 1, teaching parents to use labeled <b>praise</b> did not increase immediate child compliance, whereas teaching them to use unlabeled <b>praise</b> did. In Experiment 2, teaching parents to use labeled <b>praise</b> for two weeks reduced disruptive child behavior, but this effect was of a similar magnitude to that for unlabeled <b>praise.</b> Parents preferred the use of unlabeled over labeled <b>praise.</b> These findings suggest that parental <b>praise</b> promotes child compliance, but the addition of labeling the specific positive behavior may not be of incremental value...|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{views of}} the effects of <b>praise</b> on {{motivation}} exist. In one camp, <b>praise</b> is thought to decrease intrinsic motivation by increasing the presence of external control. However, <b>praise</b> has also been argued to define standards and expectations, which in turn may motivate an individual to exert effort to meet those standards. Lastly, <b>praise</b> may serve to influence interpersonal relations. For example, strong pressures to reciprocate <b>praise</b> have been found. It is thought that the mutual <b>praise</b> may serve to increase attraction and strengthen the interpersonal relationship, and this process may underlie the use of <b>praise</b> in ingratiation.|$|R
