50|$|Automated {{production}} lines {{that are used}} in the beverage industry to fill containers usually have several machines executing parts of the complete process, from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and <b>palletisation.</b> These machines operate at different speeds and capacities and have varying efficiency levels.|$|E
50|$|Palvans were {{designed}} for palletised loads and loading by forklift truck. Whereas most vans had small doors centrally positioned on the van sides, Palvans had large doors half {{the width of the}} wagon on the left hand side of each side (i.e. diagonally opposite each other). Although <b>palletisation</b> was the future, these early Palvans were found to be very sensitive to unbalanced loads and prone to derailment at higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|Filling {{and packing}} technologyAttention goes to rinse, filling and capping lines with a rotary concept. This {{is where the}} {{enterprise}} distinguishes itself from inline construction, since only rotary lines are suitable for high-speed tasks of up to 60.000 bottles/hour or approximately 100,000 cans/hour, including aseptic filling systems for beverages with a high pH value (> 4,5). For the disinfection of containers and closures, PES or H2O2 is used. Further steps in beverage production as bottle-washing machines, inspection and control systems for bottles and bundles, as well as labelling machines for cold and hot glue or self-adhesive labelling complete the product range. Packaging machines for bundles either one-way or returnable, sorting and grouping stations, as well as <b>palletisation</b> systems supplement the spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|Eye Green {{railway station}} was a station in Eye, Cambridgeshire on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line between Peterborough and Wisbech. The station was opened by the Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway (PW&SBR) on 1 August 1866 and was {{originally}} named Eye; it was renamed Eye Green on 1 October 1875. The PW&SBR was later {{part of the}} Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. It later came {{under the control of}} British Railways and was closed on 2 December 1957. The station's name as given in some timetables [...] "Eye Green for Crowland" [...] was misleading, since a passenger would have a three-mile walk to Crowland. The station was adjacent to the Northam works of the London Brick Company. There was a busy siding where bricks were hand loaded onto trucks - before the days of <b>palletisation.</b> There were through trains to Hunstanton, via King's Lynn.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1950s the T vans were {{starting}} to wear out, so a new fleet of 50 aluminium-constructed vans were added, numbered 420 through 469. These had angled roofs and a capacity of 15+1/2 LT, with room for up to 8 LT of crush ice and walls 6.0625 in thick, insulated with [...] "Onazate". They were initially noticeable in consists because they not painted above the underframes (which were in VR wagon red), although by the mid-1960s they were painted all over in wagon red. Van 422 was of a different design to the other 49 wagons in this batch, with thinner walls and internal bracing to compensate; {{this could have been}} a trial or caused by material shortages. At some point, van 421 had its doors made wider for <b>palletisation,</b> although it is not know whether this was from new or a later modification.|$|E

In automated manufacturing palletising operations, the Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) usually {{deals with}} generating optimal pallet patterns of placing boxes on a rectangular pallet.

40|$|Introduced work {{is focused}} on waste {{aluminum}} recycling process with objective to propose complex production system for recovering of aluminum and some aluminum alloys. Solution is supported by extended analysis concerning purpose, basis and system sequences for recyclation. Based on that, sources, possibilities and conditions for recycling are formed. This {{has been used in}} proposal of manufacturing system. The principle is the structural proposal of manufacturing system, which does not only differentiate the stage of aluminum melting process, but also related stages as gross separation, sizing, containerisation and batching, <b>palletisation,</b> stacking and some related operations. Production system respects technological specifications, requirements for rationalisation of manufacturing systems, technical and economical feasibility conditions and is considered in lower automation level.

40|$|A Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) {{occurs when}} {{identical}} rectangular boxes {{are to be}} stacked and packed on a rectangular pallet. The problem has many practical applications in distribution and logistics in packaging industries. An {{increase in the number}} of boxes that can be shipped on a pallet directly reduces the cost. In automated manufacturing palletising operations, the Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) usually deals with generating optimal pallet patterns of boxes on a pallet but a purely mathematical solution does not consider the physical aspects and restrictions encountered when using the robot and the gripper to implement these patterns. Therefore, merely getting an optimal pallet pattern does not guarantee an optimal pattern placement strategy.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of the technological changes {{that have taken place}} recently in international shipping, with particular reference to linear services in Australia's export trade. The new technologies are studied for all ship types - bulk carrier and tramp, tanker, and general cargo liner - but attention is concentrated on the development of unitised liner technology (containerisation and <b>palletisation)</b> and its economic effects in Australia's export trade. Unitisation has affected the liner shipping industry through the Conference system, competition between operators, internal cost levels and structure, and relations between land and sea-carriers. As far as Australian shippers are concerned, unitisation is bringing about changes through new freight pricing procedures, methods of rate bargaining, and trade creation or diversion. The Commonwealth Government has an active policy towards liner shipping, and the introduction of unitisation has affected the nature and efficiency of intervention in the overseas shipping market. It has a particularly marked effect on Australian general cargo ports, affecting levels of investment and causing problems of readjustment in the stevedoring industry. The analysis of these tipics draws support from study, early in the thesis, of the derived demand for shipping services in Australia's export sector and supply conditions in international shipping...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} characterisation of automotive shredder residue which resulted in application of its polymeric fraction {{as a substitute for}} coke, as reducing agent, in magnetite iron-ore composite pellets. In Australia aloan, nearly 200, 000 tonnes of automotive shredder residue is landfilled every year. This thesis aims to characterise this waste stream and come up with an idea to apply it in proper way and prevent it to go to the land. On the other hand iron making industry specifically blast furnace and its feed stock consumes a huge amount of worldÂ’s energy and resources. It was anticipated that shredder residues could be reused for its energy and composition aspect in iron making process. Samples were collected from an Australian shredder and were analysed for their composition and size distribution. Initial visual inspection confirmed the ASR as a very heterogeneous stream of waste and due to this heterogeneity application based on specific composition seemed to be out of prospect as it needs rigorous and costly separation processes. As result, the simple approach of size distribution, energy value and carbon content was considered as the bases for this study. It was realized that this waste consist of majorly high heat content materials with high carbon and hydrogen, metals and inorganics. The high energy content portion were analysed for their level of calorific value {{to come up with a}} representative range with purpose of nominating an effective re-application process. Charring process for analysis of carbon content was done based on standard ASTM E 1755 - 01. This was followed by burning the carbon content to derive the ash. Composition of ash was studied for oxide and element content using XRF. Calorific value analysis was done to determine the right fraction of ASR for the application of heat recovery and the source of carbon. These characterisations led to the understanding of the heat value and carbon content of each size fraction of ASR. This high heat and carbon content of the ASR were realised to be majorly due to the polymeric content. As result it was selected for further application. It was realised that the <b>palletisation</b> of iron oxide with this polymeric portion of ASR, as the source of carbon and energy, would be an attractive choice due to the versatility of <b>palletisation</b> process. Pellets were then made from concentrated magnetite provided by the OneSteel Whyalla. The source of carbon in the pellet was set to be 100 % metallurgical coke, 50 % ASR, 70 % ASR and 100 % ASR. The concentrated magnetite is the major source of iron-ore used in the OneSteelÂ’s pellet plants. This magnetite was mixed with metallurgical coke, and flux, which basically is the milled limestone, before formed in to pellets and heat treated. These pellets are then fed into the blast furnace for iron extraction. Flux was not used in this project to minimise the effect of other oxides on the overall process. To make the pellets, the raw were mixed together and formed in to the ball-shape pellets and dried in 1050 C for 24 hrs in the oven. The reduction process was then performed in horizontal tube furnace in 12000 C under argon gas flow for 20 min. Various qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the level of reduction in pellets. Gas products were captured and in-situ infrared gas analyser was applied to measure the concentration of generated CO, CO 2 and CH 4 gases. The reduction was then calculated based on the weight reduction of the pellets by measuring the weight of pellets before and after process. Oxygen and carbon content of pellets were measured by means of LECO oxygen and carbon analyser to be compare with weight reduction and IR analyses. Analysis of reduced pellets was also performed physically and chemically with help of optical and electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and XRD analysis. Compressive strength of pellets then was performed on two sets of pellets before and after high temperature reaction. The result for reduced pellets was compared with the standards pellets provided by OneSteel Whyalla blast furnace. This feasibility study has shown that there is possibility for the ASR to be used in the iron reduction process and specially blast furnace process application...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in-depth study about applying Supply Chain Management concepts to make event-catering firms competitive. SCM concepts have extended to various industries and this paper aims {{to extend the}} application of SCM concepts to the event-catering sector. To achieve this, relevant SCM concepts were analysed and compared with SCM initiatives in the event-catering sector. Firstly, SCM initiatives in the event catering sector were analysed using secondary data. Secondly, first hand data was collected via interviews with two event-catering firms; Fresh and Tasty. This provided a more in-depth understanding on the study. After the analyses of the findings, {{it was evident that}} there were few similarities and more differences in how both companies managed various functions of their supply chain. The analysis also revealed greater application of various SCM concepts by Fresh, in comparison to Tasty. Thirdly, upon thorough discussion of the findings, a gap was evident between how SCM concepts are applicable in theory and how they are practically applicable amongst both firms Fresh applies SCM concepts such as, modular product design and late differentiation. It produces inventories of modular food bases, to which it adds additional ingredients in order to construct a variety of meals according to actual customer demand. Moreover, Fresh postpones the final assembly of meals as it applies garnishing touches at the event site based on customer requirements. By applying modular product design and form postponement strategy, it was able to provide a wide variety of products and a high level of customization. Furthermore, Fresh utilized a third party logistics provider who offers specialised service such as, customised refrigerated <b>palletisation</b> at a competitive price. The 3 PL provider has enhanced Freshâ€™s responsiveness to customers as it delivers twice the amount of products in a single delivery and provides Fresh the opportunity to access to new markets and customers via its distribution networks. Fresh has established long-term relationships by applying certain collaboration principles. It mutually shares information with suppliers by communicating customer requirements beforehand, jointly planning new product launches. Fresh adopts a win-win approach with suppliers as it jointly solves any issues regarding late or incorrect deliveries. On the contrary, Tasty does not apply the various SCM concepts discussed. It does however display the existence of trust because its suppliers having access to its warehouse during non-office hours, so they can make deliveries early in the morning. Tastyâ€™s current supply chain strategy only cater to a limited number of customers. Lastly, Tasty needs to adopt a responsive supply chain strategy by implementing SCM concepts aspects such as, modular design and postponement if it wishes to expand its customer base and offer a larger variety of products...|$|E
