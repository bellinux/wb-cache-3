25|$|In the poem, Tithonus asks Eos for {{the gift}} of immortality, which she readily grants him, but forgets to ask for eternal youth along with it. As time wears on, age catches up with him. Wasted and withered, Tithonus is reduced to a mere shadow of himself. But since he is immortal, he cannot die and is destined to live forever, growing older and older with each <b>passing</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
25|$|Napoleon entered Moscow a week later. In another turn {{of events}} the French found puzzling, there was no {{delegation}} to meet the Emperor. The Russians had evacuated the city, and the city's governor, Count Fyodor Rostopchin, ordered several strategic points in Moscow set ablaze. Napoleon's hopes had been set upon a victorious end to his campaign, but victory in the field did not yield him victory in the war. The loss of Moscow did not compel Alexander I to sue for peace, and both sides were aware that Napoleon's position grew worse with each <b>passing</b> <b>day.</b> Napoleon stayed on in Moscow looking to negotiate a peace, his hopes fed {{in part by a}} disinformation campaign informing the Emperor of supposed discontent and fading morale in the Russian camp. After staying a month Napoleon moved his army out southwest toward Kaluga, where Kutuzov was encamped with the Russian army.|$|E
25|$|If the muster-roll of Laudonnière is accurate, the {{garrison}} which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist {{an attack of}} the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort was about two hundred and forty. Three days passed without any news of Ribault, and with each <b>passing</b> <b>day</b> Laudonnière became more anxious. Knowing {{the proximity of the}} Spaniards, and dreading a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonnière himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each <b>passing</b> <b>day,</b> but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each <b>passing</b> <b>day.</b> We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E
25|$|By 0700 on 17 December 1944, Peiper's Kampfgruppe {{had seized}} the American fuel dump at Büllingen. At 1330 that same day, at a {{crossroads}} near Malmedy, men from Peiper's LSSAH formation shot and killed at least 68 United States POWs, in {{what became known as}} the Malmedy massacre. By the evening of 17 December, the leading element of the LSSAH was engaged with the 99th US Division at Stavelot. Mohnke's division was behind schedule by at least 36 hours by the end of the second day. The retreating U.S. troops blew up important bridges and fuel dumps that Mohnke and Peiper had counted on taking intact, further slowing the German advance. With each <b>passing</b> <b>day,</b> enemy resistance stiffened and by 24 December the advance was halted. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched a series of attacks on Allied airfields but the operation was very costly for the Germans. They suffered losses which could not be replaced. By this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attacks launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. A short time later the LSSAH and I SS Panzer Corps were transferred to Hungary to try and bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was injured in an air raid where he suffered, among other things, ear damage. He was removed from front-line service and put on the Führer reserve.|$|E
50|$|Leave {{and passes}} are terms to {{describe}} days off work. A typical weekend day off {{is also known}} as a regular pass. Up to four consecutive days off can be either leave <b>days</b> or <b>pass</b> <b>days.</b> Leave days are deducted from the servicemember's 30 annual <b>days</b> off. <b>Pass</b> <b>days</b> are not deducted. Five or more days off must be deducted as leave. Leave and <b>pass</b> <b>days</b> can now be taken consecutively, as long as the Service Member is in the local area to sign back in from or on leave; for example, a SM may put in for a 4-day pass over the 4th of July weekend, and leave starting the day after the 4-day weekend, as long as the soldier personally signs in or out on leave.|$|R

Well might the youthful Samuel shrink when he brought his parcel into my room! Well might he run when he had performed his miserable errand!

6000|$|Two tables {{covered with}} books {{were the first}} objects that {{attracted}} me. On approaching them, I {{was surprised to find}} that the all-influencing periodical literature of the present day--whose sphere is already almost without limit; whose readers, even in our time, may be numbered by millions--was entirely unrepresented on Miss Welwyn's table. Nothing modern, nothing contemporary, in the world of books, presented itself. Of all the volumes beneath my hand, not one bore the badge of the circulating library, or wore the flaring modern livery of gilt cloth. Every work that I took up had been written at least fifteen or twenty years since. The prints hanging round the walls (toward which I next looked) were all engraved from devotional subjects by the old masters; the music-stand contained no music of later date than the compositions of Haydn and Mozart. Whatever I examined besides, told me, with the same consistency, the same strange tale. The owner of these possessions lived in the by-gone time; lived among old recollections and old associations--a voluntary recluse from all that was connected with the <b>passing</b> <b>day.</b> In Miss Welwyn's house, the stir, the tumult, the [...] "idle business" [...] of the world evidently appealed in vain to sympathies which grew no longer with the growing hour.|$|E

The Spiritualism of England, for those godless years, is, as it were, all forgettable. Much has been written: but the perennial Scriptures of Mankind have had small accession: from all English Books, in rhyme or prose, in leather binding or in paper wrappage, how many verses {{have been added to}} these? Our most melodious Singers have sung as from the throat outwards: from the inner Heart of Man, from the great Heart of Nature, through no Pope or Philips, has there come any tone. The Oracles have been dumb. In brief, the Spoken Word of England has not been true. The Spoken Word of England turns out to have been trivial; of short endurance; not valuable, not available as a Word, except for the <b>passing</b> <b>day.</b> It has been accordant with transitory Semblance; discordant with eternal Fact. It has been unfortunately not a Word, but a Cant; a helpless involuntary Cant, nay too often a cunning voluntary one: either way, a very mournful Cant; the Voice not of Nature and Fact, but of something other than these.|$|E
