25|$|Under {{the present}} Olympic AA scoring system — New Life — Davydova {{would have won}} the 1980 AA title by a larger margin and would have won gold on beam. In {{addition}} to the AA gold, Davydova {{won a gold medal}} with the team and a silver medal on balance beam. While recognised as the best vaulter in event finals Davydova failed to stand her second vault and thus failed to medal. This vault is described below in the paragraph on the 1981 World Championships. In 1980 the gymnasts performed 2 different vaults and the scores were averaged instead of taking the best of the 2 scores as in Montreal Olympics ef. Davydova would have won gold with her 1st vault – scoring 9.95 – if the Montreal rules had still applied.

40|$|A {{fine control}} of the <b>pirouetting</b> motion of rotaxanes was {{achieved}} by using a series of metallabisdicarbollides. The latter were used as anions in the protonated form of benzylic amide macrocycle-containing fumaramide rotaxanes. The present paper discusses the synthesis and the structural and dynamic characterizations of the first examples of anionic boron cluster-containing rotaxanes. To study the dynamic properties of such molecules, the <b>pirouetting</b> rate of the weakly coordinating boron cluster-containing rotaxanes with the more strongly coordinating trifluoroacetate anion (TFAâ), which would form a close ion pair with the macrocycle, was measured using the exchange spectroscopy NMR technique. Our hypothesis was that the stronger the ion pair the lower the rate of rotation due {{to the presence of}} a bigger volume of solvent to be moved. The anion would act as an anchor for the <b>pirouetting</b> motion. Indeed, the results show the expected trend: the rotaxane with the closely coordinating TFAâ anion <b>pirouettes</b> most slowly, and the most weakly coordinating hexabromoderivative of cobaltabisdicarbollide <b>pirouettes</b> the fastest.

He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said.

500|$|Dipayan Pal of Mumbai Boss was {{disappointed}} {{in the book and}} theorized a number of reasons for it. He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas, whose ending failed to live up the curiosity. Pal particularly criticized Tripathi's language, saying [...] "It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas, much of Amish’s attention was upon language. There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read. The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics. Sentences have been sliced to create weak, dangling fragments ('Parashuram charged. Followed by his vicious horde'). Instead of simply talking, people bellow, scream, whisper and fall silent. They are flabbergasted, they <b>pirouette</b> {{in the middle of a}} fight, and use words like 'exponentially', 'gargantuan' and 'plethora' in their speech. The net result is text that is labored, trite and awkward." [...] Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas, the characterization of Shiva lost some of the fervor in it from the first book, and is cast more as a Bollywood hero, comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan. Desai also noticed that there were too many characters in the book, most of them remaining unexplored. Likening the book with a computer game, the reviewer concluded that [...] "one of the remarkable qualities of [...] is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise." [...] Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} turns in ballet, <b>pirouettes</b> and fouettés require precise {{movement}} to match proper technique and prevent injury. Variation in knee angle of a dancer's supporting leg during <b>pirouettes</b> of 1 - 5 rotations {{was measured using}} a goniometer for 12 professional and pre-professional ballet dancers. Plié angle saw no significant difference for different numbers of rotations, but the effect of gender was significant: males pliéd at least 20. 3 degrees deeper than females. Average knee angle while turning was less than zero for all <b>pirouettes,</b> highlighting dancers' tendency to bend their supporting knee to correct for instability, which may contribute to knee injuries. Knee angle trajectory closely matched a minimum jerk profile, indicating that dancers encode movements in angle coordinates. Knee angle was compared between <b>pirouettes</b> and fouettés using 2 goniometers and aerial video for 3 advanced amateurs. No difference was found in preparation plié or turn angle between turn types. Axis of rotation remained within 0. 221 +/- 0. 014 meters of starting position during fouettés. Maximum angular velocity of the head was nearly {{one and a half}} times that of the body during fouettés. This kinematic definition of ballet technique creates a framework for movement control of a dancer's lower extremities to prevent injury. by Hannah Barrett. Thesis: S.
