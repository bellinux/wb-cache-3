40|$|Genu {{recurvatum}} is {{an uncommon}} condition in children. Occasionally, it may {{occur as a}} late complication of femoral shaft fracture.

We believe that the etiology of tibial physeal closure and genu recurvatum after femoral fracture in children is unclear. It seems that identifying one cause for this serious complication in all cases is not possible.

40|$|Background: Fractures of distal radius {{are common}} injury in all age groups. Cast {{treatment}} {{with or without}} close reduction is a viable option. However, the results are often unsatisfactory with restricted function. The open reduction and internal fixation often results in extensive soft tissue dissection and associated high rates of infection and delayed/nonunion. The distractor/external fixator have reported good functional and anatomical results but the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>traction</b> infection nerve injury and cosmedic deformity are high. We introduced a modified operative technique for minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) for distal radial fracture and evaluated the functional outcomes and complications. Materials and Methods: 22 distal radial fractures (10 left, 12 right) were treated using the MIPO technique and two small incisions with a palmar locking plate from August 2009 to August 2010. The wrist function was assessed according to Dienst wrist rating system, and postoperative complications were recorded. Results: According to Dienst wrist rating system, 13 patients showed excellent results, 6 cases showed good results and 3 patients had moderate results. No patient had poor results. Thus, the excellent and good rate was 86. 4 %. One patient had anesthesia in the thenar eminence and this symptom disappeared after 3 months. One patient had delayed healing in the proximal wrist crease. Two patients had mild pain on the ulnar side of the wrist and two patients had limited wrist joint function.

40|$|Abstract Background Femoral {{skeletal}} traction {{assists in}} the reduction and transient stabilization of pelvic, acetabular, hip, and femoral fractures when splinting is ineffective. Traditional teaching has recommended a medial entry site for insertion of the <b>traction</b> <b>pin</b> {{in order to}} minimize injury to the femoral artery as it passes through Hunter's canal. The present anatomical study evaluates the risk to the femoral artery and other medial neurovascular structures using a lateral entry approach. Methods Six embalmed cadavers (twelve femurs) were obtained for dissection. Steinman pins were drilled from lateral to medial {{at the level of the}} superior pole of the patella, at 2 cm, and at 4 cm proximal to this point. Medial superficial dissection was then performed to identify the saphenous nerve, the superior medial geniculate artery, the adductor hiatus, the tendinous insertion of the adductor magnus and the femoral artery. Measurements localizing these anatomic structures relative to the pins were obtained. Results The femoral artery was relatively safe and was no closer than 29. 6 mm (mean) from any of the three Steinman pins. The superior medial geniculate artery was the medial structure at most risk. Conclusions Lateral femoral <b>traction</b> <b>pin</b> entry is a safe procedure with minimal risk to the saphenous nerve and femoral artery. Of the structures examined, only the superior medial geniculate artery is at a risk of iatrogenic injury due to its position. The incidence of such injury in clinical practice and its clinical significance is not known. Lateral insertion facilitates <b>traction</b> <b>pin</b> placement since it minimizes the need to move the contralateral extremity out of the way of the drilling equipment or the need to elevate or externally rotate the injured extremity relative to the contralateral extremity. </p...|$|R

40|$|For {{people with}} hip fractures, {{traction}} involves either using tapes (skin <b>traction)</b> or <b>pins</b> (skeletal <b>traction)</b> {{attached to the}} injured leg and connected to weights via a pulley.

40|$|Abstract A {{fracture}} of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint {{at the base}} of the middle phalanx is rare, but is a challenge to treat. Posttraumatic osteoarthritis is a known complication causing impaired hand function and disability. The aim of the present retrospective study was to evaluate characteristics and outcome of complex PIP joint fractures treated by the <b>pins</b> and rubbers <b>traction</b> system (PRTS). Medical records of 42 patients with fractures treated with a PRTS in 1999 - 2010 were reviewed, and followed-up by questionnaires (QuickDASH, CISS, self-composed questionnaire). Eighteen of the 42 were clinically examined. The fractures were divided into three types of fractures: volar lip, dorsal lip, and pilon fractures. The volar lip fracture was most frequent (26 / 42; dorsal lip 3 / 42; pilon 13 / 42). Most fractures were sport-related (19 / 42; 45 %) and males predominated (M:F ratio = 1. 8). All fractures united. Infection occurred in 17 / 41 (41 %) cases. Radiological signs of posttraumatic osteoarthritis were found in 25 / 41 (61 %) patients. In 18 / 42 patients, where a clinical evaluation was performed, 66 % of contralateral total active range of motion (TAM), 93 % grip strength, and 100 % pinch strength were achieved. The volar lip fracture had the best outcome according to the self-reported QuickDASH and CISS score and regained 77 % of contralateral TAM. Fractures of the PIP joint in the middle phalanx can be treated with the PRTS, but reduced mobility, grip strength, infection, and osteoarthritis are seen.

30|$|Using random {{allocation}} software, patients {{were divided into}} two groups of TEN and spica cast and were treated by a single orthopedic surgeon. Hip-supported long-limb casting splints without skeletal traction was applied for all patients at admission for controlling pain and preventing deformities. For patients in the TEN group, the standard TEN technique was applied according to the method described by Flynn and colleagues [6]. Operation was done under general anesthesia on a fracture table. After a linear incision, opening the fascia, and passing the muscle fibers, a hole was opened in the bone and enlarged. Then, each titanium elastic nail was retrogradely placed through the distal part of the femur. Each nail was 40 % of the canal diameter at the narrowest site of the femoral shaft. Reduction and fixation was done under C-arm image intensifier. All patients received first-generation cephalosporin prophylaxis, which was initiated 12  h preoperatively and continued 24 – 48  h postoperatively [6]. Patients in the spica cast group were treated with skeletal traction for about 3  weeks and then with a spica cast. The <b>traction</b> <b>pin</b> was inserted in the distal part of the femur in the operating room and under general anesthesia. Control radiography was carried out after the traction and later at 1 -week intervals. The pin was removed after sufficient callus consolidation had been achieved, and a one-and-a-half hip spica was applied (with the hips at 20 – 30 °of flexion and the limb in 10 – 15 ° external rotation) in the operating room under general anesthesia. The cast was maintained for about 1  month; After cast removal, patients were referred for physical therapy for initial gait training and additional physical therapy if a satisfactory range of motion was not achieved.|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{treatment}} was planned. An anterior midline skin incision was used. Flaps were dissected {{to expose the}} patella and tibial tuberosity. Scar tissue in {{the remnants of the}} patellar tendon was exiced. One transverse tunnel in the patella and one in tibial tuberosity were drilled after removal of the cannulated screws. While the knee was held in extension, a circular wire was passed from the tunnels and tightened until obtaining an adequate distance between the patella and the tibial tuberosity, considering the Insall-Salvati ratio (normal length of the patellar tendon is approximately equal to the length of the patella) [9]. There was no difficulty to pull down the patella by tightening the cerclage wire (Fig. 2) [1, 10]. Apart from the Ecker technique, we did not use a Steinman <b>pin</b> for patellar <b>traction</b> and only one hole was drilled to the patella for semitendinosus-gracilis tendons and cerclage wire [7]. Remnants of the patellar tendon were repaired with primary sutures as far as we could. The ends of the semitendinosus and gracillis tendons were exposed at their insertion and harvested by the open-end tendon stripper from their proximal musculotendinous junction and brought into the primary incision. The semitendinosus tendon was passed through the tunnel drilled in the patella and sutured to the gracilis tendon. Then, the gracilis tendon was passed through the same tunnel drilled in the patella too and sutured to the semitendinosus tendon (Fig. 3). After the repair was completed, when the hip was flexed at 45 °, the knee could be flexed to 20 ° with gravity of the leg. At this point the repair was stable and the knee was immobilized by the plaster cast in 20 ° flexion {{at the end of the}} procedure.|$|R

The literature reports many experience about this type of trauma {{but none of these}} has a long term followup. We present a retrospective study on a group of femoral diaphyseal fractures treated nonsurgically in children up to 6 years of age, with a minimum of 10 year followup. Materials and Methods: 48 cases (36 males/ 12 females) with femoral diaphyseal fractures treated between January 1988 and December 1998 were reviewed. Patients with fractures due to obstetrical trauma and pathologic fractures were excluded. The mean age of the patients was 3. 3 ± 1. 1 years (range 5 months- 6 years). Right side was involved in 21 cases (44 %), and left side in 27 cases (56 %). In 34 cases (71 %), closed reduction was performed and hip spica was applied with the hip and knee flexed to 45 ΀. In 8 cases (17 %), skeletal traction was applied to perform fracture reduction and the <b>traction</b> <b>pin</b> was embedded in plaster while in the remaining 6 cases (12 %), the Delitala pressure apparatus was applied after casting. Results:All fractures healed in our study. There were no complications (infection or vascular nervous issues, axial deviations, consolidation delays, or pseudoarthrosis). In 13 cases (27 %), followup examinations showed mean lengthening of 1. 3 ± 0. 75 (range 0. 5 - 2. 5 cm) of the fractured lower limb. All these patients were treated with skin traction before treatment and presented with 2. 08 ± 0. 28 cm mean initial femoral shortening.
