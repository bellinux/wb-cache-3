These offshoots include fusions with noise music, ambient music, folk music, post-punk and electronic dance music, {{as well as other}} mutations and developments. The scene has spread worldwide, and is particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Post-industrial subgenres include dark ambient, power electronics, Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, <b>power</b> <b>noise,</b> and witch house.|$|E

Peak <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> can be significantly reduced by judiciously arranging the modules based on their spatial correlations in the floorplan. In this paper, <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> is, for the first time, incorporated into the cost function to determine the optimal floorplan in terms of area, wire length, and <b>power</b> supply <b>noise.</b> Compared to the conventional floorplanning which only considers area and wire length, <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> aware floorplanning can generate better floorplan {{both in terms of}} area and peak noise. The decoupling capacitance required by each module is also calculated and placed {{in the vicinity of the}} target module during the floorplanning process. Experimental results on MCNC benchmark circuits show that the peak <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> can be reduced as much as 40 % and both the total area and wire length are improved due to the reduced total decoupling capacitance budget gained from reduced <b>power</b> supply <b>noise.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Power</b> supply <b>noise,</b> {{which is}} the {{variation}} in the supply voltage across the on-die supply terminals of VLSI circuits, is a serious performance degrader in digital circuits and mixed analog-digital circuits. In digital VLSI systems, <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> causes timing errors such as delays, jitter, and false switching. In microprocessors, <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> reduces the maximum operating frequency (FMAX) of the CPU. In mixed analog-digital circuits, <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> manifests as the substrate noise and impairs {{the performance of the}} analog portion. The decrease in the available noise margin with the decrease in the feature size of transistors in CMOS systems makes the <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> a very serious issue, and demands new methods to reduce the <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> in sub-micron CMOS systems. In this thesis, we develop a new method to determine optimal time-delays between the switching of input/output (I/O) data buffers in digital VLSI systems that realizes maximum reduction of the <b>power</b> supply <b>noise.</b> We first discuss methods to characterize the distributed nature of the Power Delivery Network (PDN) in the frequency-domain. We then develop an analytical method to determine the optimal delays using the frequency-domain response of the PDN and the supply current spectrum of the buffer units. We explain the mechanism behind the cancellation of the <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> by the introduction of optimal buffer-to-buffer delays. We also develop a numerical method to determine the optimal delays and compare it with the analytical method. We illustrate the reduction in the <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> by applying the optimal time-delays determined using our methods to two examples of PDN. Our method has great potential to realize maximum reduction of <b>power</b> supply <b>noise</b> in digital VLSI circuits and substrate noise in mixed analog-digital VLSI circuits.
