25|$|The {{origins of}} the Type 31 frigate {{are found in the}} 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The review {{authorised}} a replacement programme, known as the Global Combat Ship (GCS), to replace the Royal Navy's thirteen Type 23 frigates. Earlier that year, BAE Systems was awarded a four-year, £127 million contract by the Ministry of Defence to design the new class. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. There was to be little difference between the two variants, except for the Sonar 2087. Initial expectations were that all thirteen of the Global Combat Ships would be built starting in 2016, and gradually replace the Type 23 frigates one for one out to the mid-2030s.

5000|$|Six ships {{have been}} ordered, and {{transfer}} of {{custody of the}} first happened on 10 December 2008. The MoD's initial <b>planning</b> <b>assumption</b> was to procure twelve ships (essentially a like-for-like replacement of a similar number of Type 42s), {{with the size of}} the second batch to be determined between 2005 and 2010. However this was reduced to eight ships in the 2003 defence white paper entitled Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities. It was reported in December 2006 that the last two could be cut. In July 2007, Ministry of Defence officials stated that they [...] "still planned to build eight Type 45 destroyers" [...] and that [...] "the extra two ships were still included in planning assumptions". This plan was officially abandoned on 19 June 2008 when the Minister for the Armed Forces, Bob Ainsworth, announced in Parliament that options for the seventh and eighth destroyers would not be taken up. The continual scaling back of the project, first from twelve to eight, and subsequently to six ships, has been criticised for leaving the Royal Navy with insufficient ships to meet its requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{certified}} WMD-CSTs provide unique capabilities, expertise, {{and technologies}} {{to assist the}} governors in preparing for and responding to a CBRN situation. These WMD-CSTs are available 24 hours a day, 7 {{days a week for}} rapid deployment for response operations. The WMD-CST complements and enhances local and State capabilities. In order to ensure that the WMD-CSTs are capable of a sustainable, rapid response in support of a validated request for assistance, the following response management plan outlines a standardized approach to provide WMD-CST support anywhere in the United States. The WMD-CST is manned, trained, and equipped to conduct continuous operations for a minimum of 72 hours using organic table of distribution and allowances (TDA) assets. If extended operations, past 72 hours are required, additional WMD-CSTs will be alerted to provide augmentation or relief. Codified as the Response Management Plan (RMP), this document ensures that a designated number of WMD-CSTs are always ready to respond to a national need, or to fill a request of a State without an available WMD-CST. A primary <b>planning</b> <b>assumption</b> is that each JFHQ-State is best informed to create contingency plans for WMD-CST coverage within its jurisdiction. Therefore, this plan is intended to be activated only when a specific support request is received at the NGB Joint Coordination Center (JoCC). NGB initiated operational support requests will be the exception. WMD-CSTs support over 2500 events annually conducting counter WMD activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} a {{healthcare}} facility evacuation depends on communication and decision-making {{at all levels of}} the organization, from the coordinators at incident command to the clinical staff who actually carry out the evacuation. One key decision is the order in which each patient is chosen for evacuation. While the typical <b>planning</b> <b>assumption</b> is that all patients are to be evacuated, there may not always be adequate time or resources available to move all patients. In these cases, prioritizing or ordering patients for evacuation becomes an extremely difficult decision to make. These decisions should be based on the current state of the facility, but without knowledge of the current patient roster or available resources, these decisions may not be as beneficial as possible. Healthcare facilities usually consider evacuation a last-resort measure, and there are often system redundancies in place to protect against having to completely evacuate all patients from a facility. Perhaps this is why there is not a great deal of research dedicated to improving patient transfers. In addition, the question of patient prioritization is a highly ethical one. Based on a literature review of 1) suggested patient prioritization strategies for evacuation plannin...|$|E

The SIP Currency approach addresses problems that arise when the latest emissions and transportation modeling tools and <b>planning</b> <b>assumptions</b> are used to estimate on-road vehicle emissions, but the resulting estimates are compared to outdated emissions targets. Translating emissions estimates into the currency of emissions estimates included in older air quality plans provides a way to ensure continued improvement in air quality while preventing unintended disruption of transportation planning.

30|$|The third task, {{defining}} the concentration allocation {{for the main}} experiment, is guided by an idea of robustness similar to the second task. From a formal point of view, only as many concentration points as unknown parameters in the dose-response model are needed. It would however be unwise to involve only this minimum because it would not allow model checks. Concentration allocation needs at least a vague idea about position and scale of the concentration-response curve. Concentration-finding experiments, pilot studies, literature data, and similar sources are used to obtain these <b>planning</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Given an initial assumption, we propose the following concentration allocation strategy: calculate EC 10, EC 50, EC 90 from the <b>planning</b> <b>assumptions,</b> assuming a logistic concentration-response relation and involving SL and IY, if the selected risk type requires so. The control concentration of zero and these three concentrations plus target concentrations, given by the ECxx values of the experimenter’s interest, constitute the concentration allocation pattern for the main experiment. Two-sided CIs with 95 and 99  % coverage probability will be calculated for the concentration-response curve. If more than four concentration points are chosen {{and there is an}} even number of free points, these will be allocated symmetrically around the chosen ECxx value. If two free points are available, these are located at the limits of the 95  % CI. If an even number of 4 or more free points is available, these are allocated equidistantly in the 99  % CI. For an odd number of free points, 1 point is located at ECxx and the others are allocated according to the rule for an even number. Note that the 1 of EC 10, EC 50, EC 90 can be used twice as an experimental concentration, if the user’s target coincides with one of these. The strategy prefers low concentrations if several targets are specified by the user. This pattern is a robust strategy which focuses on the main interest of finding ECxx but does not rely too strongly on the <b>planning</b> <b>assumptions.</b> If previous experience suggests that the <b>planning</b> <b>assumptions</b> are realistic, concentrations could be allocated more closely around the presumed ECxx.|$|R
40|$|The Chinese Agriculture Technology Demonstration Centre (ATDC) in Ethiopia is an aid {{project on}} {{agricultural}} technology cooperation between China and Ethiopia. The process of cooperation {{is the art}} of improvising on the ground when the original project plan doesn’t quite match reality. This study analyses the logic behind the improvising of implementation on the ground.

The Chinese experts carry this working approach – along with its assumptions and principles – to Ethiopia, without considering the lack of any parallel institution and culture there at the beginning. This results in many challenges for implementing the ATDC activities and novel reactions by the ATDC experts, which also reflect the individual’s working style in the Chinese extension system.

40|$|Vulnerability {{analysis}} and threat assessment require systematic treatments of adversary and defender characteristics. This work addresses {{the need for}} a formal grammar for the modeling and analysis of adversary and defender engagements of interest to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Analytical methods treating both linguistic and numerical information should ensure that neither aspect has disproportionate influence on assessment outcomes. The adversary-defender modeling (ADM) grammar employs classical set theory and notation. It is designed to incorporate contributions from subject matter experts in all relevant disciplines, without bias. The Attack Scenario Space U{sub S} is the set universe of all scenarios possible under physical laws. An attack scenario is a postulated event consisting of the active engagement of at least one adversary with at least one defended target. Target Information Space I{sub S} is the universe of information about targets and defenders. Adversary and defender groups are described by their respective Character super-sets, (A) {sub P} and (D) {sub F}. Each super-set contains six elements: Objectives, Knowledge, Veracity, Plans, Resources, and Skills. The Objectives are the desired end-state outcomes. Knowledge is comprised of empirical and theoretical a priori knowledge and emergent knowledge (learned during an attack), while Veracity is the correspondence of Knowledge with fact or outcome. Plans are ordered activity-task sequences (tuples) with logical contingencies. Resources are the a priori and opportunistic physical assets and intangible attributes applied to the execution of associated Plans elements. Skills for both adversary and defender include the assumed general and task competencies for the associated plan set, the realized value of competence in execution or exercise, and the opponent's <b>planning</b> <b>assumption</b> of the task competence...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} is a {{major public}} health concern, and {{the first line of}} defense is the flu shot. Antigenic drifts and the high rate of influenza transmission require annual updates to the flu shot composition. The World Health Organization recommends which flu strains to include in the annual vaccine based on surveillance and epidemiological analysis. There are two critical decisions regarding the flu shot design. One is its composition; currently, three strains constitute the flu shot, and they influence vaccine effectiveness. Another critical decision is the timing of the composition decisions, which affects the flu shot production. Both of these decisions have to be made under uncertainty many months before the flu season starts. We quantify the trade offs involved through multistage stochastic mixed-integer programs that determine the optimal flu shot composition and its timing in a stochastic and dynamic environment. Our first model takes the view of a social planner, and optimizes strain selections based on a production plan that is provided by the flu shot manufacturers. It also incorporates risk-sensitivity through mean-risk models. Our second model relaxes the exogenous production <b>planning</b> <b>assumption</b> and, hence, provides a more accurate representation of the hierarchical decision mechanism between a social planner, who selects the flu shot strains, and the manufacturers, who make the flu shot available. We derive structural properties of both models, and calibrate them using publicly available data. The flu shot strains are updated based on clinical, virological and immunological surveillance. In the virological surveillance, hemagglutinin inhibition assays are used to identify antigenic properties of the influenza viruses. However, this serology assay is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, pairwise amino acid sequence comparison of influenza strains is used in statistical learning models to identify positions that cause antigenic variety. The performance of these models is evaluated by cross validation. In Chapter 5, we formulate cross validation as a bilevel program where an upper-level program chooses the model variables to minimize the out-of-sample error, and lower-level problems in each fold optimize in-sample errors according to their training data set by selecting the regression coefficients of the chosen model variables. We provide an extensive computational study using clinical data, and identify amino acid positions that significantly contribute to antigenic variety of influenza strains...|$|E

Once a plan invariant fails the plan execution is stopped and other plans that are more appropriate in the current context are considered for execution instead. The use of plan invariants allows for an early detection of problems. <b>Plan</b> <b>assumptions</b> that are required for a plan to succeed are explicitly represented by plan invariants. ...|$|R
