50|$|The {{spreading}} {{of sound}} recording equipment among musicologists, from the 1890s the phonograph, {{and in particular}} from the 1940s the tape recorder, easy to carry and not too <b>pricy,</b> opened a time window of some decades, where Scandinavian and German musicologists brought modern technology to the Faroe Islands and recorded numerous examples of the islanders’ still vigorous folk singing tradition. With the introduction in the late 1950s of Faroese radio broadcasting, and in the late 1970s of television, traditional singing suffered a severe setback.|$|E

50|$|With the Housing Development Board (public housing) {{upgrading}} scheme dangled as a <b>pricy</b> {{stake for}} voters, PAP reversed its electoral decline {{for the first}} time in four elections and since 1963, won back an opposition ward, recapturing the two SDP seats out of the four it had lost the last round. The PAP's share of the vote rose by 4 percentage points nationally. With Chiam See Tong's defection, SDP had no representation in Parliament since 1984. Low Thia Khiang, now WP assistant secretary-general, and Jeyaretnam as a Non-Constituency MP, returned to the legislature, the latter's last presence was previously in 1986.|$|E
50|$|On 22 November 1938 AMX presentedits new track fitted only to {{the right}} side of a trials vehicle so that direct {{comparisons}} could be made with the old track type. After 1500 kilometres the normal track was completely worn out and the AMX track was now fitted to a second vehicle; after testing had resumed on 9 January 1939 only after 3700 km on 21 March the new track was worn. The commission concluded that the new type was clearly superior in durability, but that this was caused by the use of chrome steel that made it 70% more expensive, too <b>pricy</b> for the French Army.|$|E

50|$|In Indonesia, singkong or ketela (cassava) is an {{important}} food. It can be cooked by frying or boiling, or processed by fermentation to make tapai and getuk cake, while the starch is made into krupuk crackers. In time of famine or food shortage, cassava is used to replace rice. In 2011, modified cassava flour became common, and some instant noodle producers have used it silently, especially for low-end instant noodles as a partial substitute of <b>pricy</b> flour. The flour is often added to pastry flour although {{the result is a}} pastry that is a little stiff. Getuk cakes can be difficult to digest for diners not used to it and can result in severe cramps and discomfort.|$|E
50|$|Log booms {{were used}} in the United States and British North America {{throughout}} the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the largely bloodless Aroostook War that centred on the disputed border between Maine and New Brunswick, hastily built booms proved <b>pricy</b> for local governments. The 1,300-foot-long Aroostook Boom, made of confiscated timber and containing seven piers, cost the state of Maine more than $15,000 to construct. Licensed loggers commonly sent their wood in easily manageable raft units, but illegal lumbermen cunningly sent loose timber, complicating the sorting process and angering officials. Booms often caused friction between the disputing governments; when political tensions intensified, loggers and soldiers targeted enemy booms with arms and explosives.|$|E
5000|$|Alicia Sanz (Laura Pamplona) - Belen's roommate. A would-be actress, Alicia is vain, selfish, {{completely}} without tact and {{not above}} rubbing her success {{with men in}} her less successful roommate Belen's face. She goes through men like shoes, never {{falling in love with}} one. She toys with Carlos for a while, getting <b>pricy</b> gifts from him but never giving him anything in return. Occasionally (very occasionally) a bit of friendly generosity comes through. After Emilio moves up with Belén, they quarrel and Alicia moves in with a now single Lucía. After a while, she and Belén patch things through and she returns to 3-B. Eventually, Alicia finally {{falls in love with a}} man, Ricardo, and moves to New York City with him.|$|E

Bærum, particularly its eastern neighbourhoods bordering West End Oslo, is one of Norways <b>priciest</b> and most fashionable residential areas, leading Bærum residents to be frequently stereotyped as snobs in Norwegian popular culture. The municipality has been voted the best Norwegian place to live in considering governance and public services to citizens.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Lo Schiavo's warning, the improprieties continued. A very {{exclusive}} booster {{organization called}} the Dons Century Club committed {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to illegal recruitment of players, paying off family members, and covering travel expenses, while other alumni were also giving or [...] "lending" [...] players large sums of money, paying them for no-show jobs, providing lavish gifts, as well as picking up <b>pricy</b> restaurant and entertainment tabs. Basketball players continued to receive special academic treatment; many were marginal students at best, and at least one incident occurred in which a player threatened another student, and the incident was swept under the rug by school officials. It was also commonplace for [...] "tutors" [...] to take tests and write papers for players. The situation finally came to a head in December 1981, when All-American guard Quintin Dailey was found guilty of assaulting a female student. During the subsequent investigation, Dailey admitted taking a no-show job for $1,000 a month at a business owned by a prominent USF booster, while another booster had also paid Dailey $5,000 since 1980.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stage was}} built {{the day before}} the concert {{in the middle of the}} night. This {{conflict}} happened because a football game was scheduled on the night of August 19. Stax, being polite, did not make the Coliseum-managers cancel the game. Immediately after the football game, trucks full of long wood-planks drove onto the field. The stage was built right in the center of the field and was built high enough where artists could walk/sit under (a little less than 20 feet tall…). A platform was built that lead from the road (where artists would walk from) to the side stairs of the stage. The seats were hand-cleaned and trash was picked up all around the Coliseum... making the stadium look perfect for the next-day's concertgoers. Also, due to the Coliseum's policy, there could be no seating on the field so the grass wouldn't get ruined for football games. Because of this, Stax wondered: [...] "Could each and every seat be occupied?" [...] Since all of this construction was being done late at night, the rest of it was finished the next day. The concert didn't start until 3:00 in the afternoon, so there was all morning to set-up. A big thing to take care of was cleaning the additional bleachers that seated at least 1,000. The bleachers were set-up so that there would be more seating that included a better view of the stage. Next thing to take care of was building a fence around the stage for the artists' safety reasons. Along with that, a large group of L.A.'s African-American policemen were requested to be scattered all around (inside and outside) the Coliseum. Next to do: was taking care of the transportation situation. The dressing rooms for Stax's artists were outside/behind the stadium... kind of far from the stage. Two vans were rented to drive the artists up to the stage and then back to the dressing rooms. Another <b>pricy</b> necessity was the bathroom situation. Portable restrooms were rented (for the artists to use before and after their sets) and placed right under the side of the stage. Lighting was needed since a few of the acts took place at night. Colored lights were hammered onto poles on each corner of the stage. Next to take care of was the speakers. Stax wanted to make sure the whole stadium could hear the music (especially for the people who were sitting far away from the stage.) In each corner of the fenced part of the field were stacked speakers. Right below the stage was a long table which had several open-reel tape recorders. Stax wanted to put the highlights from the concert on records and sell copies. The biggest deal to take care of was filming the whole concert. A film crew was scattered from the top-row of the stadium to the corners of the stage where the artists were zoomed-in-on. The film crew was told to capture the artists singing, but also get shots of the crowd dancing. And lastly, throughout the whole show, the most commotion was communicating over walkie-talkies. As told, the production of the Wattstax Concert was very stressful.|$|E
