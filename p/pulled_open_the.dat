500|$|Teller made {{valuable}} {{contributions to}} bomb research, {{especially in the}} elucidation of the implosion mechanism. He {{was the first to}} propose the solid pit design that was eventually successful. [...] This design became known as a [...] "Christy pit", after the physicist Robert F. Christy who made the pit a reality. Teller {{was one of the few}} scientists to actually watch (with eye protection) the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, rather than follow orders to lie on the ground with backs turned. He later said that the atomic flash [...] "was as if I had <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> curtain in a dark room and broad daylight streamed in." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> drawer; as I did so, both Miss Trelawny and I {{started back}} in amazement.|$|E

5000|$|Sounds {{described}} the album's style as [...] "If All Fall Down chipped {{away at the}} gothic walls of From the Lions Mouth, Shock of Daylight nails down the carpet, but nervously <b>pulls</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> curtains".|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Toynbee maneuver": {{pinching}} {{the nose}} and swallowing. Swallowing <b>pulls</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> eustachian tubes while {{the movement of the}} tongue, with the nose closed, compresses air which passes through the tubes to the middle ear.|$|R
60|$|A {{cycle of}} time went by--an eternity, or else a few seconds. Sir Thomas Ryder <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> long drawer of his monumental desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought not}} to have <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door!" [...] she cried excitedly. [...] "It is not {{becoming}} in you! Oh, will you go away; please will you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{laid the}} shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure {{rose from the}} hammock {{where it had been}} sitting, went to the doorway and <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> inner doors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's got a parrot-mouth. Some {{folks like}} 'em." [...] Here <b>the</b> dealer would <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> creature's flabby lips, and {{discover}} a beak {{like that of}} a polyp; and the cleansing process on the grass or trousers would take place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought this}} rather a rum start, but I agreed, and {{no sooner had}} I said the word than the old one she <b>pulls</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, and she and the other, without {{waiting for me to}} bear a hand, bundled him in between them.|$|R
50|$|In {{the trailer}} for the film, {{there are the}} scenes with Doppler laying out the {{evidence}} against Wyke {{as shown in the}} movie. They include him <b>pulling</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> shower curtains in one of the bathrooms and exposing the clown's jacket, dripping wet and apparently with bloodstains on it. This scene {{was not included in the}} final film.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{go over it}} again," [...] {{broke in}} Dick, who had already left his desk and gone to the strong-box. He worked at the {{combination}} for a few moments, and <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> safe door.|$|E
6000|$|Underneath {{appeared}} {{the signature of}} the Hands. Quest moved like a dream to his cabinet and <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> right-hand drawer. He turned around and faced the other two men. In his hand was Mrs. Rheinholdt's necklace! ...|$|E
6000|$|He couldn't help doing so. The moment Marya Morevna {{had gone}} he {{rushed to the}} closet, <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, and looked in--there hung Koshchei the Deathless, fettered by twelve chains. Then Koshchei entreated Prince Ivan, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|My first {{work was}} to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> drawer {{of the cabin}} table. I found it full of charts and {{nautical}} instruments, accompanied by the log-book. There was also, stuffed in one corner, the ship's articles, and opening it, I discovered my name at the very end, written in a rough hand, entirely different from my own.|$|R
50|$|This {{episode was}} also {{mentioned}} in the Season 2 episode Age of Steel. At {{the end of the}} episode, Mickey Smith recalls to Jake Simmonds how he 'saved the universe with a big yellow truck'.

25|$|Appellant Micah unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> locked desk drawer. Next, appellants Micah and Hein, in a threatening manner, shouted words demanding that McLoren {{turn over the}} key to the locked desk drawer. Appellant Micah, when threatening McLoren and demanding the key, shouted, “Give me the key fool” and “Give me the key, ese. You want shit with Gumbys, ese?” McLoren refused to relinquish the key.|$|R
6000|$|... "You silly flower, to wait so long. See {{how quickly}} I {{will make the}} ugly green bud a pretty pink rose," [...] cried Thistle, as he <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> folded bud so rudely that the little leaves fell all broken on the ground.|$|E
60|$|He had {{unlocked}} it, had <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> inner drawer, {{had taken}} out the Hair Bracelet, {{and was just}} examining it closely {{by the light of}} his taper (after having locked the bureau again)--when a faint sound on the staircase of the house caught his ear.|$|E
60|$|As {{he put out}} {{his hand}} to Christine, she pushed it aside with a scream of rage; she flashed at him, and with both hands made a feline pass at the face he bent toward her. He sprang back, and after an instant of stupefaction he <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door behind him and ran out into the street.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{functions}} of the ECM include operation of the fuel pump by closing the Ground for the fuel pump relay, and control of idle speed by a throttle plate bypass valve.

50|$|Baker {{and his men}} assault the bandit's town in Mexico, {{with the}} help of the Apache allies they have {{previously}} paid with whiskey. They are informed that the notorious bandit, named Emilio Estevez, is now a monk, who greets Baker in a garden. Baker suspects a ruse and <b>pulls</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> monk's robe, revealing a pistol. A gun battle erupts in which Estevez is shot dead. The Apaches, who arrive drunk, and sustain casualties, quickly flee.|$|R

The inner liner is made of #2 or #4 BPA-free plastic and uses up to 70% less plastic than comparable plastic jugs. The Ecologic bottle can be customized to a brand's specifications. Bottles are disposed by <b>pulling</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> shell to separate the two components.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's what I intend," [...] said Sir Terence in a {{voice that}} made a threat of the statement. He strode stiffly across the room and <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door. There was no need to go farther. Lady O'Moy, white and tearful, was {{discovered}} on the threshold. Sir Terence stood aside, holding the door for her, his face very grim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{know but}} I had," [...] said Pinney. He {{gathered}} up {{his work and}} followed her out into the cosy little kitchen, where she cooked their simple meals, and they ate them. [...] "Been living on tea since I been gone?" [...] He <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> refrigerator built into the wall, and glanced into it. [...] "Last night's dinner all there yet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{turned the}} key, and {{pulled down the}} door that makes a desk. They seemed to know all about it, for, without looking at the papers in the pigeonholes, they <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> lower drawer, and took two foreign-looking letters out from it. I will do them the justice {{to say that they}} both looked sorry, as they opened them, and looked at the writing.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fig. 20. The {{operculum}} or {{gill cover}} of a pike has been <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> to expose <b>the</b> gill arches bearing filaments.|$|R
5000|$|For his part, Garfunkel had a {{different}} memory of the song's success: [...] We were in L.A. Our manager called us at the hotel we were staying at. We were both {{in the same room}}. We must have bunked in the same room in those days. I picked up the phone. He said, 'Well, congratulations. Next week you will go from five to one in Billboard.' It was fun. I remember <b>pulling</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> curtains and letting the brilliant sun come into this very red room, and then ordering room service. That was good." ...|$|R
60|$|The little maid, {{bearing the}} dishes, backs to <b>the</b> door, <b>opens</b> {{it with her}} foot, and escapes from this terrible visitor. The drawn {{curtains}} attract Amy's eagle eye, and she looks behind them. There is no one there. She <b>pulls</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door of the cupboard and says firmly, 'Come out.' No one comes. She peeps into the cupboard and finds it empty. A cupboard {{and no one in}} it. How strange. She sits down almost in tears, wishing very much for the counsel of Ginevra. Thus Steve finds her when he returns.|$|R
6000|$|We <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> {{latticed}} window doors, {{and looked}} down on the street: the only street. And it was a river of noisy life. A band was playing, rather terribly, round the corner at the end, {{and up and down}} the street jigged endless numbers of maskers in their Carnival costume, with girls and young women strolling arm-in-arm to participate. And how frisky they all were, how bubbly and unself-conscious! ...|$|E
60|$|After {{twilight}} had gone, in {{the first}} darkness of the night, a freight train rumbled into the station. When the engine was switching cars on to the side-track, Johnny crept {{along the side of}} the train. He <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> side-door of an empty box-car and awkwardly and laboriously climbed in. He closed the door. The engine whistled. Johnny was lying down, and in the darkness he smiled.|$|E
6000|$|A stir of {{garments}} made itself {{heard from}} the parlor at last, and we knew the ladies had risen. In a loud voice Hasketh began {{to say that they}} had a carriage down at the gate, and I said they had better let me show them the way down; and as my wife followed the others into the hall, I <b>pulled</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> outer door for them. On the threshold stood a man about to ring, who let his hand drop from the bell-pull. [...] "Why, Tedham!" [...] I shouted, joyfully.|$|E
60|$|At once Captain Jerry {{dropped his}} stick {{and pulled out}} his jack-knife, a big affair, such as many old sailors carry. One <b>pull</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> main blade, and then old Jerry started in to do as Dick had suggested. It was no easy job and {{the body of the}} snake squirmed and whipped in every direction, lashing each on the neck and the cheek. But the head came off at last and then they left the body where it fell, and leaped {{out of the way of}} further danger.|$|R
60|$|The string which bound {{the mouth}} of the sack was now cut. The officer laid the bag on its side, seized it by the bottom, and jerked forth the contents. A large package was disclosed, {{carefully}} wrapped up in impervious tarpaulin, also well tied. He was on <b>the</b> point of <b>pulling</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> folds at one end, when a light coloured thread of something, hanging on the outside, arrested his eye. He put his hand upon it; it felt stringy, and adhered to his fingers. 'Hold the light close,' he said.|$|R
50|$|Travelers are {{operated}} by pulling {{down on the}} rope segments that ascend from the tension pulley. One rope segment is <b>pulled</b> to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> curtains {{and the other is}} pulled to close the curtains.|$|R
