40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{association}} between family poverty, the level of deprivation in electoral wards and children’s cognitive test scores {{using data from the}} second generation in the 1991 sweep of the British National Child Development Study (1958 birth cohort). Family poverty has a significant association with lower test scores in children of all ages (4 - 18 years). Neighbourhood poverty has a significant association with lower test scores in children aged 4 - 5 years which, though somewhat attenuated, is independent of other socioeconomic indicators. Among children aged between 6 and 9 years, the association with neighbourhood deprivation is statistically accounted for by individual characteristics. Among children aged between 10 and 18 years, levels of neighbourhood deprivation were for the most part statistically insignificant. The family <b>poverty</b> – <b>test</b> score association among children aged between 10 and 18 years was mediated by the home environment.

40|$|Background: Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} in the United States, {{accounting}} for 22 % of all deaths among women. Despite the importance of the Pap test in preventing and detecting cervical cancer, screening rates among poor women remain low. The pathways linking poverty with lower Pap test use remain unclear. The screening disparity for this low-cost test suggests that poor women may face other transaction costs, opportunity costs and barriers in accessing Pap tests that are not faced by women living above poverty. Data/Methods: The data set merged the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, 2000 Census, and safety net clinic data. I examine elements of the patient-provider interaction (racial/ethnic discrimination) and healthcare system (distance to the nearest safety net clinic) as possible mediators between individual-level <b>poverty</b> and Pap <b>tests.</b> I then examine the role of individual-level poverty in moderating the association between discrimination and Pap test use and safety net distance and Pap test use. I also examine whether the neighborhood-level poverty moderates the association between individual-level <b>poverty</b> and Pap <b>tests,</b> discrimination and Pap tests, and distance and Pap tests. The sample included women, 18 - 64, with a physician visit in the previous 5 years and no history of cervical cancer. Mediation was tested using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and a weighted product-of-coefficients test. Moderation was tested using GEE and including interaction terms. Results: Poor women were significantly less likely to report a timely Pap test, had significantly higher odds of reporting discrimination, and were more likely to reside closer to a safety net clinic. Discrimination did not predict Pap tests and was not a mediator between individual-level <b>poverty</b> and Pap <b>tests.</b> Safety net distance predicted Pap tests and was a mediator between individual-level <b>poverty</b> and Pap <b>tests.</b> Neither individual-level <b>poverty</b> nor neighborhood-level poverty modified the proposed relationships with Pap test use. Conclusion: Racial/ethnic discrimination did not explain disparities in Pap tests. Proximity to a safety net clinic was shown to be protective against disparities and {{may play a role in}} addressing disparities in screening.

Findings indicate that there is little differentiation in productive asset endowments over time and that rural households gravitate towards a single equilibrium, which is at a surprisingly low level.

The single low-level equilibrium points to an overall development trap in the rural farm-based economy. This is attributed to the long-term impact of the civil war, which has consolidated unfavorable economic conditions in rural areas and limited new economic opportunities outside of the agricultural sector.

With each 10 % increase in the percent of the population that was African American, associated HbA 1 c testing rates were 0. 24 % lower (95 % CI - 0. 32 [...] 0. 17); for identical increases in the percent with less than a high school education or the percent living in <b>poverty,</b> <b>testing</b> rates were 0. 70 % lower (- 0. 95 [...] 0. 46) and 1. 6 % lower (- 1. 8 [...] 1. 4), respectively.

The paper computes income-based poverty measures and investigates their sensitivity to the use of different poverty lines. We found that adoption of improved groundnut technologies has a significant positive impact on crop income and poverty reduction.

One emphasizes diminishing marginal utility of income: poor people derive more utility than the wealthy from a good of a given nominal value; hence they are more responsive to targeted benefits and their votes less expensive to buy. The second posits that voters view targeted rewards as less risky than public goods or redistribution via public policy. Poor people, this approach assumes, are risk-averse; hence their targeting of the poor by clientelist parties. Our evidence, from original surveys conducted in Argentina, lends greater support to the diminishing marginal utility of income than to the risk aversion explanation. ...|$|R

The models used are: the original Forrester [1] model, which treats a single city as a unit in an unchanging national environment; an extension of this model to include all the central cities of the nation and describe the migration between these areas; and finally a complete revision of the Forrester model to obtain a simulation of the national economy including both cities and suburbs.

40|$|Objectives. Long-term {{colon cancer}} {{survival}} {{is not well}} explained by main effects. We explored the interaction of age, gender, marital status, health insurance and poverty on 10 -year colon cancer survival. Methods. California registry data were analyzed for 5, 776 people diagnosed from 1995 to 2000; followed until 2014. Census data classified neighborhood <b>poverty.</b> We <b>tested</b> interactions with regressions and described them with standardized rates and rate ratios (RR). Results. The 5 -way interaction was significant, suggesting larger 4 -way disadvantages among non-Medicare-eligible people. A significant 4 -way interaction was a 3 -way interaction in non-high poverty neighborhoods only. Private insurance was protective for unmarried men (RR = 1. 60) but not women, while it was protective for married women (RR = 1. 22) but not men. This pattern seemed explained by lower-incomes of certain groups of unmarried women and married men and more prevalent underinsuring of unmarried men. Conclusions.

However, as we increase the poverty line, the poverty difference between female- and male-headed households rises to the detriment of female-headed households and becomes statistically significant.
