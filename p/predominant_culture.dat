25|$|The {{composite}} Turco-Persian tradition {{refers to}} a distinctive culture that arose in the 9th and 10th centuries (AD) in Khorasan and Transoxiana (present-day, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, minor parts of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan). It was Persianate {{in that it was}} centered on a lettered tradition of Iranian origin and it was Turkic insofar as it was founded by and for many generations patronized by rulers of Turkic heredity. In subsequent centuries, the Turco-Persian culture would be carried on further by the conquering peoples to neighbouring regions, eventually becoming the <b>predominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the ruling and elite classes of West Asia (Middle East), Central Asia and South Asia (Indian Subcontinent).|$|E

5000|$|Fishing was an {{important}} part of the local economy and part of the subsistence lifestyle that permeated the early location. Its fertile soils, supported by a warm microclimate, allowed the cultivation of corn, rye, grapes, potato, beans and tarot (with the latter two being the <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures),</b> while a low-volume coffee culture also developed.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>predominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the South has {{its origins}} with the {{settlement}} of the region by large groups of Northern English, Scots lowlanders and Ulster-Scots (later called the Scotch-Irish) who settled in Appalachia and the Piedmont in the 18th century, and from parts of southern England such as East Anglia, Kent and the West Country in the 17th century, and the many African slaves {{who were part of}} the Southern economy. [...] African-American descendants of the slaves brought into the South compose the United States' second-largest racial minority, accounting for 12.1 {{percent of the total population}} according to the 2000 census. [...] Despite Jim Crow era outflow to the North, the majority of the black population remains concentrated in the Southern states, and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend (Christianity, foods, art, music (see spiritual, blues, jazz and rock and roll)) that characterize Southern culture today.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the novel, the {{characters}} are confronted with the sometimes-thin line separating sexual promiscuity from sanctity {{in the eyes of}} the <b>predominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Abortion, divorce, remarriage and adoption affect the lives and psyches of Roth's subjects as the plot unfolds.|$|E

50|$|These coastal {{cultures}} eventually {{began to}} decline {{as a result of}} recurring el Niño floods and droughts. In consequence, the Huari and Tiwanaku, who dwelt inland in the Andes became the <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures</b> of the region encompassing much of modern-day Peru and Bolivia. They were succeeded by powerful city-states, such as Chancay, Sipan, and Cajamarca, and two empires: Chimor and Chachapoyas culture These cultures developed relatively advanced techniques of cultivation, gold and silver craft, pottery, metallurgy, and knitting. Around 700 BC, they appear to have developed systems of social organization that were the precursors of the Inca civilization.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population live in Latin America, named for its <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures,</b> rooted in Latin Europe (including the two dominant languages, Spanish and Portuguese, both Romance languages), more specifically in the Iberian nations of Portugal and Spain (hence {{the use of the term}} Ibero-America as a synonym). Latin America is typically contrasted with Anglo-America, where English, a Germanic language, is prevalent, and which comprises Canada (with the exception of francophone Canada rooted in Latin Europe France—see Québec and Acadia) and the United States. Both countries are located in North America, with cultures deriving predominantly from Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, in some {{immigrant}} families and communities, language brokering {{is also used}} to integrate children into family endeavors and into civil society. Child integration has become very important to form linkages between new immigrant communities and the <b>predominant</b> <b>culture</b> and new forms of bureaucratic systems. In addition, it also serves towards child development by learning and pitching in.|$|E

5000|$|Sourdough bread traces {{its origins}} to ancient Egypt and {{is common in}} parts of Europe. It became a staple in San Francisco during the California Gold Rush of 1849. [...] Gold miners valued it for their camps because of its durability, and the {{relative}} ease of obtaining yeast. Although {{many different kinds of}} pre-ferment (a dough-like mixture of fermented flour and water containing bacteria and wild yeast) are suitable for making sourdough, specific species of bacteria (Lactobacillus sanfrancisco) and wild yeast (Candida humilis) have been identified as the <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures</b> in local breads.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, about 160,000 Kuy {{lived in the}} {{northern}} Cambodian provinces of Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, and Stung Treng {{as well as in}} adjacent Thailand. (Approximately 70,000 Kuy had been reported in Cambodia itself in 1978.) Most of the Kuy have been assimilated into the <b>predominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the country in which they live. Many are Buddhists, and the majority practice wet-rice cultivation. They have the reputation of being skilled blacksmiths.|$|E
50|$|The <b>predominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the South {{was rooted}} in the {{settlement}} of the region by British colonists. In the seventeenth century, most voluntary immigrants were of English origins who settled chiefly along the coastal regions of the Eastern seaboard.

The wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights, to encourage settlement.|$|E
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of dozens of archaeological sites on Peavine and in the surrounding areas, {{it is apparent that}} aboriginal Great Basin cultures were active in this area. The <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures</b> were those of the Washo and Northern Paiute peoples, their artifacts having been found at locations ranging from Bull Ranch, at the southern terminus of Bull Ranch Creek on the southern flank of the mountain, to the shores of White Lake north of the Peavine (it {{is interesting to note that}} many of these sites have been found above the 6,000 foot level). Extant artifacts have been traced to both the Kings Beach (ca. 500-1500 A.D.) and Martis (ca. 2000 B.C. to 500A.D.) cultures at sites primarily located within the Truckee River drainage.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was {{identification}} of aroma active compounds in Moravský bochník cheese type, than discuss their changes during ripening and consider influence of aplication different rates of microbial cultures on number of volatile compounds. SPME-GC-MS was used for identification of volatile compounds. In total, 148 of volatile compounds were identified and 82 of them are considered as aroma active compounds. Three microbial cultures (their combination with predominant thermophilic or mesophilic culture) were used for making samples. The influence of <b>predominant</b> thermophilic/mesophilic <b>culture</b> on number of volatile compounds was not proved. From {{the point of view}} of sensory quality, combinations with <b>predominant</b> mesophilic <b>culture</b> proved to be more successful. During ripening, the number of identified compounds was reduced in all the combinations of cultures studied. The optimal time for ripening seems to be three months...|$|R
50|$|Otero-Warren {{was born}} in New Mexico {{during the twentieth century}} into a family of old Spanish colonial lineage. During a period {{distinguished}} by various <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures</b> she was characterized as the intermediary of not just Hispanic, but also Anglo and American Indian relations. She gained the public affinity through her heritage, marriage, and career. She was a well-educated and career-driven Southwest Native. But because of her distinct background and role as a middleman across cultures she managed to make a unique impact socially and politically. Her opulent heritage and marriage to Anglo, Warren gave her a particular position between the power structures and boundaries dividing the Anglos and natives. Aside from her more concrete contributions politically, Otero-Warren also stands as a figurative symbol of the intricate relationship between cultures in America during the twentieth century, and the controversial notion of assimilation.|$|R

40|$|This article {{details the}} {{development}} of an inventory that identifies and measures reading preferences of sixth- through ninth-grade Mexican immigrant students. The inventory of reading preferences employs a unique methodology which utilizes open-ended, rating type questionnaires and annotated titles for 22 reading preference categories in combination with two statistical techniques (Qquotient and reading preference factor) all developed by the researcher to accurately measure reading preferences. Reliability coefficients ranged from. 90 to. 96, far exceeding the typical range of. 60 to. 80 for similar inventories. Three panels of experts, one including children in validating the inventory, identified 36 annotated titles representing the dominant culture (Section A), and 37 annotated titles representing one of four <b>predominant</b> <b>cultures</b> in the Southwest: Mexican, African American, Native American, and Anglo American (Section B) from a pool of 120 annotated titles. This inventory was used to investigate seven primary and four secondary research questions. Summary results are provided. Other uses of the inventory are suggested...|$|R

50|$|In some {{immigrant}} communities, children link {{their family}} and friends to the environment around them by translating and paraphrasing words, phrases or occurring situations. This practice is known as language brokering and is used by children in immigrant communities to integrate themselves into family endeavors and into civil society. The child's contribution by language brokering integrates them into many environments, such as the doctor's office, at parent-teachers' conferences, banks, housing offices, and various sorts of negotiation activities. Subsequently, children who engage in language brokering {{are more likely to}} also be representatives of their community when transitioning into adulthood.
