The BT systems, based at Scousburgh in the Shetland Islands, Mormond Hill in Aberdeenshire and Row Brow near Scarborough, were capable of transmitting and receiving 156 analogue (4 kHz bandwidth) channels of data and telephony to / from North Sea oil production platforms, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDMX) to combine the channels. Because {{of the nature of}} the turbulence in the troposphere, quadruple diversity propagation paths were used to ensure 99.98% reliability of the service, equating to about 3 minutes of downtime due to propagation drop out per month. The quadruple space and <b>polarisation</b> <b>diversity</b> systems needed two separate dish antennae (spaced several metres apart) and two differently polarised feed horns - one using vertical polarisation, the other using horizontal polarisation. This ensured that at least one signal path was open at any one time. The signals from the four different paths were recombined in the receiver where a phase corrector removed the phase differences of each signal. Phase differences were caused by the different path lengths of each signal from transmitter to receiver. Once phase corrected, the four signals could be combined additively.|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are attractive largely {{because they need}} no wired infrastructure. But precisely this feature makes them energy constrained, {{and the consequences of}} this hard energy constraint are the overall topic of this thesis. We are in particular concerned with principles for energy efficient wireless communication and the energy-wise trade-off between sensing and radio communication. Radio transmission between sensors incurs both a fixed energy cost from radio circuit processing, and a variable energy cost related to the level of radiated energy. We here find that transmission techniques that are otherwise considered efficient consumes too much processing energy. Currently available sensor node radios typically have a maximum output power that is too limited to benefit from transmission-efficient, but processing-intensive, techniques. Our results provide new design guidelines for the radio output power. With increasing transmission energy [...] with increasing distance [...] the considered techniques should be applied in the following order: output power control, <b>polarisation</b> receiver <b>diversity,</b> error correcting codes, multi-hop communication, and cooperative multiple-input multiple-output transmissions. To assess the measurement capability of the network as a whole, and to facilitate a study of the sensing-communication trade-off, we devise a new metric: the network measurement capacity. It is {{based on the number of}} different measurement sequences that a network can provide, and is hence a measure of the network's readiness to meet a large number of possible events. Optimised multi-hop routing under this metric reveals that the energy consumed for sensing has decisive impact on the best multi-hop routes. We also find support for the use of hierarchical heterogeneous network structures. Model parameter uncertainties have large impact on our results and we use probability theory as logic to include them consistently. Our analysis shows that common assumptions can give misleading results, and our analysis of radio channel measurements confirms the inadequacy of the Rayleigh fading channel model. wisene...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study and monitor glaciers and ice sheets for glaciological and climate change research. SAR is a powerful remote sensing tool due to its high spatial resolution and wide coverage, and its ability to penetrate beneath the ice's surface to observe sub-surface structures. However, SAR backscattering from ice and the inversion of geophysical parameters from SAR ice data remain poorly understood. The relative importance of scattering from the air/snow and snow/ice interfaces, from internal layers and structures in the firn, as well as the dependence of the land ice radar signatures on frequency and glacier facie, is unclear. Few models address the interferometric coherence as an observable, and the greatest focus to date has been on modelling single-polarisation backscattering coefficients. This paper augments the use of SAR backscattering coefficients with <b>polarisation</b> and baseline <b>diversity</b> (Polarimetric Interferometric SAR or Pol-InSAR) to provide additional information on the underlying glacial structure and more thorough validation criteria for evaluating the applicability of electromagnetic models. The backscatter and interferometric coherence from the ice is modelled as a coherent sum of slightly rough annual layers as well as volume scattering from ice crystals between the layers. Validation is performed using a unique Pol-InSAR data set acquired over the Nordaustlandet sheet in Svalbard, Norway. The data were collected using DLR's airborne E-SAR (Experimental SAR) system as part of the SVALEX (April 2005) and ICESAR (March/April 2007) campaigns. Fully-polarised multi-baseline data at L- (1. 3 GHz) and P-band (0. 35 GHz) frequencies and single-pass VV data at X-band (9. 6 GHz) were obtained. For calibration purposes and to determine the penetration of the radar signals, corner reflectors and an approximately 200 -m-long wire were deployed directly {{on the surface of the}} ice. Backscatter and coherence at different frequencies and thus different depths of penetration, and at different polarisations and thus potentially different scattering mechanisms, are examined as a function of incidence angle, spatial baseline, and temporal baseline (a two year temporal baseline is available). Modelled results are compared with the quad-pol observed backscatter and complex coherences, providing insight on the electromagnetic interaction between the radar signal and the polythermal ice. The use of interferometry and surface reflectors enables measurement of the phase centre depth of the penetrating radar signal. Electromagnetic modelling of longer-wavelength Pol-InSAR observables over glaciers and ice sheets has relevance for future spaceborne SAR concepts. Potential satellite missions including a P-band sounder and the BIOMASS earth observation proposal would benefit from an increased understanding of long-wavelength SAR observables over land ice...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{technology}} has made complex signal processing possible in communication systems and greatly improved {{the performance and}} quality of most modern telecommunication systems. The telecommunication industry and specifically mobile wireless telephone and computer networks have shown phenomenal growth in both the number of subscribers and emerging services, resulting in rapid consumption of common resources of which the electromagnetic spectrum is the most important. Technological advances and research in digital communication are necessary to satisfy the growing demand, to fuel the demand and to exploit all the possibilities and business opportunities. Efficient management and distribution of resources facilitated by state-of-the-art algorithms are indispensable in modern communication networks. The challenge in communication system design is to construct a system that can accurately reproduce the transmitted source message at the receiver. The channel connecting the transmitter and receiver introduces detrimental effects and limits the reliability and speed of information transfer between the source and destination. Typical channel effects encountered in mobile wireless communication systems include path loss between the transmitter and receiver, noise caused by the environment and electronics in the system, and fading caused by multiple paths and movement in the communication channel. In multiple access systems, different users cause interference in each other’s signals and adversely affect the system performance. To ensure reliable communication, methods to overcome channel effects must be devised and implemented in the system. Techniques used to improve system performance and capacity include temporal, frequency, <b>polarisation</b> and spatial <b>diversity.</b> This dissertation is concerned mainly with temporal or time diversity. Channel coding is a temporal diversity scheme and aims to improve the system error performance by adding structured redundancy to the transmitted message. The receiver exploits the redundancy to infer with greater accuracy which message was transmitted, compared with uncoded systems. Sparse graph codes are channel codes represented as sparse probabilistic graphical models which originated in artificial intelligence theory. These channel codes are described as factor graph structures with bit nodes, representing the transmitted codeword bits, and bit-constrained or check nodes. Each constraint involves {{only a small number}} of code bits, resulting in a sparse factor graph with far fewer connections between bit and check nodes than the maximum number of possible connections. Sparse graph codes are iteratively decoded using message passing or belief propagation algorithms. Three classes of iteratively decodable channel codes are considered in this study, including low-density parity-check (LDPC), Turbo and repeat-accumulate (RA) codes. The modulation platform presented in this dissertation is a spectrally efficient wideband system employing orthogonal complex spreading sequences (CSSs) to spread information sequences over a wider frequency band in multiple modulation dimensions. Special features of these spreading sequences include their constant envelopes and power output, providing communication range or device battery life advantages. This study shows that multiple layer modulation (MLM) can be used to transmit parallel data streams with improved spectral efficiency compared with single-layer modulation, providing data throughput rates proportional to the number of modulation layers at performances equivalent to single-layer modulation. Alternatively, multiple modulation layers can be used to transmit coded information to achieve improved error performance at throughput rates equivalent to a single layer systemDissertation (MEng (Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

Each antenna contains two parts: a PIFA resonant at 2. 4 GHz and an inverted-L behaving as a capacitive load and responsible for the resonance at 5. 2 GHz The results has been calculated for the 3 x 3 MIMO system without and with human hand around it...|$|E
30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this work}} lies in the unique combination of energy-efficient techniques and practices for the realisation of a reliable maintenance-free smart home system with wearable sensors for long-term activity monitoring. It also provides insight for researchers and engineers who are developing similar platforms. In particular, we perform a thorough power consumption study {{that is based on}} actual measurements and considers each key part of the system separately, in an attempt to be the basis of practical battery lifetime estimations. In addition, we investigate the issue of antenna design for body-centric communications. We provide a thorough wireless coverage study focusing on the challenges of full-house coverage and the effects of the body on the path loss and the packet error rate (PER) in a residential environment. We investigate the trade-off between power consumption and wireless coverage. Finally, we quantify and evaluate the performance of energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques, including cyclic redundancy code (CRC) error correction, application-layer coding and antenna <b>polarisation</b> <b>diversity.</b> Overall, this work documents experiences and practical lessons on the use of BLE for streaming data, body-centric communications in residential environments and ultra low-power system design.|$|E
