50|$|Within the Courts, the EFS allows {{electronic}} {{documents to}} be automatically routed {{to the appropriate}} registry staff for processing. The system allows further routing within the courts e.g. for approvals by the Duty Registrar and a reply is then sent out by the Registry staff which is routed back to the originating LF. This has enabled realisations of improvements in efficiency by minimising <b>paper</b> <b>flow</b> to shorten case processing time. Fees payable by the LFs for filing documents to Court are deducted automatically by the EFS. The whole process is fast, convenient and efficient.|$|E

Particular {{attention is paid}} to extending the existing depth-averaged equations initially developed for frictionless and incompressible fluids down a horizontal plane. The effects of the gravitational acceleration along the slope, and of the retarding acceleration caused by friction as well, are systematically taken into account. The analytic solutions are then used to revisit existing data on rigid walls impacted by granular flows. This approach allows establishing a complete phase diagram for granular flow-wall interaction...|$|R

50|$|EDI {{documents}} generally {{contain the}} same information that would normally {{be found in a}} paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as request for quotation (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a <b>paper</b> <b>flow</b> before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged.|$|E

40|$|Artificial cavitation, or ventilation, is {{produced}} by releasing gas into liquid flow. One objective of creating such a multiphase flow is to reduce frictional and sometimes wave resistance of a marine vehicle completely or partially immersed in the water. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>flows</b> around surface ships moving along the water-air boundary are considered. It is favorable to achieve a negative cavitation number in the developed cavitating flow under the vessel's bottom in order to generate additional lift.

Methods for calculating these influences and results of a parametric study are reported...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} half of this paper the {{evidence}} concerning the costs of job insecurity is presented. There is now sufficient good research data to conclude that job insecurity is damaging to psychological health, marriages and employee motivation, and contributes to 'cycles of disadvantage'. In the second half of this <b>paper,</b> <b>flows</b> out of secure and insecure jobs are analysed using a work-histories dataset. Not only is it the case that flows from secure to insecure jobs were more common in the 1980 s than in the 1970 s and 1960 s, but it is also apparent that the risk of a transition from a secure job into an insecure job is much greater for those in less advantaged jobs. The negative consequences of this further polarisation of the UK labour market are discussed. ...|$|R
