5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> or blown away from it. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> is {{maintained}} by {{volunteers from the}} Trust and {{is open to the}} public every Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holiday except during the winter maintenance period, when opening is only on Saturdays. There is a working model of the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> at the Kennet & Avon Canal Museum at Devizes. The restoration work received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{county has}} several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths. Other visitor attractions which reflect the {{cultural}} {{heritage of the}} county include: Claverton <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station,</b> Dunster Working Watermill, the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Nunney Castle, The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare, King John's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge, Blake Museum Bridgwater, Radstock Museum, Museum of Somerset in Taunton, the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury, and Westonzoyland <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station</b> Museum.|$|E
25|$|By September 6, 2005, the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> {{began to}} get online on 17th Street Canal. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 10 was {{actually}} pumping at this point. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1, {{which is a little}} bit further up in the system, was <b>pumping</b> to <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 6, so as to drain the upper area, uptown areas. Over on the east side, <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 19 had been running for some time. Two of the three big <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> in New Orleans East were running, in addition to temporary pumps. At least one <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> was running in Plaquemines Parish.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pumping</b> <b>stations</b> {{maintain}} {{the momentum of}} the oil as it goes through the pipeline. <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1 is the northernmost of 11 <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> with 4 <b>pumps</b> each, but <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 5 held in reserve. <b>Pump</b> <b>Stations</b> 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> on sewer network. In the {{theoretical}} part is described the construction solution and machinery equipment of <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> The design of volumes and machinery of <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> is also solved. In the practical part are evaluated the two operated <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> in the municipalities of Dolní Lhota and Velenov. At {{the conclusion of the}} practical part is evaluated the volume and operation of <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> in these municipalities...|$|R
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} dam and provided water to the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> which originally contained four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines, built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock, which have now been replaced by electric pumps. Two of the steam engines have been preserved, with one in working order as part of the visitor centre which also includes educational facilities for children. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station.</b> The original steam-powered <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E
5|$|After its closure the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> lay {{derelict}} {{until the}} late 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEl-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Stations</b> (1) and (2) {{are located}} at 22. 1 km and 54. 3 km {{respectively}} at El-Salam Canal. When El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (1) is in operation, and switching off El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2), water level rises upstream El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2). Water level overtops El-Salam <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> (2) and banks upstream it. Flooding then takes place as Wadi El Noqra Canal, Egypt. This necessitates discharging the excess water {{to protect the}} <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> and the canal from water flooding when the electricity is shut down. The hydrodynamic simulation of El-Salam Canal determinates the critical time for storage capacity according to location and type of emergency spillways through the numerical model to prevent water overtopping upstream <b>pump</b> <b>stations.</b> Determination of the critical time of storage capacity is considered as a new parameter in case of the hydraulic design of the canal controlled by cross <b>pump</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
25|$|In East Orleans, {{four more}} {{portable}} pumps {{were to be}} added in support of <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 15 to increase the overall capacity to 1,100 cubic feet per second (31 m³/s). For the first time, the Jahncke <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> ran at its full capacity of 1,200 cubic feet per second (34 m³/s). Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> and St. Charles <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> each were running at half capacity because the Citrus <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> has to pull power from a generator {{at one of the}} other two stations. Total possible capacity for these two stations is 1,750 cubic feet per second (50 m³/s).|$|R
50|$|The MMDA {{operates}} several <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> {{in strategic}} areas of Metro Manila, {{with the aim}} of mitigating flooding risks, particularly during inclement weather. Old <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> that used diesel engines were upgraded in 2015 to use electric motors. Brand new <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> were also constructed in flood-prone areas as part of the agency's flood-mitigation program. In addition they also scheduled a regular maintenance of 54 <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> across the country with 12 stations being equipped with new pumps.|$|R
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former <b>pumping</b> <b>station,</b> {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Kinder Morgan {{began the}} process to add a second pipeline, running {{parallel}} to the first, for the portion running between Hinton, Alberta, and Hargreaves, British Columbia. This required two more <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> - the Wolf <b>Pump</b> <b>Station,</b> near Niton Junction, Alberta, and the Chappel <b>Pump</b> <b>Station,</b> near Pyramid, British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|The project {{includes}} {{improvements to}} channels, canals, <b>pump</b> <b>stations,</b> and drainage lines, {{as well as}} the addition of a new <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> in Orleans Parish.|$|R
500|$|Even though winter {{shut down}} all {{pipelaying}} {{on the right}} of way, work on the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> and in Valdez continued without stop. At <b>Pump</b> <b>Station</b> 1, in Prudhoe Bay, temperatures reached lower than , but the work continued. Because the <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> was the origin point for the main pipeline, it also had to process the feeder lines coming from oil wells. The <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> camp had a population of 270 workers through the winter, and it would peak in the summer with 430 workers.|$|R
5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers {{with plans for}} improvements, the chief of which was for a steam <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E
5|$|Little {{attempt was}} made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, {{possibly}} because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as {{they were on the}} Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The first steam <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> was Westonzoyland <b>Pumping</b> <b>Station</b> in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric pumps are used today.|$|E
5|$|That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved {{south to}} their objectives, {{reaching}} them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the <b>pumping</b> <b>station.</b> The commander {{made the mistake}} of separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the <b>pumping</b> <b>station,</b> the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being directed against the bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{required}} significant {{infrastructure in}} power generation to support the <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> Communities oriented {{to the maintenance of}} the pipeline and <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> grew up along the route. However, with improved power supplies and modern machinery and automation, the scheme now has more unattended <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> operated by fewer people required to live along or close to the line.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013 in June. The Canadian National Energy Board forces Enbridge to {{disclose}} safety measures {{in place at}} 125 of its <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> The disclosure revealed that 117 of 125 <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> were in non-compliance to safety rules set out by the NEB. The NEB rules broken included lack of backup power at all but 8 stations and no emergency shutdown at 83 of its <b>pump</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} of <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> has attracted {{more and more}} attention. The scheme of pumping energy-saving based on computer control technology was explored in this study by taking the example of Da Zhang Zhuang <b>pump</b> <b>station</b> in Tianjin. The results showed that when efficient was improved by 1 %, the 170, 000 kWh power would be saved annually. This method was applicable for the other <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> with same style. What’s more, for the <b>pump</b> <b>stations</b> which have already been controlled by computer program, {{it would be much}} more convenience that might be easy conducted in the near future...|$|R

And application example was given. Raise the question The regional important tasks including flood control, waterlogging control, irrigation, water diversion and water supply are borne by the <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> The enormous economic benefits are brought for each sector even the national economy through the long running of <b>pumping</b> <b>stations.</b> Most of large and medium-sized <b>pumping</b> <b>stations</b> in China have been built for a long time. Due to long-running and the technical–economic-environmental constraints at that time, problems occur more frequently [1]. So it not only has severely restricted the effective play of disaster reduction and resulted in ever-increasing operating costs, also may lead the engineering accidents...|$|R
5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical <b>pumping</b> <b>station</b> on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the drainage system {{led to the formation of}} Internal drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
