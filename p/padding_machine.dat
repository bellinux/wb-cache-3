The advantages of the application of a new composition on the basis of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, silver ion solution and benzoic acid include the availability of the material’s use, as well as the simplicity of the technological process: finishing may be per-formed with any tenter drier aggregated with a <b>padding</b> <b>machine</b> and combining the drying process and thermal treatment. The newly developed efficient composite formulation for biocidal finishing of cotton fabrics is comparatively inexpensive, environmentally safe, and resistant to wet treatment. Its application offers opportunities of manufacturing of a wide range of competitive, environmentally compatible, and biologically stable cellulose textiles with various textures and various fabric weights. As a result of the study it has been found out that cotton fabrics finished with the composition on the basis of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, silver ion solution and benzoic acid have advanced antimicrobial characteristics prevent-ing fouling with mould fungi and are not deteriorated by microorganisms under operationa...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Tampico Schools {{date back to}} 1874. Until 1912, the high school only had three grades. The brick {{building}} that housed TTHS for 75 years was built in 1921 and had 14 classrooms and a gymnasium. It was located near a railroad junction of the Hooppole, Yorktown & Tampico Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. The first mentioned was abandoned in 1953. In 1967, there were 153 students enrolled at TTHS. In the 1980s, Tampico lost its main railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy route, {{that was the reason}} Tampico became a settlement like most other small towns. Declining enrollment and financial concerns led to the closing of Tampico High School in 1996. The 1921 brick building was torn down during the summer of 2012 as part of a district wide facility improvement plan.. As of 2003, the old football field is still there, along with the <b>padded</b> hitting <b>machine</b> which is now rusted. The track outside of the field is still there in cement form. High School students from Tampico now attend Prophetstown High School, twelve miles to the northwest.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{pressurised}} cylinders having attached pads was made. The {{possibility of a}} fatigue crack developing along {{one side of the}} pad was noted. For both defect-free components and components having axial crack-like defects, finite element and limited experimental studies of the local and global deformations were made and results were found to be in close agreement. Both welded and integrally <b>machined</b> <b>pads</b> were studied. It was observed that for defect-free components, the method of pad attachment has little effect on the burst pressure. The presence of a pad was found to increase the burst pressure of cracked components by a small but significant margin. A finite element-based parametric study of pipes with part-penetrating defects and a range of pad geometries has demonstrated that pad size has little influence on the limit load for any of the cracked cases considered. However, pipes with penetrating defects were strengthened by the presence of pads, particularly for thin-walled sections...|$|R

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{analysis of}} the fatigue life of specimens subject to fretting fatigue was carried out. A mechanics based fretting life analysis was applied that accounted for the local stress gradient {{at the edge of}} contact. The random variables in the analysis included the initial crack size, coefficient of friction, crack growth rate law, and the contact pad profile. The variation in pad profiles was determined through statistical analysis of seventy-seven <b>machined</b> <b>pads.</b> Distributions for the other random variables were generated using previously generated test data. A probabilistic fatigue analysis was applied using Monte Carlo sampling to determine the statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the fatigue life prediction. Several qualitative and quantitative sensitivity methods were applied to the results including the calculation of the probabilistic sensitivities (partial derivatives of the fatigue statistics with respect to the input probability density function parameters.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the failure analysis of carbon steel roller shaft of continuous <b>pad</b> steam <b>machine</b> used in textile industry. The fracture position was located at a stepped diameter. The failed component was the shaft made of carbon steel AISI 1040. Standard procedure for failure analysis was employed in this investigation. Visual examination, chemical analysis, hardness and tensile strength measurements, microstructural characterization, fractography analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{were used for}} the failure analysis. Using this failure analysis approach, we pinpointed the root cause of failure and developed a means of solving this type of failure in the future. Firstly, the chemical composition of the shaft is done by an Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) method, the found chemical composition was matching with required standard value. Mechanical testing consists of two test i. e. tensile test and hardness test and it was found out that the strength and hardness of specimens were within the required capacity. For metallurgical analysis, the microstructure of the shaft was developed by using an optical microstructure. Equal distribution of ferrite perlite shows that heat treatment was performed well and carbon percentage in a material is satisfying the standard values. Thus, it proves that the material used was of good quality and indicates that failure is not due to material property. Further for the fractography, the fractured surface was examined by SEM. The cross-section was taken in a quarter segments and divided into four regions i. e. A, B, C, and D. Fractography morphology mainly showed that the failure of roller shaft was caused due to fatigue. To examine the stress distribution at the fractured surface the Finite Element Method (FEM) was also carried out. Based on the shaft size, a precise ANSYS model was developed. The result of FEM shows that stress concentration was significant at roller shaft step which could reduce the material reliability to some extent. Based on the failure analysis it could be concluded that due to stress concentration a micro crack is initiated along the weak interface and further it converted into the major fatigue failure. Fractography morphology of failed roller shaft also confirms the fatigue failure...|$|R
40|$|Impact loads {{applied to}} {{concrete}} sleepers, either {{due to the}} wheel flats of a train or rail abnormalities, may cause the sleepers to crack. The rail pads {{have been used to}} attenuate the effect of these impact loads on concrete sleepers and on the substructures in ballasted railway tracks. The rail pads experience high intensity loads due to wheel impacts and, as a result, the pad properties deteriorate during the service life. The consequences can be significant for the dynamic behaviour of railway tracks, interaction of vehicle and track, and impact forces on track components. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the pads. In this paper, the degradation of rail pad properties as a function of their in-service life is studied with a view of developing a technique for predicting the optimum period of track maintenance with regard to pad replacement. Identification of structural properties using methods of experimental modal analysis provides a means for investigation of the deterioration of dynamic pad characteristics. A technique using an instrumented impact hammer is employed in this study. The pad samples were collected from the railway lines in Sydney Electrified Network, Australia, which are operated by Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp). Through testing of pads in a recently developed rail <b>pad</b> testing <b>machine,</b> the vibration responses were measured in the frequency range from 0 to 1000 Hz using the Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE Vibration Analyser system. The analytical solution was derived to estimate the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the worn pads from the obtained experimental data. The rates of deterioration based on limited data are proposed to predict the useful lifetime of pads and the period of pad replacement. In this study, the type of rail pad used was the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pad with 5. 5 mm thickness. All worn pads were sourced from RailCorp tracks with approximately 22 MGT (million gross tons) annual tonnage. Based on linear regression analysis, it has been determined that at 20 kN preload (equivalent to PANDROL e-Clip fastening system clamping force) degradation of dynamic stiffness and damping is about 2. 2 MN/m and 19. 6 Ns/m per MGT, respectively, for the particular track conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project were to analyze, characterize, and predict the influences that surface treatments have on crack propagation {{in the presence of}} fretting fatigue damage. The titanium alloys, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 17, were implemented for this research, and the surface enhancement methods consisted of shot peening and laser shock peening. The approach was to incorporate methods of contact mechanics, fractography, and fracture mechanics so that the influence of surface enhancements on fretting fatigue could be better understood. The specimens were obtained from prior fretting fatigue experiments that consisted of dog-bones and contact pads with both surface enhanced and bare conditions. ^ The dog-bone specimens had fretting fatigue damage, which is a combination of a cyclic bulk load and the fretting induced damage. These specimens were incorporated in life prediction analyses in which a procedure for calculating fretting fatigue life by correlating nucleation and propagation through a non-arbitrary crack initiation criterion was introduced. The life prediction results show that the fretting fatigue life can be determined with knowledge of the fretting stress field and nature of the fretting cracks. The results also show that surface enhancements do not stop fretting fatigue cracks from forming, do slow the propagation and increase the fretting fatigue life. ^ The contact pads had what is known as ‘pure fretting’ damage, which consists of the damage from the contact stresses but no cyclic bulk load. The contact pads are the basis {{for the development of the}} C-specimen experiment. The contact <b>pads</b> were <b>machined</b> into C-specimens that help measure the threshold stress intensity factor. The objective of the C-specimen experiment is to increase the cyclically applied load of the specimen through step testing until a fatigue crack propagates from the existing fretting induced crack. The testing technique provides for the threshold stress intensity factor to be measured while exposing the original fretting crack for fractographic observation. The results show that C-specimen type experiments are an effective method of measuring the threshold stress intensity factor, and that surface enhanced C-specimens will have larger threshold loads than the untreated specimens. ...|$|R
