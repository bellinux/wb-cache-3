5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the <b>public</b> <b>treasury,</b> the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as Ling (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the imperial mint for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint {{was transferred to the}} office of the Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|To a large extent, {{the public}} {{were aware of}} the vast {{financial}} resources that Augustus commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the <b>public</b> <b>treasury.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E

5|$|No great {{compromise}} reached Taylor's desk {{during his}} presidency; instead, his last days were {{overshadowed by the}} Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford {{had served as a}} lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid {{at the time of the}} American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} <b>public</b> <b>treasury,</b> (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} his move from an {{ideology}} of republicanism {{to one of}} autocracy, Diocletian's council of advisers, his consilium, differed from those of earlier emperors. He destroyed the Augustan illusion of imperial government as a cooperative affair between emperor, army, and senate. In its place he established an effectively autocratic structure, a shift later epitomized in the institution's name: it would be called a consistorium (""), not a council. Diocletian regulated his court by distinguishing separate departments (scrina) for different tasks. From this structure came the offices of different magistri, like the Magister officiorum ("Master of offices"), and associated secretariats. These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards {{to the level of}} a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect – although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general – but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.|$|E
60|$|This threat mightily alarmed the inhabitants, and {{the firing}} ceased altogether; for as {{these were not}} regular soldiers, and knew that {{the object of the}} English attack was to plunder the <b>public</b> <b>treasuries,</b> rather than private property, the townsmen readily deemed it to their {{interest}} to hold aloof, rather than to bring upon their city and themselves so grievous a calamity as that threatened by the English.|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} the entire {{administration}} of the state was in a disorganised state, <b>public</b> <b>treasuries</b> were empty and large arrears of payments in way of salaries and otherwise were pending. The Maharajah had already taken a loan from the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple of Trivandrum and adding the subsidy {{to be paid to}} the British Government, the state of affairs was bad enough to deter anyone from taking up the post of Dewan. Soon after Madhava Rao's appointment the Shanar agitations took place in Travancore which added to the problems of the state.|$|R

25|$|Bait-ul-Maal (literally, The {{house of}} money) was the {{department}} {{that dealt with}} the revenues and all other economic matters of the state. In the time of Muhammad there was no permanent Bait-ul-Mal or <b>public</b> <b>treasury.</b> Whatever revenues or other amounts were received were distributed immediately. There were no salaries to be paid, {{and there was no}} state expenditure. Hence the need for the treasury at the public level was not felt.|$|E
25|$|His {{reforms in}} favor of the people greatly angered the nobility of the Umayyads, and they would {{eventually}} bribe a servant into poisoning his food.

25|$|The palace complex {{consisted}} of two primary buildings. The larger one {{has been identified as}} the Dar al-'Amma (Public Palace), where the caliph sat in audience and conducted official business, and where the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> (bayt al-mal) was housed. On the western side of the palace was the Bab al-'Amma (Public Gate), whose triple iwan still survives. The Bab al-'Amma was often used as a location for public executions and displaying the remains of those killed.|$|E
40|$|When asset values fall, {{the owners}} of collateralized loans are not in an enviable position. Nonetheless, they possess a kind of {{monopoly}} power over their borrowers {{that they do not}} possess when borrowers are solvent. Lenders maximize profits by price discriminating, but create deadweight costs in the process. From the perspective of the aggregate labor market, it is as if lenders were levying their own labor income tax, on top of the taxes already levied by <b>public</b> <b>treasuries.</b> Governments have an incentive to regulate this price discrimination, repudiate part of the private debts, cut their own tax rates, or acquire the debt themselves. These conditions may describe both the 1930 s and economic events today. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{what is seen}} as {{yet another}} one of John Hyrcanus' accomplishments, during his days any {{commoner}} or rustic could be trusted in what concerns Demai-produce (that is, if a doubt arose {{over whether or not}} such produce bought from him had been correctly divested of its tithes), since even the common folk in Israel were careful to separate the Terumah-offering given to the priests. Still, such produce required its buyer to separate the First and Second Tithes. Some view this as also being a discredit unto the High Priest, seeing that the commoners refused to separate these latter tithes because of being intimidated by bullies, who took these tithes from the <b>public</b> <b>treasuries</b> by force, while John Hyrcanus refused to censure such bad conduct.|$|R
25|$|Córdoba was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Naples in 1504.

Although Ferdinand praised Córdoba, he gave him {{nothing else to do}} until his death. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba died on 2 December 1515 at his villa near Granada from malaria at age 62.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{instructions}} Mago received also {{some money for}} mercenaries, {{but not enough to}} raise a stronger army.

He sailed to the Balearic Islands and settled for the winter in the smaller one, Minorca.|$|E

500|$|Until recently, {{the full}} panoply of {{potential}} federal resources {{had not been}} brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes {{at the state and}} local level. These schemes are at least as corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from <b>public</b> <b>treasuries</b> for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption. Moreover, in some cases, local law enforcement is part and parcel of the problem itself, due to the outright corruption of its own establishment.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{the lack}} of product {{diversity}} and the overdependence on coffee was a major drawback {{when it came to}} supply for the country needs when the coffee international price plummeted; on the other hand, everything was imported and consequently the country owed not only the merchandise but also the current exchange, fleets and commissions. Guatemalan exports did not even reach twenty millions pesos and, given that too many plantations where owner by German and other legal aliens, {{only a fraction of the}} total exports value got the <b>public</b> <b>treasury.</b>|$|E

He farmed out the alcabala (sales tax) to improve its collection. He reorganized the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> and required strict accounting of the viceroyalty's income and expenses. He reestablished commerce and the postal service, which had been interrupted by the war with the insurgents.

25|$|In {{the country}} districts, {{as has been}} stated, the magistri pagorum had {{authority}} to maintain the viae vicinales.

The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the <b>public</b> <b>treasury</b> and the private owner shared the expense equally. No doubt, if only to secure uniformity, the personal liability of householders to execute repairs of the streets was commuted for a paving rate payable to the public authorities who were responsible from time to time.|$|E

25|$|Uthman was {{a shrewd}} {{businessman}} and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed {{greatly to the}} Rashidun Empire. Umar had fixed the allowance {{of the people and}} on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, {{in view of the fact}} that the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the <b>public</b> <b>treasury.</b> Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners.

25|$|Uthman was {{a family}} man who {{apparently}} led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire and regardless {{of the fact that}} he was rich due to his flourishing family business. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the <b>public</b> <b>treasury,</b> but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman was also a humanitarian: He developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad's wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely plain and simple, however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling like a King.|$|E

50|$|Schuster's estate sued New York City {{for failure}} to protect him.

In general, governments were held not to owe duties of protection to citizens for fear of straining <b>public</b> <b>treasuries</b> (among other reasons).

Schuster v. City of New York, 5 N.Y.2d 75 (1958). This important precedent meant that the case could go to trial. The City of New York eventually settled for $41,000, a reasonably large sum at the time, especially considering that even the presumably exaggerated sum the complaint sought was only $1,000,000.|$|R
