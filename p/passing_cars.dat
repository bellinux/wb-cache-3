5|$|Frankel praised Livolsi {{for making}} the film's four key montages—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. The third was {{particularly}} challenging as it uses <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove B-roll footage in to keep the action flowing.|$|E
5|$|Between his 1969 {{victory in}} the race and 1981, Andretti {{dropped out of the}} races due to part {{failures}} or crashes. His luck seemed to turn around in 1981. Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a fallen}} {{standing}} stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies beside the road about 1.5kilometres (0.9 miles) {{to the west of}} the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the 19th century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 and a half feet) in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Cars may pit {{as often}} as they wish at the expense of track position, but the free <b>pass</b> <b>car</b> is limited to taking fuel only at the first pit stop opportunity. If the free <b>pass</b> <b>car</b> is judged to have caused the caution (intentionally or not) there will be no free <b>pass</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
25|$|During a full yellow, {{only lead}} lap cars may pit {{the first time}} by the pit road. Once the lead lap cars who have decided to pit have entered pit road, the free <b>pass</b> <b>car</b> will be sent around the pace car to earn their lap back. The next time by, all cars (including the free <b>pass</b> <b>car)</b> may pit.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} {{specific}} examples of corvid cleverness. One carrion crow was documented to crack nuts by placing {{them on a}} crosswalk, letting the <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> crack the shell, waiting for the light to turn red, and then safely retrieving the contents. A group of crows in England took turns lifting garbage bin lids while their companions collected food.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of August 18, 1989, Davis {{attended}} a pool party in the Cloverdale neighborhood of Savannah, Georgia. As he left the party with his friend Daryl Collins, the occupants of a <b>passing</b> <b>car</b> yelled obscenities. A bullet was fired at the <b>passing</b> <b>car</b> and Michael Cooper, a passenger, was struck in the jaw. Davis and Collins then went to a pool hall on Oglethorpe Avenue in the Yamacraw Village section of Savannah.|$|R
25|$|On October 4, 1997, {{while driving}} on the Hokuriku Expressway with his {{associate}} Etsuo Kiso, Yokoi rear-ended a truck driven by Takashi Okushima. After {{the two men had}} left the car to inspect the damage, Yokoi was hit and fatally injured by two <b>passing</b> <b>cars.</b> The driver of one of the passenger cars that hit Yokoi in the second accident was Gen Tsushima, a member of the tourism industry. Yokoi's death was confirmed two hours later.|$|E
25|$|Bayamón is {{the site}} of several notable Puerto Rican {{landmarks}} and places of interest. Bayamón Central Park is a public park where people gather and relax. Bayamon also hosts the Braulio Castillo Theater, the Francisco Oller Museum, and the José Celso Barbosa Monument. The Bayamón City Hall building is notable by being built across a major divided highway. While walking through a connecting corridor, right above the road, pedestrians can see <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> underneath. It {{is believed to be the}} only building of its class in the world.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lived in}} Protestant or Catholic {{enclaves}} which put them {{within easy reach}} of local paramilitary or community groups. The years 1972–73 saw paramilitary threats from loyalist and republican sources. Of the 288 incidents of intimidation reported, all but twelve were from Protestants who had been threatened from within their own community. Sometimes this was to gain information or to persuade soldiers to join (or remain within) loyalist organisations. The intimidation included: threatening letters and phone calls, abduction, shots fired from <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> and off-duty soldiers being assaulted.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Bergenline Avenue was {{the width}} of a cowpath, and was not {{regarded}} as a business center. Street car tracks were expected to be laid on Palisade Avenue where the Town Hall was located. However, an influential citizen named Henry Kohlmeier, who had just built his residence on Palisade Avenue, did not wish to be disturbed by the noise of the <b>passing</b> <b>cars,</b> and proposed that the tracks be laid on Bergenline Avenue, two blocks to the west, and before those who would have objected to this became aware of this change, the motion was approved.|$|E
25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old {{road that}} led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down <b>passing</b> <b>cars.</b> Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E
500|$|Gritting {{vehicles}} are also dangerous to overtake; as grit is {{scattered across the}} entire roadway, loose pieces can damage the paintwork and windows of <b>passing</b> <b>cars.</b> [...] Loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for motorcycles, {{which can lead to}} skidding, especially around corners.|$|E

500|$|After {{the park}} opened, {{some of the}} bridge's foibles became apparent. [...] The bridge has had to be closed during the winter because {{freezing}} conditions make it unsafe. [...] Since the bridge is over an expressway-like trench of Columbus Drive, shoveling the snow onto <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> {{is not an option}} and the Brazilian hardwood would be damaged by rock salt. The city not only mandates that the bridge be swept and washed daily, but also that the parapets be wiped free of fingerprints.|$|E
500|$|Pleasure Beach Bridge is a riveted Warren through-truss, {{consisting}} of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along the length.

The operator's house {{is located on the}} mainland approach. The bridge spans a length of , by [...] wide, and was rated with an eight-ton limit. Its wooden construction resulted in the timbers creaking and shifting under the weight of <b>passing</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{newspaper}} hypothesised {{that the}} Guinness Book of Records statement {{was based on}} an article in a London newspaper.

[...] It referred to violence statistics and stated that [...] "the white overseers" [...] left the island in 1985 removing most of the island's assets and resources, only allowing a pub to remain. The Sunday Times claimed that up to 30 people live in each house, without sufficient drinking water.|$|E

[...] Should the player reach a goal with a satisfying grade, a romantic ending is displayed.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian {{government}} accompanied UDI with {{emergency measures}} that it said {{were intended to}} prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, import licences were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently Leo Baron, Nkomo's lawyer, whose links with black nationalists and communists were seen by authorities as [...] "subversive". Baron, the younger brother of the scientist Jacob Bronowski, was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.|$|E
500|$|Hastings Banda, {{the leader}} of the Nyasaland {{nationalist}} cause, returned to the territory in 1958 and began organising opposition to the federation. Having lived outside the territory for more than 25 years and having great difficulty remembering his native African language, he required the assistance of interpreters to communicate with the population, whom he stirred into a frenzy with his speeches. After the Governor and the federal government refused to give Africans a majority in the Legislative Council, he embarked on a speaking tour of the territory. In January 1959, he stated in a speech that he [...] "put Salisbury [...] on fire... I got Salisbury rocking, rocking, and got it awake out of its political sleep...", after which his followers stoned <b>passing</b> <b>cars</b> and police officers.|$|E
