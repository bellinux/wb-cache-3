5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boilerâ€“ essentially a <b>portable</b> <b>engine</b> without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>portable</b> <b>engine</b> {{is a type}} of {{self-contained}} {{steam engine}} and boiler combination that may be moved from site to site. Although bearing a strong family resemblance, in both appearance and (stationary) operation, the <b>portable</b> <b>engine</b> is not classed as a traction engine as it is not self-propelled. [...] However, it is included in this list because the traction engine is a direct descendant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traction}} engine, in {{the form}} recognisable today, developed partly from an experiment in 1859 when Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth <b>portable</b> <b>engine,</b> {{which had to be}} hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. [...] The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the crankshaft and the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} to see <b>portable</b> <b>engines</b> working at traction engine rallies and steam festivals.

2500|$|When the Model T was {{designed}} and introduced, the infrastructure {{of the world was}} quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term [...] "pavement" [...] as equivalent with [...] "sidewalk" [...] comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. Power tools were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. Rural electrification and motorized mechanization were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and <b>portable</b> <b>engine</b> as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a flat belt to drive a bucksaw, thresher, silo blower, conveyor for filling corn cribs or haylofts, baler, water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of Fordson Farmer magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.|$|E
60|$|Nothing gave Lapham so much {{satisfaction}} in the whole construction of his house as the pile-driving. When this began, early in the summer, he took Mrs. Lapham every day in his buggy and drove round to look at it; stopping the mare {{in front of the}} lot, and watching the operation with even keener interest than the little loafing Irish boys who superintended it in force. It pleased him to hear the <b>portable</b> <b>engine</b> chuckle out a hundred thin whiffs of steam in carrying the big iron weight {{to the top of the}} framework above the pile, then seem to hesitate, and cough once or twice in pressing the weight against the detaching apparatus. There was a moment in which the weight had the effect of poising before it fell; then it dropped with a mighty whack on the iron-bound head of the pile, and drove it a foot into the earth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Portable</b> <b>engines</b> were {{in common}} use in industrialised {{countries}} {{from the early}} 19th through early 20th centuries, during an era when mechanical power transmission was widespread. Before that, most power generation and transmission were by animal, water, wind, or human; after that, a combination of electrification (including rural electrification) and modern vehicles and equipment (such as tractors, trucks, cars, engine-generators, and machines with their engines built in) displaced most use of <b>portable</b> <b>engines.</b> In developing countries today, <b>portable</b> <b>engines</b> still have some use (typically {{in the form of}} modern small engines mounted on boards), although the technologies mentioned above increasingly limit their demand there as well. In industrialised countries they are no longer used for commercial purposes, but preserved examples can often be seen at steam fairs driving appropriate equipment for demonstration purposes.|$|R

50|$|Stationary or <b>portable</b> <b>engines</b> were commercially {{introduced}} {{early in}} the 1900s. The first commercial production was by the New Way Motor Company of Lansing, Michigan, US. The company produced air-cooled engines in single and twin cylinders in both horizontal and vertical cylinder format. Subsequent to their initial production which was exported worldwide, other companies took up the advantages of this cooling method, especially in small <b>portable</b> <b>engines.</b> Applications include mowers, generators, outboard motors, pump sets, saw benches and auxiliary power plants.|$|R
