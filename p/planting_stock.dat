50|$|The {{improved}} {{appearance of}} the gardens over {{recent years has been}} due to local government projects required as part of a Conservation Management Plan (CMP). The creation of mulched beds around significant trees has improved their condition and large herbaceous beds have been restored using heritage <b>plant</b> <b>stock.</b> The most obvious works include the reconstruction of the western half of the path network along accurately plotted heritage alignments using the original orange-coloured, granitic, sand surface and steel edging. This included the installation of an on-site stormwater dissipation system, which now uses surface runoff to help irrigate lawn areas and minimise water usage. The perimeter hedge around the gardens uses original Lonicera heritage <b>plant</b> <b>stock</b> sourced from Dame Elisabeth Murdoch's 'Cruden Farm.' This hedge will grow to a height of approximately 700mm. The CMP and further detailed historical investigations have led to the design of entry treatments for each of the entrances to the Gardens.

Reconstruction of the entry treatments in the western half of the Gardens commenced earlier this year.

5000|$|The PSPP is {{impossible}} to estimate reliably by eye because outward appearance, especially of stock withdrawn from refrigerated storage, can deceive even experienced foresters, who would be offended if their ability were questioned to recognize good <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> when they saw it. Prior to Wakeley's (1954) demonstration {{of the importance of}} the physiological state of <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> in determining the ability of the stock to perform after outplanting, and to a considerable extent even afterwards, morphological appearance has generally served as the basis for estimating the quality of <b>planting</b> <b>stock.</b> Gradually, however, a realization developed that more was involved. Tucker et al. (1968), for instance, after assessing 10-year survival data from several experimental white spruce plantations in Manitoba noted that [...] "Perhaps the most important point revealed here is that certain lots of transplants performed better than others", even though all transplants were handled and planted with care. The intuitive [...] "stock that looks good must be good" [...] is a persuasive, but potentially dangerous maxim. That greatest of teachers, Bitter Experience, has often enough demonstrated the fallibility of such assessment, even though the corollary [...] "stock that looks bad must be bad" [...] is likely to be well founded. The physiological qualities of <b>planting</b> <b>stock</b> are hidden from the eye and must be revealed by testing.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{current and}} {{potential}} deployment strategies using stecldings of Pinus radiata. The investigations {{showed that the}} growth of stecldings at 9 months of age {{was influenced by the}} age of the <b>stock</b> <b>plant</b> from which they were propagated, the genotype, an interaction between these two effects, and <b>stock</b> <b>plant</b> source. <b>Stock</b> <b>plants</b> raised from seed showed the fastest growth rates and produced cuttings that also showed the fastest growth rates. Growth of stecldings declined with increasing <b>stock</b> <b>plant</b> age (2 to 5 years). It was also shown for most traits that estimates of genetic variance and heritabilities were similar for seedlings and stecldings propagated from 2 year-old <b>stock</b> <b>plants,</b> with very high genetic correlations between these propagule types. However inflated estimates of genetic variance and heritability were found for two out of three traits measured in stecklings propagated from 6 year-old <b>stock</b> <b>plants.</b> This was attributed to either dominance effects or propagation effects common to a fullsib family, C-effects. Also poor correspondence between the performances of seedlings and stecklings propagated from 6 year-old <b>stock</b> <b>plants</b> was found for one trait. Deployment of families as stecklings based on the performances of seedlings is viable for cuttings that come from young <b>stock</b> <b>plants</b> (up to 2 years of age). By comparison, the use of stecklings from older <b>stock</b> <b>plants</b> may bias the estimates of genetic merit in P. radiata and result in yields which differ from those expected from breeding programs. Age-age correlations were highest when comparing traits measured at later ages, between 6 and 11 years of age, rather than between 9 months and 6 years of age and 9 months and 11 years of age. It could not be shown whether selection of superior families can be carried out at an earlier age than is currently employed. The study also indicates that the deployment strategy for P. radiata which will provide the grower the highest potential economic benefit is clonal forestry. Two modelled scenarios predicted genetic gains of a clonal forestry deployment strategy to be at least 50...|$|R
