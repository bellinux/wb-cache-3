5|$|A young white-bellied sea eagle in {{its first}} year is {{predominantly}} brown, with pale cream-streaked <b>plumage</b> on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The <b>plumage</b> becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult <b>plumage</b> by the fourth or fifth year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.|$|E
5|$|During another {{courtship}} {{display the}} male bows deeply forward facing the female, reaching {{the ground with}} his bill and spreading and flattening his <b>plumage</b> in a near-horizontal plane for up to 20seconds. In this pose, the white <b>plumage</b> forms a striking white band across his darker <b>plumage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white <b>plumage</b> during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial <b>plumage,</b> where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial <b>plumage.</b> The breeding males' blue <b>plumage,</b> particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue <b>plumage</b> also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} <b>plumage.</b> There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish <b>plumage,</b> larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white <b>plumage</b> in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The smaller white-winged chough {{has similar}} <b>plumage</b> but has red eyes and is found {{mainly on the}} ground. Australian crow and raven species have white eyes and lack the white rump, and the similar-sized Australian magpie has red eyes and {{prominent}} black and white <b>plumage.</b> The larger grey currawong is readily distinguished by its lighter grey overall <b>plumage</b> and lack of white feathers {{at the base of}} the tail. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies melanoptera of the grey) does have a darker <b>plumage</b> than other grey subspecies, but its wings lack the white primaries of the pied currawong.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} {{as to how}} the three races of white-winged fairywren could have evolved. The first suggests that black-and-white <b>plumage</b> is an ancestral condition and, following separation of the three populations, blue-and-white <b>plumage</b> evolved in the mainland species. The second hypothesis suggests that black-and-white <b>plumage</b> evolved convergently on the two separate islands. The third suggests that black-and-white <b>plumage</b> evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue <b>plumage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} recognisable, the Australian magpie is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and <b>plumage,</b> but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white <b>plumage.</b> Currawong species have predominantly dark <b>plumage</b> and heavier bills.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use <b>plumage</b> {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in <b>plumage</b> also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their <b>plumage</b> with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their <b>plumage</b> with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the <b>plumage.</b>|$|E

50|$|Adult {{females of}} both species are entirely green above (except for a gray and white tail in nigrolutea) and yellow (dull in winter, {{brighter}} in spring) below. The juvenal and first-winter <b>plumages</b> in both sexes of both species {{are similar to}} their adult female <b>plumages.</b> First-year birds are best recognized by the possession of more pointed and somewhat narrower tail feathers.|$|R
5|$|Juvenile terns {{typically}} have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges {{that give the}} <b>plumage</b> a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the <b>plumage</b> then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature <b>plumage</b> is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter <b>plumage,</b> typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding <b>plumage</b> of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding <b>plumage</b> has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black <b>plumage.</b> All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding <b>plumage</b> the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial <b>plumage</b> initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding <b>plumage</b> in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding <b>plumage</b> of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding <b>plumage</b> the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish <b>plumage</b> that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding <b>plumage.</b> They moult again into nuptial <b>plumage</b> in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue <b>plumage,</b> particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue <b>plumage</b> also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on Kangaroo Island, {{and has been}} separated from the mainland subspecies for around 9000 years. Birds of this subspecies are larger, have narrower bills and darker <b>plumage</b> than birds on nearby mainland South Australia. Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in <b>plumage</b> than mainland birds.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of the wings and back. Juveniles have a duller, less streaked appearance than adults. Juveniles moult into adult <b>plumage</b> at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the <b>plumage</b> of breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The <b>plumage</b> of {{juvenile}} birds {{in their first}} moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first immature <b>plumage,</b> and more closely resemble the adult female. The breasts of male birds may have some orange feathers. Birds in their second year moult into a second immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown <b>plumage.</b> Determining the age and sex of birds in brown <b>plumage</b> can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E
