His career as ruler vindicates the wisdom of that wise but unwritten provision of the American Constitution by which there is a limit to the tenure of this office. Continued rule for half a generation must turn a man into an autocrat. The old <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> himself, in his homely but shrewd way, that when one gets a good ox to lead the team it is a pity to change him. If a good ox, however, is left to choose his own direction without guidance, he may draw his wagon into trouble.|$|E

We got to the point in the season when Meredith said, “I can live without you, but I don’t want to,” which for any woman is a very powerful statement.

40|$|It {{has long}} been my belief that the greatness of America has risen in large part out of the {{diversity}} of her peoples. Before the war, peoples of Japanese ancestry were a small but valuable element in our population. Their record of law-abiding, industrious citizenship was surpassed by no other group. Their contributions to the arts, agriculture, and science were indisputable evidence that the majority of them believed in America and were growing with America. Then war came with the nation of their parental origin, The ensuing {{two and a half years}} have brought heartaches to many in our population. Among the casualties of war has been America’s Japanese minority. It is my hope that the wounds which it has received in the great uprooting will heal. It is my prayer that other Americans will fully realize that to condone the whittling away of the rights of any one minority group is to pave the way for us all to lose the guarantees of the Constitution.
