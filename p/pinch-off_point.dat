This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E

50|$|To {{understand}} the effect, first {{the notion of}} pinch-off of the channel is introduced. The channel is formed by attraction of carriers to the gate, and the current drawn through the channel is nearly a constant independent of drain voltage in saturation mode. However, near the drain, the gate and drain jointly determine the electric field pattern. Instead of flowing in a channel, beyond the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> the carriers flow in a subsurface pattern made possible because the drain and the gate both control the current. In the figure at the right, the channel is indicated by a dashed line and becomes weaker as the drain is approached, leaving a gap of uninverted silicon {{between the end of}} the formed inversion layer and the drain (the pinch-off region).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{pinch off}} of {{heterogeneous}} ferrofluid drops at a nozzle in air was experimentally investigated with {{a magnetic field}} (downward or upward) and without a magnetic field. Compared to homogeneous drops, the self-similarity and universal scaling law were verified through modifying the initial conditions, such as the nozzle diameter, flow rate, and magnitude {{and direction of the}} magnetic fields. Two <b>pinch-off</b> <b>points</b> were observed, and the two consecutive pinch-off dynamics were characterized through scaling laws. Here our scaling exponent remains within the scope of (0. 70 - 0. 80) for the primary whereas it remains within the scope of (0. 60 - 0. 70) for the secondary pinch off, respectively, comparable to the classic range from 2 / 3 to 1 for homogeneous drops. The gravity-compensating and gravity-superimposing magnetic fields display a negligible effect on the exponent but determine the sequence of double pinch offs. The universal character of the self-similar pinch off is extended to a heterogeneous fluid...|$|R
40|$|The hydrodynamics {{associated}} with water-entry of spheres {{can be highly}} variable {{with respect to the}} material and kinematic properties of the sphere. This series of five fluid dynamics videos illustrates several subtle but interesting variations that can be seen. The first series of videos contrasts the nature of impact (F r = Uo / √ gd = 5. 15) between a hydrophilic (wetting angle of α = 60 ◦) and hydrophobic sphere (α = 120 ◦), and illustrates how surface coating can affect whether or not an air cavity is formed; the views from the side and from above are synchronized in time. The second video series illustrates how spin and surface treatments can alter the splash and cavity formation following water entry. The spinning sphere (S = ωr/Uo = 1. 7; F r = 5. 15) causes a wedge of fluid to be drawn into the cavity due to the no-slip condition and follows a curved trajectory. The non-spinning sphere (F r = 5. 15) has two distinct surface treatments on the left and right hemispheres: the left hemisphere is hydrophobic (α = 120 ◦) and the right hemisphere is hydrophilic (α = 60 ◦). Interestingly, the cavity formation for the half-and-half sphere has many similarities to that of the spinning sphere especially when viewed from above. The third video series compares two millimetric nylon spheres impacting at slightly different impact speeds (Uo = 40 cm/s and Uo = 45 cm/s); the faster sphere fully penetrates the free surface, forming a cavity, whereas the slower sphere does not. The fourth series shows the instability of an elongated water-entry cavity formed by a millimetric steel sphere with a hydrophobic coating impacting at Uo = 600 cm/s.

40|$|Charge carrier {{concentration}} in operating organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) reflects the electric potential within the channel, {{acting as a}} key quantity to clarify the operation mechanism of the device. Here, we demonstrate a direct determination of charge {{carrier concentration}} in the operating devices of pentacene and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) by field-induced electron spin resonance (FI-ESR) spectroscopy. This method sensitively detects polarons induced by applying gate voltage, giving a clear FI-ESR signal around g= 2. 003 in both devices. Upon applying drain-source voltage, carrier concentration decreases monotonically in the FET linear region, reaching about 70 % of the initial value at the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point,</b> and stayed constant in the saturation region. The observed results are reproduced well from the theoretical potential profile based on the gradual channel model. In particular, the carrier concentration at the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> is calculated to be β/(β+ 1) of the initial value, where β is the power exponent in the gate voltage (Vgs) dependence of the mobility (μ), expressed as μ∝Vgsβ− 2, providing detailed information of charge transport. The present devices show β= 2. 6 for the pentacene and β= 2. 3 for the P 3 HT cases, consistent with those determined by transfer characteristics. The gate voltage dependence of the mobility, originating from the charge trapping at the device interface, is confirmed microscopically by the motional narrowing of the FI-ESR spectra...|$|E
40|$|Charge carrier {{concentration}} in operating field-effect transistor (FET) of regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) has been directly determined by {{electron spin resonance}} (ESR). ESR signals of field-induced polarons are observed around g= 2. 003 under the application of negative gate-source voltage (Vgs). Upon applying drain-source voltage (Vds), ESR intensity decreases linearly in the low Vds region, reaching to about 50 % of the initial intensity at the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> (Vds~=Vgs). For larger absolute values of Vds, it becomes nearly Vds independent.

40|$|We report non-saturating linear {{magnetoresistance}} (MR) in {{a two-dimensional}} electron system (2 DES) at a GaAs/AlGaAs heterointerface in the strongly insulating regime. We achieve this by driving the gate voltage below the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> {{of the device}} and operating it in the non-equilibrium regime with high source-drain bias. Remarkably, the magnitude of MR is as large as 500 % per Tesla with respect to resistance at zero magnetic field, thus dwarfing most non-magnetic materials which exhibit this linearity. Its primary advantage over most other materials is that both linearity and the enormous magnitude are retained over a broad temperature range (0. 3 K to 10 K), thus making it an attractive candidate for cryogenic sensor applications...|$|E

40|$|When a ball is {{dropped in}} fine very loose sand, a splash and {{subsequently}} a jet are observed above the bed, {{followed by a}} granular eruption. To directly and quantitatively determine what happens inside the sand bed, high-speed X-ray tomography measurements are carried out in a custom-made set-up that allows for imaging of a large sand bed at atmospheric pressures. Herewith, we show that the jet originates from the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> created {{by the collapse of}} the air cavity formed behind the penetrating ball. Subsequently, we measure how the entrapped air bubble rises through the sand, and show that this is consistent with bubbles rising in continuously fluidized beds. Finally, we measure the packing fraction variation throughout the bed. From this we show that there is (i) a compressed area of sand in front of and next to the ball while the ball is moving down, (ii) a strongly compacted region at the pinch-off height after the cavity collapse and (iii) a relatively loosely packed centre {{in the wake of the}} rising bubble...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Carrier {{trapping}} via tunneling {{into the}} gate oxide was implemented into a partial differential equation-based semicon-ductor device simulator to analyze the-like noise in silicon MOSFETs. Local noise sources are calculated using the carrier tunneling rates between trap {{centers in the}} oxide and those at the interface. Using the Green’s transfer function approach, noise con-tributions from each node in the oxide mesh to the overall noise at the specified contact terminals are simulated. Unlike traditional noise analyses in MOSFETs, the simulator is capable of simu-lating noise {{for a wide range}} of bias voltages and device structures. The simulation results show that for an uniformly doped channel, the region in the oxide above the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> in saturation is most critical for low frequency noise generation while for a graded channel device the source side of the gate oxide region becomes im-portant. By comparing the simulation results with the measured noise data, the oxide defect density in the noise producing regions can be profiled.

40|$|This fluid {{dynamics}} video shows {{the impact of}} a hydrophobic sphere impacting a water surface. The sphere has a mass ratio of m ∗ = ρs/ρw = 1. 15, a wetting angle of α = 110 ◦, a diameter of 9. 5 mm, and impacts the surface with a Froude number of F r = Uo / √ gd = 9. 2. The first sequence shows an impact of a sphere on the free surface illustrating the formation of the splash crown and air cavity. The cavity grows both in the axial and radial direction until it eventually collapses at a point roughly half of the distance from the free surface to the sphere, which is known as the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point.</b> The second set of videos shows a sphere impacting the free surface under the same conditions using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the flow field.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} drop {{detachment}} from a capillary tip and formation of satellite droplets is studied for solutions of trisiloxane surfactants above the critical aggregation concentration. Two of the studied surfactants self-assemble in bilayer based phases, whereas the third forms micelles. The {{difference in the}} aggregates formed results in an essential difference {{in the rate of}} equilibration between the surface and the bulk solution and in a different behaviour near the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point.</b> The difference in behaviour becomes pronounced when the viscosity of solutions increases 2 – 6 times (and therefore diffusion coefficients decrease correspondingly). In particular, when surfactant solutions are prepared in a water/glycerol mixture with a viscosity six times larger than water, the size of satellite droplets formed by the micellar solutions increases more than twice, whereas the size of droplets formed by the bilayer-forming solutions remains almost constant over a range of concentration covering two orders of magnitude. The bilayers forming solutions demonstrate a decrease in the effective surface tension near to pinch-off which can be related to the Marangoni stresses generated by surface flow during the thinning of the capillary bridge connecting the main drop with the liquid in the capillary...|$|E
30|$|For {{increasing}} the generating rate further, a Y-junction splitting unit is proposed which {{can serve as}} an additional splitting unit alongside the L-junction reservoir {{which can be used}} to split the droplets further after they have been generated in L-junction reservoir to double the generating rate or it can act as a stand-alone droplet splitter when symmetric and faster droplet splitting is needed. In a Y-junction splitter, a unit droplet is first transported via an array of slender electrodes and placed on linear section ‘L 1 ’. It is followed by a second section ‘A’ which is composed of a set of angular electrodes. Section ‘A’ is then branched into two linear sections, ‘L 2 ’ and ‘L 3 ’ which are apart from each other at an angle of 2 θ. As shown in Fig.  1 e, faded red areas show the regions filled with liquid just before the pinch off. When electrowetting force is applied on them in the direction indicated by yellow arrows, the neck which is nothing but the thin liquid bridge between the two sections (L 2 and L 3), moves to the right along x-axis. Gradually, the radii of curvature of menisci NL and NR would keep decreasing while decreasing the corresponding Laplace pressure drops until the breakup happens. This is a slightly modified version of the ideal splitting technique described earlier. This splitting mechanism would ensure equal splitting, as well as consistency in the location of the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point.</b> Also, use of the slender electrodes makes the splitting much faster [35] than the conventional splitting technique as described in Fig.  1 b.|$|E
40|$|MOSFET {{degradation}} due to {{hot carrier}} injection {{is the most}} important reliability issue in realizing submicron ultra-large scaled integrated circuits. This degradation has been widely studied and lifetime simulators have also been developed for digital circuit operation [1]-[2]. On the other hand, the degradation of analog device parameters such as drain conductance due to hot carrier injection are not clearly understood and modeled. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a physical model of analog drain conductance, gd degradation based on mobility reduction due to hot carrier generated interface states and show a reliability design guideline for analog devices. Fig. 1 shows gain degradation of a single MOSFET amplifier with a constant current source (Fig. 2) as a function of DC stress time. Since the gain of the amplifier is given by gain=g,/&, gm and were also measured and dg,=lg,-g,l and dgd=lgd 0 -gdl were plotted in Fig. 1. It has been found that the main cause of the gain degradation was gd degradation rather than &n degradation. Our model of gd degradation is based on the gradual channel approximation (GCA) and mobility reduction due to interface states generated by hot carrier injection [3]. When distribution of interface states generated by hot carrier injection is assumed to be a step function over the damaged region, the generated interface state density, Nits, is given by [4] where Le 8 is the effective gate length, L h g the length of the damaged region and a the mobility reduction factor. In the saturation region, a depletion region is formed between the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> and the drain as shown in Fig. 3. The drain current equation in the saturation region is given b...|$|E
40|$|Cavity {{formation}} {{resulting from}} the water-entry of solid objects {{has been the subject}} of extensive research owing to its practical relevance in naval, military, industrial, sports and biological applications. The cavity formed by an impacting hydrophobic sphere normally seals at two places, one below (deep seal) and the other above the water surface (surface seal). For Froude numbers, the air flow into the resulting cavity is strong enough to suck the splash crown above the surface and disrupt the cavity dynamics before it deep seals. In this research work we eliminate surface seals by means of a novel practice of using cone splash-guards and examine the undisturbed transient cavity dynamics by impact of hydrophobic spheres for Froude numbers ranging. This enabled the measurement of extremely accurate pinch-off heights, pinch-off times, radial cavity collapse rates, and jet speeds in an extended range of Froude numbers compared to the previous work of Duclaux et al. (2007). Results in the extended regime were in remarkable agreement with the theoretical prediction of scaled pinch-off depth, and experimentally derived pinch-off time for. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of confinement on cavity formation by varying the cross-sectional area of the tank of liquid. In conjunction with surface seal elimination we observed the formation of multiple pinch-off points where a maximum of four deep seals were obtained in a sequential order for the Froude number range investigated. The presence of an elongated cavity beneath the first <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> 5 resulted in evident "kinks" primarily related to the greatly diminished air pressure at the necking region caused by supersonic air flows (Gekle et al. 2010). Such flows passing through second pinch-offs were also found to choke the cavities beneath the first pinch- off depths causing radial expansion and hence disappearance of downward jets...|$|E
30|$|This ideal {{splitting}} method is introduced in our proposed reservoir design {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 d. First a column L 1 is filled by liquid pulled from the filling section of the reservoir. Next, liquid is further transported across arc section A and placed on second linear section L 2. Both L 1, L 2 are divided into slender (instead of square) electrode segments. Arc A is also composed of four sectors. All of these segments can be individually addressed. Note that, A is not filled with liquid and only used to carry liquid to L 2. Since L 1 and L 2 create a right angle, liquid on those two sections touch each other diagonally just before pinch-off, {{which is similar to}} that in Fig.  1 c. Later, liquid column L 1 is held in place by activating all of the electrodes while pulling force is applied on the liquid on L 2 from left. Without generating any elongated tail, pinch-off happens very close to the junction point of L 1 and L 2. Like the ideal splitting scheme already discussed and shown in Fig.  1 c, the tail formed after pinch-off is expected to be very tiny in this case and therefore dispensed volume should be very accurate. Also, because the liquid column L 1 is fixed, the volume in the filling section is not likely to affect the meniscus formation in the neck and thus will not affect location of the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point.</b> The use of the slender electrodes in L 1 and L 2 serves two additional purposes: first, it controls the deformation thus making sure that the necking will happen very close to the L 1 –L 2 junction and second, it speeds up the process by enhancing the transport velocity of liquid [35]. Due to the latter advantage, this reservoir design would also give higher droplet generating rate as well.|$|E
40|$|We report {{results from}} an {{experimental}} study of cavity formation during the impact of superhydrophobic spheres onto water. Using a simple splash-guard mechanism, we block the spray emerging during initial contact from closing thus eliminating the phenomenon known as 'surface seal', which typically occurs at Froude numbers Fr= V 0 2 /(gR 0) = O(100). As such, {{we are able to}} observe the evolution of a smooth cavity in a more extended parameter space than has been achieved in previous studies. Furthermore, by systematically varying the tank size and sphere diameter, we examine the influence of increasing wall effects on these guarded impact cavities and note the formation of surface undulations with wavelength λ =O(10) cm and acoustic waves λa=O(D 0) along the cavity interface, which produce multiple pinch-off points. Acoustic waves are initiated by pressure perturbations, which themselves are generated by the primary cavity pinch-off. Using high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques we study the bulk fluid flow for the most constrained geometry and show the larger undulations (λ =O (10 cm)) have a fixed nature with respect to the lab frame. We show that previously deduced scalings for the normalized (primary) pinch-off location (ratio of pinch-off depth to sphere depth at pinch-off time), Hp/H = 1 / 2, and pinch-off time, τ α (R 0 /g) 1 / 2, do not hold for these extended cavities in the presence of strong wall effects (sphere-to-tank diameter ratio), ε = D 0 /Dtank 1 / 16. Instead, we find multiple distinct regimes for values of Hp/H as the observed undulations are induced above the first <b>pinch-off</b> <b>point</b> as the impact speed increases. We also report observations of 'kinked' pinch-off points and the suppression of downward facing jets in the presence of wall effects. Surprisingly, upward facing jets emanating from first cavity pinch-off points evolve into a 'flat' structure at high impact speeds, both in the presence and absence of wall effects. © 2014 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
