The type was already familiar to Mississippi State University, as it had used one to test ducted propellers. Initially, a simple conversion, to be designated MA-18, was planned, but it was later decided to make the test bed more closely resemble the final full-scale aircraft, with the resultant changes causing re-designation to MA-18A. It was later named [...] "Marvelette", and received the military serial number 62-12147 and the US Army designation XAZ-1.|$|R

The development of fluorescent markers in parallel with super-resolution imaging systems has <b>pushed</b> <b>light</b> microscopy into the realm of molecular visualization at the nanometer scale. Resolutions previously only attained with electron microscopes are now within the grasp of light microscopes. However, until recently, live-cell imaging approaches have eluded super-resolution microscopy, hampering it from reaching its full potential for revealing the dynamic interactions in biology occurring at the single molecule level. Here we examine recent advances in the super-resolution imaging of living cells by reviewing recent breakthroughs in single molecule localization microscopy methods such as PALM and STORM to achieve this important goal.

40|$|International audienceVisual formats have {{advanced}} beyond single-view images and videos: 3 D movies are commonplace, researchers have developed multi-view navigation systems, and VR {{is helping to}} <b>push</b> <b>light</b> field cameras to mass market. However, editing tools for these media are still nascent, and even simple filtering operations like color correction or stylization are problematic: naively applying image filters per frame or per view rarely produces satisfying results due to time and space inconsistencies. Our method preserves and stabilizes filter effects while being agnostic to the inner working of the filter. It captures filter effects in the gradient domain, then uses input frame gradients as a reference to impose temporal and spatial consistency. Our least-squares formulation adds minimal overhead compared to naive data processing. Further, when filter cost is high, we introduce a filter transfer strategy that reduces the number of per-frame filtering computations by an order of magnitude, with only a small reduction in visual quality. We demonstrate our algorithm on several camera array formats including stereo videos, light fields, and wide baselines...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} efforts {{characterizing the}} era of precision neutrino physics revolve around collecting high-statistics neutrino samples and attaining an excellent energy and position resolution.

In this paper, the authors introduce a novel concept called Occulting Light Concentrators (OLC), whereby a traditional LC gets tailored to a conventional PMT, by taking into account its single-photoelectron collection efficiency profile and thus occulting the worst performing portion of the photocathode. Thus, the OLC shape optimization takes into account not only the optical interface of the PMT, but also the maximization of the PMT detection performances. The light collection uniformity across the detector is another advantage of the OLC system. By considering the case of JUNO, we will show OLC capabilities in terms of light collection and energy resolution...|$|R

Physical Review A, 95 (4), 8. doi: 10. 1103 /PhysRevA. 95. 043407 Recent progress in high-order harmonic generation with few-cycle mid-infrared wavelength lasers has <b>pushed</b> <b>light</b> pulses into the water-window region and beyond. These pulses have the bandwidth to support single attosecond pulses down to a few tens of attoseconds. However, the present available techniques for attosecond pulse measurement are not applicable to such pulses. Here we report a phase-retrieval method using the standard photoelectron streaking technique where an attosecond pulse is converted into its electron replica through photoionization of atoms {{in the presence of}} a time-delayed infrared laser. The iterative algorithm allows accurate reconstruction of the spectral phase of light pulses, from the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) to soft x-rays, with pulse durations from hundreds down to a few tens of attoseconds. At the same time, the streaking laser fields, including short pulses that span a few octaves, can also be accurately retrieved. Such well-characterized single attosecond pulses in the XUV to the soft-x-ray region are required for time-resolved probing of inner-shell electronic dynamics of matter at their own timescale of a few tens of attoseconds...|$|R
