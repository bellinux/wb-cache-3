25|$|When making {{decisions}} about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness {{to pay for the}} cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for the benefits of full-service.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{has been}} imitated by {{artificial}} materials {{for hundreds of}} years; advances in technology have seen the development of increasingly better simulants with properties ever nearer those of diamond. Although most of these simulants were characteristic of a certain time period, their large production volumes ensured that all continue to be encountered with varying frequency in jewelry of the present. Nearly all were first conceived for intended use in high technology, such as active laser mediums, varistors, and bubble memory. Due to their limited present supply, collectors may <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for the older types.|$|E
25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds {{are referred to as}} callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium,</b> the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished house could not be valued for probate duty. A vacant site was attractive to property developers, who would <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|E
25|$|Under the Presidency of Carlos Flores, decrees No. 85-98 and 267-98 were {{approved}} in 1998 by the Honduras Congress {{with the aim}} of promoting the development of renewable energy-generating plants. The new legislation includes tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer arrangement for energy at prices equivalent to the system’s short-term marginal cost. ENEE, which is the default buyer, must <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> (10 percent of the same short-run marginal cost) for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50 MW. This framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public-private partnerships with ENEE for small renewable energy plants. In addition, Decree No. 85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers: import and sales taxes on equipment, and a five-year income tax holiday.|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|HBO on Demand is the channel's {{subscription}} video-on-demand service; {{launched on}} July 1, 2001 on Time Warner Cable's Columbia, South Carolina system, {{it was the}} first subscription VOD service offered by a premium channel in the United States. HBO on Demand offers a selection of movies, original series and specials previously seen on the network. The service is provided at no additional cost to HBO subscribers, who already regularly <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> fee to cable and satellite providers to receive access to the channel. HBO launched the VOD service in an effort to allow subscribers access to the channel's programming on their own schedules, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers were unable to find a program they would like to watch as well as limiting cancellations to the service for that same reason. HBO on Demand features a rotating selection of films, specials and series, with select new titles added each Friday alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.|$|E

500|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{released}} the new cents {{to the public}} on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… we had on hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for the rarer dates.|$|E
500|$|Clydesdales {{are usually}} bay in colour, but a roaning pattern, black, grey, and {{chestnut}} also occur. Most have white markings, including {{white on the}} face, feet, legs and occasional body spotting (generally on the lower belly). [...] They also have extensive feathering on their lower legs. [...] Roaning, body spotting and extensive white markings {{are thought to be}} the result of sabino genetics. Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body. To attempt getting the ideal set of markings, they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies. On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings. Clydesdales do not have the SB1 (Sabino 1) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns. Many buyers <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings. Roan horses are not preferred by buyers, despite one draught-breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture. Breed associations, however, state that no colours are bad, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.|$|E
