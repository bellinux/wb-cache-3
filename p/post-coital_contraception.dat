40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized {{study was}} conducted at the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong to compare {{the efficacy of the}} Yuzpe regimen and levonorgestrel (0. 75 mg for two doses 12 h apart) in <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception.</b> A total of 424 subjects were recruited into the Yuzpe group and 410 subjects into the levonorgestrel group; 77 subjects in the Yuzpe group and 79 subjects in the levonorgestrel group had further acts of intercourse during the treatment cycle. Fifteen pregnancies (3. 5 %) occurred in the Yuzpe group and 12 pregnancies (2. 9 %) in the levonorgestrel group. After excluding the patients who had further acts of intercourse, the failure rates in the Yuzpe group and the levonorgestrel group were 2. 6 and 2. 4 % respectively. The incidence of nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the Yuzpe group was significantly higher than those in the levonorgestrel group. We conclude that levonorgestrel is an effective drug for <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> with a lower incidence of side-effects than the Yuzpe regimen. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A GP {{friend of}} mine {{recently}} asked for some advice regarding a 13 year old girl {{who had come to}} her asking for <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> following intercourse with a 17 year old male she'd met at a party the previous night. My colleague deemed that the girl was competent to understand what she had done and the implications of any choices she made. The young girl was clear that the intercourse was consensual, but that she now regretted it and wanted nothing {{more to do with the}} young man. She did not want it to go any further, and would not give his name...|$|E
40|$|The {{past several}} years have seen an {{increasing}} number of pharmacists refuse to dispense emergency <b>contraception,</b> an effective, <b>post-coital</b> form of <b>contraception,</b> {{on the grounds that the}} drug violates their personal beliefs. This Article addresses the impact of those pharmacist refusals under existing principles of tort law. The Article draws on existing pharmacy case law, state-specific refusal clauses, and ethics statements promulgated by professional pharmacy associations to investigate whether pharmacists have a legal duty to dispense emergency contraception, notwithstanding religious or ethical objections. Concluding that in most states, such a legal duty does exist, the Article develops a “wrongful conception” theory of tort liability for refusing pharmacists and argues that by refusing to dispense emergency contraception, pharmacists subject themselves and their employers to potential civil liability, including significant compensatory and punitive damages...|$|R
40|$|Emergency <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> (EC) is an {{effective}} method of preventing pregnancy when used appropriately. EC has been available since the 1970 s, and its availability and use have become widespread. Options for EC are broad and include the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and emergency contraceptive pills such as levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, combined oral contraceptive pills (Yuzpe method), and less commonly, mifepristone. Some options are available over-the-counter, while others require provider prescription or placement. There are no absolute contraindications {{to the use of}} emergency contraceptive pills, with the exception of ulipristal acetate and mifepristone. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, efficacy, safety, side effects, clinical considerations, and patient preferences with respect to EC usage. The decision of which regimen to use is influenced by local availability, cost, and patient preference...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of medical means of inducing abortion requires a detailed {{knowledge of the}} abortion legislation. It is vital that these compounds are developed and used within the legal constraints of the country involved. In the United Kingdom, despite the Act of Union (1707), England and Scotland have not united under one legal system. In England the common law on abortion was superseded by the Offences Against the Persons Act (1861) which declared abortion illegal. This Act {{does not apply to}} Scotland where, up until 1967, common law applied. The Abortion Act of 1967 is an exemption act allowing abortion, under certain restrictions, to be legally performed. Whilst <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> is not covered by any of the abortion legislation, it is clear that contragestion and medical abortion is restricted by the current abortion legislation, hence medication will need to be take...|$|E
40|$|RU 486 is {{the first}} antiprogesterone to be used clinically. It {{inhibits}} {{the action of the}} hormone at the receptor level in target tissues. Its action is particularly significant in the endo-metrium where it prevents the initiation and progression of pregnancy in the first weeks (contragestive effect). The data indicate that the compound can be used for: (i) voluntary in-terruption of pregnancy between 6 and 10 weeks; (ii) induc-tion of menstruation during the fifth week of amenorrhoea, and (iii) <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception.</b> Current trials include its use as a once-a-month menses inducer. It can also be utilized for therapeutic interruption at a late stage of pregnancy, and tried as adjuvant treatment in some cases of breast cancer. The data on RU 486 have been obtained through studies in physio-pharmacological endocrinology and biochemistry. The development of this antihormone represents a concerted research link between biology and medicine...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{contraception}} (EC), {{also known}} as 'the morning after pill', or <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception,</b> is a modality of preventing {{the establishment of a}} pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. Both a hormonal and an intrauterine form are available. Modern hormonal EC, with low side effects, was first proposed by Yuzpe in 1974. More recently, a new regimen, consisting of levonorgestrel administered alone, was introduced and found in clinical trials to be more effective (if taken as early as possible), and associated with less side effects than the Yuzpe regimen, which it has gradually replaced. The WHO developed another regimen based {{on the use of the}} selective progesterone receptor modulator (antiprogestin) mifepristone and conducted trials with different dosages. Intrauterine EC was first proposed by Lippes in 1976. It has the advantage of being applicable for almost a week and the disadvantage of a greater complexity. In addition, this modality is solely interceptive, acting by preventing implantation. Pregnancy rates reported following EC using an intrauterine device with more than 300 mm 2 of copper are consistently low (0. 1 - 0. 2 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} pilot evaluation of a peer-produced video, produced for use as part of North Staffordshire’s Personal and Social Education school programme. A number of studies {{carried out in the}} area, including a recent audit into <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> in the under 20 s, 1 have shown that young people {{need to know how to}} access contraceptive services. Background surveys also suggest that young people need to be aware of the wider issues implicit in contraception. The impetus for the video came from the Advice Centres for the under Twenties (ACT) Working Party, who produced the video together with Staffordshire University’s Media Studies Department and a local high school drama group. The video was intended for use in schools, and was designed to be complimentary to an updated and standardised teaching pack, which was already in preparation. The pilot study showed the video to be beneficial as a stand-alone intervention, principally to promote active discussion on topics that might otherwise be difficult to approach. A comparison of responses before and after the educational session demonstrated an improvement in knowledge in most areas. Further objective evaluation of the combined video and teaching pack is now necessary. Key words peer-led, sex education, teenage pregnancy, vide...|$|E
30|$|The Ve.R.S.O. project {{started in}} October 2006 at the Policlinico University Hospital of Palermo, by the Department of Legal Medicine in {{collaboration}} with the Departments of Emergency Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Surgery, Paediatrics and in cooperation with social agencies and legal authorities. Guidelines have been elaborated for standard practice in treating the victims in different languages (Italian, French, English and Arabic), a model of informed consent, interdisciplinary medical record and a standardized model of medical legal report. Since October 2006, the new standardized protocol has been adopted in the management of all rape/sexual assault victims. Patients are divided into groups in relation to: gender, age, place of SA, number and type of assailant, nature of sexual assault, presence/absence of physical or genital injuries. SA patients present to Accident & Emergency (A&E) in confusion, emotional distress and often without support. They are received in a private room and remain in their clothing, asked not to urinate, defecate, drink/eat or smoke prior to forensic examination, which takes place as soon as possible after the assault. First of all, it is necessary to obtain a history from the patient who has undergone SA and obtain the patient’s consent during each step of the medical investigation ({{in the case of a}} minor, the history is collected with possible psychological support). Informed consent (specially designed for the purpose) informs the patient about benefits, risks and alternatives of medical evaluation and treatment (informed consent is not necessary in the case of a minor, according to Italian law on the subject of sexual abuse, as the offense is prosecutable ex officio). Consent also include reporting the crime to appropriate agencies, photodocumentation, evidentiary examination, pregnancy testing, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosis and possible prophylaxis and emergency contraception. The following data are recorded in adopted standardized medico-legal report: various demographic information, circumstances surrounding the sexual assault (date, place, aggressor’s identity when known, frequency of the assaults if repeated), type of assault (non-penetration assault, penetration, use of physical force), impaired consciousness at the time of assault, suspicion of drug-facilitated sexual assault, general physical examination, toxicology samples taken (blood, urine). Medical forensic history guides the evidentiary exam and is substantiated by the evidence collected. The risk of STD, including HIV and hepatitis, is discussed with every victim. Prophylactic treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and emergency contraception are not routine preventative therapy after a SA: the decision should be made on an individual basis. With regard to contraception, hormonal <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception</b> and insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device are available.|$|E
40|$|Background: Given {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of HIV infection {{in this country}} today {{it is not difficult to}} observe the risk faced by victims of sexual assault. In addition, there is a lack of available data on the per-episode risk of HIV infection with specific sexual encounters, and in combination with poor follow-up of sexual assault victims, this has resulted in few studies assessing the risk of HIV infection after sexual assault. There is a paucity of research conducted in this field particularly at rape centres in the Cape Metropolitan area of the Western Cape. Methods: Aim: To obtain a profile of sexual assault victims and the treatment received at the Karl Bremer Hospital Rape Centre over a period of one year. Study design: Descriptive cross-sectional survey. Setting: The study was conducted at the rape centre at the Karl Bremer Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. To describe the frequency of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in rape victims, all consecutive patients who presented to the rape centre over the one-year period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 were included in the sample. A total of 820 patient records were evaluated. The researcher and research assistant examined the victims' folders at the rape centre for information covered in the objectives. A checklist was used as an instrument to obtain relevant information on pregnancy, STIs, pre- and post-test counselling, HIV status, tolerance to anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment post sexual assault and other information covered in the objectives. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results: The age of the victims ranged from six to 70 years (average age 23. 3). Most of the victims (76. 5 %) were aged 10 - 29, 14. 3 % were aged 30 - 39, 2. 1 % were 50 or older and 0. 2 % were less than 10 years of age. About 5. 5 % had completed primary school, 26. 8 % had completed secondary school and only 1. 8 % had tertiary education. Most of the victims were not married (91. 8 %) and had experienced their first episode of sexual assault (88. 4 %). In addition, about 24. 6 % presented with STI and 12. 1 % were HIV positive at presentation. About two-thirds (67. 2 %) of the victims were offered <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraception.</b> It is, however, disturbing to note that only 6. 2 % had pre-test counselling and only 6. 1 % had post-test counselling. About two-thirds (66. 83 %) of the victims were offered ARV therapy. Of the 548 patients who received ARV therapy, 64. 2 % were placed on Combivir® and only 1. 5 % took zidovudine. There seems to be a positive association between STI and HIV infection at presentation (OR 2. 96; 95 % CI 1. 96 - 4. 56). There was no statistically significant difference between level of education, employment status or marital status and HIV status at presentation. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between number of episodes of sexual assault and HIV status. Conclusion: The prevalence of STI in victims of sexual assault attending the Karl Bremer Hospital Rape Centre during the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 is 24. 6 % and that of documented HIV infection, 12. 1 %. The results also seem to confirm a positive association between STI and HIV infection in this study population. Pre-test and post-test counselling occurred very infrequently and this needs to be addressed. Further, attention needs to be focused on proper training of professional staff members with regard to counselling skills to further enhance the quality of care of sexual assault victims at the Karl Bremer Hospital Rape Centre.
