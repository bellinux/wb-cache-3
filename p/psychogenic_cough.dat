40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{review the}} {{literature}} on habit, tic, and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough,</b> and to make evidence-based recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY: For data on adults, an Ovid MEDLINE literature review (through February 2005) was performed for all studies published in the English language, including case series and case reports, since 1966 using the medical subject heading terms 2 ̆ 2 habit cough, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough,</b> 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 tic disorder, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 vocal tic, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Tourette 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 honking cough, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 barking cough. 2 ̆ 2 For pediatric data, articles were identified dating from 1966 from searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, the list of references in relevant publications, and the authors 2 ̆ 7 collection of references with the last search performed in February 2005. The search terms used were 2 ̆ 2 children 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 vocal tics 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 habit cough, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 chronic cough. 2 ̆ 2 RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The methodologies used and rigor of the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions {{reported in the literature}} are inconsistent. The putative clinical characteristics of habit cough and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough,</b> for the most part, have not been prospectively or systematically studied. Therefore, on the basis of expert opinion, the diagnoses of habit cough or <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> can be made only after an extensive evaluation is performed that includes ruling out tic disorders and uncommon causes of chronic cough, and when cough improves with behavior modification or psychiatric therapy. In adult patients with chronic cough that remains persistently troublesome despite an extensive and thorough evidence-based evaluation, and after behavior modification and/or psychiatric therapy have failed, unexplained cough should be diagnosed rather than habit cough or <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough.</b> In children, the depth of investigations to rule out uncommon causes must be individualized as some investigations and/or treatment may increase morbidity. In adult and pediatric patients with chronic cough that is associated with troublesome psychological manifestations, psychological counseling or psychiatric intervention should be encouraged after other causes have been ruled out...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the children with chronic cough and to analyze their etiological factors according to the age groups. Method: Five hundred sixty-three children with chronic cough were included. The last diagnosis were established and were also emphasized according to the age groups. Results: The mean age was 5. 4 ± 3. 8 years (2 -months– 17 -years) and 52 % of them were male. The most common final diagnosis from all the participants were: asthma (24. 9 %), asthma-like symptoms (19 %), protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) (11. 9 %), and upper airway cough syndrome (9. 1 %). However, <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> was {{the second most common}} diagnosis in the subjects over 6 years of age. Conclusion: Asthma and asthma-like symptoms were the most common diagnosis in children. Different age groups in children may have a different order of frequencies. <b>Psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> should be thought of in the common causes especially in older children...|$|E

A multidisciplinary examination excluded allergic, viral, respiratory, epileptic, and other more usual causes of similar conditions. Two diagnoses (<b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> and transient vocal tic disorder) and a mixed intervention were proposed leading to resolution in 12 days of treatment.

40|$|A cough {{is defined}} as chronic, if it exceeds 8 weeks in length. Post-nasal drip (PND), {{bronchial}} asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) must be systematically investigated, as these account for 90 percent of chronic cough cases. In addition to medical history and examination which should exclude either a postinfectious cough or coughing related to ACE inhibitor medication, a new evaluation model suggests chest X ray and spirometry as the initial step. A chronic cough is rarely due to one cause as in at least 25 % of cases 2 etiologies are present. An effective treatment of chronic cough often relies on several medication trials until its disappearance. After a multidisciplinary approach to chronic cough using this investigative model, the diagnosis of idiopathic or <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> should remain exceptional...|$|E
40|$|Cough is {{a common}} and {{distressing}} symptom that results in significant health care costs from medical consultations and medication use. *Cough is a reflex activity with elements of voluntary control that forms part of the somatosensory system involving visceral sensation, a reflex motor response and associated behavioural responses. *At the initial assessment for chronic cough, the clinician should elicit any alarm symptoms that might indicate a serious underlying disease and identify {{whether there is a}} specific disease present that is associated with chronic cough. *If the examination, chest x-ray and spirometry are normal, the most common diagnoses in ADULTS are asthma, rhinitis or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The most common diagnoses in CHILDREN are asthma and protracted bronchitis. *Management of chronic cough involves addressing the common issues of environmental exposures and patient or parental concerns, then instituting specific therapy. *In ADULTS, conditions that are associated with removable causes or respond well to specific treatment include protracted bacterial bronchitis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, asthma, GORD, obstructive sleep apnoea and eosinophilic bronchitis. *In CHILDREN, diagnoses that are associated with removable causes or respond well to treatment are exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, protracted bronchitis, asthma, motor tic, habit and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough.</b> *In ADULTS, refractory cough that persists after therapy is managed by empirical inhaled corticosteroid therapy and speech pathology techniques. ©The Medical Journal of Australia 201...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic {{therapeutic}} options {{have been}} used to treat cough that is not associated with a pulmonary or extrapulmonary etiology. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence supporting diff erent cough management options in adults and children with psychogenic, tic, and habit cough. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus were searched from the earliest inception of each database to September 2013. Content experts were contacted, and we searched bibliographies of included studies to identify additional references. RESULTS: A total of 18 uncontrolled studies were identifi ed, enrolling 223 patients (46 % male subjects, 96 % children and adolescents). <b>Psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> was the most common descriptive term used (90 % of the studies). Most of the patients (95 %) had no cough during sleep; barking or honking quality of cough was described in only eight studies. Hypnosis (three studies), suggestion therapy (four studies), and counseling and reassurance (seven studies) were the most commonly used interventions. Hypnosis was eff ective in resolving cough in 78 % of the patients and improving it in another 5 %. Suggestion therapy resolved cough successfully in 96 % of the patients. Th e greatest majority of improvements noted with these forms of therapy occurred in the pediatric age group. Th e quality of evidence is low {{due to the lack of}} control groups, the retrospective nature of all the studies, heterogeneity of defi nitions and diagnostic criteria, and the high likelihood of reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: Only low-quality evidence exists to support a particular strategy to defi ne and treat psychogenic, habit, and tic cough. Patient values, preferences, and availability of potential therapies should guide treatment choice. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Chronic cough (CC) and {{paradoxical}} {{vocal fold}} movement (PVFM) share several common features; however, {{there has been}} no systematic comparison of these two conditions. The aims of this study were to contrast and compare the symptom profiles of CC and PVFM, to clarify {{the relationship between the two}} conditions, and to explore how symptom characteristics could be used to design an individualized treatment program. Participants included 55 people with a combination of PVFM and CC that was refractory to medical treatment, 8 people with PVFM alone, 56 people with CC alone, 25 people with voice disorders, and 27 normal controls. Symptoms and descriptive features of CC, PVFM, and voice disorders were assessed via structured case history interview, symptom frequency, and severity ratings, ratings of activity limitation, and anxiety/depression ratings. Results indicated consistent overlap in the symptom profile between people with CC and those presenting with a combination of CC and PVFM. Participants with PVFM without cough and those with voice disorders overlapped with the participants with CC on some dimensions; however, there were still some significant differences between them. These data suggest that CC and PVFM are related and manifestations of a common underlying condition but that voice disorders are a discrete entity. Most participants had normal ratings on screening for anxiety and depression. Results indicated that there were no consistent psychiatric symptoms in any of the groups studied, and they do not support the label of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>cough</b> for CC that is refractory to medical treatment. Characteristics of CC such as nature and timing of the cough provide important information for developing behavioral treatment programs for individual patients who have exhausted medical options. A template has been provided that is a practical method of designing an integrated behavioral treatment program based on those individual patient characteristics...|$|E
