40|$|Drilling fluid`s {{contact with}} the {{productive}} zone of horizontal or complex wells can reduce well productivity by fluid invasion in the borehole wall. Salted drilling drill-in fluid containing polymers has often been applied in horizontal or complex petroleum wells in the poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs of the Campos basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This fluid usually consists of natural polymers such as starch and xanthan gum, which are deposited as a filter cake on the wellbore wall during the drilling. Therefore, the identification of a lift-off mechanism failure, which can be detachment or blistering and <b>pinholing,</b> will enable formulation improvements. increasing the chances of success during filter cake removal in open hole operations. Likewise, knowledge of drill-in drilling fluid adsorption/desorption onto sand can help understand the filter cake-rock adhesion mechanism and consequently filter cake lift-off mechanism failures. The present study aimed to identify the lift-off failure mechanism {{for this type of}} fluid filter cake studying adsorption/desorption onto SiO(2) using solutions of natural polymers, lubricants, besides the fluid itself. Ellipsometry was employed to measure this process. The adsorption/desorption studies showed that the adsorbed layer of drilling fluid onto the walls of the rock pores is made up of clusters of polymers, linked by hydrogen bonds, which results in a force of lower cohesion compared to the electrostatic interaction between silica and polymers. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} most probable filter cake failure mechanism is rupture (blistering and <b>pinholing),</b> which results in the formation of ducts within the filter cake.

40|$|Image {{scanning}} microscopy (ISM) {{coupled with}} pixel reassignment offers a resolution improvement of 1. 41 over standard widefield imaging. By scanning point-wise across the specimen and capturing {{an image of}} the fluorescent signal generated at each scan position, additional information about specimen structure is recorded and the highest accessible spatial frequency is doubled. Pixel reassignment can be achieved optically in real time or computationally a posteriori and is frequently combined {{with the use of a}} physical or digital pinhole to reject out of focus light. Here, we simulate an ISM dataset using a test image and apply standard and non-standard processing methods to address problems typically encountered in computational pixel reassignment and <b>pinholing.</b> We demonstrate that the predicted improvement in resolution is achieved by applying standard pixel reassignment to a simulated dataset and explore the effect of realistic displacements between the reference and true excitation positions. By identifying the position of the detected fluorescence maximum using localisation software and centring the digital pinhole on this co-ordinate before scaling around translated excitation positions, we can recover signal that would otherwise be degraded by the use of a pinhole aligned to an inaccurate excitation reference. This strategy is demonstrated using experimental data from a multiphoton ISM instrument. Finally we investigate the effect that imaging through tissue has on the positions of excitation foci at depth and observe a global scaling with respect to the applied reference grid. Using simulated and experimental data we explore the impact of a globally scaled reference on the ISM image and by <b>pinholing</b> around the detected maxima, recover the signal across the whole field of view.

40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of solvent types and pigment types on C-type ester-based gravure inks were studied. Three of the widely used solvent types {{and two of the}} pigment types were used in this study. The {{characteristics}} of the modified inks were investigated by measuring the most important physical properties of the inks: (i) surface energy, (ii) contact angle, (iii) viscosity and (iv) substrate adhesion. The experiment results showed that the ink properties changed significantly depending on the solvent type, while pigment type variation had a negligible effect on the ink properties. From this experiment, the most improved properties were obtained in the ethyl-acetate-based ink. In order to further improve the ink properties without suppressing the advantage of this solvent type, small amounts of various aqueous additives and surfactants were added to find suitable formulations. From this stage of study, three ink formulations with suitable printability and wetting properties were achieved. These formulations were C-type ethyl-acetate-based ink with one of the following surfactants; 0. 8 percent of Zonyl FS- 300, 0. 1 percent of Zonyl FSJ, and 12 percent of hexane. The wetting and print performance characteristics of these formulations were tested by practically using them in the pilot press trials. The results from pilot press trials indicated that the new ink formulations with low concentration aqueous surfactants may be used to minimize printing problems such as <b>pinholing</b> and fish-eye effect. However, even the best performance formulation was found to have quite high temperature sensitivity and surface tension higher than the theoretical upper surface tension limit. These, unfortunately, lead to poor printing quality. Therefore, further study is needed to find a better ink formulation with superior properties that will overcome print quality difficulties and completely solve the printing problems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{various studies}} into {{the effects of}} both growth and processing conditions on a) the electrical properties of interfaces of the CdTe solar cell, and b) the photovoltaic (PV) performance. Annealing of the CdS/TCO (transparent conductive oxide) bilayer in both oxidising and reducing ambients was investigated in order to study changes in the electrical properties of the In/CdS/TCO structure. It was found that post-growth oxidising changed the current–voltage (J-V) characteristics from Ohmic to rectifying, which was attributed {{to the creation of}} a CdO-n+/CdS-n junction, as an oxygen-rich layer was revealed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) on the CdS surface. A new method of testing <b>pinholing</b> of the CdS film was used, which gave confidence that the observed Ohmic behaviour was genuine. Annealing CdS (in various ambients) was further investigated by studying its effect on full devices, but the effect on PV performance was insignificant. This study was paired with an investigation into a rapid screening method of optimising CdTe/CdS cell PV performance, which reduced the number of the required samples by a factor of ~ 30. This was achieved by varying the CdTe thickness by chemically bevelling the cells in a Br 2 /methanol solution. The best performance was obtained at a CdTe thickness of ~ 3 μm, for which the CdCl 2 treatment used was optimum. Both the uniformity and roughness of the cell layers are vital to obtaining high quality results using this methodology. The electrical current transport mechanism in the CdTe/CdS heterojunction was investigated as a function of a) growth technique by which devices were fabricated, and b) window layer type. Data were collected by recording J-V-T measurements in different light intensities (including dark), with temperature being varied in the range of 200 – 300 K. The transport mechanism was found to be dependent only on the window material under forward bias condition in the dark, but was independent of both the window layer and growth technique in a) forward bias in the light, and b) reverse bias in the dark. A new method was used to determine the diode ideality factor in the light, and therefore identify the transport mechanism. The back contact of the CdTe/CdS cell was investigated by measuring its barrier height (b). In a preliminary study, two methods of b measurement were compared, with the most applicable method being used to study Au, Sb 2 Te 3 and As 2 Te 3 contacts, with the CdTe back surface being either a) as-grown, b) nitric/phosphoric acid etched or c) plasma etched. The value of the barrier height for each contact and its impact on the cell performance are presented and discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
