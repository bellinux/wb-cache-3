40|$|A notable {{way that}} social change affects <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life</b> would {{rely on the}} person’s {{experience}} with social change. This experience may influence societal {{quality of life and}} quality of work life, which may in turn affect <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life.</b> Additionally, the experience of social change is possibly less detrimental to <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life</b> later in the presence of higher existing <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life.</b> These influences over time become transparent through a three-wave panel study of 531 working people in Hong Kong, China. Findings show that although social change experienced did not generally impair subsequent quality of life, it tended to be more detrimental to the person with lower quality of life before. In addition, social change experienced tended to erode societal quality of life and quality of work life experienced, which appeared to be predictors of <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life.</b> Hence, there are possible ways for social change to predict <b>personal</b> quality of <b>life.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.
