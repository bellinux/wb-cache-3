50|$|Several {{methods are}} used for retting flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are {{standing}} out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. <b>Pond</b> <b>retting</b> is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax {{in a pool of}} water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than <b>pond</b> <b>retting,</b> but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.|$|E
50|$|Retting {{can also}} {{be done in a}} plastic trash can or any type of {{water-tight}} container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would corrode the metal. If the water temperature is kept at 80 F, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in <b>pond</b> <b>retting.</b> 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.|$|E
50|$|The loch {{may have}} survived during the Burns family's time as Robert and Gilbert grew flax and {{probably}} used the loch as a <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> for {{the preparation of}} the flax.|$|R
50|$|The lochan {{in front}} of Low Cottage was a <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> and the cottage was built as a retting cottage for the {{preparation}} of flax. The loch no longer has any open water. Retting {{is the process of}} taking off the outer part of flax by laying flax in water.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability through {{replacement}} of non-renewable fibers with renewable fibers is an ecological need. Impact of transportation costs from South-east Asia {{on the life}} cycle analysis of the composite is detrimental. Kenaf is an easily grown crop in America. Farm based processing involves placing the harvested crop in rivers and <b>ponds,</b> where <b>retting</b> of the fibers from the plant (separation into fibers) can take 2 weeks or more. The objective of this thesis is to analyze industrially viable processes for generating fibers and examine their synergistic impact on mechanical performance, surface topography and chemistry for functional composites. Comparison has been made with commercial and conventional retting process, including alkali retting, enzymatic retting, retting in river and <b>pond</b> water (<b>retting</b> occurs by natural microbial population) with controlled microbial retting. The resulting kenaf fibers were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) optical fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and carbohydrate analysis. DMA results showed that pectinase and microbe treated fibers have superior viscoelastic properties compared to alkali retting. XPS, Raman, FT-IR and biochemical analysis indicated that the controlled microbial and pectinase retting was effective in removing pectin, hemicellulose and lignin. SEM, optical microscopy and AFM analysis showed the surface morphology and cross sectional architecture were preserved in pectinase retting. Experimental results showed that enzymatic retting at 48 hours and controlled microbial retting at 72 hours yield uniform and superior quality fibers compared to alkali and natural retting process. Controlled microbial retting is an inexpensive way to produce quality fibers for polymer composite reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} water mills were {{associated}} with the Lands of Brownmuir, including the Mill of Beith and probably the lint mill used for processing flax that was located on the Muir Burn near Brownmuir Farm above Knowes Mill, with an associated <b>retting</b> <b>pond.</b> The name of this lint mill is unrecorded. A mill also existed at Boydston on the opposite side from Mill of Beith and Davies o'the Mill may have been another flax mill. Bleach works were located at Threepwood and Sunnyside of Threepwood for bleaching linen made from the processed and woven flax.|$|R
50|$|Lows Cottage near Coldhame was a retting {{works and}} was located {{next to one}} of the Lowes Lochs which was used as a <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> for flax preparation. Davie's o'the Mill lay nearby and is thought to have been a flax or lint mill, leading to the {{suggestion}} that these industrial activities all located along Threepwood Road and nearby may have been inter-dependent business ventures. A flax or lint mill also once existed near Brownmuir on the Muir Burn. Flax made into linen was also used in the manufacture of thread by the Crawford Brothers, first in Beith and later in Barrmill.|$|R
50|$|The farm {{may have}} been {{involved}} in flax dressing at one time, a <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> is known to have existed at Windyhouse Farm and a lint mill was located on the Powgree Burn {{at the far end of}} Kersland Glen near Longbar. A room in Roughwood Farm has an unusual floor with four separately supported sides creating slopes down to a central area. This {{may have been}} the heckling shed where flax was processed and the spent material, called 'tow', was collected for further use in stuffing pilloes, etc or simply for removal as it was highly combustible and fires in heckling shops were common.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{producing}} the safe, high quality and nutritious vegetable products {{has become the}} common goal of the food producers and consumers. In doing so, Chinese government vigorously promotes clean production technology of vegetables for the source control and production process control. Unfortunately, lots of vegetables residues are still thrown away after the harvest, which has caused severe environmental pollution in producing areas. Vegetable waste composting technology, an important technology of vegetable cleaner production, has low requirements for technology conditions and is suitable {{for the promotion of}} rural households. But it needs additional investment costs including <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> construction costs during application process and its personal income is less than the social benefits brought by the technology itself, which makes it difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers to adapt cleaner technology and the technology promotion is not smooth. It is of great and practical significance to investigate the influence mechanism of technology application, assess subsides policy effectiveness and encourage farmers environmentally and friendly produce behavior. The goal of this study is thus to use the contingent valuation method(CVM) to understand the farmers' willingness to subsidize for heap retting pool construction fee and to analyze the direction and intensity of influence factors of willingness to pay(WTP) by using a Logistic econometric model and the 142 questionnaires in Gaocheng City of Hebei Province. The results indicated that the direct cost of production and operation was an important factor to affect the WTP of technology subsidies and individual labor time and social relationship were the internal control factors that affects the WTP, while the policy measures based on technology subsidies was an important factor to affect the WTP and environmental cognition factor of soil pollution presented a reverse relationship with WTP. It thus proposed three policy suggestions to guide farmers to use the composting technology, which included:advancing the technology innovation of safe and high efficient vegetable production, fully playing the important role of the vegetable professional cooperative organization, establishing an effective subsidies mechanism of vegetable clean production to improve the efficiency of agricultural ecological subsidies...|$|R
50|$|Pitmilly House {{was taken}} over during World War II as a billet for Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). After the war it {{operated}} as a hotel under several owners, but ultimately these businesses failed and the house, which {{was said to be}} haunted by a particularly active poltergeist, deteriorated badly. It burned in 1967, with much of the building material subsequently being salvaged to build houses in Kingsbarns. Pitmilly now exists as good agricultural land, with the farms of the former estate still operating. Of these, Morton of Pitmilly has been renovated as a self-catering holiday resort. The most important landmark is Pitmilly Law. The ruins of two mills and of a fisherman's bothy on the estate remain. Hillhead Mill was a grist mill, on which the date 1716 is still evident, and is located at the junction of Pitmilly Burn and Kenly Water. Crail Mill was a flax mill with an adjacent miller’s house (which still bears the date 1790), located a few hundred yards upstream from Hillhead Mill. There is a large, marshy pond {{to the west of the}} miller’s house, probably representing the <b>retting</b> <b>pond</b> for the flax. Some confusion in nomenclature exists because both mills have on occasion been referred to individually as Pitmilly Mill. Little of Pitmilly House itself is left. Pitmilly West, built in 1975 on the site of the west gate house, operates as bed and breakfast. The other three gatehouses, the walls surrounding the grounds, pathways through the grounds, as well as ruins of the stables and the bowling alley remain. The Gate Lodge has been refurbished to a high standard; the East Lodge is in its original, Georgian, condition, while South Lodge is completely ruinous. Several photographs of the Pitmilly area as it is now can be found on Geograph British Isles at Grid Square NO5713 and adjacent squares The local beach is unofficially called Pitmilly Beach with the Fife Coastal Path running along that beach and then entering the valley of Kenly Water, past the Pitmilly mills.|$|R
