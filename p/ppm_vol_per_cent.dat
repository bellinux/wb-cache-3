40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the field of the ceramic industry and relates to a stabilized Zr 0 <- 2 ceramic reinforced by hard material, in the magnetic head substrate for data storage systems, and a process for its production. The invention is based on the technical problem of citing a stabilized ZrO<- 2 < 0. 5 mu m ceramic reinforced with hard material with increased hardness which is producible without chemical reactive processes and without the technologies restricting the geometry of the parts to be manufactured. By common mixing and grinding in a liquid, a mixture is produced from the starting materials of medium grain size of the ZrO<- 2 < 0. 5 mu m, of the hard material component mu m and Al<- 2 0. 5 mu m, of the hard material component mu m and Al<- 2 O<- 3 < 0. 7 mu m.

40|$|An {{exceptionally}} {{high yield}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{has been achieved}} by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of camphor over zeolite support. A simple 30 min CVD of 12 g camphor over Fe-Co-impregnated zeolite at 650 °C in an academic laboratory setup, yields 6 g multiwalled CNTs of dia ~ 10 nm with an as-grown purity of ~ 88 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Owing to the enormous CNT growth,the zeolite bed inflates by 1000 wt <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and 10, 000 <b>vol</b> <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Camphor-to-CNT production efficiency is 50 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and net carbon-to-CNT conversion efficiency is 61 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> These figures are incomparably {{higher than that of}} any CNT precursor by any method.

40|$|The recent {{paper by}} Obata (1980) {{presents}} several petrological conclusions {{based on an}} interpretation of garnet-bearing parts of the Ronda peridotite. In my opinion, Obata's interpretation involves some uncertainties which I wish to discuss, laying emphasis on the important petrographical phenomena. According to Dickey (1970), Darot (1973, 1974), Schubert (1975, 1977), and Fabries (1979), the Ronda peridotite is an alpine-type spinel peridotite displaying spinel-lherzolite facies and plagioclase-lherzolite facies. A similar interpetation is given by Milliard (1959), Kornprobst (1966, 1969), and Polve & Allegre (1980) for the analogous spinel peridotite massif at Beni Bouchera, Morocco. Obata (1980) has reported garnet peridotite as a rock type from the Ronda mass; what are the field and petrographical facts supporting this observation? The Ronda massif contains up to 5 <b>vol.</b> <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> mafic layers developed as spinel-bearing olivine gabbros, spinel pyroxenites, and garnet pyroxenites (lit cit. above).

5000|$|Dangal {{performed}} {{particularly well}} in China. This was attributed partly to Khan's popularity in China {{owing to the}} success of his previous films 3 Idiots (2009) and PK (2014) there. It was also reported that the audiences could relate to the underlying social theme of Dangal in that it portrayed the success story of sisters in the backdrop of a patriarchal and gender inequal society, much like the conditions inherent in China. Another factor was that the film filled a [...] "vacuum" [...] created by lack of interest among filmgoers due to [...] "poor quality of domestic films" [...] and China's ban on the [...] "wildly popular" [...] Korea dramas on television and streaming platforms due Korea's acceptance to the deployment of American THAAD missile defense system, in August 2016. Consequently, an earning of between 200 crore and 300 crore was expected. On the day of its release, 5 May 2017, Dangal had a screen share of 13.3 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> with 30,000 screenings, much lower than Guardians of the Galaxy <b>Vol.</b> 2, (43.9 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> the number one film for the previous week.

During the time, the film began trending in Sina Weibo. The run continued into its third week with 2.7 million tickets sold on the Sunday. As the film grossed 900 crore in the country on 29 May, Forbes wrote, [...] "Dangal has inspired a simultaneous outpouring of pride, wonderment, and even disbelief in India's film community. No Indian movie has ever earned so much money, so quickly, in a market outside India."

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to measure {{compliance}} with agreed protocols for prophylactic antibiotics for five elective procedures: transurethral resection of the prostate, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, joint arthroplasty and herniorrhaphy in two teaching hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: Compliance was measured during the pre and post intervention periods by reviewing medical records. Findings: Overall, compliance improved by 18 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 12 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 23 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> with greater improvements for transurethral resection of the prostate and hysterectomy, increasing by 27 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 14 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 40 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and 24 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 16 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 32 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> respectively. Compliance remained low for cholecystectomy (17 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and hysterectomy (25 <b>per</b> <b>cent).</b> Overall, the proportion of patients not receiving any prophylaxis where its use was indicated, declined by 6 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 11 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> from 23 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> The use of additional anti-microbials that were not recommended in the protocol was high for joint arthroplasty 65 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and hysterectomy 71 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> but overall this practice declined by 8 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 3 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 14 <b>per</b> <b>cent).</b> Costs were reduced from $ 11. 72 to $ 10. 53 per patient between the pre and post intervention groups, while a complete adoption of the protocols could reduce costs by 70 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> to $ 3. 40. There were large variations in correct dosages and timing of antibiotics between procedural groups. Practical implications: although compliance improved there were large differences between the specialties. The adoption of preventive strategies is fundamental to providing safe patient care. The use of inappropriate antimicrobials {{is also an important}} patient safety issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance and is associated with increased costs. Introducing change in health organizations is difficult and the factors influencing successful change strategies require further study. Originality/value: The paper measures and improves compliance with agreed protocols in health care intervention procedures...|$|R
