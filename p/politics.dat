5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and <b>politics.</b> Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the <b>politics</b> of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of <b>politics</b> and power.|$|E

25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a <b>politics</b> of the poor, a living <b>politics</b> and a people's <b>politics.</b> A <b>politics</b> of the poor is understood to mean a <b>politics</b> that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a <b>politics</b> must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their <b>politics</b> there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living <b>politics.</b> The first is that it is understood as a <b>politics</b> that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This <b>politics</b> is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living <b>politics,</b> is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's <b>politics</b> is opposed to party <b>politics</b> or politicians' <b>politics</b> (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO <b>politics)</b> and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E
