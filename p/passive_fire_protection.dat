40|$|The {{potential}} {{reduction of}} risk in LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) road transport due {{to the adoption of}} <b>passive</b> <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> was investigated. Experimental data available for small scale vessels fully engulfed by a fire were extended to real scale road and rail tankers through a finite elements model. The results of mathematical simulations of real scale fire engulfment scenarios that may follow accidents involving LPG tankers proved the effectiveness of the thermal protections in preventing the "fired" BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) scenario. The presence of a thermal coating greatly increases the "time to failure", providing a time lapse that in the European experience may be considered sufficient to allow the start of effective mitigation actions by fire brigades. The results obtained were used to calculate the expected reduction of individual and societal risk due to LPG transportation in real case scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the introduction of <b>passive</b> <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> turns out in a significant {{reduction of risk}}, up to an order of magnitude in the case of individual risk and of about 50 % if the expectation value is considered. Thus, the adoption of <b>passive</b> <b>fire</b> <b>protections,</b> not compulsory in European regulations, may be an effective technical measure for risk reduction, and may contribute to achieve the control of "major accidents hazards" cited by the European legislation. © 2009 Elsevier B.

A methodology based on a combined experimental and numerical approach is presented and applied for characterizing the fireproofing behavior of a novel inorganic formulation based on basalt fibers and silica aerogel. A {{modified version of the}} ASTM E 162 standard fire test was used to expose specimens of fireproofed steel board to a steady radiation source. Experimental results were used to validate a simplified mono-dimensional model which allowed simulating more severe conditions and different protection configurations.

40|$|Fires {{may affect}} process and storage {{equipment}} causing severe damages and potential accident escalation. Passive protections, {{based on the}} application of fireproofing coatings, are usually implemented {{in order to prevent}} or mitigate such events. The design and testing of this type of barriers is a critical task due to the extreme heat exposure conditions. For this purpose, several standard tests, based on the use of large scale furnaces and experimental facilities, are adopted. In the present study, a methodology for the assessment of fireproofing materials performance was presented. The methodology was aimed at reducing the costs of fire tests by the combined use of small scale experiments and modeling activities.

The changes of the characteristics of PFP materials when exposed to high temperatures can {{have a significant impact on}} the safeguard of the protected surface. In this work, laboratory and bench-scale experimental studies of the property changes suffered by a selected PFP coating when exposed to high temperatures were carried out. The results were used in the simulation of a case of study which allowed evaluating the advantages of a detailed model of the coating behaviour. As a conclusion, it was observed that the impact of considering and not considering the property changes of PFP materials when exposed to fire is significant. The results can be used to enhance Finite Element Modelling, leading to a more realistic and better evaluation of the PFP effectiveness. Copyright © 2012, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{seemingly}} continual erosion of our cultural heritage due to fires in historic buildings. Some of these fires result in partial {{loss of the}} asset, some result in total loss – in all cases irreplaceable historic fabric is destroyed. Accurate recording for fires in historic buildings is problematic, but such data as has been collated indicates {{that the level of}} loss is high. One of the key factors in achieving robust fire safety in historic buildings is the upgrading of physical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures. It has been suggested that we should assume a fire event is probable, and together with a context in which outside help might be some time in arriving, such measures are considered crucial in containing the fire and raising the alarm as quickly as possible. This article considers <b>passive</b> and active <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures, using case study material to provide illustrative examples. Where it might be expected that conservation requirements, aiming to avoid negative impact to character and significance, might hinder disruptive physical interventions to improve <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> in fact a great deal can be achieved.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a review of}} the <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> systems {{installed}} in the Christopher Cohan Center on the Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo campus. The systems reviewed are the <b>passive</b> structural <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> <b>passive</b> and active egress components, and active detection and suppression systems. The report examines whether the reviewed systems in the building meet the prescriptive requirements of the 2010 California Building Code(CBC) and California Fire Code(CFC). The building will be further subjected to a performance based analysis. Two design fire scenarios are presented, and an analysis of available safe egress time (ASET) is compared with an analysis of the required safe egress time (RSET). Fire Safety Goals Five goals found in building guides such as NFPA 5000 and the SFPE Performance Based Design guides are as follows: 1. “Provide life safety for the public, building occupants, and emergency responders by minimizing firerelated injuries and preventing undue loss of life. 2. Minimize damage to property and cultural resources from fire. 3. Provide for continuity of operations. Minimize undue loss of operations and business-related revenue caused by fire-related damage. 4. Limit the environmental impact of fire from combustion products and release of hazardous materials. ” 5. Limit the fire-related damage to buildings and objects of historical and/or cultural significance. The performance section of this report will focus only on the life safety goal as applied to the building occupants. The prescriptive part of the report will determine if the building is compliant with the 2010 CBC and CFC, with respect to fire and egress related systems. If it is, then the first goal is assumed to have been achieved to a degree equivalent to a new building built to prescriptive code with respect to those systems. The report will not address the remaining goals beyond the following: Survey of construction documents to this point have not revealed systems for managing sprinkler discharge or other fire-related environmental hazard mitigation systems. The building is an existing structure without a protected historical status, so goal 5 does not apply...|$|R

The composite panel results of combination of a calcium sulphate hydrates matrix mainly water and inorganic mineral additives. The effective thermal conductivity of the composite is measured by the hot-disc method. Analytical and numerical models are used to determine the composite thermal conductivity which can be expected vs the rate of additives. The experimental values are compared with analytical and numerical models. In particular, effective medium percolation theory (EMPT) for a two-phase system gives analytical values which are close to the experimental results. Moreover, the numerical model based on a simple description can allow the description of the thermal conductivity evolution with the rate of additives.

30|$|Scenarios {{incorporating}} antagonistic {{events have}} a {{potential to be}} more severe, this has been discussed above, e.g. flammable liquids present the potential of a fast developing fire (Richards 2008) and of course an explosion can create a significant damage.
