40|$|An {{evanescent}} wave variant of broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy using a supercontinuum light source {{has been used}} to detect electrogenerated species at the silica-water interface. In proof-of-concept experiments [IrCl 6] 2 - was produced by electro-oxidation of [IrCl 6] 3 - in a thin layer electrochemical cell. Diffusion of the Ir(IV) across the cell to a silica interface was monitored yielding real-time concentrations within an evanescent field region at the interface. The optical response was compared with the electrochemical response during chronoamperometric step and cyclic voltammetric experiments and both were simulated by finite element modeling. The experiment is highly sensitive to interfacial processes and its wide spectral width and fast time resolution make it a potentially powerful tool for in situ spectroscopic monitoring of <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>intermediates</b> in dynamical electrochemistry. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine if {{the quality}} of primary medical care varies with {{remoteness}} from urban settlements. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of publicly available data of 18 <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>intermediate</b> outcome measures for people with coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes and stroke. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Populations registered with 912 general practices in Scotland grouped into three categories by level of remoteness from urban settlements: not remote, remote and very remote. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean percentages achieving quality indicators and interquartile range scores. RESULTS: Remote and very remote practices {{were more likely to}} have characteristics associated with low Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) total points score (smaller, higher capitation income, dispensing practice, and had lower statin prescribing despite higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes). However, in contrast with previous research, there was little evidence that quality of care was lower in more remote areas for the 18 <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>intermediate</b> outcome measures examined. The exception was significantly lower cholesterol measurement and control in people with CHD, diabetes and stroke attending very remote practices and beta-blocker prescription in CHD. CONCLUSIONS: Under QOF, there are few differences in {{the quality of}} care delivered to patients in practices with different degrees of remoteness. The differences in achievement for cholesterol were consistent with lower rates of statin prescribing relative to disease burden in very remote practices. No differences were found for complex process measures such as retinopathy screening, implying that differences under QOF are more likely to be due to slower adoption of evidence-based practice than access problems.

40|$|Summary Reelin and its {{receptor}} machinery {{are well}} known to be required for the migration and positioning of neocortical projection neurons. More recently, reelin has been shown both necessary and sufficient to determine the rate of neocortical neurogenesis. The molecular links underlying its seemingly distinct proliferative and post-proliferative functions remain unknown. Here we reveal an enriched expression of functional reelin receptors, largely of Apolipoprotein E Receptor 2 (ApoER 2), in radial glia basal <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>intermediate</b> progenitor cells during mid/late cortical development. In vivo, ApoER 2 overexpression inhibits neuronal migration. In contrast, precluding excessive levels of ApoER 2 in reelin-deficient cortices, by either ApoER 2 knock-down or the transgenic expression of reelin in neural progenitor cells, improves neuronal migration and positioning. Our study provides groundwork for the highly orchestrated clearance of neocortical neurons from their birth site, suggesting that a reelin-dependent ApoER 2 downregulation mechanism uncouples newborn neurons from progenitor cells, thereby enabling neurons to migrate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a design and prototype of {{a support system}} for archeologists to read the "mokkan " excavated from Heijyo-kyo, Japan (the ancient palace in the Nara period from AD. 710 to 794). A mokkan is a wooden tablet on which text was written by a brush. Many mokkans {{were used in the}} Nara period. Since most of unearthed mokkans have been stained, damaged, and degraded, it is extremely difficult even for archeologists to extract characters from badly blurred or missing ink on a mokkan. We realized binarization functions based on discriminant analysis to extract ink from brownish background. Then, we developed a character recognition function, which outputs candidates for partially missing patterns. The aim of this recognizer is to output candidates even for degraded or partially missing character patterns rather than to read handwritten characters at the maximum speed. We made also a graphical user interface to invoke the above functions, provide experts with suggestions and stimulate their inference. This system supports collaborative work among expert readers by sharing decoding <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>intermediate</b> results of extracted ink images and character recognition. 1...|$|R
