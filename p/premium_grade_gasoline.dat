The original Northstar Allanté also introduced the Northstar System which included traction control, adaptive suspension, and antilock brakes.

50|$|In {{order to}} be {{certified}} as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their grades of gasoline meet these standards. However, <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain {{two to three times}} the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than a cent per gallon. In addition to the detergent additive requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, {{after all}} other Standard Oil {{descendants}} had minimized {{use of the}} name Standard, Standard of Ohio, proud to be the original corporate component of Standard oil, sought to corporately rebrand itself under the Standard name, while continuing to use the Sohio brand in Ohio. However, later that year BP bought the 45% of Sohio it did not already own and assumed control. Among the first changes was the rebranding of all Sohio and Boron stations to 'BP' in 1991.The Boron name was used outside of Ohio in neighboring states, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. Boron was also the branding of its <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> along with its regular grade fuel [...] "Extron"(formerly [...] "Ex-tane" [...] later [...] "Octron") and its unleaded version [...] "Cetron" [...] introduced in 1970.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs {{part of an}} investigation of gas turbine regenerator fouling being conducted at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School gas chromatography {{was used to compare}} and analyze certain hydrocarbon fuels. Because of the known relationship between fuel aromaticity and exhaust system fouling in gas turbine engines, particular emphasis was directed toward determination of the aromaticity of the fuels and of the particular aromatic compounds present. Fuels investigated included <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> auto <b>gasoline,</b> aviation gasoline, several gas turbine fuels, and marine diesel fuel. Derivatives of cyclohexane and decahydronaphthalene were synthesized by hydrogenation of benzene and naphthalene derivatives with Raney nickel catalyst. Numerous branched-chain paraffins were synthesized by hydroisomerization of n-olefins under alkylation conditions.

5000|$|The {{production}} MKS {{rides on}} Ford's D3 platform. The MKS features an independent suspension with MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a 26 mm stabilizer {{bar in the}} front and a multilink coil over shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear; [...] "Lincoln Drive Control" [...] with continuously controlled damping (CCD) available as optional feature. The car features four-wheel antilock disc brakes (12.25 in rotors {{in the front and}} 12.75 in rotors in the rear) with standard AdvanceTrac traction control and Roll Stability Control (RSC). Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4 L Ford/Yamaha V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7 L Duratec DOHC V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's Cyclone engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular grade, 87 octane gasoline or premium grade, 91 octane gasoline. Using regular grade gasoline, the 3.7 L V6 produces 273 hp (204 kW) at 6250 rpm and 270 lb·ft (366 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Using <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> results in a small boost in output to 275 hp (205 kW) at 6250 rpm and 276 lb·ft (374 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Power from the MKS' V6 is transmitted to the wheels via Ford's 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is equipped with SelectShift which simulates the operation of a manual transmission. A road test by Car and Driver magazine of an AWD-equipped MKS recorded acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and a quarter-mile in 15.7 seconds at 90 mi/h km/h. Testers noted the MKS' heavy weight of over 4300 lbs. Ford introduced its EcoBoost V6, an all-aluminum, twin-turbocharged, direct injection 3.5 L DOHC V6, in the 2010 MKS arriving in showrooms in the summer of 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{data set}} of daily sales {{at a single}} {{gasoline}} station over a seven year period to determine if consumers respond to relative price changes among the three grades of gasoline. Based on the reasoning of Alchian and Allen (1964) and Barzel (1976), market shares of higher quality gasoline should increase {{at the expense of}} regular grade gasoline when overall gasoline prices increase. The empirical results do not conform to this expectation. We find instead that the consumers in this sample responded to higher gasoline prices by switching to mid grade gasoline from <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> leaving the market share of regular gasoline unchanged.

5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for <b>premium</b> <b>grade</b> petrol (<b>gasoline).</b> However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|R
