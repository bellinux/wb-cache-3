25|$|To {{illustrate}} this relationship, Giddens discusses changing attitudes towards marriage in developed countries. He claims that {{any effort to}} explain this phenomenon solely in terms of micro or macro level causes {{will result in a}} circular cause and consequence. Social relationships and visible sexuality (micro-level change) are related to the decline of religion and the rise of rationality (macro-level change), but also with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro), change caused by different practices and changing attitudes on the level of everyday lives (micro). <b>Practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> in turn can be affected by social movements (for example, women's liberation and egalitarianism), a macro-scale phenomena; but the movements usually grow out of everyday life grievances — a micro-scale phenomenon.|$|E

The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> similar to the Bush administration, and Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was not a case of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather a case where the exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom (UK), it was {{documented}} that a problem of knowledge transfer existed within the speciality of breast-cancer care, thus depriving patients of receiving optimal care. Despite increasingly robust research evidence indicating recommendation of whole body exercise for people affected by breast cancer, commensurate changes to practice were not noted amongst breast-care nurses (BCNs). AIM: To evaluate {{the effect of a}} targeted booklet, Exercise and Breast Cancer: A Booklet for Breast-Care Nurses, on changes in knowledge, reported <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> of BCNs in the UK. METHOD: A prospective, experimental approach was used for designing a pre- and post-test randomised controlled study. Comparisons of knowledge, reported <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> based on responses to a questionnaire were made at two time-points in two groups of BCNs (control and experimental). The unit of randomisation and analysis was hospital clusters of BCNs. The sample comprised 92 nurses from 62 hospitals. Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics and clustered regression techniques: clustered logistic regression for knowledge items, clustered linear regression for knowledge scores, ologit for <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> reported <b>practice</b> items, <b>and</b> clustered multiple regression for paired and multiple variable analysis. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in knowledge and changes in reported <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> were found. Robust variables affecting knowledge acquisition were: promotion of health, promotion of exercise, and understanding how exercise can reduce cancer-related fatigue. DISCUSSION: The study has shown that evidence-based printed material, such as an information booklet, can be used as an effective research dissemination method when developed for needs, values, and context of a target audience. CONCLUSIONS: This practical approach to research dissemination could be replicated and applied to other groups of nurses. </p...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> of specialized physicians towards AD diagnosis disclosure in Brazil. Methods: A questionnaire was devised to survey the current <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> regarding diagnosis disclosure of AD in Brazil and sent to specialized physicians (170 geriatricians, 300 neurologists and 500 psychiatrists) by electronic mail. Results: From 970 potential respondents, 181 physicians who usually attend AD patients returned the questionnaire. There {{were no significant differences}} between the three specialties regarding the frequency with which they informed patients of their AD diagnosis (p = 0. 17).

Prevalence-rates of BPD was assessed by the self-report questionnaire Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire 4 + (PDQ- 4 +), and derived from clinical BPD-diagnoses in 230 outpatients in psychiatric clinics within a large Norwegian Hospital Trust. Outpatient clinicians within the Hospital Trust (n = 33) were surveyed about their diagnostic <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes.</b> BPD-prevalence assessed by PDQ- 4 + was 34 % and significantly higher than BPD-prevalence derived from clinical diagnoses (7 %). Discrepancy in prevalence-rates of PDs and BPD between research- and clinical assessment methodology is described in the literature. The study indicated that a quarter of the clinicians use clinical assessment solely in diagnosing PDs, which is associated with underdiagnosing PDs compared to research methodology. In addition clinicians reported attitudes which may lead to reservations in diagnosing PDs. These findings can help to account for low BPD-prevalence derived from clinical diagnoses. Overall, this study indicated that BPD may be underdiagnosed within Norwegian Hospital Trusts, which has implications for treatment and prognosis...|$|R

Aim and Objectives: This research aimed to determine the association between knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude,</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> on cardiovascular disease among women in Kelantan. Methods/ Study Design: A cross sectional study was conducted in Kelantan, Malaysia. A total of 448 women attended primary care facilities in Kelantan were included in this study. Twostage sampling process was used to select clinics in all districts in Kelantan followed by female participants from selected clinics attendance lists. Recruited were non illiterate young adult women up to 65 years of age and without psychotic symptoms. Consented participants were given a set of validated KAP questionnaire that should be completed within 15 minutes. Findings: The respondents’ mean age was about 40 years with majority of them having secondary educational level and coming from low socio-economic group. Among them, 56. 8 % involved in tobacco products and 41. 3 % reported as having CVD related medical illnesses, especially obesity (23. 7 %) and hypertension (17. 6 %). About 56. 2 % had family history of CVD risk. Only 26. 8 % of them obtained the CVD information from health care workers. The good knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> score were 55. 6 %, 55. 1 % and 51. 1 % accordingly. There were significant association between <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> knowledge, <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> which were found to be strong (0. 10, 0. 20), (0. 10, 0. 18) and (0. 26, 0. 40) 95 % CI, respectively and is independent with socio-demographic and personal disease characteristic.
