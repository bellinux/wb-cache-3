40|$|A {{manually}} operated impact-type machine for breaking cocoa pods was designed, fabricated and tested. The major {{components of the}} machine include a frame, rail, hammer, pulley, bearings and rope. The machine requires rope tension, tensile stress and cross sectional area of 128. 7 N, 728 kN/m 2, 1. 77 x 10 - 4 m 2 respectively. Impact energy of 30. 9 J is required to break one pod while 78. 6 J is required for five pods at a time. Hammer speed {{was determined to be}} 3. 13 m/s. The total load on the <b>pulley</b> <b>shaft</b> was 143. 52 N. The machine requires a shaft diameter of 14. 6 mm and a shaft of 15 mm was used. The machine has a power requirement of 201. 6 W.

40|$|Modern {{agricultural}} operations now {{demand the}} utilisation {{of a wide}} variety of equipment and specialist machinery systems, with many having rotary elements such as axles, gears, pulleys etc. With these agricultural machinery systems which have rotary elements, uncontrolled vibrations may become an important problem to consider. When the initial ‘switch-on’ frequency meets with the natural frequency of a machine element in the system, undesired noise, high levels of vibration and mechanical failures may occur during operation. In this regard, it is important to predict natural frequency modes of the elements under loading as a result of these vibrations. Computing capability and design software tools are able to assist design and analysis engineers to predict and evaluate natural and forced frequency modes of these elements. These computer aided applications in the engineering domain are typically referred to as Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) and have been used with success in industry for a long time. Hence, it can be shown that the use of CAE applications in the design and analysis processes of agricultural machinery systems could be beneficial. In this study, a finite element modal analysis on the larger pulley of a fodder crushing machine which was manufactured by a commercial company in Turkey, is presented. The torque and cycle of the <b>pulley</b> <b>shaft</b> measurements of the machine were conducted and the data used in the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to simulate resonance frequency modes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{eventually}} develop a wave power model that will produce electricity at a competitive price. The work is carried out at Invencon AB and is part of the course Degree Project for Bachelor of Science in Mechanical engineering at Karlstad University. The choice of subject {{is due to the fact}} that there is currently no commercially viable wave technology that has succeeded in pushing the price of produced electricity so low to compete with other energy sources such as wind power, nuclear power and hydropower. Invencon AB has made a pilot study on a concept which is based on simplicity and is called Waves. Waves should be constructed with cheap, robust and well-proven technology. The aim of this work is to further develop the concept and will be reached by basing the design on wave force theory, weaknesses of other wave power models while remaining within the scope of what Waves patent covers. In addition to the further development of Waves, an appropriate solution to the linear motion of the buoy will be transformed into rotation, which in turn can drive any pump, generator or compressor.   A requirement specification was set up for how the conversion from linear motion to rotation should be done. This was followed by a concept generation in the form of brainstorming with a group consisting of five students, were all participants are classmates. To select the right concept, a concept evaluation is done using an elimination matrix and a relative decision matrix. Then the chosen concept is further developed and the components are dimensioned. Finally, the chosen concept is designed in Creo Parametric 2. 0 to visualize the result. The solution is a construction based on two pulleys as a drift line (wire) runs through.  The one pulley walks freely through ball bearings. Between the second pulley and wire, the friction is high enough for sliding not to occur, which causes the pulley to rotate. Through splines between the <b>pulley</b> and output <b>shaft,</b> the torque can be propelled and powered by a pump, generator or compressor.   The improvements on Waves are developed during the project. All improvements and dimensions are compiled and called Waves 2. 0...|$|R
