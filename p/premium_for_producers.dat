This article explores the potential of partnerships by developing a conceptual approach based on the sustainable livelihoods and linking farmers to market perspectives, which is applied in an exploratory study to six partnerships in the coffee sector in Peru. It is concluded that partnerships stimulate the application of standards to receive market access and therefore emphasize human capital development of farmers to facilitate certification. By transferring knowledge to farmers, partnerships present a new source of technological change, which, in combination with certification, holds potential for improved environmental management and price <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> <b>producers.</b> However, the emphasis on certification results in a comparatively narrow target group of farmers and is associated with high financial burdens <b>for</b> <b>producer</b> organizations. At the same time, other assets of producer organizations are often not strengthened sufficiently for them to operate successfully without further external support. This suggests that preparing <b>producers</b> <b>for</b> certification is prioritized over empowering organizations toward self-dependence...|$|R

S. federal farm program payments {{as the most}} important safety net for net farm income. The business climate that crop insurance purchasers and providers face in the future is one of increasing <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> <b>producers</b> and decreasing commissions for crop insurance companies and agents. The primary objective of this thesis is to assess the desirability of crop insurance agency acquisitions to increase market share for Farm Credit Services of America, considering the significant uncertainties in the future subsidy levels and commission levels for these products. Financial analysis and modeling crop insurance agency acquisitions is completed under a wide range of future economic and political scenarios. The wide range of assumptions, however, does contribute {{to a wide range of}} potential purchase prices and rates of return on crop insurance agency acquisitions. The crop insurance industry faces uncertainty in the future and general industry profitability will likely decline. However, an expansion strategy in a period of reduced commissions can be profitable if acquisitions are priced appropriately and can be made in locations where existing support services can be leveraged to support the acquisition...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} Ghanaian cocoa producers face lower yields than other main cocoa producing counties which in turn increases food insecurity <b>for</b> smallholder <b>producers.</b> In addition, low yields experienced by Ghanaian producers is a driving factor for forest degradation and deforestation as cocoa producers encroach further into previously undisturbed forests in efforts to increase their incomes. There are currently production methods to achieve higher yields readily available in Ghana; however, many producers choose not to adopt these methods because they are seen as too risky, or simply cannot adopt them due to financial/credit constraints. A common rationale <b>for</b> <b>producers</b> not adopting new technologies is that smallholder producers are risk averse and find it difficult to risk the little capital they may have. Smallholder producers frequently forego opportunities because they are vulnerable to adverse shocks such as crop failure that can move them into or deeper into poverty. Crop insurance could mitigate these risks but there is currently no crop insurance available for cocoa in Ghana. The Climate-Smart Cocoa (CSC) Working Group has proposed offering crop insurance <b>for</b> <b>producers</b> who follow the practices of CSC. This study estimated the average yields and yield variation (risk) between two groups of producers: (1) those who followed CSC practices: have training for efficient agrochemical input usage, used inorganic fertilizer, and practiced shade management (appendix 5) and (2) those who did not use CSC practices: no input-use training, no shade management, but did use inorganic fertilizer. The objectives of this study were: (1) to estimate yield differences among producers who follow CSC and non-CSC practices (2) estimate the impact of CSC practices on risk (i. e. yield variation) using percent chance of indemnity payments to producers and relative standard deviation of yield as measurements, and (3) estimate potential revenue gains through following CSC practices. To investigate these objectives, a regression model was estimated to predict cocoa yields using historical yield for 19 districts in Ghana for the copping seasons of 2010 - 2011 and 2011 - 2012. Regression results were then used to identify average yields at the district level, yield variance, and fair-market <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> <b>producers</b> who followed CSC practices {{and those who did not}} in 19 districts of Ghana. The results of the study show that producers who followed the CSC recommended practices had higher yields, less risk, and higher gross revenue in every district of the study. Meaning, producers can obtain higher incomes by following CSC on lands that are already under cocoa cultivation as well as income stability through crop insurance. By obtaining these benefits, producers are not allowed to encroach into undisturbed forests and remain in the CSC program. Therefore, CSC can not only increase farm income but also reduce deforestation...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of intake and carcass characteristics {{can assist in}} projecting input costs and potential premiums when cattle are sold at optimum finishing so net profit/loss can be anticipated. Currently published DMI prediction equations and dietary NE values are based off of data collected over 50 years ago and {{have been shown to}} inaccurately predict intake compared to a prediction equation based of off performance data. Calculating dietary NE values from performance data increased precision and accuracy of prediction. Additionally, prediction accuracy was increased for diets containing ethanol byproducts. Since ethanol byproducts have been shown to have 110 to 140 % the feeding value of corn, the improvement in predicting intake illustrated the need for research to more accurately defining feedstuff energy values via performance data and using that information to derive new intake prediction equations. Even so, predicting optimum endpoint <b>for</b> the <b>producer</b> can be the most economically beneficial prediction since carcasses are awarded <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> high cutability and high quality grades. It has been found that predicting marbling score by measuring backfat and BW over the feeding period seems to be the most viable and accurate compared to other model combinations of backfat, BW and DMI. However, backfat and BW are not synonymous with marbling score and therefore, bias increases {{at the end of the}} feeding period. Still, the economic advantage may be given to feeding the animal longer as a greater return was found for projections of animals fed past the 1. 2 cm optimum backfat. Since carcass gain can be up to 90 % of total gain at the end of the feeding period, it is beneficial <b>for</b> the <b>producer</b> to feed cattle longer as the cost of gain is spread over more carcass weight. The resulting paradigm shift to feeding cattle what is deemed past industry optimum will lead to greater carcass weights, higher quality grades, and ultimately greater <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> the <b>producer.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|High oil corn (HOC) is {{essentially}} dent corn {{that has been}} selected for high oil content in the scutellum. It is a value-added crop that can potentially offer a <b>premium</b> price <b>for</b> <b>producers.</b> Though southeastern U.

One of the most evident differences between these growers and their northern counterparts is the climate. Temperatures during the reproductive growth and grain fill periods are higher in southern latitudes. A two-part research project was conducted to further investigate the significance of temperature on oil content. The field project consisted of three different plantings; the first being planted May 11 th, 2000, the second three weeks later on June 1 st, 2000, and the third {{three weeks after the}} second, on June 22 nd, 2000. The intention of the three plantings was to force the reproductive period and grain fill to occur during different times in the growing season. Ambient temperature data was supplied by the WKU Weather Center. Each planting was harvested and analyzed for oil content. The project resulted in a significant difference in oil content between the first planting and the last two plantings. The laboratory project began in the field. Sixteen ears per planting were hand pollinated and then harvested ten days after pollination. Six to twelve kernels, still attached to the cob, were removed from each ear. These pieces were placed on growth media in petri dishes and divided into two groups. One group was placed in an incubator set at 25 °C, an optimum temperature for grain fill.

40|$|There are {{multiple}} programs producers can market cattle into including certified natural programs. These programs offer <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> <b>producers</b> {{as an incentive}} to raise natural cattle that have slower growth rates because of the inability to utilize growth-promoting technologies. Because of tremendous improvements in genetics resulting in dramatic increases in growth rates of modern feedlot cattle, it is of value to investigate how to maximize the growth potential {{of these types of}} cattle. Trace minerals are essential for growth processes throughout the body. The supplementation of trace minerals has produced varying responses in regards to growth performance and carcass characteristics of cattle. However, there are several factors that can contribute to an animal’s trace mineral status and response to trace mineral supplementation including initial mineral status, environment, genetics, and stage of production. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate the growth response and trace mineral status of certified natural Angus steers supplemented with dietary trace minerals and given an injectable trace mineral at different times in the feeding period and 2) evaluate the effect of supplementing dietary trace minerals at NRC recommendations or industry concentrations in non-implanted or implanted steers that receive high potency implant series. Within our first research objective, an injectable trace mineral had no effect on growth performance regardless of injection given {{at the start of the}} growing period, start of the finishing period, or at both time points, likely due to the steers having adequate trace mineral status throughout the feeding period. Injectable trace mineral did improve the trace mineral status of natural beef steers by increasing liver Cu, Zn, and Se concentrations during the growing period, as well as Cu and Se concentrations during the finishing period. After completion of our second research objective, we found there was a implant ÃÂÃÂ trace mineral supplementation interaction during the first 56 days of the experiment on the first implant where growth rates were increased in implanted cattle that received supplemental trace minerals and subsequent body weights tended to follow a similar pattern. But there were no implant ÃÂÃÂ trace mineral supplementation interactions for overall live or carcass adjusted animal performance. Hormone implants improved growth parameters and increased hot carcass weight. Trace mineral supplementation also improved dry matter intake and carcass adjusted final body weight, average daily gain, and improved feed efficiency regardless of implant status. Hormone implants decreased Cu and Mn concentrations 14 days after the implantation of a high dose potency implant. The varying concentrations of trace mineral supplementation increased liver Cu, Mn, Se, and Co concentrations 14 days post reimplantation and at harvest compared to steers receiving no trace mineral supplementation. The combination of utilizing hormone implants and supplementing steers at industry recommended concentrations of trace minerals produced the most favorable breakeven selling price of all costs. The findings of these experiments produced conflicting responses in regards to the effects of trace mineral supplementation on the growth rates of feedlot steers. These variable responses could be attributed to divergent mineral status, dietary concentrations of trace minerals, steer genetics, and growth rates. More research is warranted to better understand which mineral(s) may be responsible for producing a growth response in feedlot steers along with what concentrations are needed to optimize steer growth performance...|$|R
