She won universal acclaim and a National Film Award – Special Jury Award for her performance {{as a young woman}} with cerebral palsy in the coming of age drama Margarita with a Straw (2014). Koechlin also uses YouTube as a platform or forum for issues for which she advocates, appearing in videos including AIB's It's Your Fault, Culture Machine's <b>Printing</b> <b>Machine</b> and Noise and Y-Films's web-series entitled Man's World.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID <b>printing</b> <b>machine</b> was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E

25|$|The {{uprising}} started {{earlier than}} scheduled. The {{attacks on the}} governor and the chief prosecutor started on schedule but failed. The attacks on the post office and on the gun shop also failed. At 2 a.m. the prefectural office team went into the campus, but one of them was watched by a policeman on duty. The team broke into the office and set it on fire at 2:20, 20 minutes before the scheduled time. Kan Sōda, master of a small restaurant, rushed {{to the scene of the}} fire and was killed by Takeshi Kitamura, a member, who mistook Sōda for a person trying to resist them. He was the only fatality during the uprising. The newspaper team broke into the newspaper building amid confusion resulting from the fire and cut the belts of the <b>printing</b> <b>machine.</b> The power plant team arrived at the plant later than 3 a.m. and cut the 65,000 volt cable. The electricity of Matsue went off for the following three-and-a-half hours. The governor and the chief prosecutor were not in their houses since they had rushed to the prefectural office when it started to burn. The post office team succeeded in setting the dynamite but it failed to explode, although the fuse burnt. The gun shop team could not reach the shop.|$|E

Megha Shah of the GQ called her [...] "someone who can speak her mind, sound intelligent and also look stunning in a bikini". Members of the media have subsequently labelled her {{as a role model}} for women across the country.

500|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} had {{its origin}} in a <b>printing</b> <b>machine</b> designed in 1866 by Christopher Latham Sholes {{to assist in}} printing page numbers in books, and serial numbers on tickets and other items. Sholes, a Wisconsin printer, formed a partnership with Samuel W. Soule, also a printer, and together they began development work in Charles F. Kleinsteuber's machine shop, a converted mill in northern Milwaukee. Carlos S. Glidden, an inventor who frequented the machine shop, {{became interested in the}} device and suggested that it might be adapted to print alphabetical characters as well. In July 1867, Glidden read an article in Scientific American describing [...] "the Pterotype", a writing machine invented by John Pratt and recently featured in an issue of London Engineering. Glidden showed the article to Sholes, who thought the machine [...] "complicated and liable to get out of order", and was convinced that a better machine could be designed. To that point, several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in the United States and abroad. None of the machines, however, had been successful or effective products.|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because she wants her name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the <b>printing</b> <b>machine</b> and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E

2500|$|After the First World War {{there was}} a general {{shortage}} of housing in Britain, and much of it was crowded slums.

[...] The 1920s also saw the beginnings of the conversion of properties to a sewer drainage system, and electric lighting instead of gas on the streets. Further estates followed and by 1955 there were more than 1000 council houses. [...] Private housing was also expanded during this time, but was greatly reduced the Second World War.
