40|$|Abstract. By {{researching the}} {{characteristics}} of hydraulic torque forklifts, developed a device which achieved inching function. It can detect position of the handle, using Delta PLC controlled stepper motor driven screw movement, to achieve {{the control of the}} engine speed, and modify the control parameters via touch-screen on-site commissioning, to achieve a truck at idle operation, through the manipulation of the handle can Smooth and stable <b>pan,</b> <b>lift</b> or tilt operation, making operation more convenient forklift and reduces the operator's labor intensity, a high value market applications...|$|E
60|$|A low whistle made Pan jump. Blinky stood inside in a flare {{of light}} from an open door. He beckoned. <b>Pan</b> <b>lifted</b> the girl and carried her in.|$|R
60|$|She threw {{aside the}} blanket that {{partially}} covered her {{and got to}} her knees. <b>Pan</b> <b>lifted</b> {{her out of the}} wagon. Then he ran off toward camp to get a flask. Upon returning he found Blinky trying to put a blanket round Louise's shoulders. She threw it off.|$|R

60|$|He <b>lifted</b> <b>Pan</b> up on Curly and led {{the pony}} away from the roundup, {{out in the open}} where Pan espied his mother, eager and anxious with her big dark eyes strained.|$|R
50|$|Harryhausen {{gave the}} Cyclops a horn, furry goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea {{based upon the}} concept of the Greek god <b>Pan.</b> He <b>lifted</b> much of the {{creature}}'s design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the Ymir (the Venusian creature from his earlier 20 Million Miles to Earth). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latter's latex body.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{paused in}} his task of {{chopping}} wood. Joe Lake, on his knees, {{with his big}} hands in a <b>pan</b> of dough, <b>lifted</b> his head to stare. She had left off the somber black hood, and, although that made a vast difference in her, still {{it was not enough}} to account for what struck both men.|$|R
50|$|To make Matilda magically appear, Keith {{would produce}} an egg from two {{cardboard}} tubes, which were shown empty and then nested one inside the other. After cracking the egg, dropping its contents {{into an empty}} pan, and adding {{a few drops of}} hot sauce, Keith would place the lid on the <b>pan</b> and immediately <b>lift</b> the lid to reveal Matilda in all her glory. Her magic career would span well over a decade.|$|R
50|$|Indian folktales often {{tell stories}} of Krishna's {{competing}} wives, especially Rukmini and Satyabhama. A tale narrates how once Satyabhama, {{proud of her}} wealth, donated Krishna to the divine sage Narada and pledged {{to take him back}} by donating wealth to him as much as Krishna's weight. Krishna sat on one pan of a weighing scale and Satyabhama filled the other pan with all of the wealth, inherited from her father, but it could not equal Krishna's weight. The other wives, except Rukmini, followed suit but Krishna's pan did not leave the ground. The wives requested Satyabhama to approach Rukmini. A helpless Satyabhama asked her foremost rival, Rukmini, for help. Rukmini, who was kidnapped by Krishna, had no wealth of her own. She chanted a prayer and put the holy tulsi leaf in the other pan, as the symbol of her love; removing the wealth of Satyabhama and the other queens from the pan. Krishna's <b>pan</b> was suddenly <b>lifted</b> into the air and the other pan touched the earth, even though only a tulsi leaf in it.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative hand {{assessments}} are necessarv {{in order to}} not only accurately monitor the disease progress {{and the effect of}} therapy, but in the formulation of the therapy and as an aid to a closer understanding of the disease process. Current {{assessments are}} very subjective, being based on observations of everyday activities e. g. button fastening or using a knife and fork. Any measurements that are taken, e. g. grip ‘strength’ using an inflated cuff, are generally inaccurate. An objective assessment was formulated and constructed using strain-gauged measuring devices that were a blend of functional and strength tasks. The functional tasks included the measurement of the handle grip and <b>lifting</b> forces in <b>pan</b> and kettle <b>lifting</b> and the measurement of torque in key turning and cloth wringing out tasks. Strength measurements included power grip strength, which also gave the individual finger contribution, pulp and lateral pinch and the extension force. For ease of operation, the measurement devices were all linked via necessary electronic circuitry to a microcomputer. This was used to automatically select the required device, collect the data and calculate, display and store the results. The software provided a user friendly interaction to permit operation by non-technica...|$|R
