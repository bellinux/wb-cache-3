25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of <b>pulverizing</b> the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a {{heat recovery steam generator}} which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|E

Based on the Standard turbulent model, flow velocity, particle trajectories and ratio of <b>pulverized</b> coal drifting is analyzed by changing technical parameters including liquid-level, mass flux, particle size and particle concentration in gas phase. It can be concluded that ratio of <b>pulverized</b> coal drifting increases with the decrease of particle size and it enhances significantly if particle diameter is smaller than 60 μm; the extent of <b>pulverized</b> coal drifting seems not relative with solid concentration change within a low scope of solid concentration in gas phase...|$|R

25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. <b>Pulverizing</b> dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

In this paper, geological factors including the composition of coal petrography, the mechanical strength of coal petrography and coalbody structure destruction and engineering factors including drilling, fracturing and drainage were analyzed to study on the controlling factors on the output of <b>pulverized</b> coal. We conclude that the determinant on output of <b>pulverized</b> coal is the nature of coal seam, however engineering factors cause the output of <b>pulverized</b> coal directly. The root-mean-square amplitude attribute analysis was first used to display the mechanical strength of coal seam.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, <b>pulverized</b> coal from {{industry}} {{was used as}} the experimental material and sieved into seven samples with different particle size. The effect of particle size on the flow properties of <b>pulverized</b> coal was investigated. An annular shear cell was used to measure angle of internal friction, angle of effective internal friction, cohesion and angle of wall friction, and a transparent Perspex hopper was used to determine the discharge characteristics of <b>pulverized</b> coal. The experimental results showed a significant effect of particles size on the cohesive and angle of wall friction rather than on the angle of internal friction. Jenike's procedure was used to predicate the flow pattern of <b>pulverized</b> coal with different particle size, which linked with the discharge experiment. Three regions including arching, unstable-flow and mass-flow were obtained based on the analysis of weighting curves and a progressive transition from blocking to unstable flow and to mass flow was observed as the particle size increased. In addition, the failure properties of <b>pulverized</b> coal was investigated which supported the region division. The investigation showed that the effect of particle size on the flow properties of <b>pulverized</b> coal is diversity and rheological test results can reflect flow properties of <b>pulverized</b> coal to some extent...|$|R
40|$|Coal and gas outbursts are dynamic {{failures}} {{that can}} involve the ejection of thousands tons of <b>pulverized</b> coal, {{as well as}} considerable volumes of gas, into a limited working space within a short period. The two-phase flow of gas and <b>pulverized</b> coal that occurs during an outburst can lead to fatalities and destroy underground equipment. This article examines the interaction mechanism between <b>pulverized</b> coal and gas flow. Based {{on the role of}} gas expansion energy in the development stage of outbursts, a numerical simulation method is proposed for investigating the propagation characteristics of the two-phase flow. This simulation method was verified by a shock tube experiment involving <b>pulverized</b> coal and gas flow. The experimental and simulated results both demonstrate that the instantaneous ejection of <b>pulverized</b> coal and gas flow can form outburst shock waves. These are attenuated along the propagation direction, and the volume fraction of <b>pulverized</b> coal in the two-phase flow has significant influence on attenuation of the outburst shock wave. As a whole, <b>pulverized</b> coal flow has a negative impact on gas flow, which makes a great loss of large amounts of initial energy, blocking the propagation of gas flow.

25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the <b>pulverizing</b> action of the soil.|$|E
