2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium <b>polyacrylate</b> that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBranching was {{detected}} in <b>polyacrylates</b> synthesised through radical polymerization via solution-state NMR, while inconsistencies {{have been reported}} for {{the determination of the}} molar mass of hydrophilic <b>polyacrylates</b> using aqueous-phase and organic-phase size-exclusion chromatography. In this work, poly(sodium acrylate) s, PNaAs, of various topologies were separated for the first time using free-solution capillary electrophoresis (CE). Free-solution CE does not separate the PNaAs by their molar mass, similarly to separations by liquid chromatography in the critical conditions, rather by different topologies (linear, star branched, and hyperbranched). The electrophoretic mobility of PNaAs increases as the degree of branching decreases. Separation is shown to be not only by the topology but also by the end groups as expected for a separation in the critical conditions: replacing a relatively bulky nitroxide end group with hydrogen atom yielded a higher electrophoretic mobility. This novel method, capillary electrophoresis in the critical conditions enabled, for the first time, the separation of hydrophilic <b>polyacrylates</b> according to their topology (branching) and their chain ends. This will allow meaningful and accurate characterization of their branched topologies as well as molar masses and progress in for advanced applications such as drug delivery or flocculation...|$|R
