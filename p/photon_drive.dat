40|$|The linear size {{distribution}} of 218 {{galaxies in the}} IRAS infrared bright galaxy sample is studied by examining new measurements of the 1. 49 Hz radio continuum emitting regions. We find that the radio surface brightness varies {{over a wide range}} at a given luminosity, but its median scales approximately as luminosity to the power of 6 / 5. Consequently, the median effective radio size of galaxies in a given luminosity range actually decreases with increasing luminosity, especially among galaxies with LFIR greater than 10 exp 11 solar luminosities. The close correlation between FIR and radio fluxes of these star-forming galaxies then leads to a picture contrary to earlier theoretical predictions that the sizes of FIR emitting regions should increase with luminosity.

We find that whenever a sudden change occurs in the device, the current takes time to react to the abrupt change, overshoots, oscillates, and eventually settles down to a steady value.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between molecules and solid surfaces influence {{our daily lives}} in many ways. One important example is heterogeneous catalysis where surface reactions, for example, are used for production of chemicals and exhaust after-treatment. As surface reactions are complex, various different approaches are needed to explore the fundamental processes. One route is to study reactions at well-defined single crystal surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. However, as the reaction pathways may depend on pressure, ideally {{we would like to}} track how and if the interactions change with pressure. Furthermore, technical catalysts generally consist of nanometre-sized particles supported by an oxide material. This introduces the complexity of particle size-dependence, as well as effects arising from interactions between the reactants and the support material. The studies in this thesis range from fundamental studies in UHV to experiments under ambient conditions. Structure-wise, the studies encompass single crystal substrates and model catalysts. Furthermore, surface processes are stimulated by both thermal and photon energy.

In this vein, this work reports the photocatalytic reduction of Zn(II) to zinc metal using visible light. Heteroleptic bis-cyclometallated iridium complexes and zinc quinolates that form in situ are found to be effective photocatalysts. Zinc generating photoreactions are conducted on a custom-designed home-built photoreactor, with triethylamine (TEA) employed as the sacrificial reductant. Photocatalyst structure–activity relationships, ideal reaction conditions, and reaction kinetics are described for the iridium catalyzed reaction.

40|$|The use {{of quantum}} cascade lasers (QCLs) for laser {{feedback}} interferometry (LFI) has received significant attention since it enables {{a wide range}} of sensing applications without requiring a separate detector, and hence simplifies experimental apparatus [1]. LFA (based on the self-mixing effect) refers to the partial reinjection of the radiation emitted from a laser after reflection from a target; the injected radiation field then interacts with the intra-cavity field causing measurable variations of the QCL terminal voltage. The theory of LFI with conventional laser sources is well studied and explained by the Lang–Kobayashi model [2, 3]. However, while this enables the dynamic state populations and light interaction to be modelled, a linear relationship between the change in cavity light power, ∆P, and terminal voltage variation is commonly assumed, i. e. VSM ∝ ∆P [4, 5]. This is not strictly applicable to QCL structures since carrier transport is dominated by the mechanisms of electron subband alignment, intersubband scattering and <b>photon</b> <b>driven</b> transport between subbands with energy separations that change with applied bias (terminal voltage). We present experimental results of a QCL which departs significantly from this assumed linear behavior. We observe strong enhancement of the self-mixing signal in regions where the local gradient of the current-voltage (I–V) curve increases. We explain the origin of this signal using an extended density matrix (DM) approach [6] which accounts for coherent transport and interaction of the optical light field with the active region. The model is used to calculate the I–V characteristics of a bound-to-continuum (BTC) terahertz (THz) QCL and predict the effect of light variation on terminal voltage at a fixed drive current. This approach is shown to predict the experimental signal with good agreement...|$|R
