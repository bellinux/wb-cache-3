This thesis uses a multidisciplinary approach to combine two disparate areas of research namely marine biology and surface engineering, to develop a novel natural product (NP) based antifouling system. The overall objective of this thesis is to transfer a natural marine biological defence mechanism into an engineered antifouling coating system. By combining natural product extraction and incorporation into a trial coating an extensive test programme was able to investigate the antifouling performance and address the issues of bringing this active area of research to the next technological readiness level. By using a stepwise approach {{to the development of}} the engineered solution, a suite of techniques were used to fully characterise a NP based system. The biological and surface engineering techniques adapted and developed are described here and their future use to evaluate a novel NP based antifoulant system is critically assessed. After an extensive literature review, an ethanol extract from the red seaweed Chondrus crispus was selected as the natural product source. NP specimens were harvested locally and also purchased as industrially processed dried algae. The industrially <b>processed</b> <b>algae</b> showed good antifoulant activity (? 25 ?g mL- 1) in laboratory bioassays and had a greater efficacy than the locally harvested samples highlighting its potential as an economically viable solution. The direct incorporation of the NP into a commercial control depletion polymer binder, allowed for the rapid development of characterisation techniques to evaluate the effects this had on the performance of the NP-binder matrix. The feasibility of a range of electrochemical techniques to measure corrosion potential, impedance, resistance and water uptake in the NP coating was critically assessed. A combination of open-circuit potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provided a unique and rapid means to non-destructively measure the contribution of incorporated NPs to the degradation and water uptake of the binder film. Studies of biofilm growth were used to successfully measure community viability and structure using fluorescent staining and differential interference contrast microscopy. These techniques were found to be very informative on Southampton water marine biofilm community structure and were cross correlated by fourier transform infrared measurements. Resistance to biofouling was determined through field trials, an important testing platform for an antifouling system, and specifically trials which test the entire coated system including any primers and substrate preparation requirements. An initial NP antifouling performance greater than the booster biocide (Chlorothalonil) control was documented for one field trial over a period of the first 6 weeks. A key aspect was to determine the potential efficacy of NPs and their viability in a coating system. To achieve this, a range of standard and non-standard techniques were used to assess this novel combination of crude NP extract and commercial binder system. This work has shown that a limited antifoulant activity is achievable. By evaluating the effect of a NP on both the fouling community and a binder system this unique approach helps define key techniques to assess future NP antifoulants and identifies the optimisation required to increase their functionality...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{three separate}} lifecycle analyses {{to determine the}} emissions and fossil energy demand required to <b>process</b> <b>algae</b> biomass into renewable fuel and animal feed. A complete well-to-wheel fuel-cycle analysis is conducted {{for the production of}} biodiesel and jet biofuel from algae biomass. The environmental impacts of algae-based fuels for the road transportation and aviation industry are benchmarked against analogue conventional fossil fuels. This thesis demonstrates that algae biofuel production can only realize its inherent environmental advantage of reduced GHG emissions, once every step of the production chain is fully optimized and decarbonized. This includes smart co-product utilization, offsetting fertilizers through wastewater recycling, reusing exhaust gases as additional CO 2 source and using decarbonized electricity, heat and indirect energy. The definition of a Catalyst Sensitivity Index (CSI) demonstrates how catalytic efficiency increases can impact the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions balance of catalyst-dependent processes. The CSI will allow the industry to highlight ‘best practice catalysts’ and draw conclusions for what efficiency gains one could anticipate with higher performance catalysts. For countries where a decarbonized electricity and heat grid is not available to guarantee low-carbon algae fuel production and the looming resource scarcity around marine feed production has become more pressing, the alternative use of algae for aquafeed production is recommended. This thesis analyses major routes towards the future cost-competitive production of microbial biomass as sustainable fish meal and oil source to meet a global demand for depleting fish feed supplies. A comprehensive economic cost analysis and lifecycle assessment demonstrates the feasibility of replacing global fish meal and fish oil supplies with low-carbon and affordable algae feed by the year 2030.

With the expectation of fossil fuels being exhausted in the future, novel strategies need to be discovered for alternative energy generation. Biofuels such as acetone, butanol, ethanol, and hydrogen gas are gaining interest as high value energy sources. These fuels can be produced by anaerobic clostridia as metabolic byproducts of fermentation. The capability to produce these biofuels has been widely studied using glucose or other common feedstocks. Biofuels from renewable and industrial waste feedstocks such as algae and cheese whey may have significant implications on the efficiency of biofuel production, where the price associated with feedstocks is considered a major bottleneck in biotechnology <b>processes.</b> <b>Algae</b> and cheese whey are both rich in organic nutrients and can be utilized by clostridia to produce not only biofuels, but also bioacids, which are considered fuel intermediate compounds. Additionally, understanding microbial communities both in the biosphere and within bioreactors can provide knowledge on microbial relationships and novel microbes, and provide knowledge to optimize engineered systems for biofuels and bioremediation strategies. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of the Logan City Wastewater Lagoon System at the microbial level was executed.
