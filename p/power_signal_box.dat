25|$|The <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at New Street was {{completed}} in 1964. The signal box is a brutalist building with corrugated concrete architecture, designed by Bicknell & Hamilton in collaboration with William Robert Headley, the regional architect for British Railways London Midland Region. The four-storey structure is {{at the side of}} the tracks connected to Navigation Street. It is now a Grade II-listed building.|$|E
25|$|The Thames valley {{signalling}} centre {{will eventually}} replace older signalling {{control in the}} entire English Western region. The London area is due to switch over {{at the end of}} 2011, followed by the old Slough PSB (<b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box)</b> area. Attention will then be given to abolishing Oxford, Swindon A, Bristol PSBs and the 1990s Swindon B IECC. This will be followed by the elimination of the 1980s PSBs at Westbury and Exeter, and the 1970s Plymouth PSB, the 1960s PSB at Gloucester as well as substantial semaphore signalling in Cornwall.|$|E
500|$|Lambrigg ground frame, [...] {{south-west}} of {{the accident}} site, controls two crossovers, each one comprising two sets of points allowing trains to cross from one running line to the other in emergencies or during track maintenance work. These points are used only occasionally, operated locally after a release is obtained from Carlisle <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> They are normally locked in the main line [...] "running" [...] position. Early statements by Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley of British Transport Police suggested that investigations would focus on these points.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical lever {{frames and}} {{interlocking}} have now largely {{been replaced by}} modern, much larger electrical or electronic route interlockings located in <b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Boxes</b> and more recently Integrated Electronic Control Centres which are able to control much larger areas of the rail network.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} tracks from Severn Tunnel Junction through Newport to Cardiff Central, with two tracks on the {{remaining}} sections. Multiple-aspect signals are controlled from several <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> including Swindon, Bristol and two in Cardiff. Over the August Bank Holiday weekend 2016 control of the signals between Westerleigh Junction and Pilning was switched over to the Thames Valley Signalling Centre. These signals now carry the prefix 'BL'.|$|R
500|$|As part of {{this work}} four manual <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{replaced}} by three <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> and the semaphore signals and mechanical point linkages were replaced by colour light signals and point motors. The new Bristol Temple Meads East box was the largest on the GWR with 368 miniature levers operated by three signalmen assisted by a [...] "booking boy". The other two boxes were at Bristol Temple Meads West, and controlling the movements {{in and out of}} the new Bath Road Depot, which replaced the old B locomotive works in 1934.|$|R

2500|$|In 1967 further remodelling of {{the site}} took place and trains using Central Railway Station were {{diverted}} into the City Railway Station which became the main railway station serving the city. Central Railway Station was closed and has been demolished. The viaduct leading to Central Railway Station {{is one of many}} disused viaducts near Leeds Railway Station. [...] Engineering work included replacing 100-year-old bridges over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the construction of the south concourse & an overall roof, along with major platform and track layout alterations and the commissioning of a new <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> to control the railway station area.|$|E
5000|$|... 1933 Britain's first [...] "panel" [...] route-setting <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{opened at}} Thirsk.|$|E
5000|$|These were {{replaced}} on 13 June 1909 {{by a single}} box. This was a <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>box</b> which did not rely on the signalman's muscle power to operate points and signals. 120V motors were used with signals being held in the [...] "off" [...] position by electromagnets. 50 miniature levers were provided in the box to operate the points and signals. The frame was constructed by McKenzie and Holland {{at a cost of}} £2,800. This was the second <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> installation on the GWR and lasted for twenty years until replaced by a conventional mechanical signalling system on 30 July 1929. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> finally closed on 28 March 1971.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, the United Kingdom {{network was}} host to over ten {{thousand}} mechanical lever signalboxes. When British Rail was created from the Big Four private railway companies under the Transport Act 1947, they began to install <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> (PSB) at strategic locations such as Euston, Crewe, Doncaster, Rugby and Carlisle. The PSBs would remove the necessity for lots of individual boxes along a particular route and would pass control to one centralized location. Carlisle's PSB took over the responsibility of 44 <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> alone in the north west area.|$|R
50|$|In August 2008, a new {{electronic}} interlocking {{controlled by}} the Leipzig Operating Centre (Betriebszentrale) replaced seven locally operated <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> some using lever frames. It controls the train traffic between Weinböhla and Dresden-Neustadt. It replaced five mechanical interlockings of the Jüdel type and two <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> (Befehlsstellwerk) of S&H type. An automatic track vacancy detection system was not installed. Two dispatchers direct operations using the Sächsischen Befehlsblocks (Saxon command block) system. An upgrade and adaptation of these systems {{in the course of}} the German Unity Transport Project (Verkehrsprojekts Deutsche Einheit) No. 9 has not been possible as the regulations could not have been complied with. Many jobs were lost in relation to signalling, control of points and train detection. Of the seven <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> only <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 on the eastern side has been retained as a memorial.|$|R

50|$|The railway block {{signalling}} bell code {{is a system}} of bell rings used in Great Britain to communicate between manually operated <b>Signal</b> <b>Boxes</b> (the system is not used in modern <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> unless it is a fringe box to an older signalbox). Each <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> would have a bell circuit to the box {{on either side of}} it along the line. The equipment would consist of a plunger or tapper (rather like a Morse key) which if pressed, rings the bell in the neighbouring box. The neighbouring box would have a key for communicating back, therefore each box has a key which rings the bell in the other <b>box.</b> Where a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> communicates with more than one other box (in either direction along the line, and possibly along a branch line too), each bell would have a different tone, so that the signalman could tell them apart by ear.|$|R
5000|$|Railtrack {{initiated}} an upgrading of the Felixstowe {{branch line}} in 1997, {{the first time}} that it had done this speculatively in anticipation of it receiving increased revenue from freight train operators. The passing loop at Derby Road was extended so that two container trains could pass, the signalling replaced and transferred to the control of [...] <b>Power</b> <b>Signalling</b> <b>Box,</b> and the line speed was increased. The aim was to allow an hourly passenger train service to operate while accommodating more freight trains. The line as far as Felixstowe Beach was maintained to passenger standard in case a service to there is resumed in the future. Electrification was again considered as most Freightliner trains were by then being worked by electric locomotives to Ipswich where they had to be changed to diesel for the short trip to Felixstowe, but the cost of this could not be justified. The work cost £8,000,000 and was completed by June 1999.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, the SECR {{obtained}} {{powers to}} electrify their lines. At {{a meeting in}} 1913, SECR chairman H. Cosmo Bonsor expressed the opinion that the time was not right {{for the company to}} incur the heavy expenditure that electrification would incur. The outbreak of war meant the postponement of any plans to electrify suburban lines. With the passing of the Trades Facilities Act 1922, the SECR proposed to electrify a number of lines in three stages. The SEML was to be partly electrified as follows - Charing Cross and [...] to Orpington as part of Stage 1. Orpington to Tonbridge as part of Stage 2, which also included the electrification of the former SEML between Redhill and Tonbridge. Both stages only covered the working of local passenger trains on the lines that were electrified. Stage 3 was to extend the working to through passenger trains and freight. Permission was sought in 1922 to build an electricity generating station at Charlton, London. This was refused by the Electricity Commissioners, who insisted that the company bought electricity from an existing supply company. Objections to this by the SECR were not entertained. On 1 January 1923, the SECR became part of the Southern Railway (SR). The SR decided that the electrification system was to be 660 V DC third rail. The first station on the SEML to see electric trains was Orpington, which was the terminus for electric trains from Victoria via [...] and [...] public services commenced on 12 July 1925. In preparation for Stage 2 of the electrification, the lines between Charing Cross and Metropolitan Junction were remodelled. Semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals, with a new temporary manual <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> provided at Charing Cross. The lines serving Cannon Street were electrified. Electric trains were due to start on 1 December 1925, but power supply problems meant that the introduction of electric trains from Charing Cross and Cannon Street to Orpington was postponed until 28 February 1926. Cannon Street was closed from 5-28 June 1926 for alterations to the track layout and platforms. On 27 June, new four aspect colour light signals were brought into use between Cannon Street, Charing Cross and Borough Market Jn. New <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> came into service at the two termini, but Metropolitan Jn remained a manually-worked box, although it was provided with a new 60-lever frame. With the introduction of the new service on 28 June, a new station was opened at [...] On 30 June 1929, four-aspect colour light signals were introduced between [...] and [...] New <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were provided at [...] and Parks Bridge Jn, enabling seven manual boxes to be abolished. On 1 December 1929, four-aspect colour light signals were introduced between [...] and New Cross. A new power box at North Kent East Jn allowed the abolition of seven more manual boxes. The increased services provided by electric train meant that there were fewer paths available for freight trains to reach the marshalling yard at Hither Green. Therefore, the Greenwich Park Branch Line, which had closed on 1 January 1917 and thereafter was only used by freight trains as far as , was brought back into use on 30 June 1929 as far as the point at which it crossed the SEML, a new spur being provided to give access to Hither Green. The reopened section of line was also electrified and provided with four aspect colour light signalling.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for electrification, Aston's two mechanical signal boxes, Aston No. 1 and No. 2, were closed, semaphore signalling {{was replaced by}} multiple-aspect colour light signals and control transferred to the <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at Birmingham New Street.|$|E
50|$|Both Up and Down lines through Royston station are signalled bi-directionally, {{meaning that}} Royston {{is the only}} place on the Cambridge Line where a train can {{overtake}} one ahead of it. The Signalling is controlled by Kings Cross <b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{exceptional}} cases, district control {{offices were}} abandoned and Train Controllers appointed at key <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> (as in the London Midland Region of British Railways {{in the late}} 1960s), obviating the need for telephonic communication. This practice was followed by {{what has been the}} norm since the introduction of modern <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> schemes, viz. the traditional Train Controller's substitution by a senior Signalman, <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> Supervisor or Traffic Regulator, situated in the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> in 1986, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and the {{crossovers}} disappeared, and the tracks approaching the station were relaid to allow trains from any direction to enter or leave any platform.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1901 and 1905 Glasgow Central Station was {{refurbished}} {{and extended}} {{over the top}} of Argyle Street; and thirteen platforms were built. An additional eight-track bridge was built over the River Clyde; and the original four-track bridge was raised by 30 inch (0.76 m). [...] Bridge Street station then closed as a terminal station and the platforms were removed. The area previously occupied by the four bay platforms was used as carriage sidings for Glasgow Central Station; and the area previously occupied by the through platforms was used as running lines to Central Station. The remaining Caledonian Railway Clyde Coast services were extended to Glasgow Central Station and the remaining G&SWR services diverted to St Enoch station. A new signalling scheme for Glasgow Central in the 1900s led to {{the construction of a new}} <b>power</b> operated <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> It was cantilevered off the eight-track bridge; sitting suspended between the two river bridges. Signal installation commenced in October 1907; the west side was commissioned on 5 April 1908 and the remainder on 3 May 1908.|$|R
50|$|This {{junction}} {{along with}} Hest Bank North Junction and Bare Lane Junction forms a triangular junction with the WCML. This junction is controlled from Preston <b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box.</b> The section to Bare Lane was double track {{until the late}} 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} signal boxes found during the period during Ipswich was controlled by mechanical signaling. The last of these boxes closed in 1985 when the area was re-signalled and electrified. Currently all signals are controlled from Colchester <b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|E
50|$|The station {{buildings}} were subsequently demolished, {{but a number}} of engineers' sidings remain on the eastern side, along with the 1961 <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> that supervises the main line from the Scottish border southwards towards Alnmouth and a number of former railway staff cottages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absolute}} block system enables the safe working of trains between manual <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> As <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> installations are implemented covering a wide area of control, manual <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> are gradually being supplanted, and the {{absolute block}} system is now mostly confined to limited {{areas of the}} network that carry lighter and slower traffic (there are exceptions, such as the Great Western main line through much of Cornwall). As noted above all Network Rail RUSs point to lines where absolute block signalling is a bar to increased services (both passenger and freight trains). The problem is made worse by rationalisation in the 1960s which closed <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and made some absolute block sections of considerable length.|$|R
25|$|In around 1928 the London and North Eastern Railway re-signalled {{the station}} {{replacing}} its five <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> with two electrically controlled boxes, {{with the work}} {{carried out by the}} British <b>Power</b> Railway <b>Signal</b> Company.|$|R
5000|$|In 1935 the {{decision}} was made to resignal the station and approaches, replacing the 1904 electro-pneutmatic <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> system with an electrically operated system. [...] "Park Street" [...] and [...] "Paragon station" [...] <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were to be replaced with a single box; the running lines out of the station, including those controlled by the West Parade <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> were to be track circuited. The system was an early British example of electrical interlocking. 48 points were controlled, using thumb switches in the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> <b>Power</b> supply was from the Hull Corporation at 400V 50 Hz three phase, with a backup generator powered by a [...] Petter oil-engine. The main external system was electrified at 110V AC, with shunt signals at 100 or 55V AC; the point motors, previously electro-pneumatically operated were retained, with a [...] per hour [...] max. pressure compressor system, duplicated for redundancy. Signalling was electric lamp backlit. The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd was the main supplier of the equipment. A new <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was installed, a LNER type 13, resembling in architectural design the Southern Railway's Streamline Moderne <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> but with square corners.|$|R
50|$|Doncaster PSB (<b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box)</b> is a {{signalling}} centre on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) railway in the United Kingdom, principally {{covering the}} line from London to Edinburgh but also encompassing other lines diverging and converging to the ECML. The signal box celebrated its 25th birthday in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} closed in January 1968 and {{demolished}} shortly afterwards, and the North Curve was removed, {{in spite of}} much local opposition. The route of Fields Farm Road now uses the trackbed of the former curve. The name Trent remains however, perpetuated on the <b>Power</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> built in 1969.|$|E
50|$|It also acts as {{a fringe}} box to Preston <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> {{controlling}} the line towards Clitheroe and the single line via slotted signals, requiring both the signalman at Preston and Daisyfield, to give a release before a train can use the single line. The disused platforms are still visible from passing trains.|$|E
25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an {{automatic}} block system of safeworking with three-position <b>power</b> <b>signalling.</b> This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|R
5000|$|A {{remarkable}} innovation with {{a form of}} <b>power</b> <b>signalling</b> {{was installed}} at Stobcross. The station was in a very cramped site already heavily built up. At the east end, where the line emerged from the tunnel section, there was a sharp curve and a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had to be located there: [...] "Stobcross East". At the location where the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had to be located to allow the signalman to observe the passage and location of trains, there was inadequate space for a conventional box. The solution adopted was to build a master-and-slave system: a manned <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was placed where visibility of trains was convenient, and a dependent box with full interlocking {{was placed in a}} convenient space, but where visibility was poor. The latter box was normally unstaffed, and it was operated by hydraulic power from the staffed box, which contained the block instruments.|$|R
5000|$|In New South Wales, Australia, train {{controllers}} and the Telephone Train Control System {{have survived}} {{to the present}} under RailCorp, despite the advent of <b>power</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and other improved technical provisions for signalmen. These train controllers have gradually assumed theoretical and actual safe working responsibility, stemming from a process of consolidation and restructure in the 1980s and facilitated by considerable changes to the rules and regulations. The nett result of these changes was far-reaching, with fewer train controller positions, but an expanded train controller duty statement, diminished overall responsibility for signalmen (at least theoretically) and more direct involvement by train controllers in work previously managed by signalmen. It is doubtful that these changes have led to an overall improvement in train working efficiency and, significantly, {{it was not until}} circa 2000 that the train control system was ever properly enforced. With signalmen relieved of the right to make a large proportion of train working decisions themselves, the limitations of the train control system mentioned above became acutely apparent. Furthermore, the additional link in the chain of safety-critical communication has been identified as a risk by industry experts and railwaymen alike. The change, apparently influenced by a revised corporate outlook (since 1988) and a modern management culture with elements of postmodern business ideology, favoured a network overseen by a small number of controllers using a computerized, largely automated signalling system and simplified timetable. The old vertically integrated state-owned railway, which was operated almost solely by blue-collar workers, front-line managers such as station masters, with a small number of managers and engineers above, has fallen out of favour since the 1980s. Today, the railway and workforce generally have a greatly expanded, professionalized white-collar component, and the average railway employee's work is becoming less hands-on and more theoretical. However, owing to the retention of a colonial network, complex timetable and operational environment, real automation of the Sydney rail network and elimination of the traditional signalman role remains impracticable at this juncture. The deregulation and liberalization of the Sydney rail network, which began in the mid 1990s, remains in its preliminary stages. Should the virtual monopoly which CityRail has for passenger services over most of the network be dissolved, the traditional train control system, which evolved under the vertically integrated British railways of the early twentieth century, would probably be dissolved with it. This scenario is becoming increasingly likely, but its impact upon signalling and control remains indeterminate.|$|R
