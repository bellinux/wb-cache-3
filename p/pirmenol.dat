40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics of <b>pirmenol</b> enantiomers {{were investigated}} in coronary artery ligated mongrel dogs. Reduction in frequency of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) was determined following intravenous administration of 5 -mg/kg doses of racemic <b>pirmenol</b> (n = 5), (+) -pirmenol (n = 4), and (−) -pirmenol (n = 4), each given as a 5 -min infusion. Electrocardiographic signals and blood samples were obtained serially over a 4 -h period. <b>Pirmenol</b> enantiomer concentrations in plasma {{were determined by}} a stereospecific assay. Following the racemate dose, (−) -pirmenol had 47 % lower clearance and 33 % lower steady-state distribution volume than (+) -pirmenol. These differences could be mostly explained by stereoselective plasma protein binding, reflected in a 58 % higher unbound fraction for (+) -pirmenol compared with (−) -pirmenol following racemate administration. Unbound <b>pirmenol</b> distribution volumes were nearly identical for both enantiomers, and unbound clearance was only 16 % lower for (−) -pirmenol than (+) -pirmenol following administration of the racemate. Similar trends were observed for <b>pirmenol</b> enantiomers administered individually. Both <b>pirmenol</b> enantiomers were equally effective in arrhythmia suppression. The antiarrhythmic response of coronary artery ligated dogs to <b>pirmenol</b> was described by a sigmoid E max model, and {{no statistically significant differences}} were observed in the pharmacodynamic parameters [i. e., EC 50 (plasma concentration at 50 % of maximum drug effect), S (constant that reflects the sigmoidal shape of the effect–concentration curve), and EC 90 (plasma concentration at 90 % of maximum drug effect) ] for (+) -pirmenol, (−) -pirmenol, or <b>pirmenol</b> racemate...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiologic}} {{actions of}} <b>pirmenol,</b> an investigational class I antiarrhythmic agent, were evaluated in eight anesthetized dogs, 5 to 10 days after anterior myocardial infarction. Before {{administration of the}} drug, programmed ventricular stimulation failed to initiate nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) {{in any of the}} postinfarction dogs. After the cumulative administration of 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 mg/kg <b>pirmenol,</b> programmed stimulation initiated sustained VT in six of the eight postinfarction dogs tested, with one additional dog responding with reproducible nonsustained VT (15 to 20 monomorphic complexes) after <b>pirmenol</b> adminstration. Only one of eight postinfarction dogs tested remained noninducible throughout the primenol dosing schedule. Administration of <b>pirmenol</b> tended to increase ventricular excitation thresholds, relative (p p p < 0. 01 after 2. 5, 5, and 10, mg/kg) refractory periods between ischemically injured and normal noninjured ventricular myocardium. These findings suggest a potential for the provocation or aggravation of ventricular arrhythmias by <b>pirmenol</b> in the setting of recent myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>pirmenol</b> (a class I antiarrhythmic agent) as a converter of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was investigated. Forty patients without {{congestive heart failure}} or a history of sinus node disorder were randomly allocated to receive either intravenous <b>pirmenol</b> (50 - 100 mg) or placebo in a double blind trial. In 12 of 20 patients sinus rhythm was restored 2 - 16 minutes after <b>pirmenol,</b> and in 3 of 20 patients {{in the control group}} it returned within one hour. A nodal escape rhythm was seen during sinus slowing in one patient, but in other patients there was no sinus arrest, atrioventricular conduction disturbance, or hypotension. The ventricular rate was slightly increased in patients in whom sinus rhythm was not restored by <b>pirmenol.</b> The results indicate that <b>pirmenol</b> has an antifibrillatory effect on the atria. Sinus rhythm was restored rapidly after intravenous administration. It was well tolerated in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics of <b>pirmenol</b> {{were investigated}} in 12 patients with {{premature ventricular contractions}} (PVCs) after oral administration of racemic <b>pirmenol,</b> 100 mg and 200 mg every 12 hours. Holter monitoring was performed and serial blood samples were collected after the seventh doses. Plasma concentrations of <b>pirmenol</b> enantiomer were determined using a stereospecific liquid chromatographic assay. Clearance of total (-) -pirmenol was 20 % {{higher than that of}} total (+) -pirmenol, and the difference in unbound clearance was 45 % between enantiomers. Totalpirmenol showed a smaller difference because of stereoselective protein binding, with 25 % (100 -mg dose) or 27 % (200 -mg dose) higher fraction unbound for (+) -pirmenol than for (-) -pirmenol. Distribution volume was similar for both enantiomers. Dose-dependent clearance was observed for unbound pirinenol enantiomers, as both enantioniers showed 20 % lower unbound clearance at the higher dose. Antiarrhythmic effect (% reduction in PVCs from baseline) was correlated with plasma concentrations ofpirmenol using a sigmoid maximum drug effect model, and patients showed a large variability in their antiarrhythmic response to plasma concentrations of <b>pirmenol.</b> The media...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY <b>Pirmenol</b> (CI- 845), a new {{antiarrhythmic}} drug, was {{studied for}} the first time in humans to es-tablish a minimum effective i. v. dose in 10 patients with chronic, stable premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Infusions of 70 - 150 mg were associated with a 90 % or greater reduction in PVCs nine of the 12 times they were administered to six patients. Peak plasma concen-trations were 1. 0 - 3. 8 Ag/ml at the end of these infusions. At the same time, small but significant increases in diastolic blood pressure (4 mm Hg) and QTc interval (0. 01 second) were seen, but both values were within the normal range. <b>Pirmenol</b> was associated with no change in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, PR interval or QRS duration, renal, hepatic or hematologic function, or symptoms. Blood, plasma and free drug concentra-tions declined biexponentially after cessation of a 150 -mg infusion (n = 4), with a terminal half-life of 7 - 9. 4 hours. The therapeutic response, lack of toxicity, and relatively long half-life indicate that <b>pirmenol</b> is a promising antiarrhythmic agent. THERAPY of cardiac arrhythmias is limited by the small number of antiarrhythmic drugs available and in particular by their side effects. 1 2 <b>Pirmenol</b> (CI- 845, Parke-Davis) is a new antiarrhythmic agent that ha...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirmenol</b> is an investigational type 1 A {{antiarrhythmic}} drug {{the long-term}} efficacy {{of which has}} not been fully determined. Therefore the long-term efficacy of oral <b>pirmenol</b> in supprossing ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) was assessed in an open-label, dose-titration study. Twelve patients (eight men and four women; mean age 57 +/- 12 years) were treated for 24 to 36 months (mean 33 +/- 4). Seven had structural heart disease (three valvular heart disease, two ischemic heart disease, and two hypertensive heart disease) and five did not. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0. 63 +/- 0. 13. Exclusion criteria included 15 beats of ventricular tachycardia (VT), or prior failure of more than two antiarrhythmic drugs. Drug efficacy was assessed by 24 -hour ambulatory ECG monitoring performed every 3 months during the first year, every 4 months during the second year, and at 6 -month intervals during the third year. The mean hourly frequency of VPDs during the placebo phase was 732 +/- 608. Seven patients (58 %) were treated successfully with effective (> 75 %) long-term suppression of VPDs. Two patients (17 %) had a partial response with effective suppression of VPDs for the first 16 months and 5 months of treatment, respectively. Three patients falled to show consistent suppression of VPDs while receiving <b>pirmenol.</b> The daily dose of <b>pirmenol</b> ranged from 200 to 500 mg (mean 317 +/- 94 mg {{at the beginning of the}} study and 375 +/- 97 mg at the end). No proarrhythmic effects were identified during long-term treatment, and none of the patients withdrew from the study prematurely. Mild side effects included dry mouth, bad taste, and urinary hesitancy. We conclude that oral <b>pirmenol</b> maintains effective long-term suppression of VPDs in approximately 60 % of patients and is well tolerated during chronic administration. No proarrhythmic effects occurred during long-term treatment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Pirmenol</b> enantiomers in dog plasma were {{quantified}} using a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection at 262 nm. Racemic <b>pirmenol</b> {{and internal}} standard, (+) -propranolol, were isolated from dog plasma by a three-step extraction procedure using toluene, 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid and hexane, respectively. A chiral analytical column (Chiralcel OJ) was {{used with a}} mobile phase consisting of hexane [...] isopropanol [...] diethylamine (98. 9 : 1. 0 : 0. 1). Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range 0. 0200 - 5. 00 [mu]g/ml for each enantiomer. Precision of the method, expressed as coefficient of variation for nine quality control samples, was 7. 1 % for (+) -pirmenol and 6. 4 % for (-) -pirmenol. Bias was +/- 2. 2 % for (+) -pirmenol and +/- 1. 5 % for (-) -pirmenol in quality control samples...|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} action of the available K-channel blocking agents used to treat arrhythmias is to selectively inhibit the HERG + MIRP channels, which carry the rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (I-Kr). These antiarrhythmics, like sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide, have been classified as Class III antiarrhythmics. However, {{in addition to their}} beneficial effect, they substantially lengthen ventricular repolarization in a reverse-rate dependent manner. This latter effect, in certain situations, can result in life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Selective blockers (chromanol 29313, HMR- 1556, L- 735, 821) of the KvLQT 1 + minK channel, which carriy the slow delayed rectifier potassium current GO, were also considered to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF). However, I-Ks activates slowly and at a more positive voltage than the plateau of the action potential, therefore it remains uncertain how inhibition of this current would result in a therapeutically meaningful repolarization lengthening. The transient outward potassium current (I-to), which flows through the Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 2 channels, is relatively large in the atrial cells, which suggests that inhibition of this current may cause substantial prolongation of repolarization predominantly in the atria. Although it was reported that some antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, tedisamil) inhibit I-to, no specific blockers for I-to are currently available. Similarly, no specific inhibitors for the Kir 2. 1, 2. 2, 2. 3 channels, which carry the inward rectifier potassium current (I-kl), have been developed making difficult to judge the possible beneficial effects of such drugs in both ventricular arrhythmias and AF. Recently, a specific potassium channel (Kv 1. 5 channel) has been described in human atrium, which carries the ultrarapid, delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kur). The presence of this current has not been observed in the ventricular muscle, which raises the possibility that by specific inhibition of this channel, atrial repolarization can be lengthened without similar effect in the ventricle. Therefore, AF could be terminated and torsades de pointes arrhythmia avoided. Several compounds were reported to inhibit I-Kur (flecainide, tedisamil, perhexiline, quinidine, ambasilide, AVE 0 118), but none of them can be considered as specific for Kv 1. 5 channels. Similarly to Kv 1. 5 channels, acetylcholine activated potassium channels carry repolarizing current (I-KAch) in the atria and not in the ventricle during normal vagal tone and after parasympathetic activation. Specific blockers Of I-KAch can, therefore, also be a possible candidate to treat AF without imposing proarrhythmic risk on the ventricle. At present several compounds (amiodarone, dronedarone, aprindine, <b>pirmenol,</b> SD 3212) were shown to inhibit I-KAch, but none of them proved to be selective. Further research is needed to develop specific K-channel blockers, such as I-Kur and I-KAch inhibitors, and to establish their possible therapeutic value...|$|E
