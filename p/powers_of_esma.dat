40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Meroni doctrine {{in the light of the}} recent judgment in the ESMA case. The first part explains in detail the problem of delegation of powers in the EU from the perspective of the principal-agent theory and complements it with the analysis of the trade-off between different levels of independence and accountability of agencies. A simple economic model is developed to illustrated the relationship between the independence and accountability of an agency. It shows that it is the accountability mechanism that induces the agent to act, rather than the extent of his independence. The paper also explains the inter-temporal interactions between the principal and the agent on the basis of the incentives in place for the different players. The second part is devoted to analysis of the functioning of ESMA in the context of its delegated powers. After the presentation of main aspects of the regulatory framework establishing ESMA, the paper continuous with an analysis and interpretation of the discretionary <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>ESMA.</b> The rather rigid position of the Court of Justice in relation to the Meroni doctrine seems to be unsuitable to delegation of complex regulatory tasks. This is particularly evident in the case of financial markets. Finally, the judgment does not examine in any detail whether and how the principals - i. e. the EU and Member States - are best able to evaluate the quality of ESMA decisions and regulations and whether there are different but more effective accountability mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the institutional governance {{issues raised by}} Capital Markets Union (CMU). It suggests that the preferences of administrative actors {{are likely to have}} a determinative influence on the evolution of institutional governance as the CMU agenda rolls out. Specifically, the incentives, <b>powers,</b> and preferences <b>of</b> <b>ESMA</b> (the European Securities and Markets Authority) are likely to have strong effects on how institutional governance for the EU capital market develops. Member States’ preferences will continue to have a strong influence but this is most likely with respect to whether further centralization of institutional governance in the euro area will occur. The article also {{considers the}} likely pace and nature of the evolution of institutional governance for the EU capital market in light of the CMU agenda. It draws on the insights of experimentalist governance and on empirical observation <b>of</b> <b>ESMA’s</b> recent activities to suggest that incremental change, rather than a ‘big bang’ is likely, and that a further but gradual centralization of regulatory and supervisory governance will follow. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the CMU agenda injects an accelerating factor into this evolutionary process or, conversely, and by distracting the EU from necessary institutional reforms, disrupts incremental developments...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, and its {{companion}} article, {{is to examine the}} implications of the new European Securities and Markets Authority, established in January 2011. In the wake of the financial crisis, the case for institutional reform and for conferring regulatory and supervisory powers on a central EU authority became compelling. But any design for institutional reform of EU financial market regulation and supervision would have struggled to deliver an optimum model, given the necessity for compromise. The central difficulty is one of nuance. Where on the spectrum from national powers to EU powers, and with respect to regulation and supervision, should any new body's powers be placed if optimum outcomes are to be achieved? The question is further complicated by the different dynamics and risks of centralising rule-making and of centralising supervision/enforcement, even if there is considerable symbiosis between these different activities. This article considers ESMA's rule-making powers; it is accompanied by a companion piece on ESMA's supervisory powers. It examines the considerable powers which ESMA has been granted in the rule-making sphere and argues that ESMA is likely to lead to significant intensification of the EU rule-book for financial markets. While a uniform rule-book carries risks, there are countervailing benefits. There are also promising signs that ESMA may become an effective rule-maker and may prove an effective mechanism for managing the risks of the intensifying rulebook. But the institutional design model is flawed. Treaty restrictions have led to a troublesome compromise in terms <b>of</b> <b>ESMA's</b> design, particularly with respect to Commission control and ESMA independence. Overall, ESMA's design is under-ambitious with respect to rule-making. By contrast, as the companion piece argues, the extent <b>of</b> <b>ESMA's</b> supervisory <b>powers,</b> real and potential, may have pushed ESMA too high up the spectrum towards EU <b>powers.</b> Local supervision <b>of</b> the EU rule-book represents an important safety valve for the EU financial market, and should not be obstructed by over-centralisation. Once supervision was placed on the reform agenda, however, it was {{always going to be a}} challenge to draw the dividing line between <b>ESMA's</b> <b>powers</b> and those <b>of</b> national competent authorities. The line may, however, have been drawn too far on the side of operational centralisation...|$|R
40|$|In their {{assessment}} of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), adopted by the EU in April 2004 and implemented at Member State level {{by the end of}} 2007, Karel Lannoo and Diego Valiante find that the legislation has been remarkably successful in terms of improving market structure and efficiency. In their view, the upcoming MiFID review should therefore take a 'light touch', clarifying some definitions and extending price transparency to related segments of securities markets. They argue that more integrated price transparency solutions will also allow end-users to fully participate in the changes brought about by MiFID, restoring investors' trust and pushing more liquidity in equity markets.

Furthermore, some of her earlier songs also show strong Western influences, including Kod, kodak (1966), Devojka i pesna (1966), Makedo (1966), Pjesma Šeher Sarajevu (1970) and Djurdjevdan, Djurdjevdan (1972).|$|R

40|$|The European Union {{reacted to}} the (several) crisis – financial, of the public debt, economic, {{and in some ways}} existential – with a {{centralization}} of many relevant functions (the budget area and banking supervision are two such examples). Compared to this trend, the first reform, dating back to 2011 – the establishment of the European System of Financial Supervision and of the European Supervisory Authorities – is a ‘weak model’ of enhanced cooperation. However, European financial regulation does not follow one single model of division of competences between the European authorities and national ones: in the area of credit rating agencies (CRAs) and for some aspects of derivatives (such as trade repositories (TRs)), supervisory competences have been given to the Esma. Hence, a remarkable centralization has taken place. Is this delegation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> legitimate? The paper examines the current normative framework and the first years of activity <b>of</b> the <b>Esma,</b> in particular through the analysis of its practices in the area of CRAs. The paper concludes that recent decisions <b>of</b> the <b>ESMA</b> do not follow the criteria set forth by the Court of Justice in the short selling case in order for delegation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> to technical authorities to be legitimate and calls for a broader implementation of procedural rights and duty to give reasons by the most powerful EU financial authority...|$|R
