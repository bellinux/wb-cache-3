5|$|After Kennedy's assassination, Congress {{altered the}} Secret Service's mandate to include {{protection}} for <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates.</b> The remaining candidates were immediately protected under {{an executive order}} issued by Lyndon Johnson, putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E

5|$|After eight {{straight}} days of campaigning, Thompson {{concluded the}} first leg of his tour on July 14. Like all other Republican <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> except Congressman Tom Tancredo, Thompson chose to skip the July 12 presidential debate sponsored by the NAACP.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{was once}} close friends with Clay, though the {{friendship}} between them cooled when Hawes supported Zachary Taylor instead of Clay {{for president in}} 1848. When the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s, Hawes became a Democrat, supporting <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> James Buchanan in 1856 and John C. Breckinridge in 1860.|$|E
5|$|Romney campaigned heavily for Republican {{candidates}} in the 2010 midterm elections, raising {{more money than the}} other prospective 2012 Republican <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates.</b> Beginning in early 2011, Romney presented a more relaxed visual image, including more casual attire.|$|E

50|$|Since 2002, the Libertarian Party of Alabama has {{not been}} able to collect the nearly 60,000 raw {{signatures}} that would be required to regain statewide ballot access.

In 2004 <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Michael Badnarik appeared on the ballot as an independent. In 2008 <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Bob Barr appeared on the ballot as an independent. In 2012 <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Gary Johnson appeared on the ballot as an independent.|$|R

5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for {{two days}} before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death {{prompted}} the protection of <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey, the sitting Vice President {{at the time and}} also a presidential candidate, later {{went on to win the}} Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 Super Tuesday tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a deadly}} tornado outbreak which affected the Southern United States {{and the lower}} Ohio Valley on February 5 and 6, 2008. The event began on Super Tuesday, while 24U.S. states were holding primary elections and caucuses to select the <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> for the upcoming presidential election. Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, and Tennessee were among the affected regions in which primaries were being held. Some voting locations were forced to close early due to the approaching severe weather.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|About {{one year}} before {{entering}} the race, Tancredo won the Macomb County Straw Poll in Michigan on July 5, 2006. He received 60 of the 327 votes cast or 18% of the vote. Tancredo beat out the second-place finisher Rudy Giuliani by 15 votes. On February 13, 2007, the American Conservative Union issued ratings for potential <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> for the 2008 election. Tancredo took first with a lifetime ranking of 99 out of 100. The website ConservativesBetrayed.com polled 525 people who attended CPAC 2007, and 88.1% believed that Tancredo would govern as a conservative. Newt Gingrich polled next at 87.9%.|$|E

5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk, many people, including most rival <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates,</b> were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions of <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> that preceded the Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He {{initially}} supported General Winfield Scott, but really wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, Donald Trump {{supporters}} from Aurora, Indiana made {{national news}} for operating a parade float that explicitly depicted <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Hillary Clinton being murdered by fellow <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Donald Trump.|$|R
50|$|Mountaga Tall was {{selected}} as a <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> by the National Congress of Democratic Initiative (CNID) on 15 January 2012 in Bamako. The lawyer was a <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> in 1992, 2002, and 2007.|$|R

5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> and never did again.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{politics}} are generally {{dominated by the}} Republican Party. Since statehood, Republicans have carried the state's electoral votes in all but five presidential elections: 1896, 1912 (By Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party), 1932, 1936 and 1964. Only Alaska has been carried fewer times by Democrat <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates.</b> Not even George McGovern, the Democratic nominee in 1972 {{as well as a}} native South Dakotan, was able to carry the state. Additionally, a Democrat has not won the governorship since 1974. As of 2016, Republicans hold a 15% voter registration advantage over Democrats and hold large majorities in both the state House of Representatives and Senate.|$|E
