5|$|In 1907 the A2 class steam {{locomotive}} was introduced. There were 185 locomotives {{in this class}} and they were Victorian Railway's main <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> until {{the arrival of the}} diesel electric B class in 1952. On 20 April 1908 the Sunshine train disaster occurred, killing 44 passengers in the worst Victorian railway accident.|$|E
5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's {{projected}} {{design of}} express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{was not ready}} for introduction during the summer timetable of 1925, so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh. This batch {{was part of an}} outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond’s unsuccessful 4-cylinder F13, G14 and P14classes 4-6-0s into 2cylinder H15class locomotives. Only the five F13s were converted to H15s; the remaining ten G14 and P14s (Nos.448457, renumbered E448E457) were rebuilt as N15s, implementing modifications to Urie’s original design.|$|E

5|$|The museum hosts {{a number}} of annual events and some {{one-time}} railroading events that bring rail fans from across the country. In 2012, the Bob Julian Roundhouse was the stage for all 20 of Norfolk Southern's Heritage locomotives during a two-day photographic event. In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam <b>Passenger</b> <b>locomotive,</b> visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation. This notable locomotive remained in Spencer for repair and restoration work {{to allow it to}} once again pull passenger excursions across the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{due to the fact that}} they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E

5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> designs {{which would}} be {{compared}} were: London Midland Region (former LMS) Princess Coronation class, Eastern Region (former LNER) Class A4, Southern Region (former Southern) Merchant Navy class and Western Region (former GWR) 6000 Class or King class.|$|E
25|$|The two additional, partly built H class {{locomotives}} remained incomplete while wartime {{production of}} armaments (and later postwar rebuilding of badly run-down infrastructure) took precedence over express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> construction.

25|$|The AA {{class was}} an express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> that {{ran on the}} Victorian Railways between 1900 and 1932. The largest, {{heaviest}} and most powerful 4-4-0 steam locomotive to run in Australia, it was the final development of this locomotive type in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The A2's {{principal}} express passenger role {{continued into}} the postwar years as the VR, struggling with a backlog of repairs and limited capital expenditure, deferred new <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> construction.

25|$|Most Soviet, Czech (the USSR ordered {{passenger}} {{electric locomotives}} from Skoda), Russian and Ukrainian locomotives can operate on AC or DC only. For instance, VL80 is an AC machine, with VL10 a DC version. There were some half-experimental small series like VL82, which could switch from AC to DC and {{were used in}} small amounts around the city of Kharkov in Ukraine. Also, the latest Russian <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> EP10 is dual-system.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, Victoria's express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet {{was almost}} {{exclusively}} {{made up of}} 4-4-0 designs of the Old A, New A, {{and the most recent}} AA class. These locomotives reflected contemporary British locomotive practice (as did the VR's fleet of 0-6-0 goods locomotives), in no small part due to the Victorian Government having appointed, in 1884, a Midland Railway manager, Richard Speight, as its first Chief Railways Commissioner. The Commissioners then asked British locomotive engineer Edward Jeffreys to design five standard types of locos, in partnership with the British locomotive manufacturer (Kitson & Co. of Leeds).|$|E
25|$|David Jones {{had worked}} at Lochgorm since 1855, where he had moved {{at the age of}} 21 after serving his {{apprenticeship}} with the London & North Western Railway. He became locomotive supervisor in 1870. His first design was a 4-4-0 <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive,</b> with the double chimney that became standard on his Highland Railway locomotives. Ten were built by Dübs & Co. in 1874, and between 1878 and 1888 another seven were built by the Highland at Lochgorm. The tenders had six wheels, but considered small. All were still in service in 1907, but in 1923 only five had survived.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainline}} <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotives</b> later {{classified as}} B class {{ran on the}} Victorian Railways between 1862 and 1917. Utilising a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement to allow greater traction on the heavily graded new lines to Ballarat and Echuca rather than the 2-2-2 arrangement previously selected for VR's Geelong line, these highly successful <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotives</b> are regarded as the first mainline VR locomotives.|$|R

25|$|The 'Castle' Class were a {{powerful}} 4-6-0 <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> with large tenders that ran on two bogies. From 1900 {{a total of}} twelve were built, the last two in 1910/11, and they worked between Perth and Inverness. One was fitted in 1912 with a Phoenix superheater, but this was later removed. Between 1903 and 1906 seven tank engines were built at Lochgram, three 0-6-0s for shunting and four 0-4-4s for branch services. Six 'Big Bens' followed, similar to the 'Small Bens' but with slighter larger boilers. In 1909 and 1911 twelve 0-6-4 tank engines were built, designed for banking.|$|E
25|$|The PRR had {{a design}} style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a PRR {{trademark}} that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the U. S. PRR also used track pans extensively to retrieve {{water for the}} locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the PRR had a clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive. Smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive.</b> Otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp {{at the top and}} a steam-driven turbo-generator behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} July 1951 the Victorian Minister for Transport {{announced}} that the remaining 28 X class locomotives were to be converted to PBC operation. Victorian Railways went on to convert express <b>passenger</b> <b>locomotive</b> R707 to PBC operation and {{went as far as}} placing tenders {{for the construction of a}} further 15 new brown-coal fired X class locomotives. However, by 1957 the price of PBC had doubled against a fall in the price of fuel oil and the increased availability of high quality NSW coal at good prices. This, coupled with the demonstrated efficiency and economical operation of B class mainline diesel-electric locomotives introduced in 1952, made the high cost of installing storage and transport facilities for PBC uneconomic. The additional X class order had already been cancelled in favour of additional B class locomotives, and in January 1957 Victorian Railways announced the discontinuation of PBC operation and the intention to return X32 and R707 to black coal firing. X32, taken out of service in May 1956 pending repairs, was instead scrapped in August 1957.|$|E
