50|$|The film {{begins with}} an account of impoverished {{families}} living on the North-West coast of the United States having taken up arms smuggling to support themselves and their families. A group of said smugglers have just received a shipment of high tech weapons, including one-man <b>portable</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers,</b> but are intercepted and slaughtered by a rival group who take the weapons for themselves. One member of the first group escapes, but is tracked down and killed, along with his wife; only their daughter Alex survives.|$|R

In The Enforcer, Callahan doesn't lose it, however he doesn't employ it to kill the final villain (in favor of a <b>portable</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher).</b> Additionally, in Sudden Impact, Callahan {{temporarily}} upgraded to a [...]44 Automag. Contrary to popular belief, it was not an AMT firearm, but an original AMP AutoMag built specifically for that film.|$|E
5000|$|Swelled by {{thousands}} of new recruits and an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of heavy weapons, PLAN undertook more direct confrontations with the security forces in 1973. Insurgent activity {{took the form of}} ambushes and selective target attacks, particularly in the Caprivi near the Zambian border. On the evening of 26 January 1973 a heavily armed cadre of about fifty PLAN insurgents attacked a police base at Singalamwe, Caprivi with mortars, machine guns, and a single tube, man <b>portable</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b> The police were ill-equipped to repel the attack and the base soon caught fire due to the initial rocket bombardment, which incapacitated both the senior officer and his second in command. This marked {{the beginning of a new}} phase of the South African Border War in which the scope and intensity of PLAN raids was greatly increased. By the end of 1973, PLAN's insurgency had engulfed six regions: Caprivi, Ovamboland, Kaokoland, and Kavangoland. It had also successfully recruited another 2,400 Ovambo and 600 Caprivian guerrillas. PLAN reports from late 1973 indicate that the militants planned to open up two new fronts in central South West Africa and carry out acts of urban insurrection in Windhoek, Walvis Bay, and other major urban centres. Until 1973, the South African Border War was perceived as a matter of law enforcement rather than a military conflict, reflecting a trend among Anglophone Commonwealth states to regard police as the principal force in the suppression of insurgencies. The South African police did have paramilitary capabilities, and had previously seen action during the Rhodesian Bush War. However, the failure of the police to prevent the escalation of the war in South West Africa led to the SADF assuming responsibility for all counter-insurgency campaigns on 1 April 1974. The last regular South African police units were withdrawn from South West Africa's borders three months later, in June. At this time there were about 15,000 SADF personnel being deployed to take their place. The SADF's budget was increased by nearly 150% between 1973 and 1974 accordingly. In August 1974, the SADF cleared a buffer strip about five kilometres wide which ran parallel to the Angolan border and was intensely patrolled and monitored for signs of PLAN infiltration. This would become known as [...] "the Cutline".|$|E
50|$|In 1954, {{during the}} siege of Dien Bien Phu, France had {{dismantled}} and flown {{in a number of}} M-24 Chaffee light tanks. Their thickest armor was only 25.4 mm. The Viet Minh's main infantry antitank weapon was the old World War Two U.S. 2.36-inch bazooka, captured from Nationalist Chinese forces and supplied by Communist China. During the siege the French launched counterattacks using the M-24 in support of their infantry. One Chaffee took seven hits from 2.36-inch bazookas and still continued to fight, demonstrating that <b>portable</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> were hardly a flawless tank-killer.|$|R
50|$|The Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) is a shoulder-launched rocket weapon, also {{designed}} by Israel Military Industries, {{with the primary}} function of being a <b>portable</b> anti-armor <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b> It {{was introduced to the}} U.S. armed forces in 1984.

50|$|The RPG-28 {{shares a}} close {{resemblance}} with the RPG-27 {{in that it}} is a <b>portable,</b> disposable anti-tank <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> with a single shot capacity. The RPG-28 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-27 which enables the RPG-28 to achieve higher armour penetration performance. The PG-28 round is a 125 mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 12 kg and a range of 300 meters. The round has a stated penetration capability in excess of 1000 mm RHA (after ERA) and 3000 mm of brick. Loaded weight is 13.5 kg.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} rockets {{documented in}} imperial China consisted of arrows modified by the attachment of a rocket motor to the shaft {{a few inches}} behind the arrowhead. The rocket is propelled by the burning of the black powder in the motor. (These rockets {{should not be confused}} with [...] "rocket arrows" [...] which are conventional arrows carrying small tubes of black powder as an incendiary that ignites only after the arrow reaches its target. A fuse is lit before release of the arrow.) The <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> were constructed of wood, basketry, and bamboo tubes. The <b>launchers</b> divided the <b>rockets</b> with frames meant to keep them separated, and the launchers were capable of firing multiple rockets at once.

(The original Wujing Zongyao was compiled between 1040 and 1044 and described the discovery of black powder but preceded the invention of the rocket. Partial copies of the original survived and Wujing Zongyao was republished in 1231 during the Southern Song Dynasty, including military developments since the original 1044 publication. Historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original and 1231 versions, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD.)6 The 1510 Wujing Zongyao describes the [...] "long serpent" [...] <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> constructed of wood and carried with a wheelbarrow, and the [...] "hundred tiger" [...] <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> made of wood and capable of firing 320 rocket arrows.
