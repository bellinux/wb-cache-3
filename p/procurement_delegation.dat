40|$|Economic {{theory and}} the empirically {{observed}} behaviour of agents are often challenging to match because of the richness of aspects that influence the acting of economic agents. Theory, {{on the other hand}} requires a limited number of clearly defined dimensions to be able to derive stringent arguments and conclusions. This work attempts to contribute to economic research by attempting both to retrace the real-life behaviour of agents, to validate and match findings against existing theory as well as to contribute to new theory. Following a long standing tradition among researchers in industrial organization, as e. g. put forward by Tirole (2003), Chapter 2 presents results from detailed case study interviews in procurement in the automotive industry, thus exploiting the broad array of aspects that any complex empirical problem has. Chapter 3 then presents a narrowly focussed econometric analysis of one particular aspect that has been identified in the previous case study interviews, based on a second survey data set. Chapter 4 discusses a theoretical work that is technically closely related to a well established model in industrial organization, Hotelling, and applies this to the international trade context. All chapters are self-contained research papers, and every chapter is followed by its bibliography and appendix. In Chapter 2, my co-authors, Florian MÃ¼ller and Konrad Stahl, and I report on the results of a series of case study interviews with senior managers of suppliers as well as input procurers in the German automotive industry. With this research we attempt to fill the gap between theory building and empirical observation and testing, by introducing a case study approach in which the discussed questions are based on theory, and the context in which they are raised is specified to an extent that allows the reexamination of existent theory, and new theory building. Hypotheses to explain and to evaluate the observed interactions or to identify the need for further theoretical and empirical studies are derived. Among others, we find that the hold-up by suppliers is washed out by contractual interdependence, and in particular by repetition. On the other hand, we assess upstream innovative efforts to be inefficiently small because complementarity effects as well as effort results are not fully internalized. Further theoretical investigation related to inducing innovation and the allocation of risks in the value chain we consider especially interesting. A more detailed empirical analysis would be justified, among others, concerning the differences in contracting between varying types of procured parts and the organization of manufacturing along the value chain. Chapter 3 succeeds the case study interviews discussed in Chapter 2 and concentrates on a single aspect in automotive <b>procurement,</b> <b>delegation</b> versus centralization, based on a different, larger, and more focused set of data that was generated in a survey of the German automotive industry. This industry is characterized by several stages or tiers of production. Automotive manufacturers (OEMs) in some instances directly negotiate with sub-suppliers of their direct or tier 1 suppliers. This strategy is generally referred to as directed business in the industry. I provide evidence on the use of directed business and match the empirical evidence to the theory of delegation versus centralization. Directed business, or centralization of contracting, decreases the informational rents of the tier 1 supplier as predicted by theory. In addition, I show that directed business includes higher development effort by the OEM and (weakly) reduces incentives of the tier 1 supplier to produce sufficient quality. Chapter 4 presents a model with differentiated goods applied to the context of international trade and is a joint work with Andrey V. Ivanov. The literature related to the "innocent bystander problem'' (Krugman, 1991) predicts that when a subset of countries enters into a free trade agreement (FTA), {{the rest of the world}} suffers in welfare. We present a trade model with horizontally differentiated goods, in which in contrast to the literature, under some conditions the non-FTA-participating countries can also gain in welfare. The main drivers behind this positive result are the size asymmetry of the countries and the inability of firms to perfectly price-discriminate across countries...|$|E

40|$|Public {{procurement}}, {{the generic}} {{term used to}} refer to procurement contracts (traditional <b>procurement),</b> public service <b>delegations</b> (including concessions) and public private partnerships, currently represents today significant amounts of money as it is believed to account for nearly 15 % of the GDP in France. Whilst the public procurement system must strive to achieve the best possible performance in terms of cost and service, its inefficiency is highlighted on a regular basis. In (actual) fact, substantial gains could be achieved through a more efficient management of the system. The present Note examines potential avenues of action, in the framework of the regulatory changes currently under way at European level, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the public procurement system. The contracts upon which the public procurement system is based are subject to certain asymmetries of information (in that the company is more familiar with its costs and the economic environment than the public party) and contractual incompleteness (since it is impossible to foresee every possible event that might arise during the execution of the contract). This being the case, the economic analysis recommends that competitive forces be used wherever possible when it comes to selecting partners and that incentive mechanisms be put in place to establish a real commitment of the parties concerned. New European Directives regarding procurement contracts and concessions, approved in 2014 and expected to be transposed by 2016, will give public authorities greater flexibility to negotiate with companies at both the selection stage and the execution stage (renegotiation). We believe this change to be a positive and economically justified one. It is, however, crucial that it be supported by specific terms governing its management that are not currently outlined in the Directives. Our recommendations are based on three key avenues, namely transparency, competition and expertise. The negotiation procedure must be supported by transparent information both prior to and following negotiation. During the execution stage, it must be possible for amendments to contracts to be contested without debilitating the process by facilitating {{an increase in the number}} of futile appeals. We also put forward a number of recommendations designed to encourage greater transparency where public procurement is concerned. For the purposes of intensifying competition at the tendering stage it would be useful to limit the number of electronic information platforms and to merge them towards a high-performance standardised model. At the same time, it is advisable to simplify procedures, to increase the professionalisation of public buyers and to centralise the most standard of purchases in order to benefit from economies of scale and pool the experience of public buyers. Finally, with regards to large-scale projects, we would recommend that a comparative evaluation be performed beforehand in order to determine the most appropriate public procurement tool to meet the needs of the public authorities concerned. The agency responsible for this prior evaluation would also perform ex post evaluations with a view to drawing lessons regarding the various tools and procedures available...|$|R
