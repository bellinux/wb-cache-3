50|$|Although a {{powerful}} engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some {{problems that can}} be solved easily. One of the few problems is oil <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> problems leading to broken timing belts. The oil <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8(grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the oil <b>pump</b> <b>gear.</b> Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the balance shaft belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the balance shaft's oil seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the balance shaft belt or the balance shaft assemblies altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The balance shafts are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> A marine <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> {{uses the}} meshing of <b>gears</b> to <b>pump</b> fluid by displacement.1 They {{are one of}} the most common types of pumps for {{hydraulic}} fluid power applications.Gear pumps are also widely used in chemical installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations; external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> which use two external spur gears, and internal <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). <b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution.

5000|$|At {{the bottom}} of the stroke, the exhaust valve to the {{condenser}} is closed and the equilibrium valve is opened. The weight of the <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> draws the piston up, and as the piston comes up, steam is transferred through the equilibrium pipe from above the piston to {{the bottom of}} the cylinder below the piston.|$|E
5000|$|Until 2010 this {{engine was}} a dual {{overhead}} cam design with one cam actuating the injectors {{and the other}} the valve train. This injection system is known as HPI (high pressure injection) where the injectors are cam-actuated to create injection pressure. The fuel system uses an Integrated Fuel System Module (IFSM) with a lift <b>pump,</b> <b>gear</b> pump, pressure regulators, shutoff valve, metering and timing actuators to deliver fuel to the injectors. It has a one piece valve cover that is either plastic or on older models a chrome plated steel cover otherwise known as the Signature 600 or ISX CM570.|$|E
5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the {{regulator}} valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the <b>pump</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of the pulsation of flow and pressure {{as well as the}} increase of the mean flow of a displacement pump will be a benefit to many technical processes, especially in the pharmaceutical industry and in biomedicine. By reducing the flow pulsation, microreactors could work more efficiently and thin-film coatings or fluids in biomedical applications could be applied with more precision. This article presents a new toolbox to analyse and compare different types of gerotor <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> profiles. The main objective was the development of a toolbox to analyse the mean flow and the flow ripple of theoretical and reverse engineered gerotor gear sets. For that reason, the presented toolbox does not work with analytic functions, but with numerical methods based on point cloud data. A comparison of four different profile types shows that these profiles perform very differently if they are limited by a given maximal outer root diameter and by the numbers of the teeth of both rotors...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 27 A major {{chemical}} company has implemented a cost reduction and performance enhancement via universal joints on a melt pump application. The melt pump {{is used to}} push molten polyethylene through a die to produce pellets. The pump takes material at 30 psig and 200 C (390 F) and discharges at 3000 psig. Misalignment between the gearbox and melt <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> centers is approximately one degree. The authors jointly studied the existing {{problems associated with the}} gear spindles (high angle gear coupling) : primarily reduced life, high maintenance, and high repair costs {{due in large part to}} high operating temperatures and the seal design of gear spindle at high misalignment, and proposed block style universal joints to solve the problems. The universal joints replaced the gear spindles supplied originally by the pump manufacturer. This paper demonstrates the block style universal joints were able to: ?	Significantly reduce plant downtime. ?	Eliminate high repair costs associated with gear spindles, for the chemical company. ?	Reduce wear and tear on the melt pump compared to gear spindles. ?	Improve yield (or production) through superior performance and reliability. ?	Reduce noise levels. These block type universal joints have been running for over five years now and have been inspected once after 24 months of operation with only general wear and tear from normal operation.

40|$|In most {{industrial}} settings, {{energy consumed}} by pumping systems {{is responsible for}} {{a major part of}} the overall electricity bill. In some cases, the energy is used quite efficiently; in others, it is not. Facility operators may be very familiar with pumping system equipment controllability, reliability, and availability, but only marginally aware of system efficiency. There are some good reasons to increase that awareness: As budgets shrink and the intensity of both domestic and international competition increases, the pressure to find additional methods to reduce operating costs will grow. The reliability of pumps correlates with their efficiency; that is, pumps operated near their design, or best efficiency point, will tend to perform more reliably and with greater availability. More frugal and efficient use of the earth's limited natural resources is essential. The cost of energy consumed by pumps usually dominates the pump life cycle cost. Many end users, already strained to support day-to-day facility operations, lack the time and resources to perform a methodical engineering study of the many pumps within their facilities to understand their associated energy costs and the potential opportunities for energy savings. Under the auspices of the United States Department of Energy's (USDOE) Motor Challenge Program, screening guidance documents and computer software have been developed to help end users, consultants, and equipment distributors recognize, both qualitatively and quantitatively, pumping system efficiency improvement opportunities. A key element in the Motor Challenge optimization strategy is to encourage a systems approach to how motors, drives, and motor-driven equipment are engineered, specified, operated, and maintained by industry. Because pumps have been identified as the single largest end use application, accounting for 25 % of motor systems energy use in all manufacturing industries in the United States, they are a natural target in any effort to improve motor-driven systems' energy consumption. The general thesis of this approach is that it is more important to gain a measure of the overall system efficiency or effectiveness than to focus on individual components. The elements that comprise the systems approach and their general order of review (in reverse sequence) are: ultimate system goal or purpose piping system, <b>pump,</b> <b>gear</b> or coupling, motor, adjustable speed drive (if applicable), motor starter, transformer.

5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic <b>pump</b> types (<b>gear,</b> vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the <b>pump</b> housing. Some <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
