25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A <b>phototube,</b> however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|Lenard {{observed}} {{the variation in}} electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a <b>phototube.</b> He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a <b>phototube</b> than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|E
5|$|The user {{could also}} switch between <b>phototubes</b> without {{removing}} the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that {{three types of}} <b>phototubes</b> were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and ultraviolet light ranges.|$|R
50|$|Avalanche {{multiplication}} during Townsend discharge {{is naturally}} used in gas <b>phototubes,</b> to amplify the photoelectric charge generated by incident radiation (visible light or not) on the cathode: achievable current is typically 10~20 times greater respect to that generated by vacuum <b>phototubes.</b>|$|R
500|$|When RCA {{could not}} meet Beckman's demand for {{experimental}} <b>phototubes,</b> National Technical Laboratories again had to design its own components in-house. They developed {{a pair of}} <b>phototubes,</b> sensitive to the red and blue areas of the spectrum, capable of amplifying the signals they received. [...] With the incorporation of Beckman's UV-sensitive <b>phototubes,</b> the Model D became the Model DU UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Its designation as a [...] "UV-Vis" [...] spectrophotometer indicates its ability to measure light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectra.|$|R
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a <b>phototube</b> whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E
500|$|The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to {{separate}} {{light from a}} lamp into its absorption spectrum and a <b>phototube</b> to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized [...] "fingerprint" [...] characteristic of a compound. [...] All modern UV-Vis spectrophotometer are built on the same basic principles as the DU spectrophotometer.|$|E
500|$|The 1954 DU {{spectrophotometer}} differs in that {{it claims}} to be useful from 200 to 1000 millimicrons, [...] and does not mention the ultraviolet <b>phototube.</b> The wavelength selector, however, still ranged from 200 to 2000 millimicrons. and an [...] "Ultraviolet accessory set" [...] was available. This shift away from using the DU for infrared measurement is understandable, since by 1954 Beckman Instruments was marketing a separate infrared spectrophotometer. Beckman developed the IR-1 infrared spectrophotometer during World War II, and redesigned it as the IR-4 between 1953 and 1956.|$|E

500|$|The Model D spectrophotometer, {{using the}} {{experimental}} RCA <b>phototube,</b> was shown at MIT's Summer Conference on Spectroscopy in July 1941.

In it, Cary and Beckman compared designs for a modified self-collimating quartz Fery prism, a mirror-collimated quartz Littrow prism, and various gratings. [...] The Littrow prism was a half-prism, which had a mirrored face. Use of a tungsten light source with the quartz Littrow prism as a monochromator was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.|$|E
500|$|Coleman Instruments had {{recently}} coupled a pH meter with an optical <b>phototube</b> unit {{to examine the}} visual spectrum (the Coleman Model DM). Beckman had already developed a successful pH meter for measuring acidity of solutions, his company's breakthrough product. Seeing the potential to build upon their existing expertise, Beckman made it a goal to create an easy-to-use integrated instrument which would [...] both register and report specific wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet range. [...] Rather than depending on development of photographic plates, or a human observer's visual ability to detect wavelengths in the absorption spectrum, phototubes {{would be used to}} register and report the specific wavelengths that were detected.
