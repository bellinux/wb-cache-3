40|$|Vitalization of {{internal}} organization {{of a firm}} varies {{in terms of its}} concept and method depending on the adaptation of the firm's main products to the industrial environment. In the case where a firm is enjoying a steady growth with its main products adapted well to changes in the industrial structure, the firm may be vitalized by enhancing the employees' challenging spirit. There are many ways to do this: flat organization; `philosophy of praise' by the top management; improvement of <b>personnel</b> <b>rating</b> system, etc. There are other cases where the growth is stagnant even though the main products are well adapted to changes in the environment, probably {{because of the lack of}} proper management activity. In such a case the president needs to take the lead in revolutionizing the awareness of the employees through infiltration of the sense of crisis, declaration of a lofty business goal, and president's visits at worksites. If a firm's growth is retarded due to the failure of its main products in adapting to changes in the industrial structure, restructuring of the firm is necessary. For that purpose, employees' knowledge must be deepened through various programs : specialist development program; mid-career recruitment; capability development; and appointment of talented people to new business sections...|$|E

40|$|Personnel {{employed}} in the protective services are routinely exposed to events and situations that {{can be described as}} stress inducing and traumatic. While the general stereotype is that these occupations are highly stressful, {{as a result of this}} repeated exposure, recent studies have shown that such <b>personnel</b> <b>rate</b> the organisational characteristics of their job as more stressful than operational exposure to traumatic incidents. The aim of this investigation was to apply a model of organisational health in an emergency services context, with a specific focus on the contribution of organisational factors to employee stress and well-being. Participants were 321 police, ambulance and firefighting personnel. Structural equation modelling analysis revealed that organisational climate had the strongest influence on employee job satisfaction, with both direct and mediated relationships through coping and daily work experiences. The fact that organisational processes have such a profound impact on employee well being highlights the importance of acknowledging the effect of organisational influences on protective services employees, particularly for the development and promotion of truly preventative mechanisms in dealing with critical incident and occupational stress...|$|R

40|$|Healthcare <b>personnel</b> {{influenza}} immunization <b>rates</b> remain sub-optimal. Following multiple {{studies and}} expert consultations, the "Successful Influenza Immunization Programs for Healthcare Personnel: A Guide for Program Planners" was produced. This trial assessed {{the impact of}} the Guide with facilitation in improving healthcare <b>personnel</b> influenza immunization <b>rates</b> in Canadian healthcare organizations. A sample of 26 healthcare organizations across six Canadian provinces (ON, MB, NS, BC, SK, NL) was randomized to Intervention (n= 13) or Control groups (n= 13). Baseline influenza immunization rates were obtained for 2008 - 2009; the study groups were followed over two subsequent influenza seasons. The Intervention group received the Guide, facilitation support through workshops for managers and ongoing support. The Control groups conducted programs as usual. The Groups were compared using their reported influenza healthcare <b>personnel</b> influenza immunization <b>rates</b> and scores from a program assessment questionnaire. Twenty-six organizations agreed to participate. 35 % (9 / 26) of sites were acute care hospitals, 19 % (5 / 26) continuing care, long-term care organizations or nursing homes, and 46 % (12 / 26) were mixed acute care hospitals and long-term care or regional health authorities. The median rate of influenza immunization among healthcare personnel for the Intervention group was 43 %, 44 %, and 51 % at three points in time respectively, and in the 62 %, 57 %, and 55 % respectively. No significant differences were observed between the groups at the three points in time. However, there was a 7 % increase in the median rates between the Baseline Year and Year Two in the Intervention group, and a 6 % decrease in the CONTROL GROUP over the same time period, which was statistically significant (0. 071 versus - 0. 058, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has shown that there are important links between certain psychiatric disorders and health symptom reporting. Two disorders in particular (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression) have been the most widely implicated to date, and this association has sometimes been used to explain the occurrence of ill-defined medical problems and increased somatic symptoms in certain groups, most recently Gulf War veterans. Methods: Structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews were used to examine the presence of major psychiatric (axis I) disorders and their relation to health symptom reporting in a well-character-ized, stratified subset of Gulf War veterans and a non-Gulf-deployed veteran comparison group. Results: Rates of most psychiatric disorders were substantially lower than national comorbidity estimates, consistent with prior studies showing heightened physical and emotional well-being among active-duty military <b>personnel.</b> <b>Rates</b> of PTSD and major depression, however, were significantly elevated relative to the veteran comparison group. The diagnosis of PTSD showed a small but significant association with increased health symptom reports. However, nearly two-thirds of Gulf participants reporting moderate to high health symptoms had no axis I psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusions: Results suggest that rates of psychiatric illness were generally low with the exception of PTSD and major depression. Although PTSD was associated with higher rates of reported health problems, this disorder did not entirely account for symptoms reported by participants. Factors other than psychiatric status {{may play a role in}} Gulf War health problems. Key words: Gulf War veterans, health symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder.

40|$|Objectives: “Tooth Smart Healthy Start” is a {{randomized}} clinical trial {{which aims to}} {{reduce the incidence of}} early childhood caries (ECC) in Boston public housing residents as part of the NIH funded Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities. The purpose of this project was to assess public housing stakeholders' perception of the oral health needs of public housing residents and their interest in replicating “Tooth Smart Healthy Start” in other public housing sites across the nation. Methods: The target population was the 180 attendees of the 2010 meeting of the Health Care for Residents of Public Housing National Conference. A ten question survey which assessed conference attendees' beliefs about oral health and its importance to public housing residents was distributed. Data was analyzed using SAS 9. 1. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable and results were stratified by participants' roles. Results: Thirty percent of conference attendees completed the survey. The participants consisted of residents, agency representatives, and housing authority personnel. When asked to rank health issues facing public housing residents, oral health was rated as most important (42 %) or top three (16 %) by residents. The agency representatives and housing authority <b>personnel</b> <b>rated</b> oral health among the top three (33 % and 58 % respectively) and top five (36 % and 25 % respectively). When participants ranked the three greatest resident health needs out of eight choices, oral health was the most common response.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This study {{describes}} {{the development and}} analysis of a manual for management and supervisory personnel involved with employee training programs in sanitary food production in the frozen fruit and vegetable industry. The physical aspects of the plant, microbiology of frozen foods, and employee training are discussed {{in relationship to the}} factors revolving around the sanitary production of frozen foods. Consideration of these factors {{was an integral part of}} the development of the manual which progressed in four steps: seek opinions of frozen fruit and vegetable industrial professionals, literature search, development of the manual, and analysis. A ten member expert panel comprised of five industrial personnel and five related and regulatory personnel evaluated the contents of the manual by use of a questionnaire. Panel members expressed their interest in the cleaning, sanitation, and inspection section of the manual. Responses from the panel indicated that the manual would serve as a useful industrial tool. The Student "t" test was used to determine if significant differences existed between response means of the industrial and related professional expert panel members. No significant differences were found between group members for the two major sections of the manual; the Physical Aspects of the Plant, and Training. A significant difference in response means was noted for the section, Microbiology of Frozen Foods, where industrial <b>personnel</b> <b>rated</b> the section higher than did related personnel. This indicated that industry felt it was more important to include the section than did the related professionals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of The Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) {{functional}} unit standards for Campus Activities Programs (CAP) as approximate benchmarks informing the initial steps in a large, multi-campus benchmarking process. The study was framed within Astin's (1985) theory of involvement underpinning the CAS unit standards examined (Miller, 2003). The study also utilized assumptions and principles found in the Upcraft and Shuh (1996) benchmarking model for student affairs. A survey consisting of 126 -items collected campus activities program leader demographic information, commentary and opinions. Thirty two campus activities personnel working at 20 university campus locations participated in the study. Ratings of the applicability and importance of CAS standards statements for 13 component areas produced summary means used for the selection of quality improvement benchmarks. <b>Personnel</b> <b>rated</b> highly the applicability of CAS standard components to improving the campus activities program as well as the importance the standards provided to work. Approximate CAS benchmarks were selected for the program examined using a gap analysis of the difference represented between the ratings. Findings indicated the CAS standards represent a suitable framework from which staff can be empowered to identify and define quality improvement benchmarks for campus activities programs. Variation of responses in the study indicated that the component area of Facilities, Technology, Equipment, called for expanded definition and refinement. Further study should explore the role of CAS as a central resource in higher education providing approximate benchmarks to inform benchmarking and the identification of best practice programs, services, and operations in student affairs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of students and student affairs personnel of student affairs services at Andrews University's main campus in Berrien Springs, Michigan. A modified questionnaire, based on the work of Selgas and Blocker (1974) and Glenister (1977), was developed for this study. Eleven student services found in the Council for the Advancement of Standards for Student Services/Development Program's guidelines were included. A random sample of 280 students at Andrews University received surveys, with 165 (59 %) responding. The 30 full-time student affairs personnel also received surveys, with 20 (67 %) responding. Students and student affairs <b>personnel</b> <b>rated</b> their perceptions of student services, using 77 statements associated with these services. Services were rated on a 6 -point scale in the categories of status of knowledge, relative importance, and effectiveness. Respondents were asked to include additional comments concerning the services and to provide biographical data. The following are some of the main findings: Significant differences between students' and student affairs personnel's status of knowledge of student services were found in career planning/employment, commuter programs/services, counseling services/substance abuse education, religious programs/services, student activities, and wellness/health. Significant differences between the two groups' perceptions of relative importance of student services were found in counseling services/substance abuse education, housing/residential life programs, international student/multicultural services, religious programs/services, student activities, and wellness/health. Significant differences between the two groups' perceptions of the effectiveness of student services were found in counseling services/substance abuse education, minority student programs/services, religious programs/services, services for students with disabilities, student activities, and wellness/health.

Students also completed Rotter's Locus of Control questionnaire and the Interview Behaviour Scales. Students and <b>personnel</b> managers <b>rated</b> internal-controllable attributions most likely to create a positive impression. However, students with an external LoC rated external-uncontrollable explanations and internal-controllable explanations as being equally likely to convey a positive impression. In Study 2 a group of 62 candidates applying for actual positions with a company completed the same attribution questionnaire prior to first-stage interviews. Interviewer ratings of candidate performance correlated positively with ratings of internal-controllable explanations (r =. 36, p<. 001). In Study 3, a sample of 103 experienced interviewers completed the attribution questionnaire and the WLOC.
