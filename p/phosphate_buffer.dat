25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
2500|$|Polyhistidine-tags {{are often}} used for {{affinity}} purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant [...] proteins expressed in Escherichia coli [...] and other prokaryotic expression systems. Bacterial cells are harvested via centrifugation and the resulting cell pellet lysed either by physical means or by means of detergents and enzymes such as lysozyme or any combination of these. At this stage raw lysate contains [...] the recombinant protein among many other proteins originating from the bacterial host. [...] This mixture is incubated with an affinity resin containing bound divalent nickel or cobalt ions, which are available commercially in different varieties. Nickel and cobalt have similar properties and as they are adjacent period 4 transition metals ((v. iron triad)). These resins are generally sepharose/agarose functionalised with a chelator, such as [...] iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) for nickel and carboxylmethylaspartate (Co-CMA) for cobalt, which the polyhistidine-tag binds with micromolar affinity. The resin is then washed with <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> to remove proteins that do not specifically interact with the cobalt or nickel ion. [...] With Ni-based methods, washing efficiency can be improved {{by the addition of}} 20 mM imidazole (proteins are [...] usually eluted with 150-300 mM imidazole). Generally nickel-based resins have higher binding capacity, while cobalt-based resins offer the highest purity. The purity and amount of protein can be assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.|$|E

50|$|The kit is {{supplied}} with four vials - a vial containing 3.2 mg of conjugated antibody in 2 ml saline, a vial containing 2 ml 50mM sodium acetate, a vial containing <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer,</b> {{and a fourth}} empty reaction vial. Prior to labeling, a volume of sodium acetate buffer equivalent to 1.2 times {{the volume of the}} tracer solution is transferred to the reaction vial. Then 5.5 mCi (203.5 MBq) indium-111 or 40mCi (1.48 GBq) yttrium-90 is added to the reaction vial and mixed thoroughly without shaking. Next, 1.3 ml of conjugated antibody is added. The mixture is incubated for exactly 30min for indium-111 and for 5 min with yttrium-90 labeling, followed by the addition of enough <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> to make the final volume 10 ml.

50|$|Most NONOates are {{stable in}} {{alkaline}} solution above pH 8.0 (e. g. 10 mM NaOH) and can be stored at −20 °C in this way for the short term. To generate NO from NONOates, the pH is lowered accordingly. Typically, a dilution of the stock NONOate solution is made in a <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> (pH 7.4; tris buffers can also be used) and incubated {{at room temperature for}} the desired time to allow NO to accumulate in solution. This is often visible as bubbles at high NONOate concentrations. Incubation time is important, since the different NONOates have different half-lives (t½) in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> at pH 7.4. For example, the half-life of MAHMA NONOate under these conditions is ~3.5 minutes, whilst the t½ of DPTA NONOate is 300 minutes. This is often useful in biological systems, where a combination of different NONOates can be used to give a sustained release of nitric oxide. At pH 5.0, most NONOates are considered to decompose almost instantaneously.|$|E

50|$|R-banding is a {{cytogenetics}} {{technique that}} produces the reverse of the G-band stain on chromosomes.

Resulting chromosome patterns shows darkly stained R bands, the complement to G-bands. Darkly colored R bands are guanine-cytosine rich, and adenine-thymine rich regions are more readily denatured by heat. The technique is useful for analyzing genetic deletions or chromosomal translocations that involve the telomeres of chromosomes.|$|E

50|$|For {{in vitro}} studies, Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with amino- and {{carboxylic}} acid- external reactive shells are considered as sensing phase.
