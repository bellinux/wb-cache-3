5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, <b>partridges,</b> grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

5000|$|In 1708, a cobbler named John <b>Partridge</b> {{published}} a popular almanac of astrological predictions.
