5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes.

25|$|Spring was {{the rainy}} season; farmers took {{advantage}} of this to bring fallow ground back into production. They practised biennial crop rotation, alternating {{from year to year}} between fallow and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds <b>ploughed</b> <b>back</b> into the ground after fields came out of fallow.|$|E
25|$|A {{determining}} {{trait of}} the 1585 through 1622 period was the rapid accumulation of trade capital. The seed {{money for this}} expansion was brought in by displaced Antwerp merchants and by other European merchants (for instance the New Christians who were displaced from the Iberian lands by religious persecution) that were quickly attracted by the new opportunities in Amsterdam. These merchants often invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the East Indies {{to engage in the}} spice trade. These ventures were soon consolidated in the Dutch East India Company (VOC). There were similar ventures in different fields, however, like the trade in Russia and the Levant. The profits of these ventures were <b>ploughed</b> <b>back</b> into financing new trade, which led to an exponential growth thereof.|$|E

500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was <b>ploughed</b> <b>back</b> into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa).

50|$|Interest earned is {{the income}} for the corporation, this should payments, the entire {{expenses}} and <b>plough</b> <b>back</b> requirement therefore, recovery of money {{is one of the}} major source of funds for the corporation. The health of the corporation is judged by the extent of recovery that it can affect. All source of funds carry cost, if the cost of borrowings is higher, it reduces the margin profit, further the profit are subject to payment of income tax as per applicable laws. The corporation also is bound by minimum dividend obligation irrespective, whether it makes profit or not out of the post tax and post dividend income. The memos are retained in the corporation by way of reserves. <b>Plough</b> <b>back</b> of funds into system is emerging as one of the very important sources of funds in the total resource mix, if the corporation has to retain sufficient money for the business operations; it has to generate more income. More income obviously improving the recovery. Therefore, systematic follow-up recovery of loan plays a significant role in our operations. In fact, is not exaggeration of the state that effective recovery of loans is the backboneof any financial institutions.|$|R
