2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings.</b> [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, Edward Storie {{sold the}} Fittings plant in Oshawa another [...] "Manchester of Canada" [...] operation, the Pedlar People Limited and Graeme Kirkland. Edward Storie was {{retained}} {{at the site}} as general manager. The entire operation was renamed to [...] "Pedlar Industrial Incorporated". On 30 June 1978, the new management announced that Fittings would close operations, due to competition from imported materials and plastic <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings.</b> The plan was to close operations on 8 September 1978 putting approximately 200 people out of work. Subsequent demonstrations by unemployed workers were unsuccessful in reopening operations. Kirkland was quoted as saying, [...] "It will take several months to replace this volume (<b>pipe</b> <b>fittings)</b> but the decision to discontinue <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> will strengthen the foundry operation in the future." [...] At the time, <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> represented 25% of manufacturing volume of the factory.In 1982, amid high interest rates and global steel shortages, Pedlar Industrial Inc., which included the Fittings operations, was forced into receivership.|$|E
50|$|A {{gooseneck}} (or goose neck) is a 180Â° <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> {{at the top}} of {{a vertical}} pipe that prevents entry of water.
