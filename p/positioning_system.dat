40|$|R ECENT YEARS {{have seen}} rapidly {{increasing}} demand for services and systems that depend upon accurate positioning {{of people and}} objects. This {{has led to the}} development and evolution of numerous <b>positioning</b> <b>systems.</b> This chapter provides an overview of the main positioning techniques: time of arrival (TOA), direction of arrival (DOA), and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). It then introduces <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> that are either in use or being developed for a variety of applications. Operations of these <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized using flowcharts and figures. In addition, the chapter compares <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on the basis of system characteristics and performance parameters. Many of these <b>positioning</b> techniques and <b>systems</b> are introduced in greater detail throughout different parts of this handbook. The chapter concludes by reviewing a number of emerging <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> and outlining some future applications. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe robust {{three-dimensional}} position {{architecture is}} {{proposed in the}} paper, where the hybrid time difference of arrival (TDOA) and direction of arrival (DOA) <b>position</b> <b>system</b> was designed to backup the four-station TDOA <b>position</b> <b>system.</b> The digital time delay estimation (TDE) receiver is used for TDOA measurement and the cylindrical array antenna is used for DOA measurement. The general formula of linear phase compensation for cylindrical array antenna in horizontal plane is derived. The detection probability of the TDE receiver and the circular error probability (CEP) of the <b>position</b> <b>systems</b> over Rayleigh fading channel were numerically computed in three-dimensional space. Simulations indicate that the position accuracy of the four-station TDOA <b>position</b> <b>system</b> is degraded but the location function can be retained by the hybrid TDOA and DOA <b>position</b> <b>system</b> when any one of four-stations is out of work...|$|R
5|$|In 1991, after Operation Desert Storm, the AH-64B was a {{proposed}} upgrade to 254 AH-64As. The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. Congress approved $82M {{to begin the}} Apache B upgrade. The B program was canceled in 1992. The radio, navigation, and GPS modifications, were later installed on most A-model Apaches through other upgrades.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> can be {{prescribed}} {{for children with}} cerebral palsy to help reduce or prevent hip migration, provide comfortto ease pain and/or improve sleep. As sleep disturbance is common in children with de velopmental disabilities, with impact on theircarers’ sl eep, and as sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> can be expensive, guidance is needed to support decisions as to their use. ObjectivesTo dete rmine whether commercially-available sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems,</b> compared with usual care, reduce or prevent hip migration inchildren with cerebral palsy. Any negative effect of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on hip migration will be considered within this objective. Secondary objectives were {{to determine the effect}} of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on: (1) number or frequency of hip problems; (2) sleeppatterns and quality; (3) quality of life of the child and family; (4) pain; and (5) physical functioning. We also sought to identify anyadverse effects from using sle ep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems.</b> Search methodsIn December 2014, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, E mbase, and 13 other databases. We also searched two trials registers. We applied no restrictions on date of publication, language, publication status or study design. We checked references and contactedmanufacturers and authors for potentially relevant literature, and searched th e internet using Google. Selection criteriaWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating whole body sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> for children and adolescents (upto 18 years of age) with cerebral palsy. Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened reports retrieved from the search against pre-determined inclusion criteria and assessed thequality of eligible studies. Members of th e public (parent carers of children with neurodisability) contributed to this review by suggesting the topic, reﬁning theresearch objectives, interpreting the ﬁndings, and reviewing the plain language summary. Main resultsWe did not identify any randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on hip migration. We did ﬁnd two randomised cross-over tr ials that met the inclusion criteria in respect of secondary objectives relating to sleep qualityand pain. Neither study reported any important difference between slee ping in slee p <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> and not for sleep patterns orsleep quality (two studies, 21 children, very low quality evidence) and pain (one study, 11 ch ildren, very low quality evidence). Thesewere small studies with established users of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> and were judged to have high risk of bias. We found no el igible trials that explored the other secondar y objectives (number or frequency of hip problems, quality of life of thechild and family, physical functioning, and adverse effects). Authors’ conclusionsWe found no randomised trials that evaluated the effectiveness of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> to reduce or prevent hip migration inchildren with cerebral palsy. Nor did we ﬁnd any randomised trials that evaluated the eff ect of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on the numberor frequency of hip problems, quality of life of the child and family or on physical functioning. Limited data from two randomised tr ials, which evaluated the effectiveness of sleep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> on sleep quality and pain forchildren with ce rebral palsy, showed no signiﬁcant differences in these aspects of health when children were using and not using a sleeppositioning system. In order to inform clinical decision-making and the prescription of sl eep <b>positioning</b> <b>systems,</b> more rigorous research is needed todetermine effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and the likelihood of adverse effects.

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} and {{new areas}} of application introduce new challenges related to safety {{and control of}} risk in the maritime industry. Dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>systems</b> are increasingly used, contributing {{to a higher level}} of autonomy and complexity aboard maritime vessels. Currently, risk assessment and verification of dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>systems</b> are focused on technical reliability, and the main effort is centered on design and demonstration of redundancy in order to protect against component failures. In this article, we argue that factors, such as software-requirement errors, human errors, including unsafe or too late decision-making, and inadequate coordination between decision makers, also should be considered in the risk assessments. Hence, we investigate the feasibility of using a systems approach to analyzing risk in dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>systems</b> and present an adapted version of the system-theoretic process analysis. A case study where the system-theoretic process analysis is applied to a dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>system</b> is conducted to assess whether this method significantly expands the current view on safety of dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>systems.</b> The results indicate that the reliability-centered approaches, such as the failure mode and effect analysis, sea trials, and hardware-in-the-loop testing, are insufficient and that their view on safety is too narrow. This article shows that safety constraints can be violated in a number of manners other than component failures for dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>systems,</b> and hence, system-theoretic process analysis complements the currently applied methods...|$|R

5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global <b>positioning</b> <b>system</b> (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E

5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot).

Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento.

5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global <b>positioning</b> <b>system</b> (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on the approach to each airfield, one at Southall for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.|$|E
