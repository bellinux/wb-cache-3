40|$|Within complex design {{projects}} {{the methodology of}} Simulation-Based Design is used. Critical remarks {{on the lack of}} multiple perspectives within the simulation are mentioned in literature, which creates inefficiency and dissatisfying results of the design. The addition of multiple <b>perspective</b> <b>visualization</b> during the design process can give all involved actors a better insight in the impact of the design on their own interests, and thereby create a higher shared understanding among participants. This is examined during a design case for a new shunting plan on a marshalling yard. A simulation model of the marshalling yard has been developed to create insight in the performance and behaviour of the system and to analyse the effect of alternative solutions. This model supported a design workshop in which eight critical actors were involved and discussed on the current and future design of the logistic process. Moreover, this workshop has been used to identify the effect of multi-perspective visualization within an SBD process. Different analysis led to the following conclusion: the addition of multi-perspective visualization enhanced the shared understanding significantly and contributes to a better design result. For similar design cases this approach is expected to be successful too, but different design projects will require adjustments to the approach and other type of visualizations. More case studies on the enhancement of SU by the addition of multiple perspectives should be performed to strengthen the conclusions. SEPAMSystems EngineeringTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} include developing and identifying software technologies, which facilitate the use of buildings described in Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools in both a simulation and visualization. The study focused {{on the development of}} a tool to fulfill the visualization needs of a Visual Energy Use System. To accomplish this, the study identified an open BIM file standard, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The study also identified a video game based 3 D virtual environment, the Doom 3 Engine. A tool developed during the study, IFCtoMAP, converts IFC data into the. MAP file format understood by the Doom 3 Engine. Finally, the study identified the IFCtoIDF utility, which translates IFC data into a format understood by the building energy simulation program EnergyPlus. Data from the Building Information Modeling tool Revit Building exports to the. IFC file format, which in turn drives the two conversion utilities IFCtoMAP and IFCtoIDF.

40|$|The article {{covers the}} {{following}} issues: {{the development and}} practical application of airborne electro-optic systems in the civil aviation aircraft. They provide flight visual information for the pilot day and night in visual and instrument weather conditions. The legal documents establishing the requirements {{for the application of}} this type of electro-optic systems in aircraft are presented. The classification of airborne electro-optic systems, commonly named as electronic visualization systems is analyzed. The ways of implementing the recommendations in their construction are considered. There have been analyzed the possibilities of systems of different classes: enhanced vision systems (EVS), synthetic vision systems (SVS), combine vision systems (CVS) and on-board vision systems with advanced visualization features, Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS). It is determined that nowadays EVS systems are considered to be the potential application systems. In order to analyze the possibilities of practical application of such systems in the issues of flight safety at low altitude and landing, flight experiments of the system installed on a light helicopter were conducted. The research introduces the results of flight experiments on the practical work of television and infrared (IR) viewing channels of a promising typical system in simple and complex observation conditions. Based on the results of flight experiments, a conclusion can be made about the relevance of practical application of electronic visualization systems on board the aircraft to ensure flight safety. It is determined that the systems can be used in flight both for land observation tasks and ensuring a safe flight. When flying the helicopter at low altitude and landing procedures the pilot should use visual information from the rear hemisphere of the lower tail unit by electro-optical visualization system. It was elicited that in the infrared (IR) channel and the fast rotation of visualization system camera located there is a corresponding delay of vision direction and the actual direction of flight. The vision is blurred. In the mode of the infrared spectrum information there appears a filtering problem of interference caused by helicopter engine exhaust gases and snow in the sector of observation. It makes it more difficult to obtain the benefits of visualization systems vision in adverse weather conditions. The conclusions indicated that <b>perspective</b> <b>visualization</b> systems for IR channels require additional use of methods and algorithms to ensure high-definition vision...|$|E

The 3 D digital reconstruction allows to recognize the role that the building of the market plays in the characterization and identification of this specific urban location as an essential element {{in the image of the}} city. To reconstruct the architectural and urban morphology of the place, I have conducted researches on iconographical records of the urban setting and of the historical market at the Turin city archives.

The research project was also based on other information culled from period photographs sources in others archives and in bibliographic sources. The rich iconography that emerged from the archival records has enabled me to address the research to an attempt to simulate the activities of market that existed historically within his specific location. The data drawn from historical-archival and bibliographical sources were compared and integrated with the planimetrical and altimetrical survey, prepared by me, of still existing buildings.

40|$|International audienceAgent-based Modeling {{is playing}} {{a key role in}} an {{increasing}} number of approaches addressing modeling complex systems.

The new requirements for high-level realistic visualization and online analysis tools of ABM simulations raise key issues that are yet unsolved: how to visualize interaction between entities and more generally abstracting the key information from the system dynamics. Instead of ad-hoc existing approaches that require reification in the model, we propose an approach dedicated to visualize and discover emerging dynamics from the model. In this approach, the execution of the simulation and its representation is separated and building a visualization is like building a visualization model on top of the reference model.

The rotational monitoring {{program that was}} created to capture data within the state’s {{thousands of miles of}} coastline and streams, and millions of acres of lakes, reservoirs, and ponds may be partly responsible for inducing the variability as an artifact. Florida’s new dissolved-oxygen-standard methodology will require more data to calculate a percent saturation.

To understand how, where, and when the methodological change could alter the environmental quality narrative of state waters requires addressing induced bias from prior sampling events and behaviors.
