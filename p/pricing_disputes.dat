40|$|I was {{previously}} Director of Mutual Agreement Procedures, National Tax Agency ('NTA'), in Japan. This paper was written during my stay at Columbia University as senior visiting research scholar. I {{hope that this}} paper will lead to further discussion of practical aspects of Transfer Pricing Methodologies for Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements. The opinions expressed herein are my personal views {{and do not necessarily}} reflect organizational or state positions. It is desirable for multinational enterprises to minimize the risk of economic double taxation arising as a result of transfer pricing adjustments. Such economic double taxation should be, if at all possible, addressed under the condition of rational income allocation between countries. For this purpose we need practicable transfer pricing methodologies. Furthermore, it is better if we have an efficient bilateral framework in which to settle transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes.</b> There is some possibility that Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements ('BAPA'), where Transfer Pricing Methodologies ('TPMs') are mainly based on profit methods, can be a reliable way of resolving these disputes. Looking to the past, actual results of BAPA between Japan and the United States may be viewed as a successful model whereby tax authorities have reached agreement in a considerable number of cases of various types related to both inbound and outbound transactions. In this paper, which is intended to be highly supportive of the BAPA, I enumerate the practical points at issue, after taking note of world currents in transfer pricing taxation. I also express some important items for development of the BAPA...|$|E

40|$|Russia is {{the largest}} global natural gas {{supplier}} and {{has the potential to}} expand its production significantly. Europe depends on Russia for {{more than a quarter of}} its natural gas supply, placing Russia in a position to project its power to achieve political goals, higher prices, or both. However, <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes</b> that have led to short term supply reductions, most notably with Ukraine in the winters of 2005 - 06 and 2008 - 09, have caused European gas consumers to reconsider Russia’s role in European energy security. Specifically, many European nations have significantly expanded liquefied natural gas (LNG) import capability, and there has been substantial effort devoted to looking at the development alternative pipeline routes to Europe for natural gas from the Caspian states of the Former Soviet Union. Scenario analysis using the Baker Institute World Gas Trade Model (BIWGTM) indicates that Russia may be less able to negatively influence the Western European gas market in future years. In general, as a global market for natural gas continues to develop the diversity of alternative suppliers will increase thereby lessening the effects of instability in any single region. Specific to Europe, while increased LNG import capability certainly plays an important role, the response of European consumers to future supply disruptions also accelerates other important avenues. Specifically, natural gas supplies imported by pipeline from the Middle East, in particular Iraq, could play a key role. The importance of the Middle East to European supply diversification, however, means any collusion between Russia and the major producers in the Middle East could pose a significant threat to global energy security...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing (the pricing of {{cross-border}} intra-firm transactions between related parties) {{is now the}} top international tax issue {{faced by}} multinational enterprises. In an international taxation environment characterized by rigorous enforcement of transfer pricing documentation, disclosure, and audit processes, a need has arisen for multinationals to be cognizant {{of the impact of}} their ‘tax risk appetite’ on their relationship with taxation authorities and to be aware of how best to manage their transfer pricing arrangements. The most promising development has been the growing commitment to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) – arrangements made prospectively between a multinational taxpayer and one or more revenue authorities, agreeing on an appropriate set of criteria for the determination of the transfer pricing of the covered transactions over a period of time. This is the first book to offer expert insights on APAs from a practical perspective. By focusing on the United States and Australia, the two countries that were at the forefront of adopting APAs and whose wealth of experience over two decades confirms their APA programs as the global paradigms, the author is able to highlight {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} pursuing an APA and to shed light on the powerful efficacy of this strategy for avoiding transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes.</b> In addition, the author enlists the views of revenue authorities, transfer pricing practitioners, and corporate counsel who deal with the realities of transfer pricing assessment and compliance on an ongoing basis, offering acute insight into how APAs really work in a practical way. This book contributes to the body of knowledge on APAs in the context of transfer pricing by providing in-depth scrutiny of the most important issues surrounding this critical area, and by examining innovations in APAs in the United States and in Australia. Its unmatched coverage will be welcomed by tax experts at law firms and multinational companies as well as by revenue officials, policymakers, and scholars and researchers in international taxation...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing is an {{important}} business tool in the modern world. In the modern era of globalisation, it provides management {{with the opportunity to}} manipulate prices, pursuing the business objective of maximisation of profits. This in turn allows for increased distribution to the shareholders. From a profit maximisation perspective, this concept is certainly tenable. However, businesses need to pay due consideration to the taxation implications of transfer pricing. While allowing for effective repatriation of profits from a high or low tax jurisdiction to a low or no tax jurisdiction, businesses need to be duly consider the taxation consequences if the revenue authorities establish that the tax base of their country is being depleted by such repatriations. In certain jurisdictions, the statutory powers allows for reconstruction with the existence of a mere suspicion of unacceptable price manipulation. Unlike New Zealand, the statutory framework imposes onerous obligations on the Commissioner to challenge the transfer prices by establishing that the adopted transfer pricing method is not comparable to arms length transactions. Largely, transfer pricing involves a degree of price manipulation between a parent and a subsidiary. Against this background, multi-nationals need to balance this against the social obligations of the citizens of the country. The central issue behind almost all transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes</b> between multinationals and revenue authorities is whether the prices charged is consistent with that of independent and un-associated parties. In saying this, it has to be recognised that certain transactions may have little to no comparable transactions, which constraints the search to substantiate the basis for the pricing. To make this concept workable, the transfer pricing rules in most jurisdictions operate on the basis of treating the parent and the subsidiary as separate entities. While this concept is theoretically sound, practically {{it is very difficult to}} “artificially” make the distinction for cross border transactions. Against this practical constraint, multinationals and revenue authorities reliance on commercial databases to corroborate the transfer prices certainly poses more questions. Effectively, the requirement to keep the transfer prices at arms length is discharged through utilisation of a database, designed for purposes other than transfer pricing...|$|E

40|$|All {{transfer}} pricing regimes {{give priority to}} the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method. Despite declarations that {{transfer pricing}} is {{a search for the}} “best method” or “most appropriate method,” all systems concede that the search is over when an exact comparable is found because a CUP is preferred over all methods. The best CUP is an exact CUP because it provides an arm’s length price that is not calculated. The price emerges directly from the comparison. CUPs have traditionally been the most commonly applied method for both taxpayers and the government. They are the judicial gold standard. They hold sway even when they are constructed. Whenever constructed CUPs are involved trial argumentation invariably centers on the adjustments. While exact CUPs require no adjustments, the constructed CUP’s persuasive value is based {{on the quality of the}} adjustments made. Constructed CUPs produce calculated results, and so the concern is with the precision of the calculation. This paper aligns five cases, each from a different country, to paint a multi-jurisdictional picture of the continuing importance of CUPs in transfer pricing. Australia – SNF (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation. The court is very receptive to the taxpayer’s effort to construct a CUP at trial in support of a filing position that was explained as not much more than an educated guess. US – Compaq Computer Corporation v. Commissioner. The taxpayer filed under a traditional cost-plus method, but at trial to a constructed CUP. UK – DSG Retail Ltd. v. Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. This case demonstrates what happens when a court is convinced that adjustments are needed to inexact comparables, but when well-reasoned adjustments are not offered. Norway – ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS and Norske ConocoPhillips AS v. Oljeskattekontoret. The CUP proposed is illusory. This case, like in DSG, results in a profit split. Canada – Alberta Printed Circuits Ltd. v. Her Majesty the Queen. The Canadian Revenue Authority (CRA) in this case cannot overcome the authority of an exact CUP, and missed the business restructuring adjustment. The traditional preference for CUPs in resolving transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes</b> is alive and well in the courts. Courts give just as much authority to constructed CUPs (Compaq, and SNF) as are given exact CUPs (Alberta). The only requirement is that considerable time and effort is needed to prove comparability (DSG). CUPs do not answer all transfer pricing questions. There are clearly cases where exact CUPs are impossible (ConocoPhillips) ...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing {{continues}} to be, and will remain, {{the most important}} international tax issue facing MNEs. ' The term 'transfer pricing' is used to describe arrangements involving the transfer of goods or services, at an artificial price, in order to transfer income or expenses from one enterprise to an associated enterprise in a different tax jurisdiction. This results in the income derived at for each enterprise being disproportionate to their relative economic contributions, and thus impacting the relevant tax jurisdictions' fair share of tax. Tax authorities are therefore focusing their attention on transfer pricing rules and practices to ensure the correct attribution of income and expenses of related-party transactions. Another key issue, closely related to transfer pricing, is that of double taxation. Multinational enterprises, engaging in cross-border transactions, {{are at risk of}} having a single source of income taxed in two jurisdictions {{as a result of an}} incorrect application of transfer pricing rules. The purpose of this research is to evaluate South Africa's approach to transfer pricing, as well as compare it to the approaches as adopted by selected countries, namely Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, with the aim of identifying the areas that South Africa could learn from practices in foreign jurisdictions. Specific issues dealt with include acceptable transfer pricing methods for determining an arm's length price, documentation requirements and non-compliance penalties, the use of Advance Pricing Agreements ("APA"), and the effects of e-commerce in applying the arm's length principle. The first issue relates to the criteria for the selection of the most suitable method in ensuring an arm's length outcome. Because the South African market is considered to be lacking in comparables, compliance with the arm's length principle will be determined by evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case. The second issue looks at the transfer pricing policy documentation required to be prepared, the benefits of preparing such documentation, and the imposition of penalties on taxpayers failing to do so. The lack of statutory documentation requirements and specific penalty provisions in the South African legislation is also addressed. The third issue evaluates the use of APAs in resolving transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes.</b> This technique is adopted by Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, and therefore an assessment is made, taking into account both advantages and disadvantages of the technique, to determine whether it would be beneficial to South Africa to be able to agree in advance to transfer pricing methods to be applied to transactions with connected parties, thus reducing the potential for expensive and time consuming disputes with the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"). The fourth and final issue explores the challenges facing tax jurisdictions as a result of an increase in electronic trade. The relevance of the arm's length principle is assessed and recommendations for South Africa are made...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing can be {{described}} as the internal price setting between multinational group companies. In recent years the issue of jurisdiction’s tax revenue flowing out of the jurisdiction has been closely related with transfer pricing and the tax authorities all over the world have increasingly began to question the arm’s length nature of the intra-group transactions of multinational enterprises. In this thesis {{the focus is on the}} transfer pricing issues arising in situations where intangible assets are involved in business restructuring. Multinational enterprises have noticed that in this time of global recession and economic uncertainty in order for them to be able to answer the invariably increasing competition on the global markets the need to restructure their functions, assets, and risks in a way that will rationalize their operations and reduce the related costs. Intangible assets are often the items being transferred to low-cost / low-tax jurisdictions as they are easily transferrable due to their nature. However, intangible assets are commonly also those, which cause the most controversy between tax payers and tax administrations because they are difficult to identify as well as it is difficult to determine the appropriate arm’s length compensation for them. The research questions in this thesis include the question of how intangible assets are defined and who is the owner of the intangible for transfer purposes. Even though it might sound simple, these factors are often difficult to determine, and different countries might have different interpretations even though the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are quite unanimously accepted at least among the OECD Member Countries as leading guidance in the area. The possible inadequate determination of ownership or failure to recognize a certain item as a compensable intangible asset may lead to transfer pricing adjustment by the tax authorities and possible penalties. It may also lead to double taxation especially in the case of jurisdictions disagreeing on the right characterisation of the item or the rightful owner. The main research questions of this thesis are what type of issues generally arise regarding to transfer pricing of intangibles in business restructuring situations and how different (OECD) jurisdictions treat these situations. Issues relating to back-to-back transactions and treatment of business synergies and location savings, which are common in centralization of intangible property, are examined. Also the issues related to transferring intangible assets with no established value are focused on. An issue which is especially closely related to the back-to-back transactions is the recognition or actually the non-recognition of the actual transactions taken by the taxpayer. The research questions the thesis aims at answering are thus also, in what situations should the tax authorities have grounds for restructuring the transaction instead of a pricing adjustment, what are the approaches of various OECD countries to restructuring transactions and what is the relationship of the restructuring according to Art 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention to domestic anti-avoidance provisions. Finally, as it is established that the risk of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>disputes</b> in the area of intangible assets and business restructurings exists, the preventative measures and measures for resolution of such disputes should be available to mitigate the risk. However, the conclusion that was reached in this thesis is that there is still a lot more room for improvement in this regard...|$|E
