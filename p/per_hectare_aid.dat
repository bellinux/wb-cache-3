40|$|Abstract Perpendicular {{distance}} sampling (PDS) is a fast probability-proportional- to-size {{method for}} inventory of downed wood. However, previous development of PDS had limited the method to estimating only one variable (such as volume <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> or surface area <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> at a time. Here, we develop a general design-unbiased estimator for PDS. We then show how that estimator {{can be used}} to develop simple measurement protocols that allow simultaneous, unbiased estimation of multiple downed wood variables, including logs <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> length of logs <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> surface area or area coverage <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> and volume <b>per</b> <b>hectare...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{position and}} improvement {{of any kind}} of production is largely defined by the economic effect that it achieves. In agricultural enterprises in 2009 the high costs of production {{on the one hand and}} low commodity prices on the other have assured profit only in sugar beet (€ 922 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and soybean production (€ 167 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> while loss has been recorded in the production of maize (€ 206 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> wheat (€ 121 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and sunflower (€ 162 <b>per</b> <b>hectare).</b> On family farms, the income achieved in the production of sugar beet (€ 924 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and soybean (€ 594 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> provides the funds for further reproduction, but in maize (€ 105 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> sunflower (€ 60 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and wheat production (€ 33 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> it does not. In addition to the yield level, the conditions under which products have been sold have the decisive influence on the achieved results. In this regard, storage and deferred sale, as well as the collection of crops with lower moisture content, can significantly increase the value of production, and consequently the producer's revenue...|$|R
