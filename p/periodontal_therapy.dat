Sixty single-rooted bovine teeth were selected and randomly assigned to 12 groups. Inlay cavities were prepared in the cervical region on the center of the cementoenamel junction, and were restored with laboratory processed resin and luted with a resin cement. Twelve <b>periodontal</b> <b>therapies</b> were used (n= 5) : C: control (no treatment); MS: manual scaling with Gracey curettes; US: ultrasonic scaling; PP: prophylaxis with prophylactic paste; PS: prophylaxis with pumice-stone; SBJ: sodium bicarbonate jet; MS/PP; MS/PS; MS/SBJ; US/PP; US/PS; US/SBJ. The specimens were prepared and analyzed by SEM. SEM micrographs at × 100 to × 1000 magnification were obtained from the surface of the laboratory resin and the interface of the indirect restorations. The images were evaluated by 3 skillful, calibrated, blinded observers as to the presence of grooves, microcavities and fracture of margins. The results showed that PS produced groves on restoration surface. MS and US produced groves and marginal fractures on the restorations. SBJ resulted in resin cement degradation.

40|$|Periodontitis is an {{inflammatory}} disease {{resulting in the}} loss of tooth-supporting tissues including the periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone, ultimately resulting in tooth loss. Two innovative approaches, guided tissue regeneration and application of enamel matrix derivative, have been found to achieve periodontal regeneration that reproduced essentially normal structure.

So far, several regenerative methods using growth factors including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor, have been developed to treat periodontal defects and have achieved favorable results in animal studies and clinical trials.

40|$|Introduction: Occlusal {{trauma is}} defined as an injury {{resulting}} intissues changes within the attachment apparatus as result of occlusalforce(s). Since 1901, when Karolyi reported a possible interactionbetween occlusal disharmony and periodontal alterations, severalstudies have tried to find scientific evidence that corroborates or not this interrelationship.

Conclusion: An occlusal adjustment should be done, whenever it is indicated, as a routine procedure during periodontal treatment. Furthermore, it is evident that additional studies, with more precise and reproducible methodology, are needed in order to clarify the interaction between the occlusion with the periodontal tissues...|$|R
40|$|The actual {{relationship}} between periodontal and pulpal disease was first described by Simring and Goldberg in 1964. Since then, the term "perio-endo" lesion {{has been used}} to describe lesions due to inflammatory products found in varying degrees in both the periodontium and the pulpal tissues. The pulp and periodontium have embryonic, anatomic and functional inter-relationships. The simultaneous existence of pulpal problems and inflammatory periodontal disease can complicate diagnosis and treatment planning. A perio-endo lesion can have a varied pathogenesis which ranges from quite simple to relatively complex one. Knowledge of these disease processes is essential in coming to the correct diagnosis. This is achievable by careful history taking, examination and the use of special tests. The prognosis and treatment of each endodontic-periodontal disease type varies. Primary periodontal disease with secondary endodontic involvement and true combined endodontic-periodontal diseases require both endodontic and <b>periodontal</b> <b>therapies.</b> The prognosis of these cases depends on the severity of periodontal disease and the response to periodontal treatment.
