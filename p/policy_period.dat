During the New Economic <b>Policy</b> <b>period</b> (1921–1928), it released a number of works, including the publication of the collected works of pre-eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922. What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929, after the accession of Joseph Stalin, and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression. The newspaper was also suppressed by the Post Office Department in the United States, where it was succeeded by the widely circulated Khleb i Volya (Bread and Freedom), first published on February 26, 1919, which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{estimation}} framework for identifying monetary policy shocks in both conventional and unconventional policy regimes using a structural VAR model. Exploiting a latent threshold modeling strategy that induces time-varying shrinkage of the parameters, we explore a recursive identification switching with a time-varying overidentification for {{the interest rate}} zero lower bound. We empirically analyze Japan’s monetary policy to illustrate the proposed approach for modeling regime-switching between conventional and unconventional monetary <b>policy</b> <b>periods,</b> and find that the proposed model is preferred over a nested standard time-varying parameter VAR model. The estimation results show that increasing bank reserves lowers long-term interest rates in the unconventional <b>policy</b> <b>periods,</b> and that the impulse responses of inflation and the output gap to a bank reserve shock appear to be positive but highly uncertain.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} maternity-related fee payment policies on the uptake of skilled birth care amongst the poor in Ghana. Methods: Population data representing 12, 288 births between November 1990 and October 2008 from four consecutive rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys were {{used to examine the}} impact of four major maternity-related payment policies: the full-cost recovery cash and carry scheme; antenatal care fee exemption; delivery care fee exemption and the National Health Insurance Scheme. Concentration curves were used to analyse the rich-poor gap in the use of skilled birth care by the four policy interventions. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the effect of the policies on the uptake of skilled birth care, adjusting for relevant predictors and clustering within communities and districts. Findings: The uptake of skilled birth care over the <b>policy</b> <b>periods</b> for the poorest women was trivial when compared to their non-poor counterparts. The rich-poor gap in skilled birth care use was highly pronounced during the ?cash and carry ?and free antenatal care <b>policies</b> <b>period.</b> The benefits during the free delivery care and ?National ?Health Insurance Scheme <b>policy</b> <b>periods</b> accrued more for the rich than the poor. ?There exist significant differences in skilled birth care use between and within communities and districts, even after adjusting for policy effects and other relevant predictors. Conclusion: The maternal care fee exemption policies specifically targeted towards the poorest women had limited impact on the uptake of skilled birth care. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Emerging markets such as India have {{witnessed}} waves {{of domestic and}} cross-border mergers and acquisitions. This historical analysis, which consists of two parts, tests central tenets of resource dependence theory. The first part entails {{an analysis of the}} transition in public policy governing corporations between 1991 and 2005. The second part tests hypotheses derived from resource dependence theory relating to a firm?s decision to acquire. The analysis explores the factors that explain why firms engage in mergers and acquisitions by examining three specific <b>policy</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e., 1991 - 1996, 1997 - 2001 and 2002 - 2005). The findings from the historical analysis suggest that firms did not merely react to the conditions (i. e., constraints on capital) in their environment by undertaking merger and acquisition activity, but attempted to alter them as resource dependence theory suggests. Findings from the event history logit model also support resource dependence theory. Overall, the study shows that merger and acquisition activity increased during a period of intense deregulation (i. e., 1991 - 2005) brought about by the adoption of neo-liberal reforms, change to the multilayer subsidiary form, deregulation of the banking and financial sectors? and reforms in foreign direct investment and equity markets. During this period of uncertainty, firms controlling more resources in terms of earnings, efficiency and number of subsidiaries were more likely to undertake acquisition activity as they have leverage in organization-environment relationships. The effect of number of subsidiaries on acquisition activity was the most consistent across <b>policy</b> <b>periods?.</b> This dissertation is organized in the following manner: Following the introductory chapter, Chapter II is a historical examination of the three <b>policy</b> <b>periods</b> and includes an analysis of the effect of the political-legal environment on mergers and acquisitions between 1991 and 2005. Chapter III reviews the propositions of resource dependence theory that pertain to organizational change and presents research hypotheses related to mergers and acquisitions.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of transport to {{the social and economic}} development of a country, very little, if any, work appears to have been done in South Africa {{to assess the impact of}} transport policy in achieving its aims and objectives. Two policy areas that have wide social and economic impacts are the public transport industry and the development of the national roads network. Public transport, or more specifically commuter bus transport policy, is aimed at improving the mobility and affordability of the travelling public while at the same time increasing the transparency of the subsidy system through a tender and negotiated contract regimen. The policy on national roads directly impacts the general economy as an estimated 88 % of all freight tonnage (excluding the dedicated iron ore and coal lines of Transnet Freight Rail) is moved over the road network of South Africa with the national roads linking the main economic centres of the country. This research assesses the impact of these two areas of policy making by comparing policies for commuter bus transport and primary (national) roads for two <b>policy</b> <b>periods,</b> namely, 1986 to 1994 and 1994 to 2004. The research methodology used is that of the mixed-methods research procedure explained more fully in the article and the annexure to the paper. The research arrives at conclusions in respect of the impact of the policy on the problems and issues in the two separate sectors of transport during the <b>policy</b> <b>periods</b> analysed. It also draws conclusions on the policy-making process used as well as identifying deficiencies in the process. Finally it makes recommendations to address these inadequacies. </span...|$|R
