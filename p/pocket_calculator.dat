25|$|By 1976, {{the cost}} of the {{cheapest}} four-function <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.|$|E
25|$|Sharp put {{in great}} efforts {{in size and}} power {{reduction}} and introduced in January 1971 the Sharp EL-8, also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator.</b> It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable NiCad batteries, and initially sold for US $395.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Texas Instruments (TI) {{introduced}} the SR-10, (SR signifying slide rule) an algebraic entry <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> using scientific notation for $150. Shortly after the SR-11 featured an added key for entering Pi (π). It was followed {{the next year}} by the SR-50 which added log and trig functions {{to compete with the}} HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed TI-30 line which is still produced.|$|E

25|$|A more {{successful}} series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD {{was launched in}} 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator.</b> This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's Calculator On Substrate (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display {{was used as a}} substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 a new company, Calculated Industries arose {{which focused}} on {{specialized}} markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger (1978) was a <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This {{would be the first}} in a line of construction related calculators.|$|E
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E

25|$|Since real numbers can be {{represented}} as distances or intervals on a line, the slide rule was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations {{to be carried out}} significantly faster than was previously possible. Edmund Gunter built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. William Oughtred greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular slide rule. He followed this up with the modern slide rule in 1632, essentially a combination of two Gunter rules, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
500|$|The Sinclair Executive was the world's first [...] "slimline" [...] <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator,</b> and {{the first}} to be {{produced}} by Clive Sinclair's company Sinclair Radionics. Introduced in 1972, there were at least two different versions of the Sinclair Executive, with different keyboard markings, and another called the Sinclair Executive Memory, introduced in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Most {{arithmetic}} operations truncate like simple <b>pocket</b> <b>calculators.</b> Therefore, 1 − 16−7 = 1. In this case, {{the result}} is rounded away from zero.|$|R

500|$|The Executive was {{launched}} in September 1972 {{at the price of}} [...] plus VAT, equivalent to £ in [...] when adjusted for inflation. This was around half the price of comparable calculators, but still twice the average weekly wage. It was the first <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator,</b> and the first to be mass-produced, and its introduction to the market coincided with a number of other companies entering the calculator market.|$|E
500|$|Clive Sinclair's first company Sinclair Radionics, {{established}} in 1962, made its name producing {{a wide range}} of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market. Its products include amplifiers, radios, multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi-fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists. The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first [...] "slimline" [...] <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator,</b> the Sinclair Executive. It was a major success that Radionics followed up by launching {{a wide range of}} pocket calculators. The company's subsequent expansion made it Europe's biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{took the}} view that an {{electric}} vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor {{was the key to}} the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with a button on the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first [...] "slimline" [...] <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for {{most of the rest of}} the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Bowmar Instrument Corporation {{introduced}} the [...] "Bowmar Brain", a four-function <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator,</b> in September 1971 and the $179 calculator sold over 500,000 copies {{in the first}} year. Bowmar then developed the [...] "901B" [...] calculator that was priced at $120. In September 1972, Texas Instruments (TI) {{introduced the}} TI-2500 portable four-function calculator that also sold for $120. The 901B and the TI-2500 both used the TI TMS0100 family of [...] "calculator-on-a-chip" [...] integrated circuit. TI was now directly competing with their IC customers. Other semiconductor companies such as National Semiconductor and Rockwell began selling calculators. Commodore Business Machines and other office equipment companies also got into the market. A frenzied price war started. By early 1974, Ed Roberts found he could purchase a calculator in a retail store for less than his cost of materials. The larger companies could sell below cost to win market share. Bowmar lost $20 million in 1974 and filed for bankruptcy. Commodore acquired their IC supplier, MOS Technology. Texas Instruments won the price war but their calculator division lost $16 million in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|Searle {{responds}} {{that such}} a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: [...] "No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched." [...] Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation {{is as good as}} the real thing. [...] "When we call up the <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> function on a desktop computer, the image of a <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't really a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter." [...] The question is, is the human mind like the <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator,</b> essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article synthetic intelligence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HP) {{had been}} {{developing}} a <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator.</b> Launched in early 1972, it was {{unlike the other}} basic four-function pocket calculators then available {{in that it was}} the first <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule. The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like [...] "8 plus 5" [...] is, using RPN, performed by pressing [...] "8", [...] "Enter↑", [...] "5", and [...] "+"; instead of the algebraic infix notation: [...] "8", [...] "+", [...] "5", [...] "=". It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.|$|E

5000|$|HP 9805A, {{the least}} {{expensive}} model using the same chassis as the HP46 (scientific) and HP81 (business) <b>pocket</b> <b>calculators.</b> This was a Programmable Calculator and had plug-in personality modules. It was introduced in 1973.|$|R
2500|$|The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly termed The Bowmar Brain), {{measuring}} , {{came out}} in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red LED display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function Sinclair Executive became the first slimline <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> measuring [...] and weighing [...] It retailed for around £79 ($). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 ($).|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the efforts}} in {{integrated}} circuit development {{culminated in the}} introduction in early 1971 of the first [...] "calculator on a chip", the MK6010 by Mostek, followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the vacuum fluorescent display, LED, and LCD), led {{within a few years}} to the cheap <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> available to all.|$|E
50|$|The HP-35 was Hewlett-Packard's first <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> and the world's first {{scientific}} <b>pocket</b> <b>calculator</b> - {{a calculator}} with trigonometric and exponential functions.|$|E
