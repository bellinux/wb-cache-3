5|$|Chamberlain {{had agreed}} {{to play for the}} Cleveland Spiders in 1895, but instead he joined a Class D {{baseball}} team out of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced <b>pitcher</b> <b>who</b> shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates. He reported to the Spiders in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson. Chamberlain was released after appearing in two games.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{also noticed}} these {{vacancies}} in the lineup; he was dissatisfied {{in the role}} of a <b>pitcher</b> <b>who</b> appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.|$|E

5|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Blake {{went on to}} become a plumber. He spent nearly 50 years in the {{plumbing}} business and was formerly the president of Plumbers Local 360. Blake was married to his wife, Carol Jean, for 47 years before her death. With Carol, he had a son, Ed, and a daughter, Peggy. His son, also named Ed Blake, was a former <b>pitcher</b> <b>who</b> played in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system from 1970 to 1973, playing for the AA affiliate Asheville Orioles at the peak of his career. His grandson, Ed Blake III, has continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as a pitcher in high school. Blake died in Swansea, Illinois at the age of 83 after a long illness, and is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Belleville, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|At age seven, Ruth {{was sent}} to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a {{reformatory}} where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding <b>pitcher</b> <b>who</b> sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era. Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher {{and was a member}} of three World Series championship teams with Boston, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands (born August 26, 1988) is an American {{professional}} baseball <b>pitcher</b> <b>who</b> {{is currently a}} free agent. He played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he {{earned a degree in}} sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in the farm system, they invited him to spring training in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E
50|$|Control <b>pitchers,</b> <b>who</b> succeed by {{avoiding}} surrendering walks, {{are different from}} power <b>pitchers</b> <b>who</b> succeed by striking out batters and keeping {{the ball out of}} play.Three of the most famous examples of control pitchers in the history of baseball are Christy Mathewson, Ferguson Jenkins, and Greg Maddux, though Maddux and Jenkins have also had significant strikeout totals (they are members of the 3,000 strikeout club) because of their ability to change speeds and the deceptive nature of their pitches.|$|R
