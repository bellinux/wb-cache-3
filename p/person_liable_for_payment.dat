5000|$|Account {{stacking}} is {{a broadcast}} industry term, {{which refers to}} the deployment of subscription Direct To Home (DTH) satellite receiving equipment at multiple geographical locations under a single customer account. It {{is often referred to}} as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting. Account stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV hacking and piracy but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect. A contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like cable-TV, and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis. ----CRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations In Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the CRTC as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations. 1. Under the regulations a [...] "customer" [...] means a <b>person</b> who is <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> <b>for</b> programming services that are distributed by a licensee and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. [...] 2. A [...] "subscriber" [...] is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee. 3. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit wire-line service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for distribution cover a continent-wide area.|$|R

50|$|Violations of {{the crimes}} listed in the Revised Penal Code are {{referred}} to as mala in se, which literally means, that the act is inherently evil or bad or wrongful in itself. On the other hand, violations of Special Penal Laws are generally referred to as malum prohibitum or an act that is wrong because it is prohibited. Thus, no criminal intent is needed in order to find a <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> crimes punished under Special Penal Laws. As long as the act is committed, then it is punishable as a crime under law.|$|R

50|$|When the {{taxation}} of {{the bill}} is finalised, the taxing master allocates the amount that is payable {{in terms of the}} taxed bill of costs, puts his stamp on it, and signs it. This “endorsement” is known as the taxing master’s allocatur. The taxed bill then has the effect of a court order; if the party who is <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of same fails to pay the bill of costs, payment may be enforced by means of a warrant of execution.|$|R

Continued efforts by tribal leaders {{to obtain the}} grant money and pressure from Congressional representatives helped bring about {{a new way of}} doing business. The influence of the BIA over tribal affairs slowly lessened. [...] In addition, the United States Supreme Court in Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v.

5000|$|The {{general rule}} in the {{criminal}} law {{is that there is}} no vicarious liability. This reflects the general principle that a crime is composed of both an actus reus (the Latin tag for [...] "guilty act") and a mens rea (the Latin tag for [...] "guilty mind") and that a person should only be convicted if he or she is directly responsible for causing both elements to occur at the same time (see concurrence). Thus, the practice of holding one <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the actions of another is the exception and not the rule in criminal law.|$|R

50|$|The United States Supreme Court {{found that}} holding a <b>person</b> criminally <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> taking money for work not {{performed}} was akin to indentured servitude, outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, as {{it required that}} person to work rather than be found guilty of a crime.|$|R

50|$|If {{there is}} a finding {{that there has been}} an excess benefit the disqualified person must reimburse the {{organization}} to place the organization back in the position it was in before the excess benefit transaction was completed.

The organizational managers who participated in the transaction may also be fined an aggregate of $10,000 per violation and are jointly and severally <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of such penalty. These penalties are cumulative, thus an individual may be liable as a disqualified person and as an organization manager.|$|R

His wife supported him, stating that she, not he, should have received the bill. Kelland lost the action, and had to pay the full amount. In that same year, Kelland {{was director of the}} Bank of North Hempstead in Port Washington, New York. The bank failed, tying up most of his securities.|$|R

50|$|Justice Lamer, {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} court, held that an absolute liability, {{which makes a}} <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> an offence {{whether or not they}} took steps not to be at fault, violates the principles of fundamental justice. Therefore, any possibility of a deprivation of life, liberty, or security of person from an absolute liability offence offends the Charter. A law that violates section 7 cannot be saved by section 1 of the Charter except for extreme circumstances (ex. natural disasters, outbreaks of war, epidemics). The principles of fundamental justice impose a stricter test than section 1. Thus, any law that violates the principles of fundamental justice will most likely not be saved by section 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} ACT {{was linked to}} the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994. These changes were {{accompanied}} with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. <b>Persons</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.|$|R
50|$|The Hearth Tax Assessment of 1666 {{documented}} that Gayton had 33 households <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>payment</b> of 48 hearths. The largest property {{was owned by}} George White who had six hearths. Seven households were deemed too poor {{to be able to}} pay the tax.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Belgian {{government}} claimed that she owed $63,000 in back taxes. Deckers countered that the royalties from her recording {{were given to}} the convent and therefore she was not <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of any personal income taxes. As her former congregation denied responsibility for the debt, claiming both that they no longer had any responsibility for her and {{that they did not have}} the funds, Deckers ran into heavy financial problems. In 1982, she tried, once again as Sœur Sourire, to score a hit with a disco synthesizer version of [...] "Dominique", but this last attempt to resume her singing career failed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{pilot in}} command (PIC) of an {{aircraft}} is the person aboard the aircraft who is ultimately responsible for its operation and safety during flight. This would be the captain in a typical two- or three-pilot aircrew, or [...] "pilot" [...] if {{there is only one}} certificated and qualified pilot at the controls of an aircraft. The PIC must be legally certificated (or otherwise authorized) to operate the aircraft for the specific flight and flight conditions, but need not be actually manipulating the controls at any given moment. The PIC is the person legally in charge of the aircraft and its flight safety and operation, and would normally be the primary <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> an infraction of any flight rule.|$|R
