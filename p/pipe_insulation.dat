25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} became increasingly widespread {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, when its diverse applications included fire retardant coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant gaskets, <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation,</b> ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn furniture, and drywall joint compound. In 2011 it was reported that over 50% of UK houses still contained asbestos, despite a ban on asbestos products some years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation,</b> floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E
25|$|Roach also {{founded a}} number of other firms to meet the {{material}} needs of his shipyard. He established the nearby Chester Pipe and Tube Company, from which he could source the large amount of iron piping and quality boiler tubes required for his ships. With the purchase of a patent for an asbestos compound, he founded the Chalmers-Spence Company to provide <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation.</b> He also secured exclusive patent rights in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware for the Hirsch propeller, a European design which lessened vibration, and he founded the Hirsch Propeller Company to manufacture it. The end result of these efforts was a network of companies that made the Roach shipyard largely independent of third-party suppliers, enabling Roach to minimize costs and undercut his competitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{crude oil}} {{contains}} wax and hydrate depositions, thermal management {{is needed to}} built up to prevent these deposition formation. Thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pipe</b> is the common measure. Laying thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pipe</b> is a complex operation due to their multi-layer structure and heavier weight. In this paper, mechanical analysis for thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>pipe</b> laid by S-lay is carried out. Large deformation theory is applied to establish S-lay model.

25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.|$|E
50|$|For <b>pipe</b> <b>{{insulation}},</b> the R-value varies {{not only}} with the insulation thickness and thermal conductivity ("k-value") but also with the pipe outer diameter and the average material temperature. For this reason, it is more common to use the thermal conductivity value when comparing the effectiveness of <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation,</b> and R-values of <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> are not covered by the US FTC R-value rule.|$|E
5000|$|Limited {{adhesives}} for <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation.</b> One source {{suggested that}} <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation,</b> applied to PEX using certain adhesives, {{could have a}} detrimental effect causing the pipe to age prematurely; however, other insulating materials can be used, such as conventional foam wrap insulation, without negative effects.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{localized}} {{inner wall}} corrosions in the <b>pipe</b> under <b>insulation</b> are especially hazardous to pipelines. An inspection {{system is designed}} to detect inner wall flaws in pipe based on pulsed eddy current technique. Simulation specimens with large area thinning, localized grove-like corrosions and pit-like corrosions are machined, and probes are designed and manufactured. A series of experiments are performed to optimize testing parameters and improve detection sensitivity. The experiments show that the system can detect 10 percent thinning of wall under insulation when the thickness of <b>pipe</b> and <b>insulation</b> is respectively 10 mm and 110 mm. The detection accuracy can meet the requirement in the inspection of pressure pipeline. The system can also detect some localized corrosions under insulation...|$|R
30|$|There are a {{great number}} of {{published}} scientific articles that model heat transfer in abandoned petroleum wells, estimate the potential of heat production, and perform sensitivity study to determine the optimal conditions for operating the geothermal wells. Kujawa et al. (2005, 2006) investigated the theoretical possibility of acquiring energy from a vertical well. They developed a computational temperature model to determine the amount of geothermal heat flux that can be gained using a double-pipe heat exchanger. The calculations were performed for three cases: perfectly insulated <b>pipe,</b> air-gap <b>insulation</b> formed by the casing <b>pipes,</b> and <b>insulation</b> of the polyurethane foam. They also varied the flow rate and the inlet temperature of the injected water, and found out that lower inlet temperature and higher flow rate increase the amount of the heat power of a geothermal intake.|$|R

On the other hand, plastic is considered the main building material that derived from oil and used in a wide-range as (water system <b>pipes,</b> <b>insulation</b> material, plastic fibre for reinforcement concrete, etc.). However, it is enough for these materials {{to be derived from}} oil to be polluting materials, but they are also strange materials to nature that they take thousands of years to decompose. Moreover, some materials like polystyrene it is not even accepted yet to be recycled because of the economic point of view. All above has urged us to search for alternative eco-friendly materials, thus the natural materials that come from the earth like clay may be that one. So these papers are going to present the possibility of replacing plastic pipes with clay ones by test and analyze some specimens following the standards...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{consumer}} {{is exposed to}} a wide variety of plastic and rubber products in his day to day life: at home, work, school, shopping, recreation and play, and transport. A large variety of toxic sequellae have resulted from untoward exposures by many different routes: oral, dermal, inhalation, and parenteral. Toxic change may result from the plastic itself, migration of unbound components and additives, chemical decomposition or toxic pyrolysis products. The type of damage may involve acute poisoning, chronic organ damage, reproductive disorders, and carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic episodes. Typical examples for all routes are cited along with the activities of Canadian regulatory agencies to reduce both the incidence and severity of plastic-induced disease. After the final manufacturing and processing steps, a considerable portion of the plastic industries' products are sold as consumer or household items. Other plastic articles may appear in public places (schools, theaters, stores, transport vehicles), or they could be widely dispersed throughout the work force and thus come into frequent contact with the population.
