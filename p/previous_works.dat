5|$|Internationalist is {{the third}} studio album by Australian {{alternative}} rock band Powderfinger. The album was released on 7 September 1998 and was often labelled Powderfinger's most adventurous work, with greater experimentation than in <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
5|$|The track {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Although many {{thought it was}} catchy, it {{was thought to be}} generic when compared to other songs played on the radio, and is noted for being a departure from Cheryl's <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{internal}} references {{that they often}} make to earlier passages within them, Schubert's last sonatas contain distinct allusions and resemblances {{to some of his}} <b>previous</b> <b>works,</b> mostly earlier piano works, as well as many of his songs. Important similarities also exist between certain passages in the sonatas and works from other genres that were composed in parallel, during the same months in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Graveyard Mountain Home was generally positive. Critics {{noted that the}} album was a departure from Moore's <b>previous</b> <b>works,</b> {{and that it was}} best experienced as an alternate soundtrack to Age 13.

He approached Telugu poet and playwright Devulapalli Krishnasastri to write the film's script and lyrics after being impressed with his <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> Narasimha Reddy made a few changes to Buchibabu's play and reworked Krishnadevaraya's character.|$|E
5|$|Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by {{the time}} of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a {{well-established}} author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the Académie Française in 1746. He was a deist, a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of tyrannical governments. Candide became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views. More specifically, it was a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the contes philosophiques. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> of his such as Zadig and Micromegas.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in stark contrast to the band's <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E

5|$|Phillips {{chooses to}} be kept in the dark {{about the future of the}} series, never knowing any farther ahead than his current working script.

Breitweiser, an {{integral}} part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was led by}} West himself, {{alongside}} a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's <b>previous</b> <b>works,</b> including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.|$|E

Its contents are a repackaged collection from four of Neill's <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> The foreword was written by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, who distinguished between authoritarian coercion and Summerhill.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H.

5|$|The {{series has}} been well {{received}} by Japanese and English readers, and it reached high positions on various best-seller lists; the series has sold over twenty million manga volumes in Japan. Both the manga and anime have had positive response from critics, who praised its connections to <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> and its artwork. The plot twists in later parts of the story have resulted in mixed reactions due to positive focus on {{the impact on the}} plot and negative one based on how confusing they are.|$|E
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
30|$|In {{keeping with}} <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> {{we show that}} {{measurement}} error in self-reported BMI is substantial and correlated with the true recorded value of BMI. We extend <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> by showing that, for the outcomes we examine, the self-reported error is also differential. This means that the reported BMI contains information on the respondent, even after controlling for true BMI. We show that the bias resulting from these errors can be substantial and that popular approaches proposed in <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> may not adequately address these problems. In the conclusion we discuss some alternative approaches {{that could be considered}} to reduce the bias.|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E
5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens {{said in an interview that}} he worked for fewer days when compared to his <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was among}} the first novels he {{released}} under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in La Peau de chagrin from <b>previous</b> <b>works.</b> He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is Eugène de Rastignac, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel Le Père Goriot, Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character– Massiac– and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between teacher and student in La Peau de chagrin is mirrored in Le Père Goriot, when the young Rastignac is guided in the ways of social realpolitik by the incognito criminal Vautrin.|$|E
