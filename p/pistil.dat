5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} <b>pistil</b> protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the <b>pistil.</b> Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds.

5|$|Darwin {{held the}} {{opposite}} position; he maintained that Linnaeus's works should be translated as literally {{as possible and}} that the sexual references in the nomenclature should be retained. In 1783 and 1787, the Botanical Society of Lichfield, founded by Darwin {{and several of his}} friends specifically to translate Linnaeus's works, issued their own English translation, A System of Vegetables, that categorized over 1400 plants. Assisted by Samuel Johnson, they coined over fifty new botanical words; it is this work, along with the group's The Families of Plants that introduced the words stamen and <b>pistil</b> into the English language, for example. By 1796 their translation had prevailed and Withering was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success in}} higher plants {{requires}} a lot of energy and substance provided by carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and potassium (K) {{plays an important role in}} carbohydrate and protein metabolism. However, it is unclear whether K deficiency limits reproductive success by disturbing carbohydrate and protein metabolism. The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of K deficiency on carbohydrate and protein metabolism in subtending leaves, phloem and <b>pistils,</b> and their relationship with reproductive success. A cotton cultivar DP 0912 was grown in K-deficient (0 mM K+) and K-sufficient (6 mM K+) nutrient solution in growth chambers. Results showed that Pn of the subtending leaves was decreased under K deficiency, but sucrose, starch and free amino acid contents were markedly increased in the K-deficient leaves, because K deficiency limited the translocation of sucrose and amino acid in phloem. As a result, sucrose and free amino acid contents were reduced by 47. 3 % and 51. 8 % in the K-deficient <b>pistils</b> than K-sufficient <b>pistils,</b> which led to further decreases in starch and protein accumulation in the K-deficient <b>pistils.</b> Glucose content was also reduced by 53. 1 % in the K-deficient <b>pistils</b> than K-sufficient <b>pistils,</b> due to the decreased acid and alkaline invertase activities, since sucrose synthase activity was not affected. Lastly, soluble carbohydrate and ATP contents were lower in the K-deficient <b>pistils</b> than K-sufficient <b>pistils,</b> similarly to the changes of pollen tube growth rate and seed set efficiency. It was concluded that the lower carbohydrate and ATP contents in the K-deficient <b>pistils</b> could not meet the energy requirements of pollen tube growth and seed set. Moreover, protein imbalance also limited pollen tube growth. Those changes resulted in lower seed set efficiency to limit reproductive successauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} a botanical genetic {{polymorphism}} is heterostyly, in which flowers occur in different forms with different arrangements of the <b>pistils</b> and the stamens. The system is called heteromorphic self-incompatibility, and the general 'strategy' of stamens separated from <b>pistils</b> is known as herkogamy.|$|R
25|$|As in all Proteaceae, {{individual}} flowers {{consist of}} a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry <b>pistil.</b> The <b>pistil</b> end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.acuminata, the perianth is 24–25mm long, pale pink at the base and mauve above, with sticky hairs on the base. The <b>pistil</b> is 29–40mm long, and cream or pink in colour. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing a single winged seed.|$|E
25|$|Aggregate fruits {{form from}} single flowers that have {{multiple}} carpels {{which are not}} joined together, i.e. each <b>pistil</b> contains one carpel. Each <b>pistil</b> forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including Clematis and Ranunculus have an etaerio of achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry, have an etaerio of drupelets. Annona have an etaerio of berries.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the <b>pistil</b> of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible <b>pistil</b> or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E

25|$|Maize flowers may {{sometimes}} exhibit mutations {{that lead to}} the formation of female flowers in the tassel.

25|$|Byblis species {{look very}} similar to Drosera and Drosophyllum, but are {{distinguished}} by their zygomorphic flowers, with five curved stamens {{off to one side}} of the <b>pistil.</b> These genera are in fact not closely related; modern classifications place Byblis in the Lamiales, while the sundews and Drosophyllum are now placed in the Caryophyllales.|$|E
25|$|The grass {{subfamily}} Pooideae, {{and perhaps}} {{all of the}} family Poaceae, have a gametophytic self-incompatibility system that involves two unlinked loci referred to as S and Z.

25|$|Since SSI is {{determined}} by a diploid genotype, the pollen and <b>pistil</b> each express the translation products of two different alleles, i.e. two male and two female determinants. Dominance relationships often exist between pairs of alleles, resulting in complicated patterns of compatibility/self-incompatibility. These dominance relationships also allow the generation of individuals homozygous for a recessive S allele.|$|E
25|$|Many {{plants have}} flowers {{and these are}} the sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, {{producing}} both male and female gametes. The female parts, {{in the center of a}} flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound <b>pistil.</b> Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the <b>pistil</b> and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.|$|E

25|$|More commonly, {{the process}} of {{pollination}} requires pollinators: organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the receptive part of the carpel or <b>pistil</b> (stigma) of another. This is biotic pollination. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the {{dome-shaped}} head characteristic of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches or on short laterals, and consist of from 80 to 100 individual densely packed together and surrounded by a short involucre of narrow, tapering bracts. The hairless tips of these bracts are quite prominent; this is a distinctive characteristic of this species. As in all Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry <b>pistil.</b> The <b>pistil</b> end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.fraseri, the perianth is 24–28 millimetres long, and pink to cream in colour; and the style 30–42mm long and cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing two winged seeds. In this species each head may set an unusually large number of follicles.|$|E
25|$|During pollination, plants enforce {{self-incompatibility}} (SI) as {{an important}} means to prevent self-fertilization. Research on the corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) has revealed that proteins in the <b>pistil</b> on which the pollen lands, interact with pollen and trigger PCD in incompatible (i.e., self) pollen. The researchers, Steven G. Thomas and Veronica E. Franklin-Tong, {{also found that the}} response involves rapid inhibition of pollen-tube growth, followed by PCD.|$|E
40|$|Pollination of Japanese pear 2 ̆ 7 Chojuro 2 ̆ 7, self-incompatible cultivar, at bud stages {{increased}} persisting {{fruit on}} a tree, even though selfing. Buds, selfed during 6 and 3 days before anthesis, produced fruit {{and they were}} persisted on a tree till harvest time. After bud pollination, the levels of gibberellin-like substances (GAs) extracted from <b>pistils</b> were assayed by elongation of dwarf rice seedling. Although the amounts of GAs in non-pollinated <b>pistils</b> decreased gradually till 16 days after castration, they increased in the <b>pistils</b> cross-pollinated. In the self-pollinated <b>pistils,</b> relatively high amounts of GAs were observed, especially the activitiy 4 days after pollination was stronger than that cross-pollinated one. These activities were assumed to be gibberellic acid (GA_ 3) judged from Rf value of paper chromatogram. The overall levels of GAs in self-pollinated <b>pistils</b> were intermediate between non- and cross-pollinated. Exogeneous application of GA_ 3 and GA_ had almost {{no effect on the}} protrusion of pollen tubes from the excised-styles cultured on an agar medium. From these results and other informations, increasing fruit set when selfed at bud stage was considered to be not only due to overcoming self-incompatibility, but also due to parthenocarpy induced by GAs in <b>pistils</b> produced after pollination. 1. 開葯前 6 〜 3 日の蕾を自家受粉することにより収穫までに至る果実が得られた. 2. 蕾受粉後の雌ずい内におけるジベレリン様物質の活性は試験を行なった 16 日間を通じて和合, 不和合, 無受粉区の順に高かった. しかし, 受粉後 4 日めの雌ずいでは和合のものよりむしろ不和合のものの方が高い傾向が見られた. これらのジベレリン活性はペーパークロマトグラムのRf値からGA_ 3 と推定された. 3. 外生ジベレリンGA_ 3 およびGA_ の花粉管生長に対する促進的効果は明確に観察できなかった. 4. 以上の結果より, 日本ナシの蕾受粉による着果には, 受粉によって雌ずい内に誘起される内生ジベレリンが関与した単為結果的な着果が含まれるものと推察された...|$|R

25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{composed}} of three sepals and three petals that are seldom noticed by people, they are small and hidden under extravagant stamens. What appear to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower 'petal' is the <b>pistil</b> which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (<b>pistil</b> in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E

50|$|The {{lengths of}} stamens and <b>pistils</b> in heterostylous flowers are adapted for {{pollination}} by different pollinators, or different body {{parts of the}} same pollinator.
