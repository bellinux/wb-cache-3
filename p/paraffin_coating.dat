40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a technique for continuous tuning of the Hanle effect from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) {{by changing the}} polarization ellipticity of a control beam. In contrast to previous work in this field, we use spatially separated probe and control beams. The experiments are done using magnetic sublevels of the F_g = 4 → F_e = 5 closed hyperfine transition in the 852 nm D_ 2 line of ^ 133 Cs. The atoms are contained in a room temperature vapor cell with anti-relaxation (<b>paraffin)</b> <b>coating</b> on the walls. The <b>paraffin</b> <b>coating</b> {{is necessary for the}} atomic coherence to be transported between the beams. The experimental results are supported by a density-matrix analysis of the system, which also explains the observed amplitude and zero-crossing of the resonances. Such continuous tuning of the sign of a resonance has important applications in quantum memory and other precision measurements. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

The results of the investigation obtained from genotypes appeared predominant variation in terms of most of the characters studied in the laboratory situation. The Langra enriched a greater amount of P, Mg, Fe and Mn over the Khirshapat and the process of enrichment was gradually increased with the advance of storage period up to the last edible stage. The Khirshapat showed a greater performance in producing of Ca, Cu and Zn, and longer shelf life in comparison with the Langra at all the storage times. The mineral constituents of mango pulp were also changed during storage period. Low temperature (4 ± 1 0 C) was found to be more effective in retaining the original green color of mangos for a period of time, but it caused chilling injury and fruits did not ripen at all after removal from low temperature. <b>Paraffin</b> <b>coating</b> was assumed to be better in retarding the ripening process of the postharvest mango, which might be easily adopted by common people for the mango storage...|$|E

We have modeled the Rb diffusion both in the cell and in the coating, assuming that the main loss of Rb atoms is due to the physical absorption of the atoms by the glass substrate. It is demonstrated that the equilibrium atomic density in the cell is a monotonic function of the thickness of the paraffin coating: the density increases with an increase in the thickness of the coating. The diffusion coefficient for rubidium in paraffin thin films has been determined to be equal to 4, 7 * 10 ^- 7 cm^ 2 /s.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the Hanle effect can be tuned between magnetically induced absorption (MIA) and magnetically induced transmission (MIT) simply by changing the polarization of the input laser beam. The experiments are done using closed hyperfine transitions of the D- 2 line of Cs- 133 - Fg = 3 -> F-e = 2 and F-g = 4 -> Fe = 5. The former shows a transformation from MIT to MIA, while the latter shows the opposite behavior. A qualitative explanation based on optical pumping and coherences among the magnetic sublevels of the ground state is borne out by a detailed density- matrix calculation. To increase the coherence time, the experiments are done in a C-s vapor cell with <b>paraffin</b> <b>coating</b> on the walls.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{prolonged}} coherence {{time of the}} collective spin wave of a thermal 87 Rb atomic ensemble in a paraffin coated cell. The spin wave is prepared through a stimulated Raman Process. The long coherence time time is achieved by prolonging the lifetime of the spins with <b>paraffin</b> <b>coating</b> and minimize dephasing with optimal experimental configuration. The observation of the long time delayed-stimulated Stokes signal {{in the writing process}} suggests the prolonged lifetime of the prepared spins; a direct measurement of the decay of anti-Stokes signal in the reading process shows the coherence time is up to 300 us after minimizing dephasing. This is one hundred times longer than the reported coherence time in the similar experiments in thermal atomic ensembles based on the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) and its improved protocols. This prolonged coherence time sets the upper limit of the memory time in quantum repeaters based on such protocols, which is crucial for the realization of long-distance quantum communication.

40|$|Open Access. Alkali-metal vapor {{cells with}} antirelaxation coating (especially paraffin-coated cells) {{have been a}} central tool in optical pumping and atomic {{spectroscopy}} experiments for 50 years. We have discovered a dramatic change of the alkali-metal vapor density in a paraffin-coated cell upon application of an electric field to the cell. A systematic experimental characterization of the phenomenon is carried out for electric fields ranging in strength from 0 – 8 kV/cm for paraffin-coated cells containing rubidium and cells containing cesium. The typical response of the vapor density to a rapid (duration <~ 100 ms) change in electric field of sufficient magnitude includes (a) a rapid (duration of <~ 100 ms) and significant increase in alkali-metal vapor density followed by (b) a less rapid (duration of ~ 1 s) and significant decrease in vapor density (below the equilibrium vapor density), and then (c) a slow (duration of ~ 100 s) recovery of the vapor density to its equilibrium value. Measurements conducted after the alkali-metal vapor density has returned to its equilibrium value indicate minimal change (at the level of <~ 10 %) in the relaxation rate of atomic polarization.

The two factors experiment was assigned in randomized complete block design with tree replicates. The varieties had profound variation in terms of most of the characters studied in the laboratory condition. Initially the Langra significantly enriched a greater amount of vitamin C (151. 23 mg/ 100 g) and titratable acidity (4. 31 %) and these were decreased gradually with the progress of storage period. The Khirshapat showed higher pulp pH (5. 83); produced enormous amount of TSS (18. 00 %) and sugar (TS = 17. 62 %, RS = 6. 51 % and NRS = 11. 06 %) content at 12 th day of storage. The pH, TSS, sugar (TS, RS and NRS) content of mango pulp was rapidly increased, whereas vitamin C and titratable acidity decreased drastically from the untreated mangoes.

During 2011 - 2015, ClO 4 -has been detected {{in drinking water}} with concentrations above french recommanded levels, in the northeast of France, along frontlines of World War I (WWI), and outside, in agricultural environment. For time, there are no scientifical large scale researchs focusing on the real perchlorate sources in France and theirs relationships with the observed contamination. Moreover, the extent, the time and space fates of the contamination of groundwater have not been studied yet. This desktop study aims to highlight the origins and possible ClO 4 -sources in the speficic historical frame of France. Detailled archivistic researchs have been conducted in France, in London and in the USA. Furthermore, high explosives (HE) loading shells of Great War, discovered near Verdun have been sampled by the BRGM and analyzed for perchlorate, chlorate (ClO 3 -), nitrate, ammonium and NitroAromatic Compounds (NAC). Two origins of perchlorate have been identified: natural ClO 4 -as impurity of chilean nitrates and (electro) synthetic perchlorate. Chilean nitrates had been massively imported in France before the WWII as fertilizers for intensive agriculture of beet and wheat and to supply the industry in nitrogen to produce nitric acid, synthetic fertilizers and NAC. ClO 4 -has thus polluted " conversion salpeter " (KNO 3), entering the composition of traditionnal black powder, ammonium nitrate and TNT of artillery shells, increasing dangerously the sensitivity to detonation when firing the projectiles. The presence of ClO 4 -impurites had been measured by the BRGM in sampled NAC HE as well in black powder by german chemists {{at the end of}} the XIX th century. Premature blastings of shells during firing due to ClO 4 -impurities were described by the gunners since 1880. During Trench War (1915 - 1917), enormous needs of HE for trench artillery and grenades motivated the development and large scale production of 4 types of synthetic (per) chlorated HE compositions, based on mixes of ClO 3 -or ClO 4 -energetic oxidizer with paraffinic fuels colored by methylen blue. 130 900 tons of (per) chlorate HE have been produced in France during WWI in France. The <b>paraffin</b> <b>coating</b> the salts may drasticaly hindered the dissolution rates of the explosives. The perchlorate could be introduced in the soil by old soil fertilizing, sparsed low-order detonation of projectiles, corrosion of the thin steel bodies of unexplosed ordnances, or by massiv ammunition surpluses breaking-down operations during the interwar period. Further researches are needed to define the kinetic dissolution of ClO 4 -in HE, to develop analytical and isotopic tools to fingerprint the origin of perchlorate. Specific methodologies are required too to define the sources, agricultural and/or military, of perchlorate in the specific case of France. Projects aiming these objectives are currently starting in the Vosges Mountain, in the region of Verdun, and in the Champagne area...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate all possible factors which may lead to antigen decay on a prospective standardized collection of human tissues with a panel of 14 routinely used antibodies. Serial slide sections from FFPE control tissues were stored using different methods (routine storage at room temperature, Parafilm(®) protected, <b>paraffin</b> <b>coated</b> and cold stored at 4  °C) and for different time periods: 1, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36  months. Immunohistochemistry was performed at each time cutoff simultaneously on stored sections and on freshly cut sections using a panel of 14 antibodies. Immunoreactivity was compared with immunoreactions performed at time zero. Reduction in immunostaining was observed for a subset of antibodies (CD 3, CD 31, CD 117, estrogen and progesterone receptors, Ki 67, p 53, TTF- 1, vimentin) while for others (smooth muscle actin, keratins 7, 20, AE 1 /AE 3, 34 βE 12), no antigen decay was observed. Loss of antigenicity was proportional to tissue section age and was dependent on mode of storage with cold storage slides being the least affected. All antigens with reductions in immunosignal were nuclear or membranous, and they all required heat pre-treatment for antigen retrieval. In contrast to results from other studies, when pre-analytical factors are strictly controlled and standardized, antigen decay seems to be restricted to nuclear or membrane antigens which require heat antigen retrieval...|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of oiling parchment or paper {{in order to}} make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the middle ages. Paper impregnated or coated with purified beeswax was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. Gustave Le Gray introduced the use of waxed paper for photographic negatives in 1851. [...] Natural wax was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after Herman Frasch developed ways of purifying <b>paraffin</b> and <b>coating</b> paper with it in 1876. Wax paper is commonly used in cooking for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as cookies, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in arts and crafts.|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study the effect of different concentrations of calcium chloride (1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %), <b>paraffin</b> wax <b>coating</b> and different wrapping materials (polyethylene, carton paper) inorder to increase the shelf life and to avoid the postharvest losses of Banky cultivars of apple. In physical characteristics general appearance (color and shape of fruit), weight loss percentage and organoleptic evaluation were studied during storage. In chemical characteristics, total soluble solids, pH, acidity, total sugar, reducing sugar and Vitamin C were analyzed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 days of storage. All the treatments had {{significant effect on the}} shelf life of fruits. However, Calcium chloride (2 %) was reported superior to all other treatments. Calcium chloride (2 %) proved very useful for reducing weight loss and shriveling and retained consumer acceptability even after 60 days of storage. Polyethylene packaging stood second position after 2 % calcium chloride treatment...|$|R
30|$|Solid {{paraffin}} wax in sheet form (about 7.5  kg) {{was put into}} the stainless pot. It was heated by a temperature controller of stove until all paraffin completely became liquid. The temperature of the liquid paraffin was kept at 90 – 95  °C until the coating process was finished. The temperature was checked by a thermometer every 5  min. The flower pot suspended by a rope was immersed into the liquid paraffin for 10  s. The immersed flower pot was left at the room temperature for at least 1  day. The weight of the <b>paraffin</b> used for <b>coating</b> ranged from 15.0 to 17.8 grams (3 samples: average 16.7  g, 3.1  g per pot by 100  g).|$|R
