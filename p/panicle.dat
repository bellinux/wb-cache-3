25|$|Flower buds {{are formed}} in March and April and these open from October {{to the end}} of December varying {{according}} to location and altitude. The inflorescence sits {{at the end of the}} branches in an umbel-like <b>panicle</b> that consists of five to ten flowers. Each flower is hermaphrodite, starsymmetric, 2½—3½cm in diameter and produces copious amounts of nectar, but apparently does not emit a scent. The five sepals are broadly oval, covered in downy hairs and 5–6mm long. The five petals are overlapping in the bud, white, felty, spoon-shaped with a narrow base (or claw). The claw is 1½-2cm long and is inserted on a 5-lobed disc. The five stamens extend well beyond the corolla and alternate with the five lobes of the disc at the centre of the flower. The filaments are very long and white. The anthers are connected to the filaments midlength and open in lengthwise slits towards the middle of the flower. Pollen grains have five slits. The nectar is produced by the ledges of the disc, just above the petal inplant. The five styles that rise from the disc are sometimes free from each other at their based and are twisting and fused higher up.|$|E
500|$|Panicles of creamy-yellow {{flowers with}} red {{markings}} appear from September to November in the species' native range. These arise from axillary buds on end branches. Each <b>panicle</b> contains 10–30 flowers and is [...] long, and each flower is [...] long and [...] wide. The {{length of the}} lobes of the perianth is {{more than half the}} perianth diameter. Like all Brachychiton species, B.rupestris is monoecious—each plant has distinct male and female flowers. Male flowers have 15 stamens, with pale yellow anthers, while female flowers have cream or white stigmas surrounded by rudimentary stellate (star-shaped) carpels, which sit atop the ovaries.|$|E
500|$|The {{flowering}} {{season of}} P.atriplicifolia {{can be as}} long as June through October, although populations {{in some parts of}} its range, such as China, may bloom in a much more restricted period. The inflorescence is a showy <b>panicle,</b> , with many branches. Each of these branches is a raceme, with the individual flowers arranged in pairs called s. Each flower's calyx is purple, densely covered in white or purple hairs, and about [...] The corolla is tube-shaped, formed from a four-lobed upper lip and a slightly shorter lower lip; the blue or violet blue petals are about 1cm long. The style has been reported in both an —extending beyond the flower's tube—form and one contained within the flower; all known examples of P.atriplicifolia in cultivation have exserted styles. Gardening author Neil Soderstrom describes the appearance of the flowers from a distance as [...] "like a fine haze or fog".|$|E

500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{seems to}} flower {{at any time}} of the year. [...] Flowers are {{produced}} in large numbers on inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem. [...] N. rajah produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80cm, and sometimes even 120cm [...] tall. [...] The individual flowers of N. rajah are produced on partial peduncles (twin stalks) and so the inflorescence is called a raceme (as opposed to a <b>panicle</b> for multi-flowered bunches). [...] The flowers are reported to give off a strong sugary smell and are brownish-yellow in colour. Sepals are elliptic to oblong and ≤8mm long. Like all Nepenthes species, N. rajah is dioecious, which means that individual plants produce flowers of a single sex. [...] Fruits are orange-brown and 10 to 20mm long (see [...] ). A study of 300 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (J.H.Adam 2443, collected at an altitude of 1930–2320m) found the mean pollen diameter to be 34.7μm (SE = 0.3; CV = 7.0%).|$|E

30|$|The {{plots of}} all the entries were {{harvested}} at or after physiological maturity (85 – 90 days after planting). During harvest, main <b>panicles</b> of five random plants from each plot were harvested and stored separately in a cloth bag to produce clean grain samples for micronutrient analysis. The remaining <b>panicles</b> of the plot were harvested as a bulk. These <b>panicles</b> were sundried for 10 to 15 days. While threshing, five separately harvested <b>panicles</b> mentioned above were manually threshed first and approximately 20 g of grains were collected for Fe and Zn analysis. The left over grains from these <b>panicles</b> {{were added to the}} bulk grain produced by threshing all the <b>panicles</b> of the plot in a multi-head machine thresher. The grain yield, including the 20 g sample taken for micronutrient analysis, was recorded for each plot and converted to t ha- 1 for grain yield analysis. A random sample of 200 grains for each entry was weighed to determine 1000 -grain weight.|$|R

60|$|Some low steep spurs {{were well}} cultivated, though {{the angle of}} the field was upwards of 25 degrees; the crops, chiefly maize, were just sprouting. This plant is {{occasionally}} hermaphrodite in Sikkim, the flowers forming a large drooping <b>panicle</b> and ripening small grains; it is, however, a rare occurrence, and the specimens are highly valued by the people.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} day we turned out our Vanda to dress the specimens for travelling, and preserve the flowers for botanical purposes. Of the latter we had 360 panicles, each composed of from six to twenty-one broad pale-blue tesselated flowers, {{three and a half}} to four inches across and they formed three piles {{on the floor of the}} verandah, each a yard high: what would we not have given to have been able to transport a single <b>panicle</b> to a Chiswick fete! ...|$|E

It has a long, narrow, one-sided, and {{slightly}} nodding <b>panicle</b> of bright purple and yellow flowers, like a banner raised above its reedy leaves. These bright standards are now advanced on the distant hill-sides, not in large armies, but in scattered troops or single file, like the red men. They stand thus fair and bright, representative of the race which they are named after, {{but for the most part}} unobserved as they. The expression of this grass haunted me for a week, after I first passed and noticed it, like the glance of an eye. It stands like an Indian chief taking a last look at his favorite hunting-grounds.|$|E

40|$|Detection of crop health {{conditions}} {{plays an important}} role in making control strategies of crop disease and insect damage and gaining high-quality production at late growth stages. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance of rice <b>panicles</b> was measured at the visible and near-infrared regions. The <b>panicles</b> were divided into three groups according to {{health conditions}}: healthy <b>panicles,</b> empty <b>panicles</b> caused by Nilaparvata lugens Stål, and <b>panicles</b> infected with Ustilaginoidea virens. Low order derivative spectra, namely, the first and second orders, were obtained using different techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to obtain the principal component spectra (PCS) of the foregoing derivative and raw spectra to reduce the reflectance spectral dimension. Support vector classification (SVC) was employed to discriminate the healthy, empty, and infected <b>panicles,</b> with the front three PCS as the independent variables. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were used to assess the classification accuracy of SVC. The overall accuracies of SVC with PCS derived from the raw, first, and second reflectance spectra for the testing dataset were 96. 55 %, 99. 14 %, and 96. 55 %, and the kappa coefficients were 94. 81 %, 98. 71 %, and 94. 82 %, respectively.

30|$|We {{then asked}} whether SMG 11 {{influences}} expression of BR-signaling genes {{involved in the}} regulation grain size, such as OsBRI 1, GSK 2, OsBZR 1, and BU 1 (Yamamuro et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2009; Tong et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015). We performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis to investigate their expression levels in KYJ and smg 11 <b>panicles.</b> As shown in Fig.  5, expression levels of BRI 1 and BU 1 in smg 11 <b>panicles</b> were lower than those in KYJ <b>panicles,</b> while expression levels of GSK 2 and OsBZR 1 in smg 11 <b>panicles</b> {{were not significantly different}} from those in KYJ <b>panicles.</b> It is plausible that the mutation in SMG 11 /D 2 might decrease BR signaling or responses by repressing expression of BR signaling genes (e.g. OsBRI 1 and BU 1), resulting in small grains.|$|R

Nat., tom. x. p. 134), {{speaking}} of some bushes of the Gomphia oleaefolia, which he at first thought formed a quite distinct species, says: 'Voilà donc dans un même individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantôt a un axe vertical, et tantôt a un gynobase; donc celui-ci n'est qu'un axe veritable; mais cet axe est deprimé au lieu d'être vertical." [...] He adds (p. 151), 'Does not all this indicate that nature has tried, in a manner, {{in the family}} of Rutaceae to produce from a single multilocular ovary, one-styled and symmetrical, several unilocular ovaries, {{each with its own}} style.' And he subsequently shows that, in Xanthoxylum monogynum, 'it often happens that on the same plant, on the same <b>panicle,</b> we find flowers with one or with two ovaries;' and that this is an important character is shown by the Rutaceae (to which Xanthoxylum belongs), being placed in a group of natural orders characterised by having a solitary ovary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{species of}} bamboo, the [...] "Payong" [...] and [...] "Praong" [...] of the Lepchas, here replace the Pao {{of the lower}} regions. The former was {{flowering}} abundantly, {{the whole of the}} culms (which were 20 feet high) being a diffuse <b>panicle</b> of inflorescence. The [...] "Praong" [...] bears a round head of flowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet, geranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone. Around the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet, yam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic leaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a summer crop, at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from the Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is superior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part of Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the nearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation) from July to October. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in March and fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still hard fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.|$|E
60|$|The Purple Grass (Eragrostis pectinacea) {{is now in}} {{the height}} of its beauty. I {{remember}} still when I first noticed this grass particularly. Standing on a hillside near our river, I saw, thirty or forty rods off, a stripe of purple half a dozen rods long, under the edge of a wood, where the ground sloped toward a meadow. It was as high-colored and interesting, though not quite so bright, as the patches of Rhexia, being a darker purple, like a berry's stain laid on close and thick. On going to and examining it, I found it {{to be a kind of}} grass in bloom, hardly a foot high, with but few green blades, and a fine spreading <b>panicle</b> of purple flowers, a shallow, purplish mist trembling around me. Close at hand it appeared but a dull purple, and made little impression on the eye; it was even difficult to detect; and if you plucked a single plant, you were surprised to find how thin it was, and how little color it had. But viewed at a distance in a favorable light, it was of a fine lively purple, flower-like, enriching the earth. Such puny causes combine to produce these decided effects. I was the more surprised and charmed because grass is commonly of a sober and humble color.|$|E
40|$|Today, rice {{has become}} one of the most {{consumed}} cereals in Africa in general and Cameroon in particular. The low domestic production imposes a strong import that accentuates the country's trade imbalance. To reduce this issue of external dependency, the national government is encouraging domestic production. However, producer’s efforts are inhibited by various constraints among which the pest attacks in general and in particular the stem borers. Data collection was based on sampling and incubation of white rice <b>panicles</b> in an experimental plots set up at Nkolbisson, Yaoundé. The susceptibility of rice varieties to different pest species was evaluated by comparing the frequency of pest species on their infested <b>panicles.</b> Among the NERICA rice lines, NERICA 3 had the greatest percentage of attacks <b>panicles</b> that was 41. 96 % while NERICA 9 and 13 had the less percentage of attacks <b>panicles</b> that was 14. 29 % for both of them. A total of three pest species were identified from the <b>panicles</b> incubated, Orseolia oryzivora, Chilo zacconius and Diopsis apicalis, O. oryzivora being the most frequent.

60|$|M. Duval-Jouve {{states that}} the panicles very rarely {{protrude}} from their sheaths, but that when this does happen the flowers expand and exhibit well-developed ovaries and stigmas, together with full-sized anthers containing apparently sound pollen; nevertheless such flowers are invariably quite sterile. Schreiber had previously observed that if a <b>panicle</b> is only half protruded, this half is sterile, whilst the still included half is fertile. Some plants which grew in a large tub of water in my greenhouse behaved on one occasion {{in a very different}} manner. They protruded two very large much-branched panicles; but the florets never opened, though these included fully developed stigmas, and stamens supported on long filaments with large anthers that dehisced properly. If these florets had opened for a short time unperceived by me and had then closed again, the empty anthers would have been left dangling outside. Nevertheless they yielded on August 17th an abundance of fine ripe seeds. Here then we have a near approach to the single case as yet known of this grass producing in a state of nature (in Germany) perfect flowers which yielded a copious supply of fruit. (8/26. Dr. Ascherson 'Botanische Zeitung' 1864 page 350.) Seeds from the cleistogamic flowers were sent by me to Mr. Scott in Calcutta, who there cultivated the plants in various ways, but they never produced perfect flowers.|$|E

That shrubbery above is composed of a species of Boehmeria or Ardisia, and that scarlet flower belongs to our native Aphelandra. In the rear are one or two Philodendrons--disagreeable guests, for their smell is bad enough, and they blister when imprudently touched. There also you may see a tree-fern, though a small one. Nearer to us, and low down beneath our feet, that rich <b>panicle</b> of flowers belongs to a Begonia; and here also is an assemblage of ferns of the genera Asplenium, Hymenophyllum, and Trichomanes, as well as of Hepaticae and Mosses.

Those chain- like, fantastic, strange-looking lianes, resembling a family of boas, are Bauhinias; and beyond, through the opening you see, in the abandoned ground of some squatter's garden, the trumpet-tree (Cecropia) and the groo-groo, the characteristic plants of the rastrajo.|$|E
6000|$|In {{numerous}} other cases we find modifications of structure, which are considered by botanists to be generally {{of a highly}} important nature, affecting {{only some of the}} flowers on the same plant, or occurring on distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions. As these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot have been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases, to any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only a few instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc., that I need not give examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the parts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states that with some species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as frequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which latter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same plant, and even in the same <b>panicle,</b> with either one or two ovaries. In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or tri-locular; and in H. mutabile, [...] "Une lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE, s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta." [...] In the flowers of Saponaria officinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free central placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the southern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms which he did not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them growing on the same bush; and he then adds, [...] "Voila donc dans un meme individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe verticale et tantot a un gynobase." ...|$|E

60|$|Maize has {{varied in}} an {{extraordinary}} and conspicuous manner. Metzger (9/55. 'Die Getreidearten' 1841 s. 208. I have modified a few of Metzger's statements in accordance with those made by Bonafous in his great work 'Hist. Nat. du Mais' 1836.), who paid {{particular attention to the}} cultivation of this plant, makes twelve races (unter-art) with numerous sub-varieties: of the latter some are tolerably constant, others quite inconstant. The different races vary in height from 15-18 feet to only 16- 18 inches, as in a dwarf variety described by Bonafous. The whole ear is variable in shape, being long and narrow, or short and thick, or branched. The ear in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind. The seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows, or are placed irregularly. The seeds are coloured--white, pale-yellow, orange, red, violet, or elegantly streaked with black (9/56. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 80; Al. De Candolle ibid page 951.); and in the same ear there are sometimes seeds of two colours. In a small collection I found that a single grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven grains of another variety. The shape of the seed varies greatly, being very flat, or nearly globular, or oval; broader than long, or longer than broad; without any point, or produced into a sharp tooth, and this tooth is sometimes recurved. One variety (the rugosa of Bonafous, and which is extensively cultivated in the United States as sweet corn) has its seeds curiously wrinkled, giving to the whole ear a singular appearance. Another variety (the cymosa of Bon.) carries its ears so crowded together that it is called mais a bouquet. The seeds of some varieties contain much glucose instead of starch. Male flowers sometimes appear amongst the female flowers, and Mr. J. Scott has lately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true male <b>panicle,</b> and likewise hermaphrodite flowers. (9/57. 'Transact. Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh' volume 8 page 60.) Azara describes (9/58. 'Voyages dans l'Amerique Meridionale' tome 1 page 147.) a variety in Paraguay the grains of which are very tender, and he states that several varieties are fitted for being cooked in various ways. The varieties also differ greatly in precocity, and have different powers of resisting dryness and the action of violent wind. (9/59. Bonafous 'Hist. Nat. du Mais' page 31.) Some of the foregoing differences would certainly be considered of specific value with plants in a state of nature.|$|E
