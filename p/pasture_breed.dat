50|$|Assault was {{originally}} intended to be retired after his four-year-old season and stand stud alongside his sire at King Ranch. However, none of the mares he was mated with became pregnant; {{it was apparent that}} he was sterile. He was returned to racing until the age of seven, where he won a few more races, including one more running of the Brooklyn Handicap. He was then permanently retired to King Ranch. There were some rumors that he was allowed to <b>pasture</b> <b>breed</b> with some of King Ranch's Quarter Horse mares, but there are no records that any of those foals made it to the track. He did sire two Quarter Horse foals, and they were registered with American Quarter Horse Association. Assault died on September 1, 1971, at age 28, at King Ranch. The gravesite is on the King Ranch (in Kingsville, Texas).|$|E
40|$|Thank {{you for the}} {{invitation}} {{to participate in the}} Range Beef Cow Symposium XIV. I have attended some of the Symposia over the years and have found them all to be very informative and educational. I congratulate the staff of the four Universities for the contribution they give to the Beef Industry. My family has a grain and livestock operation in western South Dakota. My wife and I have four sons, who are all involved in our operation. Developing a cow herd that will produce specific, predictable and on-time off-spring, has always been a challenge for most ranchers. Buying feeder cattle for our family feedlot operation, that are specific, predictable and uniform in size and weight is just as big of a challenge. We have always raised commercial replacement heifers and sold part of them at a bred heifer sale. We would <b>pasture</b> <b>breed</b> for 45 days to low birth weight bulls. We would preg test and sell them as a 45 day calving period package. In 1982, we started a small feedlot and over the years have increased it to a total capacity of 10, 000 head. During these years we have been tracking several groups of different ranchers cattle. One of the results that keep showing up is the inconsistency of performance and carcass value within a single rancher herd. Five years ago we began a partner feeding arrangement with Seidel, Inc. (Ron Seidel) of Bison who backgrounds calves up to 800 lbs. then brings them to our feedlot to finish. Seidel was finding some of the same inconsistency in his operation. After a lot of discussion we decided to pursue an A. I. commercial heifer program to sell to ranchers who prefer to buy their replacement heifers rather than raise them...|$|E

50|$|A {{third major}} {{system is a}} {{traditional}} forested or Mediterranean pastoral system. This involves indigenous and exotic <b>breeds</b> <b>pastured</b> in natural forests {{for the production of}} high-value cuts for restaurants or specialty foods. Furthermore, living semi-wild, all phases of production take place outdoors, sometimes in extreme conditions. Swine populations in this case are extremely low compared to world averages. Management is similar to pasture raised swine where animals will have less direct contact with humans with larger areas to roam and root. Finding adequate protein and proper nutrition are challenges, depending on the breed and environment and geographic location.|$|R
50|$|The {{most salient}} {{feature of the}} Tamworth is its great {{hardiness}} with respect to adverse climates. Thus, the breed does well in its more northerly settings such as Scotland and Canada, where winters are severe, not only in regard to cold but also high winds. The animal is not only durable and rugged, but also is extremely well-suited for forest grazing, being able to thrive on bracken. Tamworths graze compatibly with cattle, being able to retrieve forage that cattle leave behind in the open pasture. This said, Tamworth pigs can be protective of their territories, thus somewhat aggressive towards any other livestock in the same pasture. This animal is very efficient at excavation while rooting for food in the forest or <b>pasture.</b> The <b>breed</b> is used in forage-based farming systems. The sows demonstrate good maternal skills, being consistent in suckling all littermates. Litters normally {{range in size from}} six to ten piglets. Piglets at birth are usually wild and wary of humans, but easily adjust to human interaction. Tamworths display a good disposition and enjoy the attention of humans. The Tamworth pig is ready for slaughter in 25-30 weeks.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the older}} smaller public plunge dips such as Peachester {{have fallen into}} disuse, large public dips along {{the line between the}} tick-infested and tick-free areas in Queensland are still operational.

5|$|Between 1009 and 1012, the Kilab {{participated in}} the {{struggle}} between Mansur ibn Lu'lu', the ruler of the Aleppo, and the Hamdanids and their regional backers for control of Aleppo. Twice the Kilab betrayed the Hamdanids and their allies, and in return, demanded from Mansur numerous <b>pastures</b> to <b>breed</b> their flocks and war horses. Instead, Mansur, who viewed the Kilab as a hindrance to his rule, strove to eliminate them by luring the tribesmen into a trap. To that end, on 27 May 1012, he invited them to a feast and once the tribesmen entered his palace, the gates were locked and Mansur and his ghilmān (slave soldiers; sing. ghulām) attacked them. Several were killed and the rest, including Salih, were imprisoned in the citadel of Aleppo. Afterward, the Kilabi emir Muqallid ibn Za'ida besieged the town of Kafartab to gain leverage with Mansur. This prompted the latter to move the Kilabi prisoners to facilities with better conditions in case of future peace negotiations with Muqallid. However, upon hearing of Muqallid's death and his failed siege, Mansur returned the prisoners to the citadel's dungeons, where many among them, including some chieftains, were executed or died of torture or poor conditions.|$|R
50|$|Blackface ewes are {{excellent}} mothers and will often attempt {{to defend their}} lambs against predators. They are good milkers {{and are able to}} yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal <b>pastures.</b> The <b>breed</b> spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There has never been a case of natural occurring Scrapie in a Scottish Blackface Sheep. In a controlled study in the UK goats and Blackface where infected by researchers but there is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or the UK. Scrapie, an invariably fatal disease of sheep and goats, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The putative infectious agent is the host-encoded prion protein, PrP.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in tracing lamb production systems was investigated for four farming {{systems in the}} Tunisian North-West: Ain Draham and Fernana, characterised by woody pasture, and Amdoun and Joumine, characterised by herbaceous <b>pasture.</b> Mixed <b>breed</b> lambs aged 3. 5 - 5 months were reared under semi-extensive and extensive systems. Samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle were taken from eight lambs for each farming system for stable IR assessment of the five main bio-elements in the protein and fat fractions of lamb and for fatty acid (FA) determination. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) the IR profiles of Tunisian lamb types allowed correct assignment of the training meat samples {{to the area of}} origin. Inclusion of the FA profile in the classification model slightly improved its evaluation performance for the individual farming systems; the average accuracy increased by 2 %- 94 %. However, the differences between samples were not sufficiently wide to be validated by an external set of samples including 10 Italian lamb types.

30|$|The {{number of}} pastoralists {{maintaining}} production systems with {{small numbers of}} traditional breeds of cattle decreased dramatically with the modernisation and industrialisation of agriculture in Europe during the twentieth century. While these pastoral systems were not compatible with agricultural industrialisation policies, they provide a far better match to current European Union (EU) policy {{with its emphasis on}} high nature values and various cultural heritage protection measures. Today, these farms can obtain EU funding for preserving natural and/or cultural heritage values rather than producing agricultural goods. Although such EU subsidies make a welcome contribution to the livelihood of traditional farmers, the critical definitions that have to be made regarding what is considered traditional or non-traditional can be problematic. This paper provides an example from Swedish fäbodbruk, a smallholder system of forest <b>pasturing</b> with traditional <b>breeds</b> of cattle, goats and sheep in northern Sweden. As policymaking and agricultural subsidies during the twentieth century reflected the contemporary political agenda of that time, farmers have been subjected to many changes in priority in political decision making. The contemporary push for traditional farming and heritage has made policymaking potentially even more difficult, e.g. as regards the question of what should be considered traditional and what makes up natural and cultural heritage. This paper examines how farmers are affected by valuations and assessments made by the relevant authorities on whether they are producing natural and/or cultural heritage.|$|R
40|$|As oestrous {{expression}} of dairy cows has decreased {{over the last}} decades oestrus detection has become more difficult. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the main factors that affect oestrus detection in seasonal calving dairy cows, and to establish their relative importance. In each of 5 years 36 Normande and 36 Holstein cows were assigned to a Low or High winter-feeding level group. Half of each group was then assigned to a Low or High pasture-feeding group. The Low-Low strategy resulted in the lowest milk yield and the greatest body condition (BC) loss from calving to nadir BC score (6302 kg; - 0. 98 unit). The High-High strategy had the converse effect (7549 kg; - 0. 75 units). Low-High and High-Low strategies had intermediate values. The Normande cows had lower milk yield and BC loss than Holstein cows (6153 kg versus 7620 kg; - 0. 82 unit versus - 1. 20 unit). A database of 415 observed spontaneous oestruses was created. Oestruses were classified according to detection signs: (1) standing to be mounted, (2) mounting without standing, (3) other signs without standing or mounting (slight signs). Presence of another cow in oestrus, access to <b>pasture,</b> Normande <b>breed</b> and Low-Low strategy increased standing detection. In the Normande breed, 97 % of oestruses were detected by standing while combining the presence of a herdmate in oestrus and access to pasture with a milk production of less than 6550 kg. Holstein cows had a higher frequency of slight signs oestruses than Normande ones, which was associated with a decreased subsequent calving rate (P< 0. 05). In multiparous Holstein cows, the odds of slight signs detection was multiplied by 7. 8 for the High-High group in comparison with the Low-Low group (P< 0. 05). In our study milk yield had an effect on oestrus detection which was not explained by BC loss. As High-High cows produced more milk than others, we logically found that an increase in milk yield increased slight signs detection. Conversely, as they lost less BC than others, BC loss improved the chance of standing or mounting detection. These two results show that an increase in milk yield may reduce oestrous behaviour even if BC loss is moderate. Oestrus detection is crucial in seasonal compact calving systems. High phenotypic milk yields appear unsuitable with such systems in regard to depressed oestrous behaviour...|$|R
40|$|In my bachelor's thesis I give an {{overview}} of sheep farming and grazing using sheepdogs. In the first part, I focus on rearing sheep [...] especially {{on the characteristics of}} types and breeds reared for profit, on nutrition, housing and grazing. In the second part, I focus on rearing sheepdogs, especially on their characteristics and selected breeds, choice of pups, upbringing, care, and problem behaviour. I have tried to point out the differences in temperament and type of sheepdogs compared with regularly reared dog breeds. Sheep farming has a long tradition in the Czech Republic and remains an important sector of livestock production. The importance of sheep farming lies mainly in the versatile usableness of sheep (meat, milk, wool and by-products, e. g. manure) and, in the recent years, also in ecological farming. Sheep are being reared in sheepfolds or adapted buildings. Sheep are typical grazing animals. There are various grazing systems: set stocking, paddock grazing, strip grazing, and grazing of sheep in combination with other farm animals. To feed sheep, we usually either let them graze or [...] in the winter [...] feed them hay; alternatively we use sillage, high-energy feeds or root crops. There are a large number of breeds of sheep used for grazing. Based on their purpose, we distinguish combined breeds (e. g. Merino, Merinolandschaf, Tsigai), meat- (e. g. Suffolk, Charollais, Texel) and milk-breeds (e. g. East Friesian sheep), and prolific breeds (e. g. Romanov sheep). Both pure breeding and crossbreeding are being used. Together with the return to sheep grazing, breeders are increasingly using sheepdogs for the protection of their herds. A sheepdog can independently guard a herd and its constant presence deters predators, stray dogs and thieves. Sheepdogs live with herds on <b>pastures.</b> The <b>breeds</b> used include Bernese Mountain Dog, Caucasian, Anatolian Shepherd Dog and Central Asian Shepherd Dog. These dogs are strong and massive, confident, and fearless even when facing large predators. These breeds have no tests of performance so we choose pups from litters where the parents work and use their instincts on a daily basis. These dogs have genetic dispositions for guarding and only need time for the development of their skills. Training sheepdogs is therefore focused primarily on managing unwanted behaviour and upbringing near herds of sheep so that the dog can form a strong bond with sheep...|$|R

It is only produced with whole milk from the Podolic breed of cow which feeds mainly in the <b>pastures.</b> The Podolic <b>breed</b> is reared in the wild throughout the southern Apennine mountains. In the Basilicata region the cheese is produced in the province of Potenza (at Brienza, Forenza, Viggiano, Atella, San Fele, Calvello, Pescopagano, Pietrapertosa, Tolve and Lagonegro), and in the province of Matera (at Accettura,Salandra, Stigliano and Ferrandina).For some time now a process has been undertaken with the purpose, of achieving the European Dop mark for Lucanian Caciocavallo Podolico and which has already led to the drafting of production regulations. Lucanian Caciocavallo Podolico is a stringy cheese. The milk, which comes entirely from the morning’s milking, must be processed within 24 hours. The whole process and the seasoning are governed by the regulations, as are the tools and the ingredient amounts, from the “tina”, the wooden container where the cheese is initially worked, to the quantities and types of curd to be used. Even before the regulations were enforced, the process that leads to producing Lucanian Caciocavallo Podolico was codified by centuries-old tradition, handed down in these places by generations of cheese makers and herdsmen. The cheeses are characteristically pear-shaped, hung “by the neck” between the roof beams to mature.The bouquet is that of the Lucanian woods, rosemary and heather, the fragrance and that particularity that only products of long ago know how to transmit, are the best credentials with which Lucanian Caciocavallo Podolico presents itself to the consumers.|$|R
40|$|Mitigating methane {{production}} by ruminants {{is a significant}} challenge to global livestock production. This research offers a new paradigm to reduce methane emissions from ruminants by breeding climate-clever clovers. We demonstrate wide genetic diversity for the trait methanogenic potential in Australia’s key pasture legume, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). In a bi-parental population the broadsense heritability in methanogenic potential was moderate (H 2 = 0. 4) and allelic variation in a region of Chr 8 accounted for 7. 8 % of phenotypic variation. In a genome-wide association study we identified four loci controlling methanogenic potential assessed by an in vitro fermentation system. Significantly, {{the discovery of a}} single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on Chr 5 in a defined haplotype block with an upstream putative candidate gene from a plant peroxidase-like superfamily (TSub_g 18548) and a downstream lectin receptor protein kinase (TSub_g 18549) provides valuable candidates for an assay for this complex trait. In this way haplotype variation can be tracked to <b>breed</b> <b>pastures</b> with reduced methanogenic potential. Of the quantitative trait loci candidates, the DNA-damage-repair/toleration DRT 100 -like protein (TSub_g 26967), linked to avoid the severity of DNA damage induced by secondary metabolites, is considered central to enteric methane production, as are disease resistance (TSub_g 26971, TSub_g 26972, and TSub_g 18549) and ribonuclease proteins (TSub_g 26974, TSub_g 26975). These proteins are good pointers to elucidate the genetic basis of in vitro microbial fermentability and enteric methanogenic potential in subterranean clover. The genes identified allow the design of a suite of markers for marker-assisted selection to reduce rumen methane emission in selected pasture legumes. We demonstrate the feasibility of a plant breeding approach without compromising animal productivity to mitigate enteric methane emissions, {{which is one of the}} most significant challenges to global livestock production...|$|R

In a large study, 64 German Holstein and German Simmental bulls {{were randomly}} allocated to either an indoor concentrate system or periods of pasture feeding {{followed by a}} finishing period on a concentrate containing linseed to enhance the contents of beneficial fatty acids in beef. This paper reports the diet effects on the concentration of 12 -methyltridecanal (12 -MT) and further fatty aldehydes released from plasmalogens in the phospholipids of longissimus muscle of the bulls. Because of the trace level of the important odorant 12 -MT in beef, the determination of fatty aldehydes in phospholipids was done by acidic hydrolysis and {{the reaction of the}} aldehydes with 2, 4 -DNPH followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The diet affected the 12 -MT concentrations in the muscle phospholipids of both <b>breeds.</b> <b>Pasture</b> feeding significantly increased the 12 -MT concentrations up to 350 ?g/ 100 g fresh muscle in the muscle phospholipids of German Holstein and German Simmental bulls as compared with the concentrate-fed bulls.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of bovine fasciolosis in Denmark is increasing but appropriate guidelines for control are currently lacking. In {{order to help}} develop a control strategy for liver fluke, a risk factor study of farm management factors was conducted and the utility of bulk tank milk (BTM ELISA) {{as a tool for}} diagnosis in Danish dairy cattle farms was assessed. Methods This case-control study aimed to identify farm-level risk factors for fasciolosis in Danish dairy farms (>[*] 50 animals slaughtered in 2013) using two diagnostic methods: recordings of liver condemnation at slaughter, and farm-level Fasciola hepatica antibody levels in BTM. A case farm was defined as having a minimum of 3 incidents of liver condemnation due to liver fluke at slaughter (in any age group) during 2013, and control farms were located within 10  km of at least one case farm and had no history of liver condemnation due to liver fluke during 2011 – 2013. The selected farmers were interviewed over telephone about grazing and control practices, and BTM from these farms was collected and analysed by ELISA in 2014. The final complete dataset consisting of 131 case and 63 control farms was analysed using logistic regression. Results Heifers grazing on wet pastures, dry cows grazing on wet <b>pastures,</b> herd size, <b>breed</b> and concurrent beef cattle production were identified as risk factors associated with being classified as a case farm. With the categorised BTM ELISA result as the response variable, heifers grazing on wet pastures, dry cows grazing on wet pastures, and purchase of cows were identified as risk factors. Within the case and control groups, 74. 8 and 12. 7 % of farms were positive for fasciolosis on BTM ELISA, respectively. The differences are likely {{to be related to the}} detection limit of the farm-level prevalence by the BTM ELISA test, time span between slaughter data and BTM, and the relatively low sensitivity of liver inspection at slaughter. Conclusions Control of bovine fasciolosis in Denmark should target heifers and dry cows through grazing management and appropriate anthelmintic treatment, and BTM ELISA can be a useful diagnostic tool for fasciolosis in Danish dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which enteric methane (CH 4) emissions from growing lambs are explained by simple body weight and diet characteristics, a 2 ? 2 Latin square changeover design experiment was carried out using two sheep breeds and two fresh pasture types. Weaned lambs of two contrasting breed types were used: Welsh Mountain (a small, hardy hill breed; WM) and Welsh Mule ? Texel (prime lamb; TexX) (n = 8 per breed). The lambs were zero-grazed on material cut from recently reseeded perennial ryegrass and extensively managed permanent pasture. In each experimental period, individual ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI) was determined indoors following an adaptation period of two weeks, and CH 4 emissions were measured individually in open-circuit respiration chambers over a period of 3 d. Although total daily CH 4 emissions were lower for the WM lambs than for the TexX lambs (13. 3 vs 15. 7 g/d respectively; s. e. d. = 1. 01; P < 0. 05) when offered fresh forage, the yield of CH 4 per unit DMI was similar for the two breed types (16. 4 vs 17. 7 g CH 4 /kg DMI; s. e. d. = 0. 79; NS). Total output of CH 4 per day was higher when lambs were offered ryegrass compared to permanent pasture (16. 1 vs 12. 9 g/d respectively; s. e. d. = 0. 49; P < 0. 001) which was likely driven by differences in DMI (986 vs 732 g/d; s. e. d. = 22. 4; P < 0. 001). Methane emissions per unit DMI (16. 4 vs 17. 7 g CH 4 /kg DMI; s. e. d. = 0. 37; P < 0. 01) and percentage of gross energy (GE) intake excreted as CH 4 (5. 2 % vs 5. 6 %; s. e. d. = 0. 11; P = 0. 02) were both higher on the permanent <b>pasture.</b> No forage ? <b>breed</b> type interactions were identified. The results indicate that forage type had a greater impact than breed type on CH 4 emissions from growing weaned lambs. It can be concluded that when calculating CH 4 emissions for inventory purposes, {{it is more important to}} know what forages growing lambs are consuming than to know what breeds they are. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Growth data {{extracted}} from the calf (1832) and cow (1333) record files of the Data Processing Unit - Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives in Swaziland were analysed. The study considered records of calves born during the period 1975 to 1978 in three Government breeding stations: Mpisi (Station 1), Lowveld (Station 2) and Highveld (Station 3). Husbandry and management procedures employed on the stations have been standardised and cattle are raised on natural <b>pastures.</b> The <b>breeds</b> and crossbreds involved were Nguni (N), Brahman (B), Simmental (S), and B x N, S x N crosses and grades. The breed groups were not represented in all stations. The calf-breed groups were:- Station 1 (444) : N (108), B (121), 3 / 4 -B (114), and 7 / 8 -B (101). Station 2 (916) : N (138), 1 / 2 -B (423), 3 / 4 -B (308), and 7 / 8 -B (47). Station 3 (472) : N (155), S (182), 1 / 2 -B (46), 1 / 2 -S (45), 3 / 4 -S (17) and 7 / 8 -S (27). The birth weight (BWT), weaning weight adjusted to 210 -days (WWT), and 18 -month weight adjusted to 540 -days (18 -MTH WT) {{of a total of}} 1832 animals were analysed within stations by least squares to investigate the effects of breed/cross, sire (within breed), breed of dam, year, month of birth, age of dam, sex, and breed x year, breed of dam x year, and sire x breed of dam interactions. The results indicated that breed of calf had a highly significant effect on all the traits at each station, (P< 0. 01). In Station 1, the breeds ranked: 3 / 4 -B, 7 / 8 -B, B, and N for the three weights. The crossbreds were up to 3. 4, 29. 1 and 32. 5 kg heavier than the N, and 1. 9, 14. 0, and 11. 5 kg heavier than the B in BWT, WWT, and 18 -MTH WT, respectively. Straightbred B were 6 to 9 percent superior to the N in growth to 18 months. Breed x year interactions were non-significant. In stations 2 and 3, the interaction of breed with year was important for all traits. Some rank changes occurred between the crossbreds in each of these stations, but the crossbreds were generally heavier than the straightbreds. In Station 2, the 1 / 2 -B were, on average, 4. 3, 27. 3, and 46. 1 kg heavier than the N in BWT, WWT, and 18 -MTH WT, respectively. The 3 / 4 -B were heavier (P< 0. 01) than the 1 / 2 -B in WWT and there were no consistent differences among the crosses in 18 -MTH WT. In Station 3, 1 / 2 -S were, on average, 3. 6, 24. 3, and 33. 0 kg heavier than the N in BWT, WWT, and 18 -MTH WT, respectively. Straightbred S and 7 / 8 -S were up to 10. 6 kg (38 %) heavier (P< 0. 01) than the N at birth and 1 / 2 -S were up to 11 percent superior to 1 / 2 -B in growth to 18 months. Sire effects were non-significant for BWT and WWT, but highly significant for 18 -MTH WT in Station 1. In Station 2, sire effects were highly significant for all traits. Breed of dam effects were significant for BWT and WWT in Station 1, and for WWT only in Station 2. Progeny of crossbreds were heavier (P< 0. 01) than these of straightbreds. Breed of dam x year and sire x breed of dam interactions were not significant. Results on the effects of the environmental factors have indicated that year, month of birth, age of dam, and sex are important sources of variation in growth to 18 months of age. A compact calving season and regulation of the breeding season to prevent cows from calving down after November was recommended. Comparisons of the maternal performance of the cow-breeds indicated that crossbred cows were 7 to 25 percent superior to straightbreds in weight of calf weaned. Prahmans were 9 percent better than N cows. There {{were no significant differences between}} 1 / 2 -B and 3 / 4 -B cows. Heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated by the paternal half-sib method. Heritability estimates were in the range 0. 06 to 0. 29, 0. 09 to 0. 12, and 0. 18 to 0. 53 for BWT, WWT, and 18 -MTH WT, respectively. Genetic correlations were all positive, but most of the values were greater than 1. Pooled phenotypic correlations were 0. 27, 0. 21 and 0. 67 for BWT-WWT, BWT- 18 -MTH WT, and WWT- 18 -MTH WT, respectively. Repeatability of WWT was estimated within cow-breed by the intra-class correlation (Station 1) and the regression of later on earlier records (Station 2) methods. The estimates ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 39. Investigation of the feasibility of changing the performance testing age from 18 to 14 months in the breeding stations indicated that there was insufficient data on which reliable genetic parameter estimates could be based.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Over 20 years ago, {{research}} was underway to develop methods for {{in vitro fertilization}} utilizing bovine sperm and eggs. Freshly ejaculated sperm cannot fertilize an egg. Those sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract for 6 - 8 h and become diluted from seminal fluid. That process is called capacitation because it allows sperm to acquire the “capacity” to fertilize an egg. The final change sperm cells undergo after capacitation involves a morphological remodeling with release of enzymes packaged in {{the tip of the}} sperm head’s acrosome. This irreversible remodeling is known as the acrosome reaction. All of these events had to be controlled in the lab to successfully fertilize eggs from cows. Proteins produced in the seminal vesicles, prostate, and Cowper’s glands convey the capacitating effects of heparin, a carbohydrate, to bull sperm. Those proteins are collectively referred to a heparin-binding proteins because they function as “docking’ molecules to allow heparin to physically attach to the sperm, causing capacitation. Heparin per se is not found in the female reproductive tract. However, several other heparin-like carbohydrates do exist, and heparin mimics their normal biological action. One specific heparin binding protein has been named fertility-associated antigen (FAA). For the past 13 years, research has focused specifically on FAA, its identity, the ability to detect it in semen, and field trials comparing fertility of bulls classified as FAA-positive or FAA-negative. Trials included multiple-sire pastures with or without parentage of calves being confirmed by DNA testing. Herds have utilized A. I. in some instances, and serving capacity was also evaluated one year before bulls were allocated to pastures. Field Trials Comparing Bulls Categorized as FAA-Positive or FAA-Negative Since 1992, field trials have been conducted in Texas, Nebraska and California to compare prolificacy of bulls that produced semen classified as FAA-positive or FAA-negative. Multiple-sire pastures: Table 1 contains data from 7 consecutive years of field trials at King Ranch. When bulls were 14 - 19 mo. of age, FAA status was determined after they passed a breeding soundness exam. All pastures contained 8 - 16 bulls for 60 d at a constant ratio of 1 bull per 25 cows. Overall, FAA-positive bulls were 19 percentage points more fertile than their FAA-negative herdmates. FAA was quantified in the Ax lab at the University of Arizona. Serving capacity and FAA: The ability of a bull to breed cows can be estimated as “serving capacity. ” This is ordinarily evaluated by placing a group of virgin bulls with heifers that were synchronized to be in heat. Mounts with penetration are scored for each bull over a period of 20 min. Bulls are then ranked as “high” or “low” in that social setting. FAA-positive bulls with high serving capacity impregnated 87 % of cows exposed to them for a 60 d breeding season. FAA positive bulls with low serving capacity only impregnated 69 % of the exposed cows. Bulls with semen lacking FAA but with high serving capacity impregnated 78 % of the cows pastured with them. Therefore, their libido was able to compensate for the absence of FAA, but they were inferior to herdmates with high serving capacity possessing seminal FAA (Table 2). FAA was measured in the University of Arizona Lab. A. I. outcomes: With A. I., serving capacity is not an issue because cows are inseminated when they are in estrus. Holstein heifers and range beef cows were inseminated once with semen from mixed breeds of beef bulls designated as FAA-positive (n= 18) or FAA-negative (n= 7). Overall, there was a 16 % higher fertility in females inseminated with FAA-positive semen (66 % pregnancy rate) compared to FAA-negative semen (50 % pregnancy rate, Table 3). The University of Arizona Lab analyzed semen for FAA content. Efficiency of the cow herd: What does selection for FAA-positive bulls do for the cow herd? Research obtained from 1992 through 1998 at King Ranch indicated that the distribution of calves born during the calving season shifted to births occurring earlier (Table 4). In the nucleus herd, cows were initially bred only to FAA-positive bulls. Their replacement daughters were also only bred to FAA-positive bulls in subsequent generations. By 1998, 22 % more calves were born in the first 20 days of the calving season from this FAA selection management practice (Table 4). Clearly, efficiency in the cow herd had improved. DNA parentage of calves: In a collaboration with Drs. Dave and Cindy Daley and Harris Ranches, FAA status of bulls was determined using a newly developed chute-side cassette. Those bulls were in multiple-sire pastures with cows for a 60 -day breeding season in 3 consecutive breeding years (2000, 2001, 2002). The trial was conducted to relate parentage of calves by DNA fingerprinting to growth and carcass traits of individual sires. Analysis of FAA status became a retrospective comparison to evaluate utility of the cassettes to analyze semen for FAA within 20 minutes. Results from this study are being analyzed. Overall, 12 out of 62 total bulls were found to be FAA-negative. This was close to the incidence found in a population of 914 bulls screened in 6 states in April, 2003. In those bulls, 26 % were FAA-negative using the same test cassette to quantify FAA in semen. With the Harris Ranch bulls, complete DNA profiles were achieved with 47 of the 62 bulls. Overall, as bulls got older, they sired more calves per bull (1. 1 as yearlings to 22. 2 as 5 -year old breeding bulls). Irrespective of age, FAA-positive bulls produced 5. 9 more calves in the 3 years (1. 9 calves/year) compared to FAA-negative herdmates. That translated into a 19 % higher calf production for FAA-positive bulls for the 3 -year duration of the trial (Table 5). There was clearly an age influence in terms of calf production in relation to FAA status of bulls. As yearlings and 5 -year olds, FAA status did not factor into calf yield. However, between the ages of 2 and 4, each FAA-positive bull averaged 35. 4 total calves, whereas his FAA-negative herdmates produced 27. 3 total calves in that period of time. Therefore, the FAA-negative bulls were 77 % as prolific as their FAA-positive contemporaries based upon those numbers. From ages 1 through 3 years, a higher proportion of FAA-negative bulls were more likely to not sire any calves compared to FAA-positive bulls. In other words, sterility of a bull in a given year corresponded to FAA status of bulls 3 years old or younger. CONCLUSION FAA is a good thing! Fertility data support that regardless of years, <b>pasture,</b> or <b>breed,</b> the FAA positive bulls resulted in a higher percentage of cows pregnant compared to FAA negative herdmates. A conservative estimate places pregnancy rates 15 % higher in heifers or cows bred to FAA positive bulls. The calving season should also tighten up if daughters are retained from FAA positive bulls and are bred to known FAA positive bulls. In tern, daughters in subsequent generations need to be bred to FAA positive bulls, and that practice should continue. FAA testing only takes 20 minutes and is based upon visible detection of a reddish-purple line on a plastic cassette that contains all the necessary chemicals to detect FAA if it is in a semen sample. The projected payback per cow in a herd from testing for FAA in bulls will be 16 to - 25 fold if net profit per calf is $ 50. 00. Obviously, if profit per cow exceeds $ 50. 00, then the value of testing for FAA increases substantially. For more information, pricing, and to order testing kits, contact: ReproTec, Inc.
