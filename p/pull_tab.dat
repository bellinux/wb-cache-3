50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> {{is derived}} from paper pull tabs. The first electronic <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> patent {{appears to have been}} filed in November 1990, US5042809. The electronic game closely resembled pull tabs in that when new, there are a fixed and preset quantity of chances among which are a fixed quantity of winning chances of a predetermined prize value. Furthermore, it brings the unique features of allowing players to view the quantity of chances for each given prize value in each deal, as well as other <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> features common to <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> operations in Minnesota, Virginia, North Dakota and other jurisdictions.|$|E

The <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> is made in one progressive stamping process and the lid & assembly is made in another, the <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> simultaneously feeding at a right angle into the lid & assembly process. Also various car brake calipers have plates that are bent into shape, possibly cut too using these methods.|$|E

Some sliders come with a zip-lock feature in that, when the <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> is lowered, it locks the slider in place and when raised, it unlocks it.|$|E

50|$|Sardines are {{typically}} tightly packed {{in a small}} can which is scored for easy opening, either with a <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> (similar to how a beverage can is opened), or with a key attached {{to the side of}} the can. Thus, it has the benefit of being an easily portable, nonperishable, self-contained food.|$|E
5000|$|BoKu was {{marketed as}} [...] "adult" [...] juice, as juice boxes were {{commonly}} attributed to grade-school children {{because of their}} small size and easy ability to pack in a lunch.

5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{renditions}} of electronic pull tabs since 1990. The latest rendition was that authorized in Minnesota in the 2012 legislative session. These devices are available for use by state licensed charitable organizations. This version of an electronic <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> uses a hand-held device, similar to a tablet computer, with a touch screen interface. All such devices are subject to control and monitoring from a central computer. Each device must have access {{to one or more}} finite sets of chances not to exceed a maximum number per set or [...] "deal" [...] as they are called in <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> lingo. Sizes of the sets are under jurisdictional control and vary between maximums of 7,500 to 25,000. Among the chances are a predetermined quantity of winning and losing chances. Furthermore, the legislature stated that <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> devices have [...] "no spinning reels or other representations that mimic a video slot machine." [...] The Minnesota statute states an electronic pull-tab game means a pull-tab game containing [...] "(a) facsimiles of pull-tab tickets that are played on an electronic pull-tab device." [...] One value of such systems is that they not only are much more secure than paper based systems, but afford an opportunity to present games that fall within pull-tab definitions, yet have an enhanced presentation and are more suited to the desires of an electronically oriented public. Innovative manufacturers of such gaming systems expand the entertainment value of the gaming experience through the introduction of new game presentation styles.|$|E
50|$|To use, the <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> {{with the}} {{attached}} safety strip is withdrawn, {{just prior to}} throwing, unlocking the safety lever. When thrown the lever was to catch the air and be pulled from the grenade, removing the safety bar from between the firing pin and the primer.This was an open terrain grenade, as some {{amount of time and}} distance was required to allow the mechanism to function properly, which it had a tendency not to do.|$|E
5000|$|Oskar's mother tells Oskar {{she knew}} he was {{contacting}} the Blacks. She then informs him that she visited each Black in advance and informed them that Oskar was going to visit and why. Oskar makes an artbook-like scrapbook filled with pop-ups and pull tabs like a children's book, of his scavenger hunt and all the people he met and titles it [...] "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close". At {{the end of the book}} there is a <b>pull</b> <b>tab,</b> showing an animation in which Thomas's body is falling up instead of down.|$|E
50|$|The National Kidney Foundation does not, {{nor have}} they ever, had {{a program that}} {{provides}} access to dialysis machines in exchange for <b>pull</b> <b>tabs</b> on beverage cans. This rumor has existed {{since at least the}} 1970s, however, the Foundation themselves have denied this, noting that 80 {{percent of the cost of}} dialysis in the United States is usually covered by Medicare.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, {{approximately}} 20 states authorized and or licensed {{the use of}} <b>pull</b> <b>tabs.</b> The largest volume {{state in}} terms of dollar value sold is {{and has been for}} better than 15 years, Minnesota. In Minnesota as well as some other states, <b>pull</b> <b>tabs</b> are offered nightly from vending booths often called jar bars. All of the tickets in a game (called a [...] "deal") are poured into a transparent container that has attached to it a [...] "flare" [...] or poster that displays all of the winning symbol combinations, the quantity of winning tickets at each reward level, the name of the game, etc. Also attached to the container is a tally sheet that shows a potential player exactly how many of the [...] "major winners" [...] (major winner is one equal to or above 50x the value of the price paid for the chance) remain in that particular game at a given time.|$|R

50|$|Two to {{four players}} launch {{spinning}} tops into an arena. The {{object of the}} game is to have the last standing spinning top. The game takes place on a circular concave arena with four spinning top launch positions. Players wind a string (attached to a <b>pull</b> <b>tab)</b> around their tops, place them in the launch positions, then pull the tab vigorously to release the top. The concave surface forces the tops together to battle. The outcome is somewhat indeterminate, but there is a slight element of skill. Pegs in holes {{on the rim of the}} arena mark victories. The first to win ten battles wins the game.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1962, AMC took a {{leadership}} role with safer brake systems in all Ramblers featuring twin-circuit brakes, a design offered by only a few cars at that time. Classics with an automatic transmission continued to use push-buttons mounted {{on the left side}} of the dashboard with a separate sliding <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> for the [...] "park" [...] position. The cast-iron block six-cylinder engine was standard on Deluxe and Custom models with the aluminum version optional. The 400 received the aluminum block, but the cast-iron was a no cost option. Other improvements for 1962 included a price cut of $176 on the popular Custom Classic sedan.|$|E
50|$|The key {{attributes}} that make something a <b>pull</b> <b>tab,</b> electronic or paper, is the finite probability basis {{of having a}} predetermined quantity of chances among which there are a predetermined quantity of winners that pay a fixed and predetermined value of prize. Redemption of one losing chance actually does mean one chance closer to a winner. This {{is not so much}} the case with slots that operate on near-continuum probability premises. With a slot, each event is a separate activity without bearing on the next outcome and without having been influenced from past events, very different from pull tabs. Finite vs. continuum probability foundations make them different no matter which symbols are used or how those symbols are displayed: rotating, flash sequencing, revolving, etc.|$|E

25|$|While Alaska has {{no state}} sales tax, 89 {{municipalities}} collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (<b>pull</b> <b>tabs)</b> taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A {{part of the}} revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} <b>pull</b> <b>tabs</b> in {{beverage}} cans {{spread to the}} canning of various food products, such as pet food or nuts (and non-food products such as motor oil and tennis balls). The ends are known as easy open lids because they open without any tools or implements. An additional innovation developed for specifically for food cans uses a tab that is bent slightly upwards, creating a larger surface area for easier finger access.|$|R
