The M6 also was equipped with a winterization kit that included: an insulated battery box with a heating coil, a gasoline heater to heat the battery, and a <b>petcock</b> for the bottom of the fuel tank (for easy releasing of cold air and pressure from the gasoline tank).|$|E
50|$|Some {{historic}} {{examples of}} gravity feed systems include the Porsche 356 and early Volkswagens, {{which have a}} <b>petcock</b> with off, on, and reserve positions, much like a motorcycle <b>petcock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} of a <b>petcock</b> in an automobile is as a drain plug for a radiator.|$|E
50|$|<b>Petcocks</b> {{may be used}} in vehicle {{heating and}} cooling systems, such as limousines and tractor trailers.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{progressive}} {{control of a}} gate valve a ball valve style <b>petcock's</b> is coarse, confining their use principally to on-off applications.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>petcocks</b> {{were used}} on gravity feed fuel systems found on automobiles. With {{universal}} adoption of fuel pumps {{they have all}} but disappeared in that application.|$|R
5000|$|Silcock (and sillcock), same as [...] "spigot", {{referring}} to a [...] "cock" [...] (as in stopcock and <b>petcock)</b> that penetrates a foundation sill.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel gauges are {{becoming}} more common, but traditionally a reserve tank arrangement is used with a <b>petcock</b> (petrol tap) {{on the side of}} the motorcycle allowing the rider to switch to a reserve fuel supply when the main fuel supply is exhausted. There is not actually a separate reserve tank: The intake for the <b>petcock</b> has two pipes, one extending higher into the fuel tank than the other. When fuel no longer covers the longer pipe the engine will lose power/splutter and the rider switches the <b>petcock</b> to the [...] "reserve" [...] setting, which accesses the shorter pipe. Riders whose bikes lack a fuel gauge (most machines prior to the past few years) usually learn how far they can go with a full tank of fuel, and then use a trip meter if available to judge when they must refill the tank.|$|E
50|$|A <b>petcock</b> {{is a small}} {{shut-off}} valve used to control the flow of liquid or gas. Historically, petcocks were threaded valves controlled by a butterfly handle; modern petcocks are typically ball valves.|$|E
50|$|John Deere {{tractors}} and stationary power units produced {{from the late}} 1920s to the early 1940s had compression relief <b>petcocks</b> on the engine block, one per cylinder. These were opened during starting to de-pressurize the cylinders when spinning the flywheel by hand. Once the engine started they were closed and the engine would begin running smoothly.|$|R
50|$|The large MAN six-cylinder {{diesel engines}} used on German U-boats had <b>petcocks</b> that enabled the {{engineers}} to verify combustion in each cylinder. Opening {{one with the}} engine running {{would result in a}} long blue-white flame if the cylinder was firing correctly. The procedure is described in the novel Das Boot and shown in the film version.|$|R
50|$|HMS Petard, {{assisted}} by Wellesley aircraft of the No. 47 Squadron, located the u-boat and attacked the submarine with depth charges for nearly ten hours and finally forced the stricken boat {{to the surface}} at around 22:40. The U-boat was caught in Petards search-lights, and the German crew, with Kapitänleutnant (Captain) Hans Heidtmann, were taken on board under guard, but not before they had opened seavalves and <b>petcocks</b> in order to scuttle the submarine before abandoning it. HMS Petard now sought volunteers to swim over and search the damaged submarine. Lieutenant Francis Fasson RN {{said that he would}} go aboard.|$|R
5000|$|Most older {{motorcycles}} have a three-position fuel <b>petcock</b> valve (known as a [...] "petrol tap" [...] in the UK) {{mounted on}} or nearby {{the fuel tank}} to control the supply of gasoline: on, off, and reserve.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{position}} accesses the bottom {{portion of the}} fuel tank. Many older motorcycles lacked a fuel gauge, making reliance on a fuel reserve a relatively common experience. Most now have an automatic, vacuum operated <b>petcock</b> (that may include a prime position which bypasses vacuum operation and allows fuel to flow to the carburetor without the engine turning over).|$|E
50|$|The manual fuel {{shut-off}} <b>petcock</b> was removed, with the PGM-FI an automotive style fuel gauge was added. When {{the fuel level}} reaches the E symbol a low-fuel warning light begins to flash letting the rider {{know that they have}} about 1.1 gallons of fuel remaining, or enough for approximately 28 miles of reserve range. Battery capacity was increased from 14AH to 18AH.|$|E
50|$|The R80G/S was {{developed}} for BMW by engineer Rüdiger Gutsche, a successful competitor in the International Six Days Trial on his specially adapted R75/5.In 1981, Hubert Auriol, riding a R80G/S prepared by German company HPN Motorradtechnik, won the Paris-Dakar Rally. He repeated his success on an 870 cc version of the R80G/S in 1983.Gaston Rahier won the Dakar on a R80G/S in 1984, and then again on a larger 1,000 cc engined R80G/S in 1985.To commemorate their success, BMW launched the R80G/S Paris-Dakar special edition which featured a 7 imp gal fuel tank, fitted with dual <b>petcocks</b> and signed by Gaston Rahier.|$|R

[...] The site and employed 30 people in making ignition locks, door locks, keys, and brass <b>petcocks.</b> [...] The plant was unique {{in that part of}} its purpose was to provide work for World War II veterans who suffered physical or mental disabilities die to their wartime service. The plant closed in 1950. The plant was operated by several other companies after Ford stopped using it in 1945: Extruded Hinge from 1950-1960, Mather Plastics from 1960-1969, William E. Hennells Company from 1969-1976, Hennels Company from 1976-1983, Ranton, Inc. from 1985-1994 and De-Sta-Co (Detroit Stamping Company, a Dover Company) from 1994-2012.|$|R

50|$|The XS400 {{had with}} a 6-speed transmission, wet plate, 6 {{friction}} disk clutch, chain drive, tachometer, self-canceling turn signals, both electric and kick starters, adjustable rear shock absorbers, center stand, and an automatic fuel <b>petcock.</b> Early and economy models came with spoked wheels and drum brakes, while later and upgraded models received cast alloy wheels and hydraulic disc brakes. Later models also upgraded the early mechanical points ignition system to a modern solid state electronic system.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} craft {{was seven}} feet long, powered by automobile batteries {{connected to a}} small electric starter motor. It weighed about 400lbs. Moveable fins on the exterior hull enabled the sub to dive while two-gallon tin cans inside could be filled with lake water using a valve made from a kitchen sink faucet. The cans acted as ballast tanks and helped maintain neutral buoyancy once the vessel dipped below the waves. A small pressurized oxygen tank allowed the sub to stay submerged up to 48 hours. The sub's operator navigated via a conning tower featuring clear celluloid windows on three sides. Hand-operated levers were used to raise and lower the diving fins and steer the rudder while a radiator <b>petcock</b> could be opened to regulate interior air pressure when necessary. The sub's entry hatch could be bolted closed and opened from the inside.|$|E
5000|$|... "The first {{incandescent}} lamp by Woodward and Evans was constructed at Morrison's brass foundry in Toronto, {{and was a}} very crude affair. It consisted of a water gauge glass {{with a piece of}} carbon, filed by hand and drilled at each end, for the electrodes, and hermetically sealed at both ends, having a <b>petcock</b> at one end with a brass tube to exhaust the air. Woodward made the mistake of filling the tube or globe of this lamp with nitrogen after having exhausted the air. Prof. Elihu Thomson is quoted as having said that had he stopped when he had the tube exhausted he would have had the honor of being the inventor of the incandescent light as used for commercial purposes... the principle of the {{incandescent lamp}} dates several decades before the Woodward experiments, and that King, Chanzy, Farmer and others in the twenty years preceding 1860 made and used incandescent lamps much superior to the very imperfect one upon which Woodward's claims are based. Moreover, the Edison claims, as sustained in the courts, were not on the discovery of the principles of the incandescent lamp but on a definite combination of parts—all well known—which resulted in the production of a practical form of the incandescent lamp." ...|$|E
5000|$|The FZ {{came as a}} 4-stroke, four-cylinder, four-carburetor, {{naturally}} aspirated, {{air-cooled engine}} package mated with a six-gear constant mesh transmission, dropped into a rectangular tube frame that seemed pieced together from a modern standpoint, balanced upon a large rear mono shock hidden between the swingarm and subframe under the battery complementary to two smooth front forks. It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel <b>petcock</b> at the bottom left with an overflow hose fitting {{at the bottom of}} the front. The four Mikuni BS-30 carburetors utilize the [...] "Round-Slide" [...] design with the diaphragm assembly actuating the main needle jets, with plastic floats and brass slides. It uses two ignition coils (two cylinders each) controlled by a CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) printed circuit board unit, and timed by a two brush [...] "Pick-Up Coil" [...] mounted to the crank. The engine oil doubles as the transmission's lubricant, wetting the manual clutch. The FZ-600 was air-cooled however, with a radiator-looking oil cooler mounted on the front of the frame between the engine and front wheel. It also had a thundering four-into-one exhaust. It has a 4-fuse, fuse block providing for the headlights, turn signals, rectifier/regulator, etc.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{costs and}} {{environmental}} standards encouraged cement manufacturers worldwide to evaluate {{to what extent}} conventional fuels (Furnace oil, Coal and <b>Petcock)</b> can be replaced by alternative fuels in cement production, i. e. biomass or processed waste materials like sewage sludge, MSW (municipal solid waste), Refuse Derived Fuels (RDF), Tire Derived Fuel (TDF), Plastic Derived Fuel (PDF), Biomass Derived Fuels (BDF), meat and bone meal (MBM), etc.   High temperature of > 1500 C, long residence times of up to 10 seconds and high turbulence in the cement kiln ensure complete destruction of organic constituents in the waste materials. The main benefits of using solid alternative fuels in cement kilns include enhanced energy recovery and conservation of non-renewable fossil fuels which in other words translates into an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related not only to conventional fuel mining and utilization but also helping the cement industry to clear its image of being among the most polluting and CO 2 emitting industries. Most notably, a reduction in cement production costs is also expected.   Varying amounts of different alternative fuels have been studied in this thesis and referred to an actual cement plant in Ethiopia, located in the northern province of Mekelle. The availability of alternative fuels in the region has been estimated. Calculations have been performed for the comparison with the reference case for each alternative fuel option. Possible technical challenges in the combustion process and the supply feed chain {{as well as in}} the resource base have been identified. The environmental benefits for the reference plant and the impact on cement costs have been evaluated and discussed. The results show a clear advantage for alternative fuel utilization, both in terms of environmental parameters and also in production costs for the cement plant. ...|$|E
40|$|Fruits may be canned {{with the}} boiling water bath method because they contain high enough acid levels to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum spores and the {{production}} of botulism toxin. Additionally, when fruits are properly canned, they are heated long enough at high enough temperatures to destroy spoilage causing microorganisms. Equipment A water bath canner can be any large metal container with a fitted lid deep enough to fit a rack on the bottom, the jars, 1 to 2 inches of water above jars, and 2 to 4 inches of space to allow for boiling. A pressure canner also may be used in place of a water bath canner if it is deep enough. Place the lid, but do not fasten it. Leave the <b>petcock</b> and/or vent open so steam can escape and pressure does not build up during heating. As with a water bath canner, the jars need to be covered with 1 to 2 inches of water during processing, and space for boiling should be considered. Use standard canning jars and lids. Commercial food jars, such as mayonnaise and coffee jars, are not recommended because these jars may not properly seal {{and are more likely to}} break than standard canning jars. Check jars, ringbands, and lids for defects. Look for chips, cracks, dents, rust, and anything else that will prevent airtight seals. Wash jars in hot soapy water and rinse well. Prepare two-piece metal lids according to manufacturer’s directions. Ringbands may be reused if they are not rusted, dented, or damaged; however, lids may only be used once. Preparing the Produce Choose fresh, firm fruits for canning. Wash all fruit thoroughly regardless of whether or not it will be pared. Do not soak; soaking may cause the fruit to lose flavor and nutrients. Handle gently to avoid bruising. Preventing Darkening Some fruits darken when they are peeled or cut and then exposed to air. Choose one of the following treatments to retard this natural occurrence while preparing fruit for canning...|$|E
