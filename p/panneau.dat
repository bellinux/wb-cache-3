In this Note géostatistique No 28, Matheron derived k*, his estimateur and a {{precursor}} to the kriged estimate or kriged estimator. In mathematical statistics, Matheron’s k* is the length-weighted average grade of a single <b>panneau</b> in his set. What Matheron failed to derive in this paper was var(k*), the variance of his estimateur. Matheron presented his Stationary Random Function at the first colloquium on geostatistics in the USA. He called on Brownian motion to conjecture the continuity of his Riemann integral but did not explain what Brownian motion and ore deposits have in common. Matheron, unlike John von Neumann in 1941 and Anders Hald in 1952, never worked with Riemann sums. It was not Professor Dr Georges Matheron but Dr Frederik P Agterberg who derived the distance-weighted average of a set of measured values determined in samples selected at positions with different coordinates in a sample space. What Agterberg did not do was derive the variance of this function.|$|E

ABSTRACT : The proven {{toxicity of}} lignocellulosic composites based on urea-formaldehyde, phenol-formaldehyde type resins by their formaldehyde emissions cause environmental health problems. A {{study has been}} carried out to enhance the development of particleboards of low density with few formaldehyde emissions manufactured with Hibiscus cannabinus core reinforcements and matrix of bone adhesive or tannin material from pod of Parkia biglobosa, stem barks of Pithecellobium dulce and foliar sheath of Sorghum caudatum or mucilaginous material from calyx of Bombax costatum and stem barks of Grewia venusta. Vegetable materials were employed in rough powders or extracts forms, or in mixture with the bone adhesive. The results obtained reveal that bone adhesive was as valuable as the urea formaldehyde resin for manufacturing particleboard with good mechanical properties (MOE: 541 MPa, MOR: 5. 23, IB: 0. 58 MPa). Tannin and mucilaginous rough materials gave particleboards with bending modulus of elasticity (MOE) ranging from 370 to 400 MPa, bending modulus of rupture (MOR) varying from 2. 01 to 3. 17 MPa and internal bond (IB) going from 0. 06 to 0. 28 MPa. Those plant extracts leaded to particleboards with variable mechanical properties (MOE: 484 – 1100 MPa, MOR: 2. 36 – 5. 66 MPa and IB: 0. 11 – 0. 46 MPa) depending {{of the nature of the}} adhesive. Tannin based adhesive gave particleboards more valuable than mucilaginous ones. The association of the bone adhesive with the rough or the extracts of the plants material improved the mechanical characteristics of the panels...|$|R

50|$|On February 19, 1981 the {{implantation}} of the panels-furniture {{plant was}} officially announced. On August, 20 {{of the same}} year the Quebec Premier René Lévesque came to Sayabec. The Crown corporation Rexfor and the German firm Kunz were the two main shareholders of this plant named <b>Panneaux</b> de la Vallée shortened into Panval. On December 5, 1982 a thanksgiving mass had been celebrated at the occasion of the start of operations of Panval. Doctor Kunz himself attended this mass, and stated that this religious celebration was a first between all his plants around the world. In 1987 Panval was enlarged by the addition of a third laminating press, and then became the largest producer of laminated panels in North America. In 1989 Panval employed 425 full-time employees, and occupied 62,700 sq m. More than 1,000 trucks by month served the plant. However, the NAFTA had a bad impact on the production of Panval, and its personnel had been reduced to 225 employees. As of 2012, the plant belongs to Uniboard Canada and is the largest industry in the region.|$|R

In 1937, the city of Paris bought her plaquette called The Hunting (La Chasse) and an engraved vase. These two pieces of art were later placed {{in the collection of}} modern art of the Louvre. She achieved her greatest success by working with cold glass, by monumental, sculptural drawing-derived forms, while her contemporaries, Lalique, Marinot and his circle made their art in glass-works and treated glass as one block.|$|E

During this time she visited excavations from the Roman period {{in the south of}} France, she travelled to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. She lived {{as a member of the}} Hungarian colony, formed by Endre Rozsda, Brassaï, and André Kertész. During her first years in Paris, she shared an apartment together with Andre Kertész and Margit Kovács. After her exhibition in 1930, she presented her first independent show in 1933. She received a diplome d'honeur at the 1937 Paris World's Fair. That same year, she made an interior column-panneau for Le Printemps. Báthory was a member of the Salon d'Automne, formed by Matisse and the fauvists, where famous French glass designers Maurice Marinot and René Lalique also exhibited. She produced revolutionary flat glass design artifacts for [...] "La Crémmaiere", and made <b>panneaux</b> for the interior decoration department of Louis Cartier's store at Rue de la Paix. Her works were sold by Christofle in Paris. In 1934, she converted an old dairy hall near Sorbonne (7bis Rue Laromiguiere, Paris Ve) into her own atelier (or workshop), Studio La Girouette.|$|R
40|$|About {{the stone}} {{marks in the}} medieval fortifications of Qalaat al-Mudiq, citadel of Apamea on the Orontes (Syria) This paper shows that the medieval fortifications of Qalaat al-Mudiq, and {{especially}} its fifth tower, was built with ancient stones taken from the nearby theatre of Apamaea. The blocks were reused with their original marks. The great variety and the situation of these marks reveals their function: {{they were used to}} identify the quarrymen and the stone-masons who built the theatre. The medieval recutting of the stones are limited to the loopholes and the inside facings of the blocks. The stones reused in the fortification or left in the theatre were charaterized, moreover, by the division of their inside facings in several panels. La présente contribution démontre que la fortification médiévale de Qalaat al-Moudiq, et plus particulièrement la tour 5, a été construite avec des blocs antiques provenant du théâtre d'Apamée tout proche. Elle précise les modalités du démontage du monument ancien. Les blocs sont remployés avec leurs marques lapidaires d'origine. La grande diversité et la position de ces marques révèlent leur fonction : l'identification des producteurs antiques de ces blocs. Les retailles médiévales sont limitées aux meurtrières et aux parements intérieurs.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{purposes}} {{of this paper is to}} determine G(b) (hom), the overall homogenized Euler-Bernoulli strength domain of a periodic rigid-perfectly plastic beam. It also aims at studying the relationship between the 3 D and the homogenized Euler-Bernoulli beam limit analysis problems. In the homogenized beam model, the generalized 1 D stresses are the axial and the flexural stress field resultants. The homogenization method suggested by [Bourgeois, S., 1997.

The homogenization procedure is justified using the asymptotic expansion method. Lower and upper bounds for G(b) (hom) are provided. These bounds are analytically obtained in terms of local b axial ultimate strengths. Special cases of axially-invariant beams and laminated beams are studied and an improved upper bound is derived. Considering several sandwich beams, it is found that the discrepancy between the lower bound and the improved upper bound is small...|$|R
