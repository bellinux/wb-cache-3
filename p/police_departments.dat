Periyar also spoke out against child marriage.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{with colleagues}} Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Roy, Schiff {{developed}} a last-minute plan to restore $2 million in proposed {{cuts to the}} Minneapolis Fire and <b>Police</b> <b>Departments,</b> following a $26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor Tim Pawlenty. That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely {{on the grounds of}} a suspected immigration status violation.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> instead.|$|E

5|$|<b>Police</b> <b>departments</b> {{throughout}} Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department.

5|$|The ACLU {{played a}} major role in passing the 1932 Norris–La Guardia Act, a federal law which {{prohibited}} employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within <b>police</b> <b>departments,</b> by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee.

While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

5|$|In {{the five}} {{months prior to}} the riots, nativist groups had been {{spreading}} a rumor that Catholics were trying to remove the Bible from public schools. A nativist rally in Kensington erupted in violence on May 6 and started a deadly riot that would result in the destruction of two Catholic churches and numerous other buildings. Riots erupted again in July, after it was discovered that St. Philip Neri's Catholic Church in Southwark had armed itself for protection. Fierce fighting broke out between the nativists and the soldiers sent to protect the church, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Several Catholic churches were burned. Nationally, the riots helped fuel criticism of the nativist movement, despite denials from nativist groups of responsibility. The riots made deficiencies in law enforcement in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts readily apparent, influencing various reforms in local <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> and the eventual consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
