50|$|GBCE {{has built}} {{and is now}} {{operating}} the world’s first industrial scale coal upgrading facility. It has capacity to process 1 MTPA of coal feedstock and is located in Holingol, Inner Mongolia, the largest lignite producing region in China. The coal is typically high moisture (35 - 40% TM) and 3200 - 3400 kcal gar. Depending on market requirements, it produces 5000 - 5500 kcal coal (gar) with greatly reduced moisture content (< 10% gar). The plant uses LCP coal upgrading technology which is a pyrolytic process that employs heat and pressure in an oxygen free environment to continue the coalification process that occurs naturally in the earth. The <b>processed</b> <b>coal</b> by this technology is hydrophobic and transportable which means it will not reabsorb moisture or break up into powder during transportation.|$|E

30|$|A typical {{coal mine}} complex (underground mine shafts, drift portals and slopes and their {{associated}} coal preparation facilities) operates a closed loop water system. Although rainfall in Illinois greatly exceeds evaporation, a typical underground coal mine and associated preparation plan complex will often operate on net {{deficit of water}} {{during the course of}} a typical year. This is largely due to water lost during the mining process (dust suppression) and coal washing. Most water exits the facility either as evaporation water or surface moisture on the <b>processed</b> <b>coal.</b> To supplement their needs these operations add water from a fresh water impoundment or groundwater source. Periodic discharges (blow down) will occur typically from a single sedimentation control basin with an NPDES discharge. Often this blow down occurs during a period of high precipitation when waters with high TDS are acceptable. However, the primary need for blow down is to drain water that is detrimental to equipment operation.|$|E

The <b>processed</b> <b>coal</b> is used by the different steel plants to serve their purpose during the manufacturing process of steel. The present paper deals with the optimal planning for blending raw coal of different grades used for beneficiation with a view to satisfy the requirements of the end users with desired specifications. The input specifications of coal samples are known whereas the output specifications are imprecise in nature. The aim of the work is to fix the level of the raw coal from different coal seams to be fed for beneficiation to meet the desired target of yield and ash percentage to maximum extent. Further, it is also desired by the decision-maker (DM) to restrict the input cost of raw coal to be fed for beneficiation. The problem is modeled as multicriteria decision-making problem with imprecise specifications. Fuzzy set theoretic approach has been used and a corresponding model has been developed. The solution of the problem would enable the DM to optimize the raw coal feed with existing available specifications from different collieries along with the overall degree of satisfaction.

40|$|Direct {{observation}} of transient swelling and shrinkage behavior of raw coals and processed coals {{was conducted by}} using a digital camera with a long focus lens, and quantitative description of swelling and shrinkage was resulted from subsequent image processing. The {{results showed that the}} raw and processed coals in pyrolysis behaved differently. The shrinkage of the processed coals was quite different, the maximum volumetric shrinkage ratio at 1000 degrees C as in the range of 32 - 38 % with swelling ratios less than 5 %, and the volumetric swelling ratio increased and the shrinkage ratio decreased with the increase of coal sample density. The maximum volumetric swelling ratio of the raw coals was more prominent than those of the processed coals. The raw coal A(2) showed a maximum swelling ratio of 20 - 85 % and the raw coal B- 2 showed a maximum swelling ratio of 25 - 45 %. The volumetric swelling ratios decreased and the shrinkage increased with the decrease of the sample size. It is considered that the different pyrolysis behaviors were mainly due to the variation in their macroscopic structures. However, the similar swelling and shrinkage curves of coal samples were observed for the same raw or processed coals. In addition, the effect of volatile matter on the volumetric shrinkage ratios would be weakened if the raw coal was crushed into powder and then pressed into <b>processed</b> <b>coal</b> samples.

Throughout this study, surface properties of coal changed significantly after high temperature heating <b>process.</b> Meanwhile, <b>coal</b> hydrophobicity can be also reduced after high temperature heating...|$|R
