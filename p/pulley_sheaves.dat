50|$|Engineers {{can use the}} Brinell {{hardness}} {{of materials}} in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and thrust loading, they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive crankshafts or <b>pulley</b> <b>sheaves,</b> to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} Single Acting Pulley Actuator (SAPA) Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{utilizes}} combinations of DC motor system, gear reducers and power cam mechanisms to actuate primary movable <b>pulley</b> <b>sheaves</b> on the transmission shaft.

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{electric}} motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives. 1 Belt drives provide flexibility in the positioning of the motor relative to the load. <b>Pulleys</b> (<b>sheaves)</b> of varying diameters allow {{the speed of the}} driven equipment to be increased or decreased relative to the motor speed. A properly designed belt power-transmission system offers high efficiency and low noise, requires no lubrication, and presents low maintenance requirements. However, certain types of belts are more efficient than others, offering potential energy cost savings. The majority of belt drives use V-belts, which use a trapezoidal cross section to create a wedging action on the pulleys to increase friction and improve the belt’s power transfer capability. Joined or multiple belts are specified for heavy loads. V-belt drives can have a peak efficiency of 95 % or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5 % over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned. The most important operational and maintenance issue in a V-belt drive is its tension. I...|$|R

40|$|Today's vehicle must be {{efficient}} {{in terms of}} gas (CO 2, NOx) emissions and fuel consumption. Due to improvements in material and oil, the continuous variable transmission (CVT) is now making a breakthrough in the automotive market. The CVT decouples the engine from the wheel speed. CVT enables significant fuel gains by shifting the engine operating point for specific power demands. This optimization of the operating point enables a reduction of this fuel consumption. A CVT is constituted of two <b>pulley</b> <b>sheaves,</b> one fixed {{and the other one}} movable in its axial direction when subjected to an external axial force, in general hydraulic. The transition from the minimum to the maximum speed ratio is continuous and an infinite numbers of ratio is available between these two limits. An intermediate element (a metallic belt or chain) transmits the power from the input (the primary) to the exit (the secondary) of the CVT or variator. Further improvements of the fuel consumption and gas emission are still required for example by improving the variator efficiency. Increasing hydraulic performance or decreasing mechanical losses by reducing the axial forces are some solutions. The latter method is not without risks. The diminution of the clamping forces increases the slip between <b>pulley</b> <b>sheaves</b> and the intermediate element. If the axial forces decrease too much, high slip values can be reached and cause damage to the pulleys and the intermediate element. Control of the slip is an attractive solution to decrease the clamping forces in order to safely improve the variator efficiency. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the slip of each pulley and establish analytic tools dedicate to the variator control. The slip study and the theoretical approach of the CVT variator is applied to the slip control of the variator with a chain. The contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, the slip and the traction coefficient are analyzed for each pulley. The slip analysis of each pulley is then used to define a new slip synthesis as the summation of the slip of each pulley. It is demonstrated that the slip and the traction coefficient are different for each pulley and depend on the speed ratio of the variator. In low ratios, both the secondary pulley and the primary pulley slip, but only the primary reaches macro slip. For middle or higher ratios, only the secondary pulley slips and reaches high values of slip. Experiments show that the pulley with the smallest clamping force limits the system. Secondly, based on kinematics, force equilibrium, elastic deformations of the pulleys and the intermediate element, a detail model of the variator is proposed. The principal results are the estimation of the clamping forces, of the traction curve for each pulley and of the chain efficiency. These results are implemented in a simpler model that describes the variator dynamics. This last model considers the two pulleys and the intermediate element as free bodies. The hydraulic circuit and the actuators, which are important to take into account for control, are also modeled. Thirdly, the new slip synthesis and the results of the dynamic models are applied to the slip control of the variator in order to improve the efficiency. A pole placement law is applied to the actuators to control the flow that enters or exits the pulleys. With this law, the actuators are decoupled and the bandwidth is increased sufficiently for actuators dynamics to be neglected. The primary and the secondary pressures are decoupled and linearized by an input-output feedback linearization. The resulting system is linear and linear control theory can be applied to control the two pressures. The speed ratio is controlled by the primary clamping force. The secondary pressure is chosen {{as a function of the}} control mode of the variator: standard mode or slip mode. In standard mode, the intermediate element is overclamped by 30 %, whereas in slip mode, the secondary clamping force is set as a function of the desired slip. By controlling the slip at 2 %, the mechanical efficiency was increased by more than 2 % and the clamping forces reduced by more than 30 %. For the slip control, a proportional-integrator law and a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) are presented and the performances compared. The MRAC gives slightly better results...|$|E
40|$|In many {{engineering}} applications elastic continua such as {{ropes and}} belts often {{are subject to}} bending when they pass over <b>pulleys</b> / <b>sheaves.</b> In this paper the quasi-stationary mechanics of a cable-pulley system is studied. The cable is modelled as a moving Euler-Bernoulli beam. The distribution of tension is non-uniform along its span and due to the bending stiffness the contact points at the pulley-beam boundaries are not unknown. The system is described {{by a set of}} nonlinear ordinary differential equations with undetermined boundary conditions. The resulting nonlinear Boundary Value Problem (BVP) with unknown boundaries is solved by converting the problem into the ‘standard’ form defined over a fixed interval. Numerical results obtained for a range of typical configurations with relevant boundary conditions applied demonstrate that due to the effects of bending stiffness the angels of wrap are reduced and the span tensions are increased...|$|R
50|$|Every lift {{involves}} {{at least}} two terminals and may also have intermediate supporting towers. A bullwheel in each terminal redirects the rope, while <b>sheaves</b> (<b>pulley</b> assemblies) on the towers support the rope well above the ground. The number of towers is engineered based on the length and strength of the rope, worst case environmental conditions, {{and the type of}} terrain traversed. The bullwheel with the prime mover is called the drive bullwheel; the other is the return bullwheel. Chairlifts are usually electrically powered, often with Diesel or gasoline engine backup, and sometimes a hand crank tertiary backup. Drive terminals can be located either at the top or the bottom of an installation; though the top-drive configuration is more efficient, practicalities of electric service might dictate bottom-drive.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{phenomena}} such as transient and steady-state resonant vibrations in vertical {{transportation systems}} {{deployed in the}} modern built environment and underground mining applications affect {{the performance of the}} entire installation. In extreme high rise structures and deep underground mines traction drive elevator systems and drum-driven lifting installations employ long ropes and cables that exhibit low-frequency modes and nonlinear modal interactions. This results in the need to develop mathematical models in order to simulate their dynamic behaviour to predict and control their non-linear stationary and non-stationary dynamic responses; the coupled vibrations of a car/ conveyance and counterweight; as well as motions of other components present in the system, such as compensating sheave assemblies and diverter pulleys. The underlying causes of these dynamic responses / vibrations are varied. They include low frequency sway motions of the host structure induced by high winds and seismic activities, poorly aligned guide rail joints and guide rail imperfections, eccentric / out-of-balance <b>pulleys</b> and <b>sheaves,</b> systematic resonance in the electronic drive control system, motor torque ripple and aerodynamic effects that occur in the hoistway. Consequently, conditions for external, parametric and autoparametric resonances can readily arise during the operation of such installations. In this context, this paper will demonstrate a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical vertical transportation and lifting installations. Subsequently, dynamic models and simulation techniques for the prediction of their non-stationary / nonlinear dynamic responses are discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. Then, suitable strategies can be proposed to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a long {{wheelbase}} recumbent bicycle was carried out according to the wish to maximize the speed and comfort of the finished product. Various original design ideas were examined. Some were retained, and many were abandoned. A standard tubular truss frame design was settled on. Geometrical requirements regarding the riding position were tested using a full size wooden frame mock-up. As {{a result of that}} testing, flaws in the ergonomic assumptions were discovered and corrected for a second generation mock-up. Variations in truss configuration were examined using TRUSS (MATLAB) software to determine ways to minimize frame stresses and further lighten frame. Initial work with fiberglass in epoxy led to the conclusion that using fiber re-enforced matrix construction would be more effective with a unibody frame design than a truss. A rough copy recumbent frame was made using fiberglass and epoxy over a light foam male mold. Difficulties with that construction technique were discovered and corrected for in the final model. Before completion of the rough copy, AutoCAD modeling of the frame reveled how the frame design could be radically improved. The rough copy was finished in a sloppy manner and test rides reveled how important steering system considerations had been overlooked. ANSYS modeling of the new proposed frame geometry indicated that it would be structurally sound, and indicated improvements. These improvements were carried out. The geometry was set up to mimic the stability at speed of a mountain bike. The final copy of the bicycle was built using a unibody box section frame. All moving parts other than the fork, wheels and pedals were enclosed within the frame box to keep them clean and visually out of the way. The drive mechanism consisted of two parts: The first used a timing belt to transfer power from the primary bottom bracket to the secondary, and to gear the pedal velocity up by a factor of 2. The second used standard bicycle chain over a short length to shift gears over an unusually broad range, intended for high speed cruising. Steering control was maintained by means of twinned control wires in tension, wrapped around demi- <b>pulley</b> <b>sheaves</b> to eliminate wire path length variation. Construction on the final bicycle is still in progress as of this writing...|$|E
