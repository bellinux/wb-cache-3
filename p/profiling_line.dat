Secondly, we show that SIMS is a powerful technique to analyze elemental distributions and mass transport processes over various length scales ranging from some nanometres to several hundred micrometers. For this purpose, we have used stable, enriched isotopes to investigate oxygen diffusion and cation diffusion in oxides. By combining different modes of SIMS analysis – depth <b>profiling,</b> <b>line</b> scanning and imaging – it was possible to measure diffusion coefficients from about 10 − 22 cm 2 s − 1 to 10 − 6 cm 2 s − 1 and to determine surface exchange coefficients as well. In addition, high resolution SIMS makes it possible to investigate diffusion through space charge layers at surfaces and to distinguish between bulk and grain boundary diffusion in polycrystalline materials...|$|E

40|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{can support}} bacterial proliferation, induce {{the formation of}} clay-bacterial aggregates, and finally a clay-based biofilm. However, how these abiotic and biotic entities interact in a microhabitat is not fully understood. Visualization of the clay-bacterial micro-aggregate under scanning electron microscope (SEM) and profiling the associated elemental signature through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) can potentially unravel the mechanisms of a complex clay-bacterial interaction. Osmium (Os) was used previously to enhance the visualization of microbial substances, but the delineation of bacterial cells from clay particles in a micro-aggregate was not tried before. In this study, bacterial cells in a clay-bacterial aggregate (Burkholderia sartisoli with montmorillonite and kaolinite) were specifically stained with osmium (Os) which served as the EDS tracer of the biotic component of the interaction. Simultaneously silicon (Si) provided the signature of the clay minerals. X-ray elemental <b>profiling</b> (<b>line</b> and field mapping) successfully delineated the individual components of the clay-bacterial aggregate.

They are significant because bright spots often mark great contrasts in subsurface physical properties. The first is the ‘Surrency Bright Spot ’ (SBS), an exceptionally bright antiformal reflection, {{and the second is}} the ‘Reedy Creek Reflection ’ (RCR), which lies 5 km to the south and resembles the south half of a diffraction. The RCR is also imaged on a crossline, Georgia 18, as a relatively symmetric antiformal reflection. These reflections coincide with the Brunswick magnetic anomaly, thought to mark the late Palaeozoic Alleghanian suture. The SBS and the R C R are reflections from bodies that lie within the plane of Georgia 16. Migration and 2 -D seismic modelling show the aniformal SBS is from a synformal reflector with a buried focus while the RCR is from a relatively small body. The inferred geometry of the SBS reflector, with its flat portion corresponding to the deepest part of the reflector, argues that it does not represent fluids. These results, combined with recent evidence that the SBS is a reflection from a high-velocity thin layer, suggest that the SBS and the RCR might be reflections from ultramafic slices emplaced within the Alleghanian suture zone during collision or from mafic sheets intruded into the suture zone during subsequent rifting. The brightness of the SBS is attributed to a large impedance contrast, constructive interference, good data quality, and a relatively large reflector size with respect to the Fresnel zone and neighbouring reflectors...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the braneworld models, rotating black holes can be described by the Kerr metric with a tidal charge representing the influence of the non-local gravitational (tidal) effects of the bulk space Weyl tensor onto the black hole spacetime. We study the influence of the tidal charge onto <b>profiled</b> spectral <b>lines</b> generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of the black hole, the <b>profiled</b> <b>line</b> becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the <b>profiled</b> <b>line.</b> The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind the black hole. For positive tidal charge ($b> 0 $) and high inclination angles two small humps appear in the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> close to the red and blue edge of the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values of $b$, the strongest effect on the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> shape (extension) is caused by the changes of the inclination angle.
