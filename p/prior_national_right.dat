50|$|A {{requester}} may {{request to}} restrict the claims with respect to one or more, but not all, Contracting States. The limitation would then result in claims being different in different Contracting States. This may however only be done in some special cases, one of them being {{in order to avoid}} conflict with <b>national</b> <b>prior</b> <b>rights</b> (a <b>national</b> <b>prior</b> <b>right</b> is a <b>national</b> patent filed before the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent subject to the limitation procedure but published after the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent).|$|R
5000|$|... "Limitation {{proceedings}} {{would enable}} patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant {{by means of}} a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} limit a granted patent if, because of prior art which was not known during the examination proceedings or <b>prior</b> <b>national</b> <b>rights</b> not taken into account in these proceedings, the extent of the protection conferred is too great. Using the limitation procedure, patent proprietors may themselves reduce the extent of the protection claimed in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent. Postgrant limitation is also in the public interest, because it limits the protection claimed by the patentee with effect for the general public. This creates legal certainty and facilitates access by competitors to the freely available prior art." ...|$|R
