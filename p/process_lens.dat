Experiments were performed on one eye each of three rhesus monkeys with permanent indwelling electrodes in the EW nucleus of the midbrain. EW stimulated accommodative refractive changes were measured with infrared photorefraction, and ciliary <b>process</b> and <b>lens</b> edge movements were measured with slit-lamp goniovideography on the temporal aspect of the eye. Images were recorded on the nasal aspect for one eye during EW stimulation. Image anal-ysis was performed off-line at 30 Hz to determine refractive changes and ciliary body and lens edge movements during EW stimulated accom-modation and after carbachol iontophoresis to determine drug induced accommodative movements. Maximum EW stimulated accommodation was 7. 36 0. 49 D and pharmacologically stimulated accommodation was 14. 44 1. 21 D.

This study focused {{on the effects of}} laser deposition pro-cessing parameters (laser power, travel speed, and powder mass flow rate) on laser beam absorption by the substrate material. Measurements revealed that laser energy transfer efficiency ranged from 30 to 50 pct. Laser beam coupling was found to be relatively insensitive to the range of processing parameters tested. Melting efficiency was found to increase with increasing laser input power, travel speed, and powder mass flow rate. A dimensionless parameter model that has been used to predict melting efficiency for laser beam welding processing was investigated for the LENS process. From these results, a semiempirical model was developed specifically for the LENS processing window. Deposition efficiency was also investigated and results show that under optimum processing condi-tions, the maximum deposition efficiency was approximately 14 pct. A semiempirical relation was developed to estimate deposition efficiency as a function of process efficiencies and LENS process-ing parameters. Knowledge of LENS process efficiencies measured in this study is useful to develop accurate heat flow and solidification models for the LENS process. I...|$|E

To this day, digital inequality remains an important and relevant societal issue. With the rapid proliferation of digital ICT over the last 20 years the nature of the phenomenon may have evolved from an access-based to an appropriation-based issue, yet its significance has not diminished. Again this backdrop, this dissertation aims to explore which mechanisms and factors influence why and how individuals use ICT in the context of digital inequality, and, in particular, what role social influence, socio-cognitive processes, and socio-economic determinants play. In a series of essays, this dissertation first develops a theoretical understanding of the concept of social influence, which {{plays an important role in}} determining whether and how individuals use a technology. Next, a <b>process</b> <b>lens</b> is adopted to explore the underlying mechanisms that drive individuals to disengage from a new technology and may lead to digital exclusion. Building on that, this dissertation examines how digital inequality manifests itself in the specific realm of e-commerce. This dissertation concludes with a practical perspective on the issue of digital inequality aimed at policy makers seeking to bridge the gap between digitally advantaged and disadvantaged users...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{numerous}} epidemiological {{and animal}} models, {{it can be}} inferred that oxidative stress is {{a key factor in}} cataract formation. Production of reactive oxygen species and reduction of endogenous antioxidants both contribute to cataract formation. In the cataractogenous <b>process,</b> <b>lens</b> proteins lose sulfhydryl groups and become thiolated or cross-linked by disulfide bonds. The resultant high molecular weight aggregates become insoluble and affect lens transparency. All these are consequences of changes in the redox state. A mixed protein-thiol and protein-protein disulfide bond precedes the morphological changes of cataract. Normally, sustained high levels of reduced glutathione provide a protective effect, while depletion of glutathione causes damage to epithelial cells and fiber cells. UV rays in the ambient environment evoke reactive oxygen species formation and also contribute to cataracts. The reduction in free UV filters and increase in their binding to lens proteins make the lens more predisposed to UV damage and oxidation. In the aqueous humor of cataract lenses, there is a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and increase in nitric oxide, which demonstrates the relationship between oxidative stress and cataracts. Though surgical intervention is the standard treatment for cataracts, experimental medical therapies for cataracts are under extensive investigation. Carnosine, a pro-drug of carnosine-N-acetylcarnosine, bendazac, ascorbic acid, and aldose reductase inhibitors are under therapeutic evaluation, and prevention of cataract formation may be possible in the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background With age, {{the human}} lens accumulates variety of {{substances}} that absorbs and fluorescence, which explains {{the color of}} yellow, brunescent and nigrescent cataract in terms of aging. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess lens fluorophores with properties comparable to those of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) in relation to age in human lenses. These fluorescent compounds are believed to be involved in the development of cataract. Methods Spectroscopic (UV-Vis-NIR) and fluorescence photography (CCD-Digital based image analysis) studies were carried out in randomly selected intact human lenses (2 – 85 years). AGE-like fluorophores were also measured in water soluble and insoluble (alkali soluble) fractions of human lenses (20 – 80 years). Results Our experimental findings suggest that there was a progressive shift in the absorbance characteristic of intact lens in the range of λ 210 nm - λ 470 nm. A relative increase in the absorptivity at λ (511 – 520 nm), with age, was also observed. In addition, the ratio of absorptivity at λ (511 – 520 nm) versus the maximum absorbance recorded at blue-end cut-off (210 – 470 nm) was also found to increase, with age. The fluorescent intensity in the intact lens at both UV-B (λ Ex 312 nm) and UV-A (λ Ex 365 nm) were found to be positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 91 & 0. 94, respectively; Confidence interval 95 %) upto 50 years of age. In addition, a concomitant changes in AGE- like fluorophores were also observed in the <b>processed</b> <b>lens</b> samples (soluble and insoluble fractions) along the age.

The way humans engage with ecological processes within cities is highly complex, and both from a social and ecological perspective these engagements cannot be interpreted meaningfully {{on the basis of}} a single timeframe. Historical analyses offer useful insights into the nature of social-ecological interactions under diverse conditions, enabling improved decision-making into the future. We present an historical review of the evolving relationship between the urban settlement of Cape Town and the ecological processes inherent to its natural surroundings.

Processes of significance, for example water provision, soil erosion, the provision of wood and natural materials, and the role of fire, are presented. This historical analysis documents the progression from a wilderness to a tamed and largely benign urban environment.

Over the past decade Global Health Initiatives, like the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) have adopted novel approaches to engaging with stakeholders in high and low income countries. This article explores how this experience impacted on acceptance of the international obligation to (help) fulfil the right to health beyond borders. Methods The authors conducted an extensive review of international human rights law literature, transnational legal process literature, global public health literature and grey literature pertaining to Global Health Initiatives. To complement this desk work and deepen their understanding of how and why different legal norms evolve the authors conducted 19 in-depth key informant interviews with actors engaged with three stakeholders; the European Union, the United States and Belgium. The authors then analysed the interviews through a transnational legal <b>process</b> <b>lens.</b> Results Through according value to the process of examining how and why different legal norms evolve transnational legal process offers us a tool for engaging with the dynamism of developments in global health suggesting that operationalising global health obligations could advance the right to health for all. Conclusions In many low-income countries the health sector is heavily dependent on external assistance to fulfil the right to health of people thus it is vital that policies and tools for delivering reliable, long-term assistance are developed so that the right to health for all becomes more than a dream.

30|$|The {{exploration}} on how {{to manage}} organizational resources and capabilities to sustain competitive advantages remains the intriguing unit of research of strategic management science. It is especially through for Information and Communication Technologies Industry where technologies developing with astonishing speed and where the life cycles of cutting-edge products are becoming shorter and shorter, and brand-new products of firms are routinely being imitated by others (Yun et al. 2016). Therefore, the rapidly changing economic landscape, coupled with transformational advances in information and communication technologies, presents many challenges to managers of large and small enterprises alike (Amit and Zott 2016). The {{need for a new}} approach for firms to deal with the increasing open innovation phenomenon in the form of strategies, business models, user innovation is on the rise (Yun et al. 2016). In response to such challenges, two perspectives have emerged in the strategic management literature in the last two decades: the dynamic capabilities (DC) paradigm (Teece et al. 1997), and the business model (BM) perspective (Amit and Zott 2001). With few exceptions (e.g., Teece 2009), these viewpoints have been kept separate (Amit and Zott 2016). Excellent theoretical contribution did by Amit and Zott (2016) exploring the rich links between these two strategic management perspectives. The key insight that they offer is that business model design, when viewed through a <b>process</b> <b>lens,</b> can be considered a dynamic capability. The dynamic capability view (DCV) on competitive advantage has emerged as an attempt to untangle the complex problem of competitive advantage sustainability in rapidly changing environments (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Teece et al. 1997). The term ‘dynamic’ refers to capacity to renew competences so as to adapt to the changing business environment (Teece et al. 1997). The term ‘capabilities’ emphasizes the key role of strategic management in appropriately adapting, integrating and reconfiguring internal and external organizational skills, resources and functional competences to match the requirements of a changing environment. Hense, DCV studies investigate the attribute, origination, process, influence, and contribution of the dynamic capabilities (Barreto 2010; Helfat and Peteraf 2009; Narayanan et al. 2009; Teece 2009; Zahra et al. 2006; Zhou and Li 2010; Zollo and Winter 2002; Zott 2003) and most researches argue that dynamic capabilities increase competitive advantage. Helfat and Peteraf (2009) define dynamic capabilities as “the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base” and as such to reach a higher economic value than their competitors. In addition, dynamic capabilities are regarded as a transformer for converting resources into improved performance (Lee and Wu 2014). However, “dynamic capabilities theory cannot directly explain the triggers of dynamic capabilities. There is no sufficient explanation to the starting point of the introduction of new ideas, know-ledge, or technology, as a dynamic activity performed by a firm” ((Yun et al. 2016, p. 3). What’s more, Yun argues that “Big businesses should continuously make efforts to introduce new business models by creating new combinations for a short period through friendly partnerships, and technology licensing with SMEs and start-ups rather than just focusing on its internal R & D” (2015, p. 18).|$|E
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P APSS 2016 Cheungxiv, 405 pages :color illustrationsThis ethnographic {{case study}} explores how a social welfare organization, the Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS), {{achieved}} positive organizational change and {{transformed into a}} positive organization. It addresses an understudied research area which is severely lacking of qualitative case studies for constructing practice knowledge to understand how organizations affect positive change {{in response to the}} challenges brought about by the social welfare reform in the 2000 s. Positive organization is a direction of positive organizational development that focuses on nurturing the best of human condition and striving for positivity by maximizing the organization's capacity under constraint. The ethnographic approach serves as a fresh lens for looking into the process of positive organizational change from a different perspective and offers a rich and in-depth description of the experiences of positive change in an organization {{over an extended period of}} time. The researcher entered the change processes of HKCS as an insider ethnographer cum practitioner and became both the data collection/data generation instrument and the lens used to analyze the phenomenon and dynamics of transformation. Two significant phases of HKCS's organizational change were identified. The first one evolved from 2000 to 2007 showing its reframing practice and multi-frame practice. Through retrospective study, the process and mechanism of reframing that created a momentum of change and the multi-frame practice involving good practices of political, structural, human resource and cultural-symbolic dimensions that surfaced from this study explains HKCS's positive organizational change. The second phase was a process of positive practice from 2008 to 2013. An in-depth exploration of its lived experience explained how HKCS made use of the Positive Journey to create a positive practice frame by nurturing the staff's strengths, fostering a positive workplace, developing its positive service, and constructing the Positive Organizational Index as a tool for promoting positive organization. It was discovered that its positive practice is an overarching frame which generates positive energy and a positive cycle that supports the organization moves towards becoming a positive organization. The findings of this study have generated significant contributions across four important domains. First, it adopts a combined <b>process</b> <b>lens</b> and positivity to understand complicated positive organizational change of HKCS. A theoretical practice framework and the mechanism of HKCS's process of transformation into a positive organization are constructed to explain its unique practice wisdom of positive organizational development. Second, the results of this study show that it builds new theoretical insights into the literature of organizational reframing. It identifies a newly emerged positive practice frame which supports building of a positive organization on top of Bolman and Deal's (2003) four-frame model. Third, this study expands the practice knowledge of positive organizational studies by illustrating how an organization transformed into a positive organization in local context. It fills in the gaps of empirical evidence for the process of positive organizational change. Finally, it demonstrates HKCS's practice wisdom in developing a Positive Organizational Index to measure an organization's level of positivity and constructing the process of how an organization moves towards a positive organization. This case study is useful in gaining a deeper understanding of how HKCS took positive organizational development as a direction to transform itself into a positive organization.

40|$|Digital {{information}} systems (ISs) aim for efficiency gains, savings and high {{benefits such as}} better service delivery or improved fraud detection. Yet benefits are often not reached in practice as IS projects are confronted with serious obstacles. Despite high efforts and enthusiastic project teams, failure is omnipresent for public sector ISs all over the world. Public sector IS failure can imply nasty consequences such as wasted tax payers’ money, governmental reputational damage, a poor front-office service or inefficiencies etc. (Rana et al, 2013; Goldfinch, 2007; McManus & Wood-Harper, 2007; Lyytinen & Hirschheim, 1987). Understanding failure is essential to develop, implement, manage and operationalise ISs effectively (Sauer & Davis, 2012). There is still a high need and much room for additional failure research. This dissertation aims to reduce three main research gaps: (1) A shortage of in-depth research on how public sector IS projects unfold and result in failure. (2) A lack of government-to-government (G 2 G) IS studies, {{while the majority of}} G 2 G IS projects is a partial or total failure. (3) A dearth of models to study IS project failure (Goldfinch, 2007; Homburg & Bekkers, 2002; Kautz & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2013; Pan et al, 2006 a,b; Yang & Maxwell, 2011). Given these gaps, the main research question of this dissertation focuses on how G 2 G IS projects in Flanders unfold and result in failure. This question is operationalised via three sub-questions. The first concerns what useful models from the IS research domain exist to analyse G 2 G IS failure in Flanders. The second sub-questions looks on how these models could be refined. While the third focuses on what determines failure according to Flemish G 2 G IS managers. The IS failure research literature distinguishes multiple concepts, causes and management approaches of failure. In this dissertation a G 2 G IS project is believed to have failed when it does not meet the expectations of its stakeholders and runs out of support (Lyytinen & Hirsscheim, 1987; Sauer, 1993). The usefulness of three models to analyse G 2 G IS failure was studied. Two of these models fit the rational factor lens on failure which sees failure as a combination of causally linked factors, failure is identified by {{the presence or absence of}} these factors (Kautz & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2013; Sauer & Davis, 2012). The first model which fits the factor lens is the IS success model of Delone & McLean (1993; 2003), the second model is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology by Venkatesch et al (2003). The third selected model fits the <b>process</b> <b>lens,</b> this lens sees failure as a personal value judgement and as the result of dynamic interaction processes between multiple context factors, the IS project organisation and its key stakeholders, whereby the IS ultimately runs out of support. Sauer’s (1993) IS failure model fits this lens. The usefulness of each model was tested based on two criteria: its applicability to research failure in a public sector context and its degree of completeness for detecting causes of failed G 2 G IS projects. The D&M model, UTAUT and IS failure model were tested on 5 Flemish G 2 G IS projects (the Road Sign Database, the Environmental Complaints Registration and Monitoring System, Going Out, the Library Information and Monitoring System and the Plan Merits system). The first two projects were tested in case studies, the last three via a survey combined with interviews. The IS failure model was also tested on a sixth IS project (i. e. the Digital Building Permit IS). All ISs were initiated by a Flemish project organisation (also called the IS project managers or idea champions) and required mainly data of municipalities. Three research steps were undertaken to test the usefulness of each model. First, data were collected via document analysis and interviews. No model specific questions were asked during interviews in order to let the data emerge inductively and speak for itself. Second, the IS projects were re-examined by looking through the lens of the D&M model, UTAUT and IS failure model. This deductive approach provided insight whether or not these models were applicable to analyse G 2 G IS failure causes. In a third step, the causes of failure that the models detected were compared to the indeductive list of causes, which allowed for a check of completeness. The research results show that each model can be applied to the public sector and is able to detect several causes of G 2 G IS failure. The D&M model appeared to be the least complete in detecting failure factors, while the IS failure model is the most complete one. The combination of the D&M model and UTAUT learns more than each model on its own. The IS failure model goes beyond the identification of factors as it is able to explain how ISs failed via multiple interactions of support, management and context processes. In total the models identified 21 recurrent failure factors. Although the three models are useful, they could be further refined, for example by better defining (sub-) constructs, describing how sub-constructs could be operationalised or by adapting constructs to a public sector context. In order to answer the third sub-question concerning what Flemish G 2 G IS managers determine as a failure, 20 G 2 G experts were interviewed and 32 Flemish G 2 G IS project managers were put together in five focus groups to allow cross-fertilisation of knowledge. The Flemish G 2 G IS managers and experts signalled 14 recurrent political-administrative, technical, economical and legal problems of failure. They also described the context of these problems and with whose support these might be solved. The experiences of the questioned G 2 G IS expert and managers combined with practical insights from the studied IS projects, led to some management advice: 1. Check for no go's at the start 2. Oblige a business and value case 3. Pay attention to supplier management 4. Say yes to user involvement, no to scope creep 5. Make clear agreements 6. Do not cut on testing and consider an agile way of working 7. Provide sufficient service quality 8. Do not block critique 9. Prove an IS's value 10. Don't burn your bridges 11. Be visionary This dissertation took an interpretivist stance in order to uncover deeper causes of failure. Based on the insights gained throughout this PhD journey, some G 2 G specific elements and five root causes of why Flemish G 2 G IS projects result in failure could be identified: 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{research}} the virtual camera systems used in current generation third person action games and to see what could be improved upon. To do this, different camera shots were categorized into camera archetypes, which also include post <b>process</b> and <b>lens</b> effects used. Information about the games was acquired by either looking through the game’s settings or by observing gameplay. Finally the results were compared {{to each other as}} well as the film industry and several improvements regarding usage of different features and camera shots were suggested...|$|R

Nevertheless, the more significant geometrical functional aspect related to the optical properties is the curvature, which is rarely investigated in the manufacturing <b>process</b> of <b>lenses.</b> Algorithms {{for the assessment of}} shape and curvature errors on aspheric surface profile are presented. The method hasbeen investigated on profiles measured before and at different steps of the membrane polishing process. The results show how surface roughness, shape, and curvature change during the polishing process {{as a function of the}} machining time...|$|R

The content of the handbook would cover optical coatings, surfaces, fiber optics, and fabricating <b>process</b> for <b>lenses,</b> windows and mirrors that were used on LDEF. The goal of this program (and handbook) {{is to ensure that}} the space community can derive the maximum benefit from the LDEF experiment relative to future optics designs for space applications.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to define the {{manufacturing}} process of a camera application with included optics and its integration with electronics and verify the process information by Volvo Car Corporation’s (VCC’s) cost model and using it to calculate the total product cost. The method used to fulfill the purpose was divided into three phases, understanding the product, creating process maps and performing a cost calculation. By the use of literature studies, observations and interviews, necessary data needed to perform a cost calculation was included in specific process maps. The data was then used as input for VCC’s cost model to calculate the total product cost. By analyzing gathered information using the methods described above, three specific process maps with necessary data were created. These were a <b>process</b> map of <b>lens</b> manufacturing, a <b>process</b> map of <b>lens</b> barrel assembly and a process map of final assembly. When calculating the cost of all the components, {{the cost of the}} lenses was estimated using the specific <b>lens</b> manufacturing <b>process.</b> After calculating the cost of all the ingoing components, the cost of the lens barrel assembly was calculated. This cost was then used to calculate the cost of the final assembly with all ingoing components. The results showed that the total product cost was 72 €, the cost distribution showed that the lenses were the most expensive component constituting for approximately 72 % of the total product cost. When presenting information about the cost distribution of each <b>process</b> within <b>lens</b> manufacturing, it could be seen that the polishing process was the most costly operation of all. Due to lenses being the most expensive component in the product, it was recommended to do further research within optical manufacturing and to review the product requirements and specification regarding the optical system {{in order to reduce the}} total product cost...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLens {{regeneration}} {{in adult}} newts is possible by transdifferentiation of the pigment epithelial cells (PECs) of the dorsal iris. The same {{cells in the}} ventral iris are not capable of such a process. To understand this difference in regenerative competency, we examined gene expression of 373 genes in the intact dorsal and ventral irises {{as well as in}} irises during the <b>process</b> of <b>lens</b> regeneration. We found similar signatures of gene expression in dorsal and ventral with several cases of even higher levels in the ventral iris. Such transcriptional activity in the regeneration-incompetent ventral iris was unexpected and calls for a revision of our views about mechanisms of lens regeneration induction...|$|R

40|$|The LENS Qualification {{team had}} {{the goal of}} {{performing}} a process qualification for the Laser Engineered Net Shaping{trademark}(LENS{reg_sign}) process. Process Qualification requires that a part be selected for process demonstration. The AY 1 E 0125 D-Bottle Bracket from the W 80 - 3 was selected for this work. The repeatability of the <b>LENS</b> <b>process</b> was baselined to determine process parameters. Six D-Bottle brackets were deposited using LENS, machined to final dimensions, and tested in comparison to conventionally processed brackets. The tests, taken from ES 1 E 0003, included a mass analysis and structural dynamic testing including free-free and assembly-level modal tests, and Haversine shock tests. The LENS brackets performed with very similar characteristics to the conventionally processed brackets. Based {{on the results of}} the testing, it was concluded that the performance of the brackets made them eligible for parallel path testing in subsystem level tests. The testing results and process rigor qualified the <b>LENS</b> <b>process</b> as detailed in EER 200638525 A...|$|R

For soma time now it has been known that sulfatad proteoglycans are present ininitiallens development, as these molecules have been implied in morphogenetic <b>processes</b> such as <b>lens</b> invagination and induction (Webster et al., 1983, Peterson et al., 1995). The implication of sulfatad proteoglycans in these phenomena is attributed to their distribution pattern and their coinciding with a particular process, or to the changas found in this distribution pattern in certain mutant strains of aphakic mica (Zwaan and Webster, 1984). Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence to support the implication of proteoglycans in the formation <b>processes</b> of the <b>lens</b> vesicle and its subsequent development. In this paper, we offer the preliminary results of an experimental study concerning selectiva disruption of sulfatad proteoglycans synthesis by means of a P-D Xyloside, and its effect on lens growth...|$|R
