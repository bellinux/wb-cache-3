50|$|Standard Network layer {{protocols}} {{have been}} assigned reserved LLC addresses, as recorded in ISO/IEC TR 11802-1. One half of the LLC address space is reserved for such assignment. Other protocols are accommodated in two ways. One way is by local assignment of LSAPs, for which {{the other half of}} the LLC address space is available.The second way is through the use of a particular reserved LLC address value that has been assigned for use in conjunction with the Sub-network Access Protocol (SNAP) which is called SNAP address. The SNAP address identifies, at each MAC SAP, a single LSAP. Thus, each protocol using SNAP must employ a <b>protocol</b> <b>identifier.</b> Thus, the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) is a mechanism for multiplexing, on networks using IEEE 802.2 LLC, more protocols than can be distinguished by the 8-bit 802.2 Service Access Point (SAP) fields. SNAP supports identifying protocols by Ethernet type field values; it also supports vendor-private <b>protocol</b> <b>identifier</b> spaces.

40|$|In {{high speed}} networks, packet {{processing}} is relatively expensive while bandwidth is cheap. This begs the question: what fields {{can be added}} to packets to make packet processing easier? By exploring this question, we devise a number of novel mechanisms to speed up packet processing. With the advent of new standards for the Data Link, Network, and Transport layers, we believe there is an opportunity to apply these techniques to improve the performance of real protocols. First, we suggest adding a data manipulation header to an easily accessible portion of each packet. This header contains pointers to fields (in various layers) required for data manipulation. This information allows implementations to efficiently combine data manipulation steps (e. g., encryption and copying) in a structured fashion. Second, we suggest adding index fields to <b>protocol</b> <b>identifiers</b> at all layers (e. g.,, connection identifiers, network addresses, DSAPs) to reduce lookup costs and generic protocol processing.
