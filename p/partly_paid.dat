5|$|The South West Coast Path {{starts from}} {{the western side of}} Minehead, in Somerset, at a marker erected in 2001 and <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by the South West Coast Path Association. The path follows the {{waterfront}} past the harbour to Culver Cliff before climbing up on a zigzag path through woodland. Entering the Exmoor National Park, it cuts inland past North Hill, Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at Hurlestone Point. After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> as where shares are <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|E

25|$|In May 1989 one of Haughey's lifelong friends, former {{government}} minister Brian Lenihan, underwent {{a liver transplant}} which was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for through fundraising by Haughey. The Moriarty tribunal found that of the £270,000 collected in donations for Brian Lenihan, no more than £70,000 ended up being spent on Lenihan's medical care. The tribunal identified one specific donation of £20,000 for Lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by Haughey, who took steps to conceal this transaction.|$|E
40|$|In Middle English raunsom or raunson {{derives from}} the old French raencon (or raenson, rancon, ranson, ranchon, etc.) and from the Latin redemptio. Ransom is {{commonly}} defined as the price or sum paid or demanded {{for the release of}} a prisoner. However, it has not always been strictly financial. This nuance is highlighted by the medieval use of the term finance (fenaunce, fynance, financia), which seemed to designate a ransom that was paid in money, whereas ransom could also be <b>partly</b> or entirely <b>paid</b> in goods...|$|R
50|$|State laws {{delegate}} {{limited control}} over building, alcohol, marijuana, gambling, and taxi licenses to municipal governments. Municipal governments own most roads, and many use police and traffic control officers to enforce their own parking regulations, and set speed limits and various restrictions on local roads within state parameters. Maintenance of state-owned roads (typically major), setting {{the rules of}} the road, driver and vehicle licenses, and public transportation are MassDOT responsibilities, though regional transportation agencies such as the MBTA are funded <b>partly</b> by fees <b>paid</b> by municipalities.|$|R

Maria Borelius was elected a Member of Parliament from the Stockholm County, and became Minister for Foreign Trade in the centre-right government that was formed after the election. Within {{a few weeks}} two ministers had resigned, and Borelius was one of them. She admitted that she during the 1990s, when her four children were small, had used child-care without reporting to the tax authorities and paying the full 32% social fees, and in the media frenzy that followed, resigned. The Swedish Government has since then changed the system by which private child care is <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> through the so-called “RUT” reforms.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the means}} of urban {{development}} in this particular area {{of the city was}} subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest {{in the context of a}} public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at land undervalued land rates, and <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.|$|E
25|$|The Anglican {{ministry}} {{has been}} present in Sydney since its foundation in 1788. An Evangelical cleric, Richard Johnson, {{was the first}} chaplain to the new colony of New South Wales and {{was sponsored by the}} London Missionary Society. Other chaplains, notably Samuel Marsden and William Cowper, were also sent. Their positions were unusual as their stipends were <b>paid</b> <b>partly</b> by the colonial government and some (Marsden among them) received large grants of land from the governor of the colony. Some (again including Marsden) were also magistrates. The early chaplains (Johnson and Marsden) were under the authority of the governor, as per their commissions.|$|R

50|$|In France paid {{sick leave}} is <b>paid</b> <b>partly</b> by social {{security}} (Sécurité sociale) and partly by the employer.

The employer pays an additional part depending on collective agreement and legislation. Basic legislation requires that an employee working for more than one year, starting at eighth sick day social security and employer together provides 90% of salary for at least 30 days.

25|$|The {{pavilion}} end on {{the south}} side of the ground was completely redeveloped between 2010 and 2011 at a cost of £32 million, <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for from a £20 million loan from Birmingham City Council, bringing the ground's capacity up to 25,000. Demolition of the pavilion – parts of which dated back to the 1890s – and the Leslie Deakins, R. V. Ryder and William Ansell Stands took place in January 2010, with construction of the new South and West Stands starting in April 2010 and reaching completion 66 weeks later. 5 permanent floodlight pylons were erected around the ground at the same time, allowing up to 15 days of day-night cricket annually. The new development was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh on 25 July 2011. The first test match to be played at the redeveloped venue was the third Test vs India on 10 August 2011, which saw England reach the number 1 position in the ICC Test Championship for the first time with victory by an innings and 242 runs on the fourth day of the match.|$|E

500|$|Almost all of Millennium Park {{was closed}} for a day for {{corporate}} events in 2005 and 2006. Closing a public park <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for with taxpayer money was controversial, as was the exclusion of commuters who walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions. [...] On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent all park venues from 6a.m. to 11p.m, except Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and the Crown Fountain. [...] The city said the money was used to fund day-to-day operations, and for free events in the park, including the Lurie Garden Festival, a Steppenwolf Theater production, musical performers along the Chase Promenade all summer long, a jazz series, and children's concerts. The name of Toyota, one of the sponsors, was included on Millennium Park brochures, web site, and advertising signage. The closure provided a public relations opportunity for General Motors, which shuttled 1,500tourists from the park to see other Chicago attractions. Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental expense and $500,000 a sponsoring donation. On August 7, 2006, Allstate, which paid $200,000 as a rental expense and $500,000 as a sponsoring donation, acquired the visitation rights to {{a different set of}} park features (including Lurie Garden), and only had exclusive access to certain features after 4p.m.|$|E
500|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Royal Australian Navy {{underwent}} a severe reduction in ships and manpower. As {{a result of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, the flagship HMAS Australia was scrapped with her main armaments and sunk outside Sydney Heads in 1924. In the same year, the RAN began a five-year program of obtaining new ships from Britain: the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] and the seaplane carrier [...] This purchase was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by scrapping Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, and most of the destroyers. The Great Depression of 1929 led to another reduction of manpower; although reduced in size, the available posts were easily filled as many men were unemployed and the offered pay was greater than most jobs. The RAN's personnel strength fell to 3,117 personnel, plus 131 members of the Naval Auxiliary Services. By 1932, the strength of the Reserves stood at 5,446. In the early 1930s, lack of funds forced the transfer of the Royal Australian Naval College from Jervis Bay to Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria. In 1933 the Australian Government ordered three light cruisers; HMA Ships , , and selling the seaplane carrier Albatross to fund Hobart. During this time, the RAN also purchased destroyers of the V and W destroyer classes, the ships that would become known as the Scrap Iron Flotilla. With the ever-increasing threat of Germany and Japan in the late 1930s, the RAN was not in the position it was at the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

5000|$|However, mention should {{perhaps be}} made {{of the way in which}} rates were treated {{differently}} north and south of the border.

The main exception to the above general rule was that the landlord of a [...] "small dwelling-house" [...] as defined by the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Acts 1911 and 1920, was responsible for payment of the occupier's rates on the house but he could recover the full amount of these from the tenant by means of an addition to the rent.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus shares, <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E

His contemporary, Duarte Barbosa, describing Gujarat's maritime trade, recorded the import of horses from the Middle East and elephants from Malabar, and lists exports which included muslins, chintzes and silks, carnelian, ginger and other spices, aromatics, opium, indigo and other substances for dyeing, cereals and legumes (Barbosa, I, pp.108–58). Persia was the destination for many of these commodities, and they were <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for in horses and pearls taken from Hormuz (Barbosa, I, p.82). It was the latter item, in particular, which led Sultan Sikandar Lodi of Delhi, according to Ali-Muhammad Khan, author of the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, to complain that the [...] "support of the throne of Delhi is wheat and barley but the foundation of the realm of Gujarat is coral and pearls" [...] (apud Bayley, p.20).
