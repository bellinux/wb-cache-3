5000|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the 19th century alone, 10,000 pieces of popular music were printed by U.S. publishers. The industry, however, did nothing to promote music or develop writers. Songs became popular by word-of-mouth. Most {{minstrel}} troupes and professional singers wrote their own music or had songs written to order. Stephen Foster was the first composer who tried to make a living as an independent professional songwriter but, in the 1850s, copyright protection was so lax and royalties so small (or non-existent) that he found himself living in poverty. This changed only gradually as young men involved in other business enterprises began to perceive the possibilities for enrichment in song publishing.Prior to the 1880s, popular music publishing was a secondary function of music stores or [...] "serious" [...] (Classical) music publishers.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that retailers use 99 -ending prices as a <b>promotional</b> <b>technique.</b> This paper explores the consumer perceived benefits of such promotional practices {{and the information}} processing conditions under which hedonic benefits are higher (lower) than utilitarian ones. In line with the benefit framework of sales promotion proposed by Chandon, Wansink, and Laurent (2000), 99 -ends {{are not expected to}} be strictly associated to monetary savings benefit but also to a more hedonic benefit, fulfilling consumer’s needs for exploration. In addition, the analytic or intuitive consumer decision style (Mantel & Kardes, 1999) is likely to activate either the utilitarian benefit of savings or the hedonic benefit of exploration with more strength. The analysis of an on-line survey among 317 shoppers shows that both perceived savings and exploration benefits {{have a positive impact on}} proneness to buy 99 -ends products with the saving benefits being stronger (weaker) for analytical decision makers (intuitive decision makers). The findings contribute to the better understanding of the image effect of 99 -ends underlying its individual differences and help retailers and also pricing managers in their use of 99 -ends as a <b>promotional</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E

40|$|Store brands (SBs), {{also called}} private labels, are goods owned and merchandised by retailers. SBs {{have long been}} {{considered}} {{an important aspect of}} merchandising practice, both as a strategic tool for retailers and a unique source of competition for manufacturers. Retailers would benefit by increasing the purchase rates of their store brands (Batra and Sinha 2000). The difficulty with such an objective, however, is that any attempt to increase purchase rates must be weighed against the cost of achieving such a goal. Initia-tives involving increased advertising or improving product inputs may not warrant serious consideration since these options likely would increase costs and reduce the attractiveness of SBs to price-conscious consumers (Ailawadi, Neslin, and Gedenk 2001).

The study provides an insight into the management organisation, processes and relative importance of <b>promotional</b> <b>techniques</b> for competitive differentiation through research involving construction firms and their promotional design and public relations consultants and advertising agents. The research examines the effectiveness of promotion, through surveys of client organisations and professional architectural, quantity surveying and other advisors.

Problems of promotion identified in the research concern promotional material used as direct mail or in pre-selection presentations.

40|$|Gambling {{promotions}} extensively punctuate contemporary televised sport broadcasts {{and concerns}} {{have been raised}} about their potential impacts on vulnerable groups. Research suggests advertising can shape individuals’ emotions, or affect, towards a product/brand and can subsequently influence purchasing decisions.

40|$|In-store product {{sampling}} is {{a commonly}} used <b>promotional</b> <b>technique</b> {{designed to give}} prospective consumers an opportunity to experience a product prior to purchase. While prior research has documented {{a positive relationship between}} short-term sales and perceptual measures of the customer shopping experience, {{little is known about the}} long-term impact of sampling or factors that moderate its success. In this paper, we develop an empirical approach that allows us to study the short-term and long-term effects of in-store sampling on both own and competitive products. We apply our approach to six store-level scanner data sets across four different product categories and show that in-store sampling has both an immediate (short-term) and sustained (long-term) impact on sales. We also show that the impact of sampling on sales is moderated by the characteristics of the store conducting the event, and that repeated sampling for a single product leads to a multiplicative increase in its long-term sales performance. We find that, unlike many types of in-store promotion, sampling results in a category expansion effect as opposed to a pure substitution effect. We contrast the immediate and long-term sales patterns for in-store sampling to those of product displays and discuss managerially relevant differences. Finally, we demonstrate incremental profit implications and store selection scenarios for different incremental costs of conducting the in-store events using constrained optimizations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore factors {{affecting}} participant awareness, attraction, and attachment to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s (NMSS) MS 150 PGA Tour Cycle to the Shore charitable bike ride utilizing the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM) developed by Funk and James. In addition, the authors sought to outline variables sport organizations can use to predict donor behavior. Design/methodology/approach – Data for this project were derived from an electronic survey distributed to race participants and was analyzed in SPSS® software. Regression analysis was employed. Findings – The findings support previous research employing the PCM; wherein social situational variables have the greatest influence on the relational significance of hedonic and dispositional needs in attraction and attachment to sporting events. The work supports the inclusion of communities as an additional attachment outcome. Practical implications – In all, 92 percent of riders were informed about the event through word of mouth (WOM) marketing, highlighting the importance this <b>promotional</b> <b>technique</b> in the awareness stage of the PCM.
