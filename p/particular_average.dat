The results {{are based on}} a recent generalization of two time scale stability theory to di#erential equations with disturbances. In <b>particular,</b> <b>averaging</b> theory for systems with disturbances is used to establish the results. The nonsmooth nature of PWM systems is accommodated by working with upper semicontinuous set-valued maps, locally Lipschitz inflations of these maps, and locally Lipschitz parameterizations of locally Lipschitz set-valued maps. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this study confirm that Sq is a very {{changeable}} phenomenon, with a strong day-to-day variation, and that it is superimposed on magnetic disturbances of a magnetospheric origin that affect the determination of the true Sq variation. This can have repercussions for the derivation of the equivalent ionospheric currents in general and in the determination of their focus position in <b>particular.</b> <b>Averaging</b> over quiet days and seasons tends to smooth out the variability, and a seasonal and solar-cycle characteristic behaviour determination can be attempted, although sometimes the averages are of heterogeneous quantities.|$|R

Some photographers use their knowledge of these limits to determine the optimum exposure for a photograph; for one example, see the Zone System. Most automatic cameras instead try to achieve a <b>particular</b> <b>average</b> density.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of testing UGV navigation in unstructured, off-road environments made accurate, objective measurement of progress a challenging task. While no absolute measure of performance had been defined in LAGR, the relative comparison of a team’s code {{to that of}} the Baseline code on a given course demonstrated whether progress was being made in that environment. By the conclusion of the program, testing showed that many of the performers had attained leaps in performance.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we {{consider}} multi-dimensional Hartman almost periodic functions and sequences, defined {{with respect to}} different averaging sequences of subsets in R d or Z d. We consider the behavior of their Fourier-Bohr coefficients and their spectrum, depending on the <b>particular</b> <b>averaging</b> sequence, and we demonstrate this dependence by several examples. Extensions to compactly generated, locally compact, abelian groups are considered. We define generalized Marcinkiewicz spaces based upon arbitrary measure spaces and general averaging sequence of subsets. We extend results of Urbanik to locally compact, abelian groups. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} a scaling limit for autonomous stochastic Newton equations, the solutions are often called nonlinear stochastic oscillators, where the nonlinear drift includes a mean field term of McKean type and the driving noise is Gaussian. Uniform convergence in L^ 2 sense {{is achieved by}} applying L^ 2 -type estimates and the Gronwall Theorem. The approximation is also called Smoluchowski-Kramers limit and is a <b>particular</b> <b>averaging</b> technique studied by Papanicolaou.

5000|$|Costs for employer-paid health {{insurance}} are rising rapidly: between 2001 and 2007, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and inflation has risen 17%, {{according to a}} 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. [...] Employer costs have risen noticeably per hour worked, and vary significantly. In <b>particular,</b> <b>average</b> employer costs for health benefits vary by firm size and occupation. The cost per hour of health benefits is generally higher for workers in higher-wage occupations, but represent a smaller percentage of payroll. The percentage of total compensation devoted to health benefits has been rising since the 1960s. [...] Average premiums, including both the employer and employee portions, were $4,704 for single coverage and $12,680 for family coverage in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The {{only major}} {{aesthetic}} difference of the Magna relative to its Japanese donor was the wider body, {{as the general}} styling and side profile were similar also thanks to shared tooling for doors, guards and pillars. While still smaller and lighter than its then current RWD rivals, the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, the Magna trumped the latter for interior space due to the inherently superior packaging offered by the FWD layout. As the enlarging added minimal weight and the overall footprint remained smaller compared to rivals, the Magna could make do with a big-bore four-cylinder engine instead of the more traditional six-cylinder engines used by Holden and Ford. Even despite a , fuel efficiency was not significantly better. In <b>particular,</b> <b>average</b> fuel consumption was officially rated at 11.0 L/100km mpg in city driving and 7.8 L/100km mpg in highway driving.|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Revolution was the {{transition}} to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, {{the increasing use of}} steam power, and the development of machine tools. These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In <b>particular,</b> <b>average</b> income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently {{for the first time in}} history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries. The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants and fire.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{convergence}} of a finite volume scheme for a model of miscible two-phase flow in porous media. In this model, one phase can dissolve into the other one. The convergence of the scheme is proved thanks to an estimate on the two pressures, which allows to prove some estimates on the discrete time derivative of some nonlinear functions of the unknowns. Monotony arguments allow to show some properties on the limits of these functions. A key point in the scheme is to use <b>particular</b> <b>averaging</b> formula for the dissolution function arising in the space term...|$|R

40|$|Given a Finsler space (M,F), one {{can define}} natural average Riemannian metrics on M by {{averaging}} on the indicatrix I_x the fundamental tensor g of the Finsler function $F$. In this paper we determine explicitly the Levi-Civita connection for these average Riemannian metrics. We apply the result {{to the case}} when (M,F) is a Landsberg space. Using a <b>particular</b> <b>averaging</b> procedure, the invariance of the average metric along a homotopy {{in the space of}} Finsler structures over M is shown.

30|$|Thus, a {{variation}} is observed between LC and width of road, {{primarily due to}} the effect of constraining by road edges or median. Due to this constraining, vehicles may not choose to overtake on narrow roads, and thus maintain larger LC at particular speeds. However, on very wide roads (> 4 lanes), lack of any constrain from road edges may motivate the drivers to travel at higher speeds taking higher risks, due to which LC again reduces at <b>particular</b> <b>average</b> speeds.|$|E

We empirically confirm the implication from a theoretical decomposition of inflation uncertainty that disagreement is an incomplete approximation to overall uncertainty. Both measures are associated with macroeconomic conditions and indicators of monetary policy, but the relations differ qualitatively. In <b>particular,</b> <b>average</b> individual inflation uncertainty is higher during periods of expansionary monetary policy, whereas disagreement rises during contractionary periods...|$|E

The rule pertaining to the dismantling and re-establishing of the service station—the management doctrine—is based on the instantaneous size of the queue, but these processes are assumed to consume time. Operating characteristics of such systems—in <b>particular,</b> <b>average</b> queue length and queueing time—are evaluated. A cost structure is superimposed on the system and optimization procedures are outlined. The close relationship with (a) priority queueing and (b) storage models is pointed out. ...|$|E

The problem can be expressed as an optimisation problem where one selects a subset of r objects from a group of n objects and the objective function is the mismatch between the required average property and that of a proposed sample. We test our method on a reallife problem which arises when we model the assets of a life insurance company in order to understand its risk, solvency and/or capital requirements. In this paper we describe a genetic algorithm developed to solve the generic selection task. We demonstrate the algorithm successfully solving our test problem...|$|E
40|$|Microwave Field pattern {{synthesis}} using interference {{is proposed}} as {{a novel approach}} to microwave heating. It is based on ideas already well known from the optical bench (interference circles, holograms), but applied and adapted to microwaves. The angle of total transmission (Brewster's Angle) keeps reflections at the microwave to material interface to a minimum, thereby improving energy transfer. Signals from two injection-locked magnetron based sources are interfered {{with each other to}} demonstrate the idea. No direct limit is imposed on the number of sources by the topology. Simulation indicates that certain heating patterns can be obtained, simply changing relative phases between sources. Phase being variable, <b>particular</b> <b>average</b> heat distribution patterns can be realized throughout the interference space. Limits mainly occur as a result of material properties, especially loss, material dimensions and wavelength. Articl...|$|E

A multi-parametric approach can be followed to estimate mood states by integrating information coming from different physiological signals and from the analysis of voice. In this work we propose an algorithm to estimate speech features from running speech {{with the aim of}} characterizing the mood state in bipolar patients. This algorithm is based on an automatic segmentation of speech signals to detect voiced segments, and on a spectral matching approach to estimate pitch and pitch changes. In <b>particular</b> <b>average</b> pitch, jitter and pitch standard deviation within each voiced segment, are estimated. The performances of the algorithm are evaluated on a speech database, which includes an electroglottographic signal.

40|$|The inhomogeneous {{fluctuations}} {{that underlie}} structure formation – galaxies and CMB hot spots – {{might have been}} seeded by quantum cosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. The Halliwell–Hawking model for these, as a lower-energy semiclassical limit, {{is expected to be}} shared by many theories. E. g. an O((H/mpl) 2) suppression of power at large scales results from this. This model contains/suppresses very many terms; we want a qualitative understanding of the meaning of these terms and of different regimes resulting from different combinations of them.
