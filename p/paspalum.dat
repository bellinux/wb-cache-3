5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of <b>Paspalum</b> distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E

In March 1819, he traveled to Pittsburgh to join other members of the expedition. There were delays in Pittsburgh, and departure did not occur until the 5th of May.|$|E
25|$|Soras eat a {{wide range}} of foods. Animals that are {{commonly}} reported as sora food items include snails (Gastropoda), crustaceans (Crustacea), spiders (Araneae), and insects (Insecta), mainly beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera), and dragonflies (Odonata). Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as smartweeds, bulrushes, sedges, and barnyard grasses. Seeds of annual wildrice (Zizania aquatica) and rice cutgrass are eaten by soras in the eastern United States. A literature review lists crowngrass (<b>Paspalum</b> spp.) and rice (Oryza sativa) as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants comprising <5% of the sora's diet are also listed and include spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), duckweeds (Lemnaceae), pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.), panicgrasses (Panicum spp.), cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata).|$|E
2500|$|Herbaceous macrophytes {{present in}} the reserve also provide {{important}} habitats for birds, otters and other wildlife [...] and include reeds (Phragmites spp.); sedges (Cyperus spp.), rushes (Scirpus spp.); Spike-rush (Eleocharis spp.); Grey Sedge (Lepironia articulata); Rice Grass (<b>Paspalum</b> scrobiculatum) and other grasses (Scleria spp.); Sacred Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera); White Lotus (Nymphaea lotus); Blue lotus (Nymphaea nouchali); Water Snowflake (Nymphoides indica); Asian Watermoss (Salvinia cucullata); Golden Bladderwort (Utricularia aurea); Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum); Green Algae (Chara spp.) and myriad other Phytoplankton species. Many macrophyte populations form dense floating patches on the lake surface providing refuge and habitat for both mobile and sessile organisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greater rhea}} is endemic to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. There are also feral {{populations of the}} greater rhea in Germany, Cuba and Honduras. This species inhabits {{grassland}} dominated by satintail (Imperata) and bahiagrass (<b>Paspalum)</b> species, as well as savanna, scrub forest, chaparral, and even desert and palustrine lands, though it prefers areas with at least some tall vegetation. It is absent from the humid tropical forests of the Mata Atlântica and planalto uplands {{along the coast of}} Brazil and extends south to 40° latitude. They prefer lower elevations and seldom go above [...] During the breeding season (spring and summer), it stays near water.|$|E
2500|$|A Regional Council study {{describes}} the vegetation around the estuary - [...] "Te Heru Point and up towards Pakoka Landing, {{a forest of}} akeake, kanuka and kowhai lines the estuary arm. Spartina is present on the [...] upstream of Ohiawhakainga Creek. Patches of sea meadow are found {{at the mouth of}} the Motakotako Creek in front of the rushes. The saline influence on the vegetation finishes just upstream of the road bridge at Pakoka Landing. Moving downstream on the true-left bank are bands of saltmarsh ribbonwood with marsh clubrush and raupo wetland behind. Small patches of seagrass are found on the mud flats around the corner where the river widens out. The farmland is not fenced along the [...] and stock access is potentially a problem. A mature (~10 years?) flowering mangrove is upstream of Karetoto Island. A small patch of saltwater <b>paspalum</b> is found immediately opposite the island. A patch of seagrass lies behind the oyster bank at Mowhiti Point. The harbour edge is lined by a thin band of rush." ...|$|E
