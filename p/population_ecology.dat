5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with <b>population</b> <b>ecology,</b> although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term <b>population</b> <b>ecology</b> is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Population</b> <b>ecology</b> {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals {{of the same species}} that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.|$|E
5|$|A <b>population</b> <b>ecology</b> {{concept is}} r/K {{selection}} theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In <b>population</b> <b>ecology,</b> debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E

25|$|Genetic testing, {{also known}} as DNA testing, allows the {{determination}} of bloodlines and the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases.
