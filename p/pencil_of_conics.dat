40|$|We {{establish}} {{a new class of}} integrable systems of Kowalevski type, associated with discriminantly separable polynomials of degree two in each of three variables. Defining property of such polynomials, that all discriminants as polynomials of two variables are factorized as products of two polynomials of one variable each (denote one of the polynomial components as P), lead to an effective integration procedure. In the motivating example, the celebrated Kowalevski top, the discriminant separability is a property of the polynomial defining the Kowalevski fundamental equation. We construct several new examples of systems of Kowalevski type, and we perform their explicit integration in genus two theta-functions. One of the main tasks of the paper is to classify such discriminantly separable polynomials. Our classification is based on the study of structures of zeros of a polynomial component P of a discriminant. From a geometric point of view, such a classification is related to the types <b>of</b> <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>conics.</b> We construct also discrete integrable systems on quad-graphs associated with discriminantly separable polynomials. We {{establish a}} relationship between our classification and the classification of integrable quad-graphs which has been suggested recently by Adler, Bobenko and Suris. As a fit back, we get a geometric interpretation of their results in terms <b>of</b> <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>conics,</b> {{and in the case of}} general position, when all four zeros of the polynomial P are distinct, we get a connection with the Buchstaber-Novikov two-valued groups on CP^ 1.

40|$|A {{new view}} on the Kowalevski top and the Kowalevski {{integration}} procedure is presented. For more than a century, the Kowalevski 1889 case, attracts full attention of a wide community as {{the highlight of the}} classical theory of integrable systems. Despite hundreds of papers on the subject, the Kowalevski integration is still understood as a magic recipe, an unbelievable sequence of skilful tricks, unexpected identities and smart changes of variables. The novelty of our present approach is based on our four observations. The first one is that the so-called fundamental Kowalevski equation is an instance <b>of</b> a <b>pencil</b> equation <b>of</b> the theory <b>of</b> <b>conics</b> which leads us to a new geometric interpretation of the Kowalevski variables w, x_ 1, x_ 2 as the pencil parameter and the Darboux coordinates, respectively. The second is observation of the key algebraic property <b>of</b> the <b>pencil</b> equation which is followed by introduction and study of a new class of discriminantly separable polynomials. All steps of the Kowalevski integration procedure are now derived as easy and transparent logical consequences of our theory of discriminantly separable polynomials. The third observation connects the Kowalevski integration and the pencil equation with the theory of multi-valued groups. The Kowalevski change of variables is now recognized {{as an example of a}} two-valued group operation and its action. The final observation is surprising equivalence of the associativity of the two-valued group operation and its action to n= 3 case of the Great Poncelet Theorem for <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>conics.</b> Comment: 36 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

The G-orbits of lines in PG(V) were determined by the first author and Sheekey {{as part of their}} classification of tensors in F^ 2 ⊗ V in the article "Canonical forms of 2 × 3 × 3 tensors over the real field, algebraically closed fields, and finite fields", Linear Algebra Appl. 476 (2015) 133 - 147.

Interestingly, several of the G-orbits that have symmetric representatives split under the action of K, and in many cases this splitting depends on the characteristic of F. The corresponding orbit sizes and stabiliser subgroups of K are also determined in the case where F is a finite field, and connections are drawn with old work of Jordan, Dickson and Campbell on the classification <b>of</b> <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>conics</b> in PG(2,F), or equivalently, of pairs of ternary quadratic forms over F...|$|R
40|$|Strophoids are {{circular}} cubic curves {{which have}} a node with orthogonal tangents. These rational curves are characterized by a series or properties, and they show up as locus of points at various geometric problems in the Euclidean plane: Strophoids are pedal curves of parabolas if the corresponding pole lies on the parabola’s directrix, and they are inverse to equilateral hyperbolas. Strophoids are focal curves <b>of</b> particular <b>pencils</b> <b>of</b> <b>conics.</b> Moreover, the locus of points where tangents through a given point contact the <b>conics</b> <b>of</b> a confocal family is a strophoid. In descriptive geometry, strophoids appear as perspective views of particular curves of intersection, e. g., of Viviani’s curve. Bricard’s flexible octahedra of type 3 admit two flat poses; and here, after fixing two opposite vertices, strophoids are the locus for the four remaining vertices. In plane kinematics they are the circle-point curves, i. e., the locus of points whose trajectories have instantaneously a stationary curvature. Moreover, they are projections of the spherical and hyperbolic analogues. For any given triangle ABC, the equicevian cubics are strophoids, i. e., the locus of points for which {{two of the three}} cevians have the same lengths. On each strophoid there is a symmetric relation of points, so-called ‘associated’ points, with a series of properties: The lines connecting associated points P and P’ are tangent of the negative pedal curve. Tangents at associated points intersect at a point which again lies on the cubic. For all pairs (P, P’) of associated points, the midpoints lie on a line through the node N. For any two pairs (P, P’) and (Q, Q’) of associated points, the points of intersection between the lines PQ and P’Q’ as well as between PQ’ and P’Q are again placed on the strophoid and mutually associated. The lines PQ and PQ’ are symmetric with respect to the line connecting P with the node. Thus, strophoids generalize Apollonian circles: For given non-collinear points A, A’ and N the locus of points X such that one angle bisector of the lines XA and XA’ passes through N is a strophoid...|$|R
