40|$|This article {{examines}} the characteristics of law enforcement agencies and their environments that affect {{the process by which}} local organizations create and promote operational understandings of law for the purpose of managing enforcement behavior. Using data on law enforcement agencies in California, logistic and OLS regres-sion models reveal the importance of organizational “perviousness”—that is, susceptibility to environmental influence and organizational alignment with the proposed innovation—in the process of organizational inno-vation and policy implementation. We find that <b>perviousness</b> is the strongest predictor of hate crime policy adop-tion by police organizations. <b>Perviousness</b> is, in turn, influenced by environmental conditions like violent crime rates and organizational characteristics like resources and size. Given these findings, we argue that organiza-tional <b>perviousness</b> serves as a central intermediary mechanism through which abstract law is translated into operational policy at the local level of implementation.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombus CT {{characteristics}} {{might be}} useful for patient selection for intra-arterial treatment. Our objective was to study the association of thrombus CT characteristics with outcome and treatment effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 199 patients for whom thin-section NCCT and CTA within 30 minutes from each other were available in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) study. We assessed the following thrombus characteristics: location, distance from ICA terminus to thrombus, length, volume, absolute and relative density on NCCT, and <b>perviousness.</b> Associations of thrombus characteristics with outcome were estimated with univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression as an OR for a shift toward better outcome on the mRS. Interaction terms were used to investigate treatment-effect modification by thrombus characteristics. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, only {{the distance from the}} ICA terminus to the thrombus, length of > 8 mm, and <b>perviousness</b> were associated with functional outcome. Relative thrombus density on CTA was independently associated with functional outcome with an adjusted common OR of 1. 21 per 10 % (95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 43; P =. 029). There was no treatment-effect modification by any of the thrombus CT characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In our study on patients with large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation, CT thrombus characteristics appear useful for predicting functional outcome. However, in our study cohort, the effect of intra-arterial treatment was independent of the thrombus CT characteristics.

We hypothesize that thrombus permeability estimated from radiological imaging is associated with improved recanalization after treatment with intravenously administered r-tPA (r-tPA) and with better functional outcome. METHODS: We assessed thrombus attenuation increase (TAI) in patients from the Dutch Acute Stroke Study with an occlusion of an intracranial artery on computed tomographic angiography. Patients were included within 9 hours after the stroke onset. After dichotomization of TAI as pervious or impervious, logistic regressions analyses were performed to estimate associations of intravenous r-tPA therapy with complete recanalization and with favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of /= 23 HU. In patients with a pervious thrombus, complete recanalization was more frequent after treatment with intravenous r-tPA than after conservative treatment (odds ratio, 6. 26; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 4 - 16. 8; P< 0. 001). In patients with an impervious thrombus, the effect of intravenous r-tPA was not significant (odds ratio, 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 5 - 4. 1; P= 0. 47).

Nevertheless, these databases provide a general classification and may not suit some specific (often new) applications requiring a semantic or geometric finer level of details. That is to say that, on one hand, additional land cover classes should sometimes be specified, whereas, on the other hand, some existing classes should be delineated at a finer level.

Vehicle or H 2 O 2 (0. 1 and 0. 5 M) was superfused onto the tracheobronchial mucosal surface through an oro-tracheal catheter. 125 I-albumin, given intravenously, was determined in tracheobronchial tissue and in lavage fluids 10 min after challenge as an index of mucosal exudation of plasma. The tracheobronchial mucosa was also examined by scanning electron microscopy. In separate animals, 99 mTc-DTPA was superfused 20 min after vehicle or H 2 O 2 (0. 1 and 0. 5 M) had been given. A gamma camera determined the disappearance rate of 99 mTc-DTPA from the airways as an index of airway absorption. The high dose of H 2 O 2 (0. 5 M) produced epithelial damage, increased the absorption of 99 mTc-DTPA (P < 0. 001), and increased the exudation of plasma (P < 0. 001). Notably, it appeared that all extravasated plasma had entered the airway lumen within 10 min. These data demonstrate that H 2 O 2 differs from exudative autacoids such as histamine by causing both epithelial damage and plasma exudation responses.

Cet article traite plus spécifiquement du {{comportement}} du bâti africain vis à vis des écoulements, en situation inondante, et des lois de stockage et de vidange que l'on peut définir à différentes échelles représentatives de l'habitat : concession, bloc de concessions. Nous présentons trois propriétés du bâti nécessaires et suffisantes pour décrire le comportement hydraulique du milieu à ces échelles : sa pénétrabilité, sa stockabilité et sa transmissivité. L'étude du comportement hydraulique de l'objet bâti élémentaire, la concession, nous {{permet de}} relier ces propriétés à des caractéristiques géométriques de cet objet. Une approche agrégative conduit ensuite à définir un indicateur de la structure géométrique du bâti, l'HistoSeuil, équivalent à une densité d'ouvertures et caractéristique de la pénétrabilité du bâti. L'étude de sa pertinence géométrique, i. e. sa variabilité intra- et inter-quartiers a été réalisée dans le cas particulier de la ville de Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso); elle est basée sur le relevé systématique des ouvertures observables sur différentes façades de voiries de trois quartiers de types différents, (habitat individuel et spontané). Sa pertinence hydraulique, i. e. sa capacité à reproduire le comportement hydraulique moyen de l'objet urbain modélisé, est enfin abordée. Développée dans le contexte particulier de Ouagadougou, cette approche est généralisable à des configurations urbaines très diverses. Stormwater runoff generates {{one of the}} most critical natural risks in urban environments: impervious surfaces and high drainage network densities lead to frequent urban flooding events, with short process times and within small urban areas. In all parts of the world, urbanisation is growing, and urban flood hazards consequently occur more and more frequently. Examples of important flood damages suffered by urban populations are numerous, especially in tropical regions where the violence and rapidity of tropical storms often lead to an overloading of the drainage system and to the flooding of adjacent built-up areas. Prediction and evaluation of these damages require the determination of some important hydraulic characteristics of the flood, such as maximum water depth or flooding duration. Currently-used models are generally limited to checking the sewer system efficiency. Therefore new models are now expected to represent with accuracy and reliability the stormwater runoff, which can result from sewer system overloading. However, this kind of modelling is hard to carry out because of the geometric complexity of the urban media and because of the rapidity of urban storms and their associated flooding. Moreover, the modelling of the behaviour of the flooded built-up areas should sometimes be integrated into complete models of urban flooding, given their important influence on the hydrodynamics of the flood. However the geometric complexity of these built-up areas prevents us from a complete and accurate description of the different obstacles and water ways encompassed in such areas. Simplified descriptions at a larger scale are consequently to be found. This paper highlights the important physical characteristics that determine the hydraulic behaviour of every hydraulically-independent urban cell, and suggests a way to represent the exchange and storage laws of built-up areas at different scales: individual plots and blocks of plots. The study was performed in the particular case of Ouagadougou's areas. The hydraulic behaviour of every built-up area can be modelled with three important physical characteristics, the two first of which are related to the structure of the surrounding walls:- water perviousness : the ease with which the passing flood can enter or exit the plot. This is dependent upon the aperture density, which can vary according to the façade;- transmissivity: the ease with which water can pass through the plot. It depends on the <b>perviousness</b> of the different external or internal façades of the individual plot. If one façade is waterproof, the transmissivity becomes nil in the perpendicular direction;- storativity : determined with the storage capacity of an individual plot. It is a function of the internal surface area of the plot. These three characteristics are functions of height. Moreover, they are essential and sufficient to describe the behaviour of every basic or global urban object (plot, block of plots [...] .). At the "block of plots" level, the transmissivity and storativity concepts are comparable to the hydraulic roughness and urban porosity concepts that have already been proposed in scientific papers (e. g., Braschi et al. 1991). These two characteristics are sufficient for modelling the hydraulic behaviour of every open urban medium. Nevertheless, some urban media are non-transmissive because of a high connection level between the different obstacles. In these cases the <b>perviousness</b> property is very useful for modelling the different exchanges between the built-up areas and the adjacent flooded roads. The residential urban areas of Ouagadougou, used as an illustration for this study (Figure 1), correspond to this case of partitioned urban areas. The structure of the Ouagadougou's residential districts is standard and is organised around the individual plot, a parcel shielding one or several families: the individual plot is isolated from other plots and from the roads by a surrounding wall that constitutes one of the elementary hydraulic objects of the urban environment. The evolution of the flood water depth in a plot adjacent to a flooded road, determined by equation 1, depends on its floodable surface Sc and on its <b>perviousness.</b> Its <b>perviousness</b> is defined by the geometric characteristics of the apertures present in the wall: the type of aperture, weir or orifice; its height, hs, its length, Ls, and its opening if an orifice, a. Measures of exchanges between roads and plots made during some flood events in Ouagadougou (Hingray 1999) showed that the classical discharge laws for weirs or trough orifices can be used to model these exchanges (equations 2, 3 and 4). We suggest a way to simulate the exchange and storage laws of these built-up areas at a larger scale: the block of plots. An aggregation approach enables us to define a structure indicator: " l'HistoSeuil " (Figure 2). It is based on the description of the lengths of weirs and apertures found in road façades, and is equivalent to an aperture density function. The exchange discharge between the block of plots and the flooded adjacent road can be computed with a simply convolution (equation 6) between this HistoSeuil and the reference discharge laws for broad-crested weirs (equations 7 and 8). The geometric relevance of the indicator is next discussed: it seems to be a relatively stable geometric characteristic of an urban area (Figure 3). This result is given by a systematic survey of the apertures observed in 24 road façades belonging to 3 different districts of Ouagadougou. The two first are traditional residential districts, more and less developed. The "Patte d'Oie" district is fairly old and was established in the 1970 's (numerous well developed plots). The second one (Wemtenga 1) is a recent housing estate (1988) (numerous unfinished or empty plots). The final one (Wemtenga 2) is a very recent district of spontaneous development (disorganised built-up area structure). Furthermore, the hydraulic relevance of this indicator, its ability to reproduce the average hydraulic behaviour of a block of plots, is approached. Initial results seem to be positive. If both the hydraulic and geometric relevance of the structure indicator presented in this paper are validated by the additional work that we are carrying out at this present time, this approach may prove to be useful for the hydraulic modelling of built-up areas. Moreover the study of other types of built-up areas could lead to the determination of a hydraulic typology of urban areas. In particular, this study, performed in the case of Ouagadougou, a big city in a developing country, seems to be valid for every city where the built-up areas are highly partitioned...|$|E
40|$|Preclinical {{studies showed}} that {{thrombus}} permeability improves recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) efficacy. We hypothesize that thrombus permeability estimated from radiological imaging is associated with improved recanalization after treatment with intravenously administered r-tPA (r-tPA) and with better functional outcome. We assessed thrombus attenuation increase (TAI) in patients from the Dutch Acute Stroke Study with an occlusion of an intracranial artery on computed tomographic angiography. Patients were included within 9 hours after the stroke onset. After dichotomization of TAI as pervious or impervious, logistic regressions analyses were performed to estimate associations of intravenous r-tPA therapy with complete recanalization and with favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 2). Three hundred eight patients matched the inclusion criteria. The median TAI was 20. 1 (interquartile range, 8. 5 - 37. 8) Hounsfield unit (HU). We found {{a significant increase in}} the odds of complete recanalization with increasing TAI for patients treated with intravenous r-tPA (P= 0. 030). One hundred thirty-one (42 %) thrombi were classified as pervious with TAI of ≥ 23 HU. In patients with a pervious thrombus, complete recanalization was more frequent after treatment with intravenous r-tPA than after conservative treatment (odds ratio, 6. 26; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 4 - 16. 8; P < 0. 001). In patients with an impervious thrombus, the effect of intravenous r-tPA was not significant (odds ratio, 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 5 - 4. 1; P= 0. 47). Favorable outcome was more common in patients with a pervious thrombi than without (odds ratio, 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 3. 4; P= 0. 001).

40|$|This work aims at {{presenting}} some {{hypotheses about}} the potential neurobiological substrate of imagery and imagination. For the present purposes, we will define imagery as the production of mental images associated with previous percepts, and imagination as the faculty of forming mental images of a novel character relating to something {{that has never been}} actually experienced by the subject but at a great extent emerges from his inner world. The two processes appear intimately related and imagery can arguably be considered as one of the main components of imagination. In this proposal, we argue that exaptation and redeployment, two basic concepts capturing important aspects of the evolution of biological structures and functions (Anderson 2007), could also be useful in explaining imagery and imagination. As far as imagery is concerned it is proposed that neural structures originally implicated in performing certain functions, e. g. motor actions, can be reused for the imagery of the virtual execution of that function. As far as imagination is concerned we speculate that it can be the result of a tinkering that combines and modifies stored perceptual information and concepts leading to the creation of novel mental objects that are shaped by the subject peculiar inner world. Hence it is related to his self-awareness. The neurobiological substrate of the tinkering process could be found in a hierarchical model of the brain characterized by a multiplicity of functional modules (FMs) that can be assembled according to different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it is surmised that a possible mechanism for the emergence of imagination could be represented by modulatory mechanisms controlling the <b>perviousness</b> of modifiers along the communication channels within and between FMs leading to their dynamically reassembling into novel configurations...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} explores multiple {{facets of}} a green infrastructure planning framework for climate change adaptation in urban regions. The research is organized in three distinct, but related parts. The first develops an adaptation implementation model based on triggering conditions rather than time. The approach responds to policy makers 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to engage in adaptation planning due to uncertain future conditions. The model is based on planning and adaptation literature and applied to two case studies. Uncertainty during implementation may be reduced by incremental and flexible policy implementation, disbursing investments as needs arise, monitoring conditions, and organizing adaptation measures along no-regrets to transformational measures. The second part develops the green infrastructure transect as an organizational framework for mainstreaming adaptation planning policies. The framework integrates multi-scalar and context aspects of green infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration of policy. The framework integrates literature from urban and landscape planning and tested on Boston. Prioritization of adaptation measures depends on location. Results suggest that green infrastructure adaptation policies should respond to configuration of zones. Cross jurisdiction coordination at regional and parcel scales supports mainstreaming. A secondary conclusion suggests that green infrastructure is space intensive and becomes {{the basis of the}} empirical study in part three. A spatial assessment method is introduced to formulate opportunities for green infrastructure network implementation within land-uses and across an urban-rural gradient. Spatial data in GIS for Boston is utilized to develop a percent pervious metric allowing the characterization of the study area into six zones of varying <b>perviousness.</b> Opportunities across land uses were assessed then maximum space opportunities were defined based on conservation, intensification, transformation and expansion. The opportunities for transformation of impervious surfaces to vegetal surfaces are highest in the urban center and its surrounding. Intensification of vegetation on pervious surfaces along all land uses is high across the gradient. Conservation of existing forested land is significant for future climate proofing. The concluding section argues for a green infrastructure planning framework for adaptation based on integration into existing infrastructural bodies, regional vision, incremental implementation, ecosystem benefits accounting, and conditions based planning rather than time based. ...|$|E

The tiltmeter are 15 m long and buried in trenches {{at a depth of}} 2. 2 m. The strain is measured by a Sacks-Evertson dilatometer cemented in a borehole at a depth of 146 m, with a few 10 - 10 resolution at short period. A 1 h-lasting, 1, 5 (10 - 7 strain transient has been recorded on the dilatometer, related to a seismic swarm that occurred 15 km away. This anomaly was not observed, by neither the tiltmeters, nor by a large band seismometer (CMG 3), nor by some piezometers probably {{because of a lack of}} resolution of these instruments present in the Gulf. At this time, the resolution of the tiltmeters was only 10 - 8 rad, due to a <b>perviousness</b> in the presence of wind. Despite this, we have observed tidal waves with an amplitude of 10 - 7 rad. Since mid-April 2003, we have improved the resolution by a factor of 10 to 10 - 9 rad, wich is confirmed by the detection of deformations produced by the free oscillations of the Gulf, with an amplitude of 2 x 10 - 9 rad and period ranging between 8 and 40 minutes. We can also see these small deformations on the dilatometer.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar em eqüinos a aplicabilidade da trombectomia com cateter de Fogarty, técnica rotineiramente empregada pela medicina humana, no restabelecimento da perviedade vascular. Foram utilizados 10 eqüinos divididos em dois grupos de cinco animais, em que se induziu a trombose da veia jugular direita, através do acesso cirúrgico à veia e aplicação de sutura estenosante e injeção de glicose a 50 %. No grupo controle avaliou-se a evolução da tromboflebite sem qualquer tipo de intervenção terapêutica. Os animais do grupo tratado foram submetidos à trombectomia com cateter de Fogarty. Foram avaliados os parâmetros clínicos gerais, regionais, ultra-sonográficos e angiográficos, nos momentos pré-indução (M-PRÉ), indução da trombose (MTI) e 10 dias de evolução da trombose (M 10). A técnica empregada induziu a tromboflebite, que obstruiu completamente um segmento da veia jugular de todos os animais. Os animais do grupo controle mantiveram os trombos obstruindo totalmente o lume vascular até o final do período de avaliação, sendo que avaliações regionais mostraram principalmente o edema parotídeo e o ingurgitamento vascular, cranial à tromboflebite da veia jugular. O grupo tratado apresentou as veias jugulares pérvias ao final do experimento, confirmadas pelos exames ultra-sonográficos e angiográficos, com remissão total dos sinais clínicos. Concluiu-se que a técnica da trombectomia com cateter de Fogarty foi eficiente na desobstrução da veia jugular submetida à trombose experimental.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of the thrombectomy with Fogarty's catheter in horses. This technique is routinely used in medicine, in the reestablishment of the vascular <b>perviousness.</b> Ten horses were allocated in two groups (five animals each) and induced to an unilateral thrombosis of right jugular vein, through the surgical access and an application of stenotic suture and glucose 50 % injection. In the control group evolution of the thrombophlebitis without any therapeutical intervention was evaluated. The animals of the treatment group were submitted to the thrombectomy with Fogarty's catheter. General clinical parameters were analyzed at the moment of the preinduction (MPRE), induction of thrombosis (MTI), and at the 10 th day of thrombosis evolution (M 10). The procedure induced thrombophlebitis that completely obstructed a segment of the jugular vein in all animals. In the animals of the control group, the thrombus totally obstructed the vascular lumen until the end of the period of evaluation, and parotid edema and vascular dilated, cranial to the thrombophlebitis of jugular vein were observed. The treatment group presented all veins pervious in the end of the experiment, with total remission of the clinical signs, confirmed by angiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. So far, it was concluded that the technique of thrombectomy with Fogarty's catheter was effective in removal of the thrombosis obstruction experimentally induced in the jugular vein...|$|E
40|$|Predictions {{from the}} Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI 2014 a) show that high {{temperatures}} and heat waves will occur {{more frequently in}} the future. Warm weather leads to even higher temperatures in the city, because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This is not without risks, since heat can affect the health of people. Especially among elderly, poor, and minorities many extra deaths are reported because of heat. Heat does not only {{have a negative effect}} on people, but also on the economy and environment of a city. When the UHI effect is present, there is a temperature difference between the city and its surroundings. This is caused by the structure of the city, in which five characteristics play an important role. Together the amount of shadow, reflection (albedo value), <b>perviousness,</b> openness to the sky (sky-view factor), and fraction of vegetation/water, determine whether a city retains much heat or not. Since these heat related characteristics can be measured, an indication can be given of how heat proof a certain area is. Also, measuring these characteristics can give insight in how effective an adaptation strategy to heat can be. This is done in a case comparison for two locations in the cities of Antwerp, London and Copenhagen. In this case comparison, the heat related characteristics are estimated for before and after a given development. From the comparison of these results, it has become clear that interventions on a small scale and large scale both can have a positive effect on the local environment. The existing body of knowledge on adapting to the UHI effect, shows a gap in how to integrate adaptation strategies into urban design. Therefore, design elements are used in this graduation project to make this integration possible. The design elements combine the heat characteristics and adaptation measures, which can become part of a design. This leads to a design that is both good for the city and against heat. The mentioned design elements are described in a pattern language. The pattern language focuses on adaptation to heat, and is generically applicable in (Dutch) cities. In the Netherlands the UHI effect occurs in many cities, from which Rotterdam shows one of the largest temperature differences. The air temperature difference can be up to 8 °C (Heusinkveld et al. 2010), while the surface temperature difference is 4, 9 °C (E. J. Klok et al. 2012). When looking closer at the temperatures, it becomes clear that the UHI effect of Rotterdam is mainly present in the central, western and southern part of the city. Two neighbourhoods in this area, called Bospolder-Tussendijken and Cool, are chosen as design locations for the implementation of the patterns. They both are vulnerable to heat, but in a different way. In Bospolder-Tussendijken there are many young children, and it is a poor neighbourhood with a weak social cohesion. In Cool we can find many working people, who are influenced by heat in terms of labour productivity. The developed patterns are implemented as test cases in urban designs for Bospolder-Tussendijken and Cool. It has become clear that focusing on the weaker heat related characteristics of the design location, has more effect than implementing patterns without focus on specific characteristics. Furthermore, it is not important how many patterns are used in a design, but the fraction of implementation should be as large as possible. Integrating adaptation strategies against heat in urban design, with the use of patterns, helps to create spots in the urban environment where people can cool down.

40|$|In New Zealand the {{prevalence}} of stroke in children is extremely rare. Medical specialists and health care practitioners possess a knowledge, whilst their patients possess a specific knowledge acquired {{over the course of}} their illness. The patient’s voice needs to be heard without the arbitration of a medical discourse. It is essential that a discursive space is found for the vocalization of the stories bound up within the statistics, facts and figures of the medical narrative. But how? I respond to this by blending our personal stories with academic writing in order to explore an adolescent’s experience of stroke, and our lives which have been interrupted by chronic illness, and disability. I adopt collaborative autoethnography as a methodology for this research. Collaborative autoethnography offers a valuable vehicle when writing about illness as it allows for the creation of multiple spaces. As the researcher, I am the observed and observer, the narrator and narrated, I am an insider as well as an outsider, I am both believer and non- believer, doubted and doubter. I am able to occupy these and inbetween spaces. This diversity affords me the opportunity to create a discursive space to explore the problematics of representation. I am also able to develop alternative ways of storytelling so that I may capture the deeply complex, nuanced and dynamic experiences of chronic illness and disability. As a feminist engaging with autoethnography’s somewhat postmodernist flavour I have finally been able to tell my story and conceptualise my experiences. Previously I had been unable to articulate my story as I did not truly understand my story due to traditional medical knowledge not allowing a space for placing it authentically within my understanding. This research tackles how the researcher mother can capture both hers and her son’s story, whilst also reflexively revealing the experiences of chronic illness and disability. Furthermore, can this type of research be undertaken ethically? Where does my story end and his begin? How do I voice my son’s story? Is he the hero, the survivor, the disabled, the victim, the triumphant, or other? How am I positioned as the woman, the mother, and the chronically ill patient? Are we well or are we afflicted, and which spaces do we occupy? If we oscillate between the two how do I describe where we reside? Do we stay in the frightening no-man’s land or do we move between spaces with an acceptance that there are no absolutes or certainties? And if so, is this not dissimilar to the life journey that all people travel? This research tackles an array of questions; however it is also aimed at raising consciousness that within the state of chronic illness and disability alternative voices and spaces can be found. Moreover, these stories serve as both an academic tool and as a political protest performance by challenging conventional thinking and the medical paradigm which appears at times, paralysed. This work illustrates that although writing stories about chronic illness and disability is deeply nuanced and complex, viewing chronic illness and disability as a fluid concept not bound within a Cartesian dualism of socially constructed norms of illness and health, and normal and abnormal is crucial. This notion proposes an extension beyond traditional binary epistemologies, and suggests a <b>perviousness</b> between bodies, an interconnectedness of other, both within and with other. This idea includes the essential relationship between the embodied subject and their world, and that an individual may hold dual citizenship as they develop in the world with others...|$|E
40|$|Stormwater {{management}} is required due to development and alteration {{of the natural}} environment. It is heavily regulated in Florida and at the national level. Over the last two decades, Low Impact Development (LID) has been promoted as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method of controlling urban runoff. Case studies, provided in Chapter 2, show that LIDs can restore watershed hydrology by balancing the water budget. The difference in runoff between pre-development and post-development appears to increase with soil <b>perviousness.</b> However, the potential for mitigating the impacts of urbanization through runoff reduction is also greater for pervious, sandy soils that dominate central and south Florida. A greater potential for urbanization mitigation in Florida’s highly pervious soils initiates more research in quantifying the benefits of LID. Southwest Florida is currently in its infancy when adopting LID on a broad-scale; however, several municipalities {{are in the process}} of incorporating LID into their stormwater management programs. Low Impact Development includes non-structural practices such as minimal site disturbance and maintenance of natural flow patterns as well as structural practices. There are numerous structural LID practices such as rain barrels, bioretention systems, infiltration trenches, green roofs, and pervious pavement. Structural LIDs can be divided into comparison categories such as low capital cost and high capital cost as well as rainwater harvesting and infiltration- based. Low capital cost options include rain gardens, which can range from $ 4. 00 to $ 10. 00 per cubic foot of runoff volume whereas high capital cost options include pervious pavements and green roofs, which can range from $ 120. 00 and $ 225. 00 - $ 360. 00 per cubic foot of runoff volume, respectively. Given the order of magnitude difference in cost between the low capital cost and the high capital cost LIDs, the focus of this thesis will be on those practices which require a low initial capital investment. Additionally, the low-cost options are further divided into two categories, rainwater harvesting LIDs and infiltration-based LIDs. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a LID practice that attenuates peak flow during wet weather events and reduces potable water demand for uses that would not normally require water of potable quality. The two options for RWH are rain barrels and cisterns. The difference between the two is a matter of scale. Rain barrels are typically implemented in one or more barrels with a volume of approximately 55 -gallons, where as cistern volumes start at the hundreds of gallons. Effective RWH design includes long-term supply and demand as well as physical site considerations. Southwest Florida’s climate pattern is not compatible with rain barrels for runoff reduction due to their small volume; however, they still offer modest potable water savings to homeowners. Given the type, duration, and frequency of storm events, cisterns can offer runoff reduction as well as reducing potable water demand. For example, in Tampa, Florida, to achieve approximately 70 % catchment efficiency, an average sized home would need approximately fourteen 55 -gallon rain barrels or a 750 -gallon cistern. Conversely, for a single 50 -gallon rain barrel that serves outdoor use only, the water-saving efficiency is about 10 % for Tampa. When properly designed, infiltration-based LIDs mitigate groundwater disruptions that result from urbanization such as minimizing receiving water body hydromodifications, such as stream bank erosion, and reducing pollutant discharges to surface waters. Infiltration-based LIDs include systems such as bioretention, level spreaders, drywells, and “pocket” practices i. e. pocket wetlands. Infiltration-based LIDs may be wet or dry systems and rely on easily attainable construction materials such as gravel, sand, and native vegetation. This combination may have applicability in Florida due to flat slopes, sandy soils, and areas with occasionally high seasonal water table. National standards for LID design should be considered guidelines and adapted accordingly to regional conditions in Southwest Florida. It is possible to utilize any number of LIDs, though one of the key factors to success is proper knowledge of the seasonally high water table, especially along the coast line. Additional factors to ensure infiltration-based LID success include installing a pre-treatment filter strip, standardized infiltration rate testing, standardized materials specifications, proper sequence of construction, and diligent construction inspections during and following construction. The prospect of increased LID implementation within Southwest Florida appears promising. Municipalities are actively incorporating LID into their stormwater management recommendations. A behavioral study and interviews with staff from local governments regarding LID was conducted. The results indicate that Southwest Florida is facing many of the same barriers to implementation as other communities across the nation. These include lack of knowledge and education, lack of regionally specific design guidelines, and few “real world” pilot projects. Based on the behavioral study, it appears education could be the strongest key to LID acceptance. Over the course of three months in a graduate level urban hydrology course, opinions regarding LID in Southwest Florida went from not possible to positively inquiring how to increase implementation. Since the region faces most of the same barriers to implementation, it may be possible to use other cities’ methods to increase LID acceptance and implementation as a template while modifying them so they are regionally appropriate. A mnemonic device entitled “Let’s Make LIDs RADD” was created to assist engineers in implementing successful LIDs. Where “R” represents site reconnaissance, “A” stands for choosing the appropriate LID given the site conditions, the first “D” denotes conducting a drainage investigation, and the second “D” corresponds with finalizing the LID design based on the information gathered after conducting all previous acronym activities...|$|E
