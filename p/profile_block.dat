Approaches rely on constituent profiling, identification of known constituents, or <b>block</b> <b>profiling</b> (functional <b>blocks),</b> if no known constituent can be identified. Our proposed approach for NER characterisation can only be applied for ‘identified constituents’ generally based on the application of isotope labelled compounds. In a broader sense, {{it may also be}} applied to mixtures and substances of unknown composition as long as known compounds or constituent blocks, or the compounds of most critical concern can be identified. If the most critical constituent can be identified, the general suggested approach of NER characterisation is valid.

If only the ‘whole substance approach’ is applicable without supply of any labelled compound, the NER cannot be quantified.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic binary translators use a {{two-phase}} {{approach to}} identify and optimize frequently executed code dynamically. In the first step (<b>profiling</b> phase), <b>blocks</b> of code are interpreted or quickly translated to collect execution frequency information for the blocks. In the second phase (optimization phase), frequently executed blocks are grouped into regions and advanced optimizations are applied on them. This approach implicitly assumes that the initial <b>profile</b> of each <b>block</b> {{is representative of the}} block throughout its lifetime. This study investigates the ability of the initial profile to predict the average program behavior. We compare the predicted behavior of varying lengths of the initial execution with the average program behavior for the whole program execution, and use the prediction from the training input as the reference. Our result indicates that, for the SPEC 2000 benchmarks, even very short initial profiles have comparable prediction accuracy to the traditional profile-guided optimizations using the training input, although the initial profile is inadequate for predicting loop trip count information for some integer programs and several benchmarks can benefit from phase-awareness during dynamic binary translation. 1...|$|R

However, {{different types of}} DCs, such as blood myeloid DCs and skin Langerhans cells, exhibit distinct patterns of CD 1 a, CD 1 b, CD 1 c, and CD 1 d expression. The regulation of such differences is incompletely understood. Here, we initially observed that monocyte-derived DCs cultured in an immunoglobulin-rich milieu expressed CD 1 d but not CD 1 a, CD 1 b, and CD 1 c, whereas DCs cultured {{in the presence of}} low levels of immunoglobulins had an opposite CD 1 profile.

Mice received 200 H. polygyrus larvae and were studied 2 weeks later. Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were isolated from the terminal ileum for analysis and in vitro experiments. Mice with H. polygyrus were resistant to trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced colitis, a Th 1 cytokine-dependent inflammation. Heligmosomoides polygyrus did not change the normal microscopic appearance of the terminal ileum and colon and minimally affected LPMC composition. However, colonization altered LPMC cytokine <b>profiles,</b> <b>blocking</b> gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin 12 (IL- 12) p 40 release but promoting IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13, and IL- 10 secretion. IL- 10 blockade in vitro with anti-IL- 10 receptor (IL- 10 R) monoclonal antibody restored LPMC IFN-γ and IL- 12 p 40 secretion. IL- 10 blockade in vivo worsened TNBS colitis in H. polygyrus-colonized mice. Lamina propria CD 4 + T cells isolated from colonized mice inhibited IFN-γ production by splenic T cells from worm-free mice. This inhibition did not require cell contact and was dependent on IL- 10. Heligmosomoides polygyrus colonization inhibits Th 1 and promotes Th 2 and regulatory cytokine production in distant intestinal regions without changing histology or LPMC composition. IL- 10 is particularly important for limiting the Th 1 response. The T-cell origin of these cytokines demonstrates mucosal regulatory T-cell induction...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of {{transistors}} integrated on a chip continues to increase, a growing challenge is accurately modeling per-formance {{in the early stages}} of processor design. Analytical models have been employed to rapidly search for higher performance designs, and can provide insights that detailed simulators may not. This paper proposes techniques to predict the impact of pending cache hits, hardware prefetching, and realistic miss status holding register (MSHR) resources on superscalar performance in the presence of long latency memory systems when employing hybrid analytical models that apply instruction trace analysis. Pending cache hits are secondary references to a cache block for which a request has already been initiated but has not yet completed. We find pending hits resulting from spatial locality and the fine-grained selection of instruction <b>profile</b> window <b>blocks</b> used for analysis both have non-negligible influences on the accuracy of hybrid analytical models and subsequently propose techniques to account for their effects. We then introduce techniques to estimate the performance impact of data prefetching by modeling the timeliness of prefetches and to account for a limited number of MSHRs by restricting the size of <b>profile</b> window <b>blocks.</b> As with earlier hybrid analytical models, our approach is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than detailed simulations. When modeling pending hits for a processor with unlimited outstanding misses we improve the accuracy of our baseline by a factor of 3. 9, decreasing average error from 39. 7 % to 10. 3 %. When modeling a processor with data prefetching, a limited number of MSHRs, or both, the techniques result in an average error of 13. 8 %, 9. 5 % and 17. 8 %, respectively. 1...|$|R

Implemented in a 90 -nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), the generator consists of two low-noise voltage-controlled ring oscillators (VCOs) and an adder. It can generate a single-or two-tone signal {{in a range of}} 0. 9 - 5. 6 GHz with a tone spacing of 3 MHz to 4. 5 GHz and adjustable output power. The VCOs are based on symmetrically loaded double-differential delay line architecture. The measured phase noise is - 80 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 1 MHz for the oscillation frequency of 2. 4 GHz. A single VCO consumes 26 mW at 1 GHz while providing - 10 -dBm power into a 50 -Omega load. The silicon area of the complete test circuit including coupling capacitors is only 0. 03 mm(2), while a single VCO occupies 0. 012 mm(2). The measured gain, 1 -dB CP, and <b>blocking</b> <b>profile</b> of the wideband receiver using the on-chip stimulus generator are within +/- 8 %, +/- 10 %, and +/- 18 % of their actual values, respectively.

30|$|In {{relation}} to the high ground water salinity levels {{in the region as}} reported by Monjerezi et al. (2011), the general deceasing trends of the soil salinity <b>profiles</b> in <b>blocks</b> C, D, J, P, N and W depicted no intrusion of salts into upper soil layers as a result of capillary rise from the ground water. This was further confirmed by the deep observed water table depths of ≥  2  m at the three sites. The source of high salt accumulation in the upper soil layers in the aforementioned blocks could therefore not be attributed to the groundwater intrusion in the root-zone depth. Instead, the decreasing trends of soil salinity profiles could largely be attributed to the inadequacy of leaching of salts to deeper soil layers. On the contrary, the increasing soil salinity trends with soil depths particularly in blocks A and B, could be attributed to leaching of salts to deeper soil layers, though not adequate.|$|R

[...] 1 pageThe {{combined}} wide-angle reflection-refraction and multi-channel seismic (MCS) experiment, Galicia 3 D, {{was carried}} out in 2013 at the Galicia rifted margin in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, west of Spain. The main geological features within the 64 by 20 km (1280 km 2) 3 D box investigated by the survey are the peridotite ridge (PR), the fault bounded, rotated basement blocks and the S reflector, which has been interpreted to be a low angle detachment fault. 44 short period four-component ocean bottom seismometers and 28 ocean bottom hydrophones were deployed in the 3 D box. 3 D MCS profiles sampling the whole box were acquired with two airgun arrays of 3300 cu. in. fired alternately every 37. 5 m. We present the results from 3 D first-arrival time tomography that constrains the P-wave velocity in the 3 D box, for the entire depth sampled by reflection data. Results are validated by synthetic tests and by the comparison with Galicia 3 D MCS lines. The main outcomes are as follows: 1 - The 3. 5 km/s iso-velocity contour mimics the top of the acoustic basement observed on MCS <b>profiles.</b> <b>Block</b> bounding faults are imaged as velocity contrasts and basement blocks exhibit 3 D topographic variations. 2 - On the southern profiles, the top of the PR rises up to 5. 5 km depth whereas, 20 km northward, its basement expression (at 6. 5 km depth) nearly disappears. 3 - The 6. 5 km/s iso-velocity contour matches the topography of the S reflector where the latter is visible on MCS profiles. Within a depth interval of 0. 6 km (in average), velocities beneath the S reflector increase from 6. 5 km/s to 7 km/s, which would correspond to a decrease in the degree of serpentinization from ~ 45 % to ~ 30 % if these velocity variations are caused solely by variations in hydration.
