Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were [...] "concerned with their personal agendas". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. The election {{was described as a}} referendum on Narendra Modi.|$|E
500|$|Trump's {{announcement}} made way for {{the anticipated}} Buchanan–Trump primary contest with Buchanan himself moving closer to mounting a Reform Party bid. [...] Buchanan announced he would decide whether to join the race by late October. A Schroth and Associates poll of 500 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Perot in 1996, showed Buchanan with a slight edge over Trump, 32 percent to 29 percent. Though Ventura wished to prevent a Buchanan nomination, he did not publicly endorse Trump. [...] Some of Ventura's advisers were skeptical of Trump's campaign and wanted Ventura to leave the party if a Buchanan nomination appeared imminent. [...] Ventura's place in the party had become a subject of controversy. [...] Chairman Verney asked Ventura to leave the party in early October after Ventura commented in a Playboy interview that [...] "organized religion is a sham and a crutch." [...] Perot also decided not to make an endorsement during the primary campaign, despite Buchanan's plea that Perot publicly support his entrance into the race.|$|E
500|$|Piłsudski's regime began {{a period}} of {{national}} stabilization and of improvement in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed {{about a third of}} the Second Republic's population. Piłsudski replaced the National Democrats' [...] "ethnic-assimilation" [...] with a [...] "state-assimilation" [...] policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state. Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' antisemitic policies, he extended his policy of [...] "state-assimilation" [...] to Polish Jews. The years 1926–35, and Piłsudski himself, were favorably viewed by many Polish Jews whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel. Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> him and actively participated in his political bloc. Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.|$|E

40|$|Most {{candidates}} for federal elections hold values on {{economic and social}} questions that are unlike those of most voters. However, Coalition candidates are {{much closer to the}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> them than Labor candidates are to Labor voters. Labor’s electoral base is divided between {{a relatively small number of}} new-class social professionals and a relatively large number of people in traditional working-class occupations. These two groups often hold different values on political questions, such as border control, the size of the immigration program, cultural pluralism and so on. Labor candidates in federal elections are more likely to sympathise with the social professionals’ values than with those of their traditional supporters...|$|R

5000|$|The Linear Position Model {{attempts}} {{to predict how}} strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote. In this model, a graph is used to display {{the relationship between the}} number of people <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> the party and the consistency of the issue position. The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal amount of people <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, [...] "X" [...] represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party.|$|R

Co-leader Vital Rymasheuski stated, [...] " [...] {{we believe that the}} laws of the Republic of Belarus should not be contrary to biblical law, and vice versa". [...] Regarding geo-political orientation Co-leader Pavel Sevarinets stated that the party was not seeking pro-Europeans but rather Christians wanting a moral revival. [...] "In Western Europe, there are a set of traditions almost without regard to the Bible and Christianity. It is not Christian believers who make up the bulk of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Christian Democrats.

2500|$|After the 2008 {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media.

2500|$|Bjelke-Petersen's Country (later National) Party {{controlled}} Queensland despite consistently {{receiving the}} smallest {{number of votes}} out of the state's leading three parties, achieving the result through a notorious system of electoral malapportionment that resulted in rural votes having a greater value than those cast in city electorates. The effect earned Bjelke-Petersen the nickname of [...] "the Hillbilly Dictator". Yet he was a highly popular figure among conservative voters and {{over the course of}} his 19 years as premier he tripled the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> his party and doubled the party's percentage vote, reducing his Liberal coalition partners to a mere six seats in the 1983 election. In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen launched a campaign to move into federal politics to become prime minister, though the campaign was eventually aborted.|$|E
2500|$|At local level, the BNP {{continued}} {{to improve on}} its electoral results in 2002—03, gaining council seats in Blackburn, Calderdale and Burnley, despite an extensive opposition campaign. This success led to {{a large number of}} the National Democrats party, including Simon Darby and Martin Wingfield defecting to the British National Party from 1999 to 2003. After the 2004 elections, the BBC and Searchlight created a documentary called The Secret Agent, featuring Jason Gwynne infiltrating the BNP. In it, Griffin and Mark Collett made comments critical of Islam. Following the documentary, Barclays Bank froze the party's accounts. Collett and Griffin were acquitted on charges of incitement to racial hatred in 2006. The BNP branded the BBC [...] "cockroaches". In Burnley, the BNP lost one of its councillors, Maureen Stowe, who left the party after claiming it was racist. She told The Guardian, [...] "I became a BNP councillor, like most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> me, by believing their lies". Following the 7/7 bombings in London, the BNP released fliers with the slogan; [...] "maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP". Griffin claimed that this was the [...] "cost of voting Labour", attacking the government for bringing the United Kingdom into an [...] "illegal" [...] Iraq War and for its immigration policies. YouGov claimed in 2006, that support for the party stood at up to 7%. Large gains were made in the 2006 local elections, where the BNP more than doubled its number of councillors and became the second party on the Barking and Dagenham council.|$|E
5000|$|A ticket {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{political}} party. In this case, the candidates for a given party {{are said to be}} running on the party's ticket. [...] "Straight party voting" [...] (most common in some U.S. states) is <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> the entire party ticket, including every office for which the party has a candidate running. Particularly in the era of mechanical voting machines, it was possible to accomplish this in many jurisdictions by the use of a [...] "party lever" [...] which automatically cast a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> each member of the party by the activation of a single lever. Ticket Splitters are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> candidates from more than one political party when they <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> public offices, <b>voting</b> on the basis of individual personalities and records instead of on the basis of party loyalties.|$|R
