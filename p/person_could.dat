5|$|One <b>person</b> <b>could</b> {{say that}} 'hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person {{can write to}} me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide everyday of my life {{for the last ten}} years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, y'know?... It meant something to someone.|$|E
5|$|Portable {{ventilators}} may {{be required}} to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Until 2008, Kosovo did {{not have}} a flag of its own. However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags were flown in Kosovo. Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo (then an autonomous province) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia. If a nationalist flag were flown, such as Albanian, Serbian or Croatian, a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> go to prison for doing it.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of a friend, {{relative}} or acquaintance, with medical certificates written by two medical practitioners. This method was amended by The Mental Health Act 1959 which stated a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be admitted upon the recommendation of a medical practitioner who had examined the person. As soon as possible after admission the superintendent of the hospital was required to examine the patient and either approve the recommended admission or discharge the patient.|$|E

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E

5000|$|The {{land was}} never divided into regular townships, {{as in the}} Public Lands Survey System. Because <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> select their {{allotment}} from anywhere within the district, there were frequently competing and overlapping claims.|$|R
5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each <b>person</b> <b>could</b> or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E
50|$|A website lists 466 {{names of}} Jews from Kolín and, if known, what {{happened}} with them. Additional fourteen <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> not be identified. The Stolpersteine from Kolín thus memorize {{only a small fraction}} of the Jewish losses during the Shoah.|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} target {{could be}} moderate Muslims {{that do not}} want to take up an overt role against jihadists, but could supply information. The cover for approaching such <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> be any {{of a wide range of}} businesses and institutions.|$|R
60|$|The wheat was now tall, and {{the path}} was narrow; thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side. Two <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> not walk abreast without {{damaging}} the crop, and Oak stood aside to let her pass.|$|R
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be possessed.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Burnet {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one <b>person</b> <b>could</b> effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the <b>person</b> <b>could</b> absorb through meditation.|$|E

'It {{would be}} strange if any two <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> be {{together}} {{for so many}} years, especially as superior and inferior, without each having something to complain of in the other--as he thought, at all events, replied John Carker.

It {{was the second}} biggest single-incident {{maritime}} losses {{of life in the}} history of Chile.|$|R
5000|$|The Security Council was {{determined}} to resolve the serious humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo {{to ensure that all}} refugees and displaced <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> return home safely. The current situation necessitated an urgent response from the parties of the conflict {{with the support of the}} international community.|$|R
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state {{constitution}} specified that the President of the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that <b>person</b> <b>could</b> not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized <b>person</b> <b>could</b> make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E
5|$|Since the Medal of Honor was established, 19 {{recipients}} {{have received}} it twice, of whom 5 received both awards during World War I. These 5 men were all Marines who received both the Army and Navy {{versions of the}} Medal of Honor for the same action. This {{was made possible by}} the practice of attaching some units of the U.S. Marine Corps, a part of the Department of the Navy, to larger U.S. Army commands, making Marines in such units eligible for both Army and Navy decorations. Of the other three Marines who earned the Medal of Honor during World War I, two were awarded only the Navy version and one, Fred W. Stockham, received only the Army version. In February 1919, the criteria for the award were amended to state that no <b>person</b> <b>could</b> receive more than one Medal of Honor, thus precluding any future double recipients.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mars to Stay" [...] {{proposals}} involve not {{returning the}} first immigrant/explorers immediately, or ever. It {{has been suggested}} the cost of sending a four or six <b>person</b> team <b>could</b> be one fifth to one tenth the cost of returning that same four or six person team. Depending on the precise approach taken, a quite complete lab could be sent and landed {{for less than the}} cost of sending back even 50 kilos of Martian rocks. Twenty or more <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> be sent for the cost of returning four.|$|R

50|$|As Reynaud rose {{through the}} upper ranks of his party, the Democratic Republican Alliance, de Portes' status moved upwards with him. She was {{described}} by insiders as la porte à côté, the side door through which interested <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> {{gain access to the}} state of mind of the French government.|$|R
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The remedy for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other <b>person</b> <b>could</b> not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same <b>person</b> <b>could</b> not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the <b>person</b> <b>could</b> transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} other {{activities}} {{to keep people}} engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances, public executions and gladiatorial combat. In the Colosseum, Rome’s amphitheatre, 60,000 <b>persons</b> <b>could</b> be accommodated. There are also accounts of the Colosseum’s floor being flooded to hold mock naval battles {{for the public to}} watch.|$|R
