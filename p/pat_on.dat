5|$|Just {{prior to}} the next day's game, a tearful Joyce met Galarraga at home plate to receive the Tigers' lineup card. The two shook hands and Joyce gave the pitcher a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder, with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E
5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife <b>Pat</b> <b>on</b> {{the grounds of}} the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

25|$|There is {{verbal and}} nonverbal {{guidance}} from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) {{in order to support}} their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.|$|E
25|$|Through week 16, Vinatieri was 28/28 {{in field}} goals, and was {{selected}} to his third career Pro Bowl in December. In the regular season finale against the Tennessee Titans, Vinatieri converted his first field goal but would miss on his second attempt, ending his run at a perfect season. He would finish the season 30/31 in field goals, and did not miss a <b>PAT.</b> <b>On</b> January 2, 2015, Vinatieri was selected by the Associated Press as the First Team All-Pro kicker, his third such selection.|$|E
25|$|The Chiefs scored {{first as}} backup quarterback Todd Blackledge, {{filling in for}} injured starter Bill Kenney, led the team on a 67-yard drive capped by running back Jeff Smith's 1-yard {{touchdown}} run, but Nick Lowery was unsuccessful with the following <b>PAT.</b> <b>On</b> their ensuing possession, the Jets faced fourth down and 6 on the Kansas City 33-yard line. Rather than attempt a long field goal, Ryan faked a pitch to Freeman McNeil and rushed for a 24-yard gain. Two plays later, McNeil scored on a 4-yard rushing touchdown to give the Jets a 7-6 lead.|$|E
25|$|Collins {{made his}} {{competitive}} debut for Bohs in a FAI League Cup tie against St <b>Pats</b> <b>on</b> 26 August 1979 which they lost on penalties. The game at Dalymount Park had ended scoreless with Collins being {{one that had}} his spot kick saved.|$|R

25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} families will fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, {{and is one of}} the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E
25|$|Kyle {{calls into}} Pat's radio show, and tells Pat {{to meet him}} at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum, stating that this is the only chance for Pat to {{retrieve}} the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a Ween concert. After Kyle corners <b>Pat</b> <b>on</b> a catwalk, Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an epilogue, Pat and Chris get married.|$|E

500|$|Bauer {{consistently}} and privately doubted himself. He considered the praise he received for his pictures of trolls and princesses to be [...] "a nice <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the head for making funny pictures for children". He wanted to paint {{in oil and}} make what he called [...] "real art", but he needed the money he received for his illustrations. His self-doubts were contrary to his public persona and how he presented himself in self-portraits: strong minded but self-deprecating.|$|E
500|$|However, Aleksander Feklisov {{also claimed}} that Julius Rosenberg {{supplied}} {{him with a}} whole proximity fuze, which would corroborate at least this part of Greenglass' testimony. During the trial, Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop business failure. Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass' character and testimony. At Greenglass' sentencing hearing, his attorney O. John Rogge repeatedly told the court his client deserved [...] "a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back" [...] for his testimony and argued that a light sentence, {{no more than five}} years, would encourage others to follow his example. Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released after nine and a half years and reunited with his wife.|$|E

She told The Hamilton Spectator, [...] "We get a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back and a good job note from Stephen Harper. It's upsetting. Trust me, coming from being an able-bodied athlete to a Paralympian, it infuriates me", and that she receives $3,000 a year in funding from the government. Mortimer's return to the pool included the April 9, 2014 Cam Am Para Swimming competition, where she won three gold medals.|$|E

500|$|The {{landing on}} the surface of the Moon {{occurred}} several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969, at which time one of three -long probes attached to three of the Lunar Module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light inside the LM lit up, and Aldrin called out, [...] "Contact light." [...] Armstrong shut the engine off and said, [...] "shutdown." [...] As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, [...] "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, [...] "We copy you down, Eagle." [...] Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, [...] "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [...] Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back before quickly returning to the checklist of tasks needed to ready the lunar module for liftoff from the Moon should an emergency unfold during the first moments on the lunar surface. After Armstrong had confirmed touch-down, Duke re-acknowledged, and expressed the flight controllers' anxiety: [...] "Roger,Twang -- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue - we're breathing again - thanks a lot!" [...] During the landing, Armstrong's heart rate, at one point, reached 160 beats per minute, according to section 12-1 of the NASA Apollo 11 Mission Report.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it [...] "would have been just fine." [...] Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two [...] "exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was [...] "funny, without being (too) offensive." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him a <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E
