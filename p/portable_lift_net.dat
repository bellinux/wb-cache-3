The method used in this research is a case study. The diesel fuel prices used in this research are Rp 6. 900,-/litres and Rp 6. 900,-/litres. The result showed that the price of diesel fuel oil does not cause changed fishing ground, time of fishing and fishing frecuency so that the number of diesel fuel (litres) and ice (stem) used the <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> fishermen also unchanged. However, the increase in the price of diesel is causing a rise in operating costs of <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> ship 21 GT, an average of Rp 117. 000,-/trip (7, 8 %) and the <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> ship 30 GT, an average of Rp 616. 000,-/trip (7, 0 %).

40|$|Abstract: Background: Bariatric {{patients}} are being seen {{more frequently in}} health care. Transferring these patients is a challenging and risky task. Objectives: To analyze safety and reduce risks for the musculoskeletal system of bariatric patients and health care workers during transfers from bed to wheelchair and back. Methods: Clinical intervention study of patient transfers using <b>portable</b> and ceiling <b>lifts.</b> The {{study was conducted in}} the largest freestanding rehabilitation center in North America. Forty transfers from bed to wheelchair and back involving eight bariatric patients (age: 46 - 62 y, BMI: 42 - 48 kg/m 2) were observed systematically, and four were video-recorded to il-lustrate the analysis. Two proactive risk assessments were performed and compared using a scoring system to evaluate the risks during the processes of transfers using <b>portable</b> and ceiling <b>lifts.</b> Results: The bariatric patient transfer system using <b>portable</b> <b>lifts</b> was replaced by installing and using ceiling lifts. The safety of the processes involving the two systems was compared in relation to risk of injuries to staff and patients. Using of ceiling lifts as opposed to <b>portable</b> <b>lifts</b> resulted in 28 % reduction of low detectability incidents, 26 % reduction of mod-erate effect incidents, and decreased both high and moderate probability incidents (22 % and 30 % reduction, respectively). Finally, it resulted in approximately 25 % reduction on the sum of risk scores for the failure modes and causes requiring action. Conclusions: The results suggest that using ceiling lifts is safer than using <b>portable</b> <b>lifts</b> for bariatric patient transfers. The remaining risks were alleviated by training the staff and elaborating standardized procedures to perform these transfers...|$|R

40|$|Light fishing has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, fishing with lamp (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, <b>lift</b> <b>net,</b> purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of light fishing technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of light fishing has been limited especially for purse seine and <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> (bagan). Bagan is a <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on light fishing in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and <b>lift</b> <b>net.</b> These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and discarded catch. The other fishing gear, <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for fish lamp. According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of discarded catch. It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly light fishing technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|R
