50|$|In {{order to}} adjust the rate, the balance spring usually has a {{regulator}}. The regulator is a moveable lever mounted on the balance cock or bridge, pivoted coaxially with the balance. A narrow slot is formed {{on one end of}} the regulator by two downward <b>projecting</b> <b>pins,</b> called curb pins, or by a curb pin and a pin with a heavier section called a boot. The end of the outer turn of the balance spring is fixed in a stud which is secured to the balance cock. The outer turn of the spring then passes through the regulator slot. The portion of the spring between the stud and the slot is held stationary, so the position of the slot controls the free length of the spring. Moving the regulator slides the slot along the outer turn of the spring, changing its effective length. Moving the slot away from the stud shortens the spring, making it stiffer, increasing the balance's oscillation rate, and making the timepiece gain time.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} mechanisms {{which may}} decrease goal motivation in Pinterest users, specifically: vicarious goal satiation and {{the act of}} pinning images. Pinterest users may encounter vicarious goal satiation when observing completed goals, which then satiates the drive {{to achieve the same}} goal. Further, the act of pinning may reduce motivation through various mechanisms; either perceived goal progress or increased attendance to desired goal outcomes. Participants (N = 163) were randomly assigned to conditions where they saw complete or incomplete creative <b>projects,</b> <b>pinned</b> images they liked or did not pin any images, and were asked to look for a project they would like to try or were provided no additional instructions. Motivation to complete creative goals was measured by performance on a creative word association task. The study predicted that participants who saw complete creative projects would have less motivation for creative goals than those who saw incomplete creative projects (vicarious goal satiation). Secondly, it explored whether having a conscious goal facilitated or protected against vicarious goal satiation. Finally, it was expected participants who pinned images would have less motivation on the creative word association task {{than those who did not}} pin images. Results found no significant effects of <b>project</b> completion or <b>pinning.</b> Having a conscious goal did not facilitate or protect against vicarious goal satiation. Post hoc analysis of the second half of the word task was conducted to introduce an artificial delay revealing a marginal pin by seek interaction. Participants who had a conscious goal and did not pin images had greater motivation than those who did pin images. Further research addressing the limitations of this study is needed to explore goal satiation effects on Pinterest users...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept for}} this study {{originated}} at a workshop on Systems Analysis Techniques for International Negotiation sponsored by the Processes of International Negotiation (<b>PIN)</b> <b>Project</b> at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria in October 1991. That meeting was attended primarily by methodologists who have studied and developed {{a wide range of}} systematic and quantitative analytical techniques that seek to assist negotiators in effectively accomplishing various aspects of heir practical tasks. All of the participants had published widely on particular methodological tools that, at least theoretically, would increase the process efficiency and outcome satisfaction of negotiating parties. The <b>PIN</b> <b>Project</b> sponsors of the workshop bluntly confronted these experts with an anomaly: If the analytical methodologies which they developed were so useful, why are they not being applied widely in actual negotiation settings? Under what circumstances were these methods being used, what were the problems encountered, and what were the effects on the negotiation process and outcome? One of the conclusions reached at the workshop was that these methodological experts had many good ideas to enhance the process of negotiation through the use of analytical techniques, but had very limited conceptions of the practical needs of negotiators. In market terms, they had a good handle on the supply but limited knowledge of consumer demand. Thus, a valuable outcome of the workshop was the recommendation to conduct a study to explore the analytical requirements of practical negotiators. If these needs could be understood, then the appropriate analytical methodologies could be designed and offered to an interested and attentive user group, negotiators.

The autoclave was depressurized as fast as possible from 20 MPa to 1 MPa by opening the close valve located behind the cooling part of the high pressure part of the loop. Pressure inside the pin was hold at a constant value of 20 MPa by pumping high pressure water via the pin and in parallel via a separate relief valve that was connected directly to the pin using filling pressure tube. Similar approach was chosen when the opposite case i. e. loss of internal pressure in the pin was simulated in the Test 2 A.
