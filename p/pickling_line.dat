40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{equipment}} wear and operator pressure, {{as well as to}} improve the production efficiency of combined continuous <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> and tandem cold rolling mill units, four sections’ speeds should be automatically optimized to control the three loopers’ abundance, which include the entry loopers’ entry speed, pickling speed, trimming speed, and tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. According to the optimal speed principle, a new optimization algorithm was proposed based on objective function. In this work, Nelder–Mead simplex method is applied to find the optimal solution by minimizing the objective function. In addition, the calculation of four initial speeds is specified, especially the initial tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. The proposed speed optimization algorithm was successfully applied to a 1450 [*]mm continuous <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> and tandem cold rolling mill.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{and renewable energy}} use are two main priorities leading to industrial sustainability nowadays according to European Steel Technology Platform (ESTP). Modernization efforts {{can be done by}} industries to improve energy consumptions of the production lines. These days, steel making industrial applications are energy and emission intensive. It was estimated that over the past years, energy consumption and corresponding CO 2 generation has increased steadily reaching approximately 338. 15 parts per million in august 2010 [1]. These kinds of facts and statistics have introduced {{a lot of room for}} improvement in energy efficiency for industrial applications through modernization and use of renewable energy sources such as solar Photovoltaic Systems (PV). The purpose of this thesis work is to make a preliminary design and simulation of the solar photovoltaic system which would attempt to cover the energy demand of the initial part of the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> hydraulic system at the SSAB steel plant. For this purpose, the energy consumptions of this hydraulic system would be studied and evaluated and a general analysis of the hydraulic and control components performance would be done which would yield a proper set of guidelines contributing towards future energy savings. The results of the energy efficiency analysis showed that the initial part of the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> hydraulic system worked with a low efficiency of 3. 3 %. Results of general analysis showed that hydraulic accumulators of 650 liter size should be used by the initial part <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> system in combination with a one pump delivery of 100 l/min. Based on this, one PV system can deliver energy to an AC motor-pump set covering 17. 6 % of total energy and another PV system can supply a DC hydraulic pump substituting 26. 7 % of the demand. The first system used 290 m 2 area of the roof and was sized as 40 kWp, the second used 109 m 2 and was sized as 15. 2 kWp. It was concluded that the reason for the low efficiency was the oversized design of the system. Incremental modernization efforts could help to improve the hydraulic system energy {{efficiency and}} make the design of the solar photovoltaic system realistically possible. Two types of PV systems where analyzed in the thesis work. A method was found calculating the load simulation sequence based on the energy efficiency studies to help in the PV system simulations. Hydraulic accumulators integrated into the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> worked as energy storage when being charged by the PV system as well...|$|E

The reaction activity of the synthesized ZVI was much higher than commercial ZVI. When applied to the decomposition of nitrobenzene (NB), the ZVI particles underwent corrosion and passivation oxide film formation, resulting in particle size decrease. The NB decomposition rate increased with increasing ZVI dosage level and with decreasing pH. The solution pH increased monotonously with increasing reaction duration, whereas the aniline concentration showed a maximum at 50 [*]min. Based on the GC/MS analysis, NB is presumed to be reduced into aniline via reductive intermediates such as azobenzene and azoxybenzene.

40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel rolls used in the {{continuous}} <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> must be changed frequently because the continuous acid wash equipment induces wear on the roll surface in a short period. The damage portions are usually repaired by using the flame spray coating. Recently, ceramics materials are planed to be introduced to prevent the damage because of their high abrasion and corrosion resistances. In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics sleeve, spacer rings and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and fatigue strengths of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study, finite element method analysis is applied to the new structure, and the maximum tensile stress and stress amplitude have been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. Fatigue strengths of ceramics are also considered under several geometrical conditions...|$|E
40|$|On May 4, 1995 {{the author}} visited a steel plate and coil, cold {{reduction}} facility at Steel Warehouse Inc. located in South Bend, Indiana about 150 miles from Argonne. Some very interesting facts were learned about cold reduction of {{hot rolled steel}} during this visit. The company selected is only a cold reduction mill and buys steel {{from a number of}} steel producers. The author spent a total of about three hours with these people, and this included a tour of their <b>pickling</b> <b>line,</b> the small cold reduction mill which at present is limited to 15. 5 in width maximum, and their large cold reduction mill which produces sheet and coil up to 72 in. wide. Some of the things that were learned, that {{will have an impact on}} the production of the Atlas steel plates are given here. (1) Hot rolled coils have some inherent, interesting, characteristics that must be taken into consideration when being cold reduced. (2) The monitoring of the coil thickness is only done along the center line of the coil, this has a serious impact on QC of plates cut from this coil for a number of reasons. (3) Hot rolled coils of steel in this particular instance may come from a number of different sources. This could cause problems if magnetic permeability is a serious issue.

40|$|Increasing {{productivity}} by {{minimizing the}} defects {{is of utmost}} importance to any steel industry. Cold Rolling Mill plays {{a very important role}} due to its very complex processes and the products end use. Deliverance of high quality product to the customer, relentlessly understanding their requirement and regular feedback became the basis for working on this project. During the process where a coil from Hot Strip Mill (HSM) goes into the <b>Pickling</b> <b>Line</b> to Cold Rolling Mill to Batch Annealing to Final Packaging and Dispatch amidst various other processes, it acquires various defects that need to be catered before delivery to the customer. Some defects can be minimized through improvement in maintenance and some are inherent (where CRM is a customer). The aim of the project is form a quantitative comparative study with the help of profilometer analysis of Raw CRCA, Phospotised CRCA, and Painted CRCA of stainless steel samples. On the basis of comparison, one will be able to conclude upto what severity a particular defect will be passed. Among the various defects analyzed by profilometer, the Lamination & Gouge Mark are the most severed defects. The difference in total roughness obtained between defected and non-defected area after 1 st layer of painting was the order of 5 – 40 µm for Lamination & 8 – 10 µm for Gouge mark. This shows that these defects are highly prone to customer complaints and often goes for rejection. The difference upto 1 µm are passed without much scrutiny.

40|$|DP 600 HR {{is one of}} Tata Steels {{hot rolled}} products. It is a dual phase steel unique to Tata Steel for its two step cooling process and low coiling temperature. The {{finished}} product has encountered several surface defects, one of which are imprints. In order to find the root cause for the imprints a literature study, a factory inspection {{and a number of}} experiments have been conducted. To find the origin of the imprint two coils have been produced with the intention to create imprints on the surface. With these trials and the observations in the factories within Tata Steel it is found that a loose oxide layer of 4 - 10 µm thick is formed {{at the end of the}} hot strip mill process. Due to the low coiling temperature a fair amount of water remains on the strip until further processing. At both the recoiler and the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> a build-up of loose oxide is seen. From both former trials and the trials done during this project it is seen that a build-up of oxide leaves imprints with a depth of 20 to 150 µm. In order to confirm that the imprints can indeed be produced by loose oxides, two experiments were conducted. Loose oxide particles and bearing balls have been pressed into the steel surface with the result in both cases of imprints that can be compared to the ones obtained in the factory. In this work a new procedure has been developed to test the growth of the oxide layer as well as its adhesion to the steel surface. 1. To grow an oxide layer the Thermo Mechanical Testing Simulator is used. This device is normally used to test hot deformability of metals but its heating chamber can also simulating the run out table two step cooling cycle. Both cooling rates are varied between 30, 60 and 90 K=s keeping initial, intermediate and final temperatures equal to the factory values. 2. To test the adhesion of the oxide to the steel a tensile test is performed with the aid of the ARAMIS optical strain measuring system. Since the ARAMIS system follows optically the changes in the steel surface during straining the oxide layer is usually previously removed, because it will break first and interfere with the measurement. However this fact is used here to our advantage since the strain that is necessary to remove the layer can now be quantified. This loss in measurement data corresponds well to the initial loss of oxide from the sample. From the ARAMIS data it is seen that increasing the cooling rate of the first cooling step decreases the amount of strain required to break the oxide from the steel. The second cooling step does not have a pronounced effect on the adhesiveness. The microscopy analysis showed an unknown oxide layer at the steel/oxide interface. This layer is mainly iron oxide but contains an unusual amount of chromium. It is presently not known how the chromium is distributed in the oxide nor what its effects on the properties of the scale are. It is concluded that the imprints are caused by a build-up of loose oxide on the work rolls. The imprints can be prevented by not using the levelling and scale breaker work rolls. The adhesiveness of the oxide to the steel under deformation can be improved by reducing the cooling rate on the first cooling step. Using the Thermo Mechanical Test Simulator a controlled layer of oxide can be grown on steel samples. The adhesiveness of the oxide layer can then be tested by means of a tensile test while being recorded by ARAMIS. This set-up can be further improved to obtain a standardised oxide adherence testing method. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures and Material...|$|E
