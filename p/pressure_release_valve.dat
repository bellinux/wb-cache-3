5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E

As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E

A mathematical analysis of Watt's governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868.|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} use of lithium-ion power packs, {{reports of}} occasional incidents of severely debilitating and sometimes fatal tragedies appear in the news. This review analyzes possible scenarios that trigger such hazards before proceeding to discuss safety mechanisms such as <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves,</b> one-shot fuses, reversible and irreversible positive temperature coefficient elements, shutdown separators, chemical shuttles, non-flammable electrolytes and coatings...|$|R
50|$|On smaller units {{having a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> {{to prevent the}} unit from {{bursting}} under a severe flashback, the fluid level should be monitored to keep it always above the intake and not so high that the liquid could splash or overflow into the outlet.|$|E
50|$|In Western plants {{there is}} an {{airtight}} containment building. Though radiation would be {{at a high level}} within the containment, doses outside of it would be lower. Containment buildings are designed for the orderly release of pressure without releasing radionuclides, through a <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and filters. Hydrogen/oxygen recombiners also are installed within the containment to prevent gas explosions.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure {{relief valve}} (PRV) or <b>Pressure</b> <b>Release</b> <b>valve</b> (PRV) or {{pressure}} safety valve (PSV): The difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to activate the valve in case of emergency. Most PRVs are spring operated. At lower pressures some use a diaphragm {{in place of a}} spring. The oldest PRV designs use a weight to seal the valve.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} inquiry {{identified that}} the truck had been severely overloaded, and also lacked emergency <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves,</b> which {{are designed to}} help prevent a BLEVE in case of a fire. However, these valves were no longer mandatory in 1978, although they previously were. The truck was due for an inspection check-over in 1980, and it had passed the previous inspection.|$|R
50|$|The last {{power plants}} in Europe fail, and the last houses go dark as lights fail. Chemical plants now have no power. Many stored gases require {{electricity}} to be cold enough to stay in liquid form. Gas storage tanks heat up until <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> are activated, sending toxic gases into the surrounding environment. Hundreds of thousands of venting tanks cause many animals in the affected regions to die of suffocation.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> {{is often}} {{one of a}} variety of commercially {{available}} types such as a plumbing ball valve, an irrigation sprinkler valve or a quick exhaust valve. Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to a single larger valve.|$|E
50|$|Giant cicadas {{produce a}} remarkably {{distinct}} and loud sound, singing primarily at dusk, and less often at dawn in central Texas. It {{has been known}} to sing all day and occasionally through the night further south. Its loud, shrill song {{has been described as a}} siren or alarm, a whistle, or gas escaping a <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the giant cicada resides over a large area of land, there is almost no variation in its song throughout its range.|$|E

50|$|The tank {{container}} was manufactured at 13 December 1973 by a workshop from Bilbao, {{and at that}} time it did not meet the requirements for carrying flammable liquids, since it lacked emergency <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves.</b> Therefore, the tank had been used to carry other substances, some of which were highly corrosive. Tests on the remnants of the steel tank revealed microscopic stress cracks consistent with corrosion caused by previous loads of improperly overpressurized anhydrous ammonia. Combined with whether the tanker suffered an impact that caused additional structural damage, these factors likely led to the almost instantaneous rupture of the tank when the flames flashed back into the tanker. Even without safety valves, a structurally sound and properly filled tanker {{should have been able to}} maintain structural integrity in a fire long enough to at least allow nearby people to escape.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the CuIn(Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) {{crystalline}} {{quality and}} MoSe 2 thickness of films {{produced by the}} rapid thermal selenization process under various selenization pressures were investigated. When the selenization pressure increased from 48 [*]Pa to 1. 45 × 104 [*]Pa, the CIGS films were smooth and uniform with large crystals of varying sizes. However, the MoSe 2 thicknesses increased from 50 [*]nm to 2, 109 [*]nm, which created increased contact resistivity for the CIGS/MoSe 2 /Mo structures. The efficiency of CIGS solar cells could be increased from 1. 43 % to 4. 62 % due to improvement in the CIGS crystalline quality with increasing selenization pressure from 48 [*]Pa to 1. 02 × 103 [*]Pa. In addition, the CIGS crystalline quality and MoSe 2 thickness were modified by the <b>pressure</b> <b>released</b> <b>valve</b> (PRV) selenization process method. The crystalline qualities of the CIGS films were similarly affected by the selenization pressure at 1. 02 × 103 [*]Pa in the PRV selenization method and the MoSe 2 thicknesses were reduced from 1, 219 [*]nm to 703 [*]nm. A higher efficiency of 5. 2 % was achieved with the thinner MoSe 2 obtained by using the PRV selenization method...|$|R
50|$|On January 13, 1977 {{a serious}} {{accident}} occurred {{that resulted in}} the total loss of Unit A. In cold, damp weather, two high-voltage lines carrying electricity from the plant short-circuited. The ensuing rapid shutdown of the reactor led to operational errors. Within ten minutes, there was approximately 3 meters of standing water in the reactor building and the temperature had risen to nearly 80 degrees Celsius. Through error, too much water was introduced into the reactor for emergency cooling. <b>Pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> <b>released</b> between 200 and 400 cubic meters (sources vary) of radioactive coolant water into the building. The water, and also the gases, were later released from the building into the environment.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the lack}} of trained {{personnel}} available in remote areas, SMRs have to be inherently safe. Many larger plants have active safety features that require [...] "intelligent input", or human controls. Many of these SMRs are being made using passive or inherent safety features. Passive safety features are engineered, but do not require outside input to work. A <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> may have a spring that can be pushed back when the pressure gets too high. Inherent safety features require no engineered moving parts to work. They only depend on physical laws.|$|E
50|$|Vented cell (wet cell, flooded cell) NiCd {{batteries}} are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required. Traditional NiCd {{batteries are}} of the sealed type, which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops. Unlike typical NiCd cells, which are sealed, vented cells have a vent or low <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> that releases any generated oxygen and hydrogen gases when overcharged or discharged rapidly. Since the battery is not a pressure vessel, it is safer, weighs less, and has a simpler and more economical structure. This also means the battery is not normally damaged by excessive rates of overcharge, discharge or even negative charge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for the race and to test the new car package, NASCAR held several test sessions on January 12-14, 2012.

40|$|There {{are many}} kayaks {{available}} {{and many of}} these are sea kayaks or inflatable kayaks. During an investigation by this researcher (referred to throughout this document in the first person), of the current sea kayaking market, a gap was identified for a sea kayak that was lightweight, portable and capable of touring and expeditions. An inflatable kayak often offers the initial two features of being lightweight and portable. The additional features of being capable of touring and expeditions, however, were the area of concentration. The problem was approached through a combination of expertise, facilities and finance provided by an inflatable boat manufacturer, Incept Marine Ltd (Incept), an experienced sea kayaker (Audrey Sutherland), and a fellow (this researcher), supported by a Graduate in Industry Foundation (GRIF) scholarship, payable over 12 months. The objectives of the project were to produce an inflatable sea kayak capable of carrying the equipment required for expeditions, be reliable, and have features that were found in most hardshell sea kayaks. Features for development included room for storage, a deck and a rudder to ease steering. In addition the inflatable sea kayak needed to perform better than most inflatables that were on the market, as they were often slow due to a lack in strength and rigidity. Stability was important and just as a whitewater kayak should be able to negotiate its way through rapids on a river, a sea kayak should be able to guide itself over waves and cover the distances it was expected to travel, while keeping the paddler safe. The detail required in the pattern and processes could only be known by those with experience in the industry who had learnt to foresee potential problems. There was little room for error, right from the pattern design to the small but often essential processes that made Incept boats recognised around the world for their quality. It was the small and sometimes obvious areas that caused problems; for example, having to trust other manufacturers' specifications, which could lead to glues becoming susceptible to humidity and heat after a prolonged time, or the need for <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> in order to fix I-beams. The final prototype was a synergy of ideas and experience brought together to form an inflatable kayak that had characteristics to fit a consumer market wanting a kayak for paddling in exposed and open water environments. The direction and input from an experienced sea kayaker moved the project to an area that could not have been reached without considerably more market research. Working in a small innovative business created its own set of difficulties to be overcome in such a project. However, it also allowed involvement from everyone in the company to input into the outcome of the project. The project ended successfully with two working prototypes known as the Incept inflatable sea kayak K 40 (K 40) ...|$|R
50|$|It {{released}} the first publicly available dive watch with helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> named the Conquistador. In certain diving situations, helium can penetrate the watch seals and cause a pressure buildup in the watch, eventually blowing the crystal off the watch face. Rolex invented and introduced the first dive watches with a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> in 1969, which prevented this helium buildup. While {{this was a}} major advance at the time, few actual watches with this feature were produced. Doxa introduced the Sub300t Conquistador in 1969 featuring a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> According to the sales brochures and advertisements in Skin diver magazine, DOXA was the first watch company to introduce this device {{to the public for}} general sale. Rolex was manufacturing watches with the Helium <b>Release</b> <b>Valve</b> at the same time, but was only selling them to Commercial Diving Companies such as COMEX. Rolex offered the Sea Dweller with Helium Escape Valve to the public in 1972. Omega also eventually introduced a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> in its Seamaster watch.|$|R

50|$|The {{method of}} Microflotation is {{comparable}} to recycled stream DAF.A portion of the clarified effluent water leaving the Microflotation tank is pumped into a small pressure vessel into which compressed air is also introduced. This results in saturating the pressurized effluent water with air. The air-saturated water stream is recycled {{to the front of}} the Microflotation cell and flows through a <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> just as it enters the front of the float tank, which results in the air being released in the form of tiny bubbles. Bubbles form at nucleation sites on the surface of the suspended particles, adhering to the particles. As more bubbles form, the lift from the bubbles eventually overcomes the force of gravity. This causes the suspended matter to float to the surface where it forms a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the Microflotation unit.|$|E
50|$|Nespresso's {{hermetically}} sealed capsules {{are made of}} aluminum foil. Depending on the Nespresso machine being used, the flat top of the capsule is pierced when inserted into the machine and the compartment lever is lowered. Some machines make a single large hole, and others make a number of smaller holes. When the machine is activated it pumps hot water under high pressure into injector holes poked into the narrow end of the capsule upon insertion. This causes the flat bottom of the capsule to bow in, as this is made of thinner foil {{than the rest of}} the capsule. The base of the capsule holder (on which the capsule sits) has a number of raised squares which cause the foil to rupture at these points. The brewed coffee exits the capsule through these rupture holes and flows through a funnel nozzle into the coffee cup. As in pressure cookers, a safety <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> inside the brewing chamber prevents an explosion from occurring if the normal coffee exhaust path becomes blocked.|$|E
50|$|Kobayashi {{attempted}} to pass {{around the outside}} of Schumacher on lap 31 but the two made contact with Schumacher subsequently hitting a barrier. Kobayashi damaged his Sauber, losing control of his rear-end, and crashed at the exit of turn 18 after his front wing was knocked off entering the corner. Senna was slow to react and buried his Hispania nose-first into the barrier alongside Kobayashi. These incidents called for the race's second safety car period to allow removal of both cars from the circuit which were on the racing line. Klien was pushed into his garage to retire with an hydraulic problem on lap 34. The safety car pulled into the pit lane {{at the end of}} lap 35 and the race resumed with Alonso leading. Hamilton got a run on Webber who was caught behind di Grassi and lined up an overtaking manoeuvre on the Red Bull driver, and overtook him on the Raffles Boulevard straight. Webber's front-right tyre hit Hamilton's left-rear tyre at turn seven. He escaped without significant damage, while Hamilton had a punctured tyre and pulled off the circuit to retire for the second consecutive race. However, Webber did feel vibrations on the front-end of his Red Bull. His tyre, which made contact with Hamilton's, had been pushed 5 mm off its normal mounting on the rim, and Button drew closer to Webber who managed to maintain a good pace. On lap 37, Schumacher went into Heidfeld's rear-end and limped back to the pit lane to replace his damaged front wing creating sparks as it was dragged along the surface of the track, while Heidfeld retired after hitting a barrier. Button was urged by his McLaren mechanics on lap 42 to push Webber whose tyres were older, while Vettel gradually closed the gap with Alonso. Hülkenberg, in ninth, made a mistake on lap 44 which allowed Massa to momentarily take advantage, but he fought back and retained ninth position. Kubica sustained a right-rear puncture on lap 46 and made a pit stop on the same lap, rejoining in 13th. Upfront, Vettel had reduced the gap between himself and Alonso to one second by lap 50 as the pair continued to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit and drove to the pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps.

40|$|A {{biomimetic}} {{study of}} the bombardier beetle’s explosive discharge apparatus was undertaken using numerical (CFD) modelling, first, of the beetle’s combustion chamber, and then of a scaled-up combustion chamber {{with a view to}} its application to devices such as gas turbine relighters. The new findings about the existence of a <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at the beetle’s combustion chamber exit yield a clearer understanding of the physics of the beetle’s mass ejection mechanism. The scaled-up chamber (about 1 cm in length) is modelled by considering the chamber to be filled with liquid hexane which then undergoes vapour explosion through a <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at the exit.

40|$|Background: Non-surgical {{reduction}} {{remains the}} first line treatment of choice for intussusception. The major complication of air enema reduction is bowel perforation. The authors developed a custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> {{to be added to}} portable insufflation devices, delivering air at pressures accepted as safe for effective reduction of intussusception in children under fluoroscopic guidance. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> that is suitable for the insufflation devices used for air enema reduction of intussusception and to put this valve into regular clinical practice. Materials and Methods: An adjustable, custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> was assembled by the authors using readily available components. The valve was coupled to a simple air enema insufflation device. The device was used for the trial of reduction of intussusception in a prospective study that included 132 patients. Results: The success rate for air enema reduction with the new device was 88. 2 %. The mean pressure required to achieve complete reduction was 100 mmHg. The insufflation pressure never exceeded the preset value (120 mmHg). Of the successful cases, 58. 3 % were reduced from the first attempt while 36. 1 % required a second insufflation. Only 5. 55 % required a third insufflation to complete the reduction. In cases with unsuccessful pneumatic reduction attempt (18. 1 %), surgical treatment was required. Surgery ranged from simple reduction to resection with a primary end to end anastomosis. No complications from air enema were recorded. Conclusions: The authors recommend adding pressure release valves to ensure safety by avoiding pressure overshoot during the procedure...|$|E
