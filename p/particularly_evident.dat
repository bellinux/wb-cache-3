5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, {{and that this was}} <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in its use of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|Like Jarmusch's {{previous}} films, Mystery Train {{enjoyed a}} warm reception from critics. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> at Cannes, where {{the film was}} nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby Müller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins).|$|E
50|$|Liška's {{influence}} is <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> in works of his disciple, fresco painter Václav Vavřinec Reiner, {{it also can}} be traced at style of Petr Brandl.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{gave the}} album a {{favorable}} review {{of four and}} a half stars out of five, stating that the [...] "result isn't as essential as their debut, but growth and maturity are <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> in the focus and depth of composition." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, Westminster College {{moved into}} a set of {{purpose-built}} facilities on Harcourt Hill, Oxford, with buildings noted for their fusion of Oxford quads with a [...] "New England" [...] style of architecture, <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> in the large and distinctive chapel.|$|R
5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E
5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

40|$|The digital {{implementation}} of systems implies some accuracy degradation {{due to the}} combined effect of sampling and finite wordlength, and said effect is <b>particularly</b> especially <b>evident</b> if the system dynamics are spread in a wide frequency range. This paper discusses an implementation scheme based on a multirate discretization approach that may improve the representation accuracy of the digital system {{as opposed to a}} standard single-rate approach. A framework is also introduced for defining feasibility conditions in terms of accuracy requirements. The proposed multirate discretization approach can be implemented on standard single-rate hardware devices, whence its qualification as "pseudo-multirate". Some simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology...|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the single}} room has been {{divided into two}} large spaces. Much of the {{original}} woodwork, including the wainscoting, remains. Other signs of the building's use as a school are <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> the coat pegs near the south door, a black spot on the floor where the potbelly stove was and {{a hole in the}} wall for its exhaust pipe.|$|R
5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} to raise their children. Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (<b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E
5|$|The Civil War forever altered Indiana's economy. Despite hardships {{during the}} war, Indiana's {{economic}} situation improved. Farmers received {{higher prices for}} their agricultural products, railroads and commercial businesses thrived in the state's cities and towns, and manpower shortages gave laborers more bargaining power. The war also helped establish a national banking system to replace state-chartered banking institutions; by 1862 there were thirty-one national banks in the state. Wartime prosperity was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in Indianapolis, whose population more than doubled during the war, reaching 45,000 {{at the end of}} 1864.|$|E
25|$|In this period, {{the methods}} of impressionistic are {{increasingly}} <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> {{in the treatment of}} light: warm, direct light, for example direct sunlight with its red tones, and partially cold light in shadows, with blue tints, and violet transitional zones. Eckenfelder's ploughing horses become more monumental and infused with pathos, but by means of the use of light they remain a part of the landscape.|$|R
25|$|The CBD {{is a major}} {{commercial}} hub containing many {{department stores}} and specialty shops, offices, and entertainment venues. It is centred on the Crown Street Mall and Wollongong Central, and approximates the area bounded by Market, Corrimal, and Burelli streets and the railway line. Surrounding the CBD lies a mixture of parks, reserves, light commercial property, houses and multi-story residential units. Multi-story housing is <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> on Smith's Hill north-east of the CBD, reflecting the popularity of combining inner-city living, coastal views and a beachside lifestyle.|$|R
40|$|Mytilus edulis, Cerastoderma edule and Aequipecten opercularis {{were found}} to ingest {{zooplankton}} when susp-ended in mesh cages {{in the water column}} in the Firth of Clyde. Zooplankters were also found in the stomachs of bivalves that had been taken directly from their natural habitat. The bivalves consumed a wide range of zooplankton species, but selectively consumed smaller categories of zooplankton present. Condition of zooplankton in the stomachs of the bivalves varied with zooplankton species. A degree of larviphagy was <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> in Mytilus edulis...|$|R
5|$|The Spanish influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E

50|$|The rising {{popularity}} and {{increased number of}} online social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, has enabled people to seek out and share ideas with others who have similar interests and values, making group polarization effects increasingly <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> in generation Y individuals. Owing to this technology, {{it is possible for}} individuals to curate their sources of information and the opinions to which they are exposed, thereby reinforcing and strengthening their own views while effectively avoiding information and perspectives with which they disagree.|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies using}} {{a total of}} 64 starter pigs (averaging 16 - 18 lbs initial weight) to {{evaluate}} the influence of varying levels of vornitoxin-contaminated wheat on performance was conducted. In both trials it appears that when vomitoxin levels exceed 1 ppm, a reduction in performance was evident. Feed refusal was <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> the first week on the vomitoxin-contaminated wheat. No symptoms of sickness, nor an influence on tissue size and function, were observed. The pigs were unable to compensate for depression in gains after withdrawal of vomitoxin-contaminated wheat...|$|R
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

40|$|The fine {{structural}} changes associated with cell growth and toxin production {{have been examined}} in Vibrio cholerae strain 569 B. No morphological alterations in the cell envelope are apparent during logarithmic growth with thin-section techniques. However, internal swelling, suggesting alteration of cell envelope permeability, is <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> during the late logarithmic and early stationary phases of growth. Certain extracellular material demonstrable with negative-stain techniques does appear {{during the period of}} toxin production. The possible origin of this material is discussed. The effects of high temperature (37 C) and aeration on cell structure are also examined...|$|R
50|$|The North Bluff {{lighthouse}} is {{in a more}} dilapidated state {{than the}} Middle Bluff light. Similar to the Middle Bluff lighthouse, the North Bluff light has a frame of timber hardwood. Much of the timber weatherboard cladding is coming away from the frame. Nothing remains of the lamp room. Most of the timber deck and iron railings are <b>evident,</b> <b>particularly</b> on the northern side of the lighthouse, {{though some of the}} railings have fallen to the ground. The lighthouse is surrounded by timber posts which were once part of a fence, constructed in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} the wide-eyed look {{commonly}} associated with manga dates back to shōjo magazine illustrations during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The most important illustrators associated with this style {{at the time were}} Yumeji Takehisa and particularly Jun'ichi Nakahara, who, influenced by his work as a doll creator, frequently drew female characters with big eyes in the early 20th century. This had a significant influence on early manga, <b>particularly</b> shōjo manga, <b>evident</b> in the work of influential manga artists such as Makoto Takahashi and Riyoko Ikeda.|$|R
25|$|Usually, {{hydrocarbons}} {{which contain}} only σ-bonds are relatively inert chemically. However, adamantane and its derivatives are highly reactive. This property is <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> in the ionic reactions where carbocations are formed as intermediates.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing {{industry}} {{no longer}} had to be close to the river as raw materials were being moved by road to cheaper locations within the UK, leaving the docks with less trade. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> with processed foods.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, The Nature Conservancy further {{noted that}} the BioBlitz of 2002 was not the {{definitive}} work on the species within Owasippe. It {{is reasonable to assume}} that other species, those not <b>particularly</b> <b>evident</b> during the two weekends of the Bioblitz, were missed in the accounting of species.|$|E
40|$|The EU has {{capacity}} on pragmatic {{approaches to}} resolving conflicts among its members. Nevertheless this supranational institution’s potentials to overcome possible rivalries and conflicts originated {{from outside of}} its border might be more challenging one. This will be particularly true when conflicts arise over influencing the ENP areas between the EU and its archrival the Russian (Federation). Recent political and economic turbulences in Ukraine affected the both powers’ awkward relations {{on a number of}} fields. These were/are <b>particularly</b> became <b>evident</b> on the issue of Crimea, in which ‘the Russian referendum’ was hold, and its annexation to Russia was/is under way. Russian and the EU officials used every opportunity to declare their legal and political stances in their statements. The issues on Crimea’s strategic, economic, cultural and environmental significance for the world community in general and the direct involving parties in particular will be scrutinized through practical and theoretical approaches of international Relations...|$|R
50|$|Much of his acousmatic music {{displays}} {{an interest}} in the abstraction of unseen and unrecognisable sounds, an approach <b>particularly</b> strongly <b>evident</b> in earlier works such as Arrivals (1987) and Time and Fire (1991). However, with the composition of Scherzo (1992) a parallel concern with the anecdotal and pictorial possibilities of recognisable sounds began to emerge, and much of his subsequent work plays on the tensions between these two approaches. Since moving to Wales, much of the evocation of image in his music relates to the landscape of the area in which he lives and works. Ascent (1994) evokes the wildness of the mountain landscape of Snowdonia, which was awarded a ‘Euphonie d’Or’ by the Bourges electroacoustic music competition, {{as one of the most}} notable former prizewinning works between 1975 and 2005. More recently the cycle of works Four Anglesey Beaches (1999-2003) takes as its inspiration the seascapes and coastal locations of the area.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{conceived}} as a concept album about nostalgia for childhood, the concept was eventually dropped, though the original theme is still <b>evident</b> <b>particularly</b> in the title track and the album's major hit [...] "Our House". This theme was also mentioned recently when interviewed as part of T in The Park highlights, where their lead vocalist Suggs claimed that all the band members were told to write about their childhood memories for The Rise & Fall (although {{he did say that}} their keyboardist Mike Barson got the wrong idea, and went off and wrote about New Delhi).|$|R
