5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> vertebrates, such as <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> {{a wide range of}} microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the European missionaries, who {{had started}} arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|Although, by custom, {{a former}} vice {{president}} unofficially receives six months of <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the United States Secret Service, President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{traditional}} applications, iron {{is also used}} for <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead, it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation {{as a function of}} energy is shown in the graph.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|Stories of the Sea Mither and Teran {{are among}} Orkney's oldest legends, perhaps invented {{to explain the}} vagaries of weather and other {{naturally}} occurring events. In Shetland fishermen petition Sea Mither to afford them <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the Devil.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} businesses {{remained with}} the old banks for winding up. Glitnir and Kaupthing, shorn of their Icelandic operations, obtained moratoria on payments to creditors (similar to Chapter 11 <b>protection)</b> <b>from</b> the District Court of Reykjavík on 24 November.|$|E
5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} cinder cones provide more <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> direct {{sunlight}} and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|E

50|$|The {{island of}} Jersey has enacted limited <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> discrimination. These do not protect an {{intersex}} person from unwanted medical interventions, nor address other issues {{raised in the}} Malta declaration.|$|R
50|$|Remove current <b>protections</b> (<b>from</b> fear of sanctions) for a {{party who}} withdraws or corrects the {{challenged}} paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets.|$|R
5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> thrombosis and choice of an agent {{that will not}} reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and bivalirudin.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|Anime {{fans and}} sympathisers used the Internet {{to raise funds}} and lodge a legal {{challenge}} to Odex's methods; one Internet user created an invitation-only forum for those considering going to court against Odex over its allegations of illegal downloads. Fans solicited legal advice and put together a library of relevant material. A letter to The Straits Times pointed out that downloaders deciding to settle out of court with Odex were afforded no <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> lawsuits initiated by other companies within the anime industry.|$|E

5000|$|Article 3 of the 1984 Convention against Torture {{and other}} Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment held that {{non-refoulement}} emanated <b>from</b> larger <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> torture and inhumane treatment. This represented a major shift, as these protections, and therefore non-refoulement provisions, are considered absolute rights.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, the {{government}} sent the [...] "Family Protection Bill" [...] to the Iranian parliament. Women's rights activists criticized {{the bill for}} removing <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> women, such as the requirement that a husband obtain his wife's consent before bringing another wife into the family.|$|R
5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Civilian A-10: Proposed by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology {{to replace}} its North American T-28 Trojan {{thunderstorm}} penetration aircraft. The A-10 would have its military engines, avionics, and oxygen system replaced by civilian versions. The engines and airframe would receive <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> hail, and the GAU-8 Avenger {{would be replaced}} with ballast or scientific instruments.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
25|$|Each Category rating also {{specifies}} maximum safe transient voltages {{for selected}} measuring ranges in the meter. Category-rated meters also feature <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> over-current faults. On meters that allow interfacing with computers, optical isolation {{may be used}} to protect attached equipment against high voltage in the measured circuit.|$|R
25|$|Intersex {{people in}} Argentina have no {{recognition}} of their rights to physical integrity and bodily autonomy, and no specific <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> {{discrimination on the basis}} of sex characteristics.

2500|$|In early March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{proposed}} to withdraw Endangered Species Act <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> grizzly bears {{in and around}} Yellowstone National Park. The population has risen from 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 in 2017, and was [...] "delisted" [...] in June 2017.|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, {{camouflage}} {{was partially}} abandoned; for example, glossy anti-flash white was used on aircraft as <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers. When SAMs made high level attack too dangerous, {{the plans for}} RAF bombers changed to low level attack and camouflaged top surfaces returned.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the vehicle. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This {{can be used as}} a form of <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> violence against ambulance crews, or in some cases (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of malpractice.|$|E
5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} for <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> predators. The nest is {{built in a}} tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E
