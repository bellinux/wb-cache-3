40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is {{foundational}} aspects of partial functions (Papers 1, 2 & 4) and some choice principles (Papers 3 & 4) {{in the context of}} constructive mathematics. Paper 1 studies the inversion functions of commutative rings. The foundational problem of having them only partially defined is overcome by extending them to total functions. This cannot be done constructively unless the rings themselves are extended at the same time. We study such extensions, called wheels. It is investigated how identities for wheels relate to identities for commutative rings. Paper 2 studies the foundations of partial functions in Martin-Löf's type theory according to the view of subsets as propositional functions, in particular in connection with equivalence relations that the functions are supposed to preserve. The first and second isomorphism theorems of algebra are verified, showing that our approach is flexible enough for some natural mathematical proofs to be carried out. Paper 3 shows that the difference between the principles of intensional and extensional choice can be described as the principle of excluded middle plus a certain mild extensionality principle, which follows from the principle that functions are identical if they are identical at every <b>point.</b> <b>Paper</b> 4 studies a constructive calculus of indefinite and definite descriptions. It has the property that it can be interpreted straightforwardly in type theory with all terms referring to individuals. In this respect it differs from other constructive calculi of descriptions, which are known to be conservative extensions of description-free calculi but for which descriptions cannot be interpreted as referring to individuals in general. The appendix includes a predicative version of Birkhoff's theorem. It states that if a class of algebras is closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras and products and contains a set-indexed family of algebras that satisfies the same identities as the class, then the class can be axiomatized by a set of equations...|$|E

This paper tracks the results from the dryer section feasibility study through the installation of the Dryer Management System? control software. The steps will be discussed as follows: 1. Dryer Section Feasibility Study. This report quantified the energy savings and outlined a plan to upgrade the dryer section. 2. Phase 1 of the Dryer Section rebuild. Steam system modifications and equipment upgrades in the after section were performed during the scheduled eight-hour monthly maintenance outages. 3. Phase 2 of the Dryer Section rebuild. The installation was continued in the pre-dryer section during the scheduled maintenance outages in the months that followed. 4. Phase 3 of the Dryer Section rebuild. The final stages of the project were completed during a 5 -day outage. This included the installation of new valves, transmitters and a complete supervisory control system. The paper will describe the upgrade and tout the benefits of each step. The energy use and production history over a two-year time period will be reported. The paper will describe any problems encountered and solutions to overcome them. Observed benefits include energy savings of 4, 000 pounds per hour steam and improvements in machine runnability and sheet quality. The expected energy benefits for paper companies like the one in this case study range from $ 100, 000 to over $ 1 million per year.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{various aspects of}} the {{critical}} properties of the Abelian Higgs model. The initial motivation to study this model is its relation to superconductivity, but the results extend beyond the realms of superconductivity. This thesis contains an introductory part and three research papers, all related to different aspects of the Abelian Higgs model. Paper 1 : We have investigated the properties of the model using a dual vortex representation. By focusing on the propagators of the gauge field A and the dual gauge field h we find a nice demonstration {{of the fact that the}} dual of a neutral condensate is isomorphic to a charged condensate. Finally this also provides firm support for the existence of a stable charged fixed point in the theory, distinct from the 3 DXY fixed <b>point.</b> <b>Paper</b> 2 : The critical fluctuations in the Abelian Higgs model are vortex loops. We have studied the geometrical properties of these loops, and by using duality we have obtained scaling relations between the fractal dimension D H of the loops and the anomalous dimension η φ of the dual field theory. Paper 3 : We have calculated the GL parameter κ tri separating a first order metal to superconductor transition from a second order one, κ tri =(0. 76 ± 0. 04)) /√ 2. We also argue qualitatively that this κ tri is the value separating type-I and type-II behavior, in contrast to the conventional value 1 =√ 2. The calculations have been done including fluctuations in the amplitude and the phase of the matter-field, as well as fluctuations in the gauge field. Paper 4 : We have determined the effective interaction between vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau model from large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations. We find a change, in the form of a crossover, from attractive to repulsive effective vortex interactions in an intermediate range of Ginzburg-Landau parameters κε[0. 76; 1]=√ 2, depending on temperature. We present a simple physical picture of the crossover, and relate it to observations in Ta and Nb elemental superconductors which have low-temperature values of κ in the relevant range. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{its wide}} {{application}} today, {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) treatment continues to have relatively low efficacy, largely due to inaccuracy in selecting the best quality embryo(s) from the cohort for transfer. Novel methodologies for improved selection are being developed, and time-lapse observation of human embryos is gaining increasing popularity due to the more detailed morphokinetic information obtained plus uninterrupted culture conditions. The morphokinetic information {{enables the use of}} quantitative timings in developmental milestones of embryos and qualitative measures of abnormal biological events, to assist embryo selection/deselection. This project aimed to identify current limitations in the use of such measures and to develop recommendations for improvement in clinical application. In the current study, most data were collected retrospectively from infertile couples seeking IVF treatment at a fertility clinic, with consent to use time-lapse incubation (Embryoscope) for embryo culture. Comparisons of time-lapse measures were made between embryos with confirmed implantation and non-implantation outcomes following uterine transfers. Thereafter, an embryo deselection model was proposed based on the retrospective findings, followed by prospective validation. It was found in the current study that the reference starting time point (t 0) in certain existing time-lapse systems was inaccurate due to (i) the early biological variations between sibling oocytes, (ii) technical limitations in current equipment and protocols, and (iii) different insemination methods used (Papers 12 ̆ 62). The above variations may be minimized by using pronuclear fading (PNF, a biological time point) as t 0 rather than insemination (a procedural time <b>point)</b> (<b>Paper</b> 2). An example of such application was the comparison of embryo development between patients with high and low serum progesterone levels on the trigger-day (Paper 3). Furthermore, the growth rate of embryos reported in the literature is subject to multiple clinical or laboratory factors, and this was in agreement with the present study where a published time-lapse algorithm emphasizing quantitative timing parameters was shown to lose its discriminatory power in implantation prediction when applied in two different laboratories (Paper 4). Interestingly, the qualitative measures seemed to have better inter-laboratory transferability due to the embryo growth patterns appearing independent of clinical and technical factors (Paper 4). Two novel qualitative measures were reported in the present study, namely reverse cleavage and less than 6 intercellular contact points {{at the end of the}} 4 -cell stage, showing negative correlations with embryo implantation outcomes (Papers 52 ̆ 66). A qualitative embryo deselection model was therefore proposed, including several qualitative measures with implantation rates being potentially increased from 22. 4...|$|E

Wind power production has for many years been produced onshore, but installing the wind turbines offshore has some benefits due to higher and more stable wind conditions. The majority of installed wind turbines are today bottom fixed, but when moving to deeper waters it is too high cost in building and installing foundation, which brings the possibility of using floating wind turbines.

The access solutions are systems that transfers personnel or equipment from a floating vessel to a fixed or floating offshore structure. Work done using a small scale hydraulic manipulator is described in Papers A and B, where paper A deals with the kinematic motion control of such a small scale redundant manipulator mounted on a moving Stewart platform, imitating the motion of a floating vessel.

Used in the experimental verification is a high precision laser tracker which measures the position of the tool <b>point.</b> <b>Paper</b> B uses the same manipulator and has in addition a hanging payload attached to the tool point. A LQR control strategy is used to minimize the vibration of the hanging payload when the manipulator moves the tool point relative to a ground fixed coordinate system. Paper C is concerned with the inherent oscillatory nature of pressure compensated motion control of a hydraulic cylinder subjected to a negative load and suspended by means of a counter-balance valve. The method proposed in this paper has the focus on pressure feedback and is compared to classical control strategies. In paper D input shaping is used for the slewing motion control of a full scale mobile crane. The flexibility of the crane causes vibrations when slewing and by knowing the natural frequency and damping, the command signal is shaped so there are no residual vibrations. Experimental verification is carried out by means of a laser tracker. Finally, the work done in Paper E deals with active heave compensation from a fixed structure to a floating vessel. Modeling of the hydraulic winch is done and a frequency response function is obtained.
