40|$|The {{influence}} of seven phenolic compounds, normally present in wine, {{on the growth}} and arginine deiminase system (ADI) of Lactobacillus hilgardii X 1 B, a wine lactic acid bacterium, was established. This system provides energy for bacterial growth and produces citrulline that reacts with ethanol forming the carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC), found in some wines. The {{influence of}} phenolic compounds on bacterial growth was compound dependent. Growth and final pH values increased in presence of arginine. Arginine consumption decreased in presence of <b>protocatechuic</b> and gallic <b>acids</b> (31 and 17 %, respectively) and increased in presence of quercetin, rutin, catechin and the caffeic and vanillic phenolic acids (between 10 and 13 %, respectively). ADI enzyme activities varied in presence of phenolic compounds. Rutin, quercetin and caffeic and vanillic acids stimulated the enzyme arginine deiminase about 37 - 40 %. Amounts of 200 mg/L gallic and <b>protocatechuic</b> <b>acids</b> inhibited the arginine deiminase enzyme between 53 and 100 %, respectively. Ornithine transcarbamylase activity was not modified at all concentrations of phenolic compounds.

Therefore, we investigated whether phenolic acids, at low concentrations, comparable to those present in human plasma, were able to decrease basal reactive species. Results show that phenolic acids reduced ROS in a leukaemia cell line (HEL), whereas no effect was observed in normal cells, such as HUVEC.

Phenolic compounds were added to cultures transferred from an acetate-enriched seed culture reactor. A control without phenolic compound was included as a basis for comparison. Unacclimated cultures were used to minimize the biodegradation of the toxic organic chemicals during the test. A finite-difference, non-linear, least-squares algorithm was used to estimate kinetic parameters by obtaining a best fit of the experimental data to the classical Monod growth and substrate utilization model. Resulting kinetic coefficients revealed substantial changes in both the maximum rate of acetate conversion, k, and the half-velocity coefficient, Ks, when both cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives were used. The relative effect of the phenolic compound was manifested in a decrease in the value of k or an increase in the value of Ks as the phenolic compound concentration increased. Therefore, mixed inhibition was occurring. In addition, the toxic effects were clearly related to the molecular structure of the phenolic compound in each pair of toxicants studied, the inhibitory impact being greater for the ortho-diphenols (caffeic and <b>protocatechuic</b> <b>acids)</b> in relation to their corresponding monophenolic compounds (p-coumaric and p-hydroxybenzoic acids, respectively). <br/...|$|R
