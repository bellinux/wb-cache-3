40|$|Background: Helicopter {{pilots are}} often exposed to periods of high heat strain, {{especially}} when wearing survival suits. Therefore, {{a prototype of}} a ventilated vest was evaluated on its capability to reduce the heat strain of helicopter pilots during a 2 -h simulated flight. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that the ventilated vest would reduce pilot heat stress. Methods: Five male and one female helicopter pilots flew for 2 h in a simulator in three different conditions; 15 °C wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) without ventilation, 32 °C WBGT without ventilation, and 32 °C WBGT with a ventilated vest. Results: Wearing the ventilated vest significantly reduced the increase in rectal temperature and increased thermal comfort. This {{made it possible for}} all subjects to complete the 2 -h session. Conclusion: With the ventilated vest the subjects experienced less heat stress, thereby allowing all subjects to successfully complete the experiment, though two of the six pilots could not complete the 2 -h flying task in the hot condition without cooling due to heat-related problems.
