40|$|AbstractA new {{approach}} to optimize 3 D preform shape in multi-step die forging based on Quasi-equipotential Field Method and Response Surface Method is proposed. Using the proposed method, the optimized <b>preforging</b> shape is determined in the hot forging of the pendulum mass. Based on the optimized <b>preforging</b> shape, the advisable blocking blank is constructed. The final perform design, including the advisable blocking blank and <b>preforging</b> shape, is completed. The desired pendulum mass forging without any defects and with smaller flash is obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{production}} of Inconel 718 (IN- 718) hemispherical domes by closed die hammer forging is proposed. Different combination of operations employed for production are as follows: (i) <b>preforging</b> + final forging + air cooling, (ii) <b>preforging</b> + final forging + controlled cooling, (iii) direct forging + controlled cooling, and (iv) direct forging + air cooling. Last three combinations yielded a crack free hemispherical dome. The forged hemispherical domes were solution annealed at 980 Â°C for 1 [*]h and air cooled. The grain size of the domes at all locations was finer than ASTM No 4. Mechanical properties of the forged dome in solution treated and aged condition (STA) were better than feedstock used...|$|E
