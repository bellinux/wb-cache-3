5|$|An {{underground}} bunker for the Royal Observer Corps {{was built}} in the village in 1863 and was continuously used until its closure in 1968. Medstead's railway station was first opened in August 1868. The 1881 census for the Alton Union Workhouse included three paupers born in Medstead (then named 'Medsted'), including an 86 year old widow labourer, a 63 year old 'disability lunatic' who served as a domestic servant and a 26 year old 'disability idiot'. Medstead's <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> was altered in 1973 after the ecclesiastical parish of Four Marks was created.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead <b>Parish</b> <b>boundary</b> is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been {{documented}} as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, both male and female, at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as they crossed the <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} in 1067, Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, mother of Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, {{stayed on the}} island before {{travelling}} to St Omer in France after the Norman conquest of England. After the invasion, Lord Robert Fitzhamon, a cousin of William the Conqueror, formed the Shire of Glamorgan in Wales proper, with Cardiff Castle at the centre of his new domain. Flat Holm came within the <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> of St Mary's, one of Cardiff's two parish churches, and was kept as a hereditary property of the Norman Lords of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the battle}} {{is one of only}} five battlefields in Norfolk that are {{recognised}} by Norfolk County Council. The battle was commemorated by three mediaeval stone crosses: one is on private land; another (now a stump) was relocated by North Walsham Urban District Council in 1932 and can be found near the roadside by the town's water towers; the third cross was moved and used as a <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> marker. It is situated on Toff’s Loke, off Norwich Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} station, {{operated by}} the Royal Air Force and later the United States Navy, was opened on part of Home Farm close to the <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> with Ruislip in 1917, later becoming known as RAF West Ruislip. The site was used originally for the British No. 4 Maintenance Unit, together with the RAF Records division. It {{became involved in the}} repair of aircraft equipment and later in the servicing of American vehicles from RAF South Ruislip. Between 1955 and 1975 the United States Air Force was based at the Ruislip station, before the U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom command leased the site from the Ministry of Defence for the American Naval Exchange.|$|E

5|$|Keswick {{became a}} Local Government District in 1853 and an urban {{district}} with three wards in 1894, reflecting its {{growth in the}} latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and Allerdale Borough Council. Since 2010 Keswick has been in the Copeland parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of Workington and before that Penrith and The Border. The electoral ward of Keswick stretches beyond the confines of the <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5,243.|$|E
5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield — possibly delineating a former right of way.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian period {{witnessed}} extensive restoration work at Quarrington. Most of the nave's {{windows were}} altered, and the chancel {{and part of}} the vestry were rebuilt by Charles Kirk in 1862–63, who also widened the chancel arch. Parts of the tower and spire were remodelled 24 years later. The Census of Religious Worship (1851) reveals that the Church had room for 120 people, attendances of 20 and 40 in the morning and afternoon respectively and 20 Sunday scholars. As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. To deal with the growing population, a second church was designed in the early 1900s on donated land in the parish, to be built closer to Sleaford. Disruption during the First World War, <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> changes in 1928, and rising costs delayed the plans. Instead a church hall was built in 1932 on Grantham Road and as of 2009 was being used as a community centre. An extension to the Church was added in 2001, providing a kitchen, accessible toilet and other facilities; built in matching stone, it incorporated a stained glass window from the north aisle.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Bronze Age and Roman activity in the area. A Late Bronze Age axe head dating to around 1000-801 BC was found near Fields Farm Fisheries in Bradwall. Around a thousand Roman coins dating from not earlier than 270 AD were discovered in 1820, {{on the eastern side}} of Bradwall, a short distance from the Brindley Moor's Farm and about four miles direct from the Roman station at Kinderton, at a point where a small brook is crossed by the footpath from Brereton to Sandbach. Discovered by a mole-catcher, the coins included examples of denarii of Gallienus, Claudius II, Tetricus, Victorinus, and Diocletian. The remains of part of a Roman road, are also thought to have been discovered near the western side of Bradwall, by Boothlane, towards the west of Sandbach, and near King Street. Since the 1936 <b>parish</b> <b>boundary</b> changes, the road's location is now in Elworth on Roman Way in Sandbach Parish.|$|E

25|$|It is not however entirely {{accurate}} to say that Holmer Green has never been represented by a Labour MP. Until quite recently, the far south-west corner of Holmer Green around the appropriately-named Wycombe Road was actually a part of Hughenden parish, Wycombe District and therefore Wycombe constituency. This peculiarity had resulted from the village's steady growth towards Hazlemere and across an old Hundred and <b>parish</b> <b>boundary.</b> Between 1945 and 1951, Wycombe and therefore a handful of Holmer Green houses were represented by Labour MP John Edwin Haire.|$|E
