5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

The safety performance attributes were obtained from factor analysis from the previous study. The index is calculated based on the weighted evaluation results of critical behavior checklist (CBC), integrated with analytical hierarchy process (AHP).

The study was carried out from November 2015 to January 2016. Occupational health hazards of these workers were analyzed through questionnaire survey and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) analysis. The {{results of the study}} showed that, these workers were exposed to a number of environmental and occupational hazards leading to musculoskeletal disorders (85 %), exposure to harmful gases (65 %), respiratory problems (45 %), headache (40 %), dermatological problem (35 %), gastrointestinal (10 %) and leptospirosis (10 %) during work. It was further observed that the workers were suffering from cough and cold (90 %), skin problems (50 %), allergies (15 %), malaria and typhoid (15 %), bronchitis lung and asthmatic problems (10 %) and hearing disorder (5 %) etc. after completion of work. The PEFR values were lower in exposed workers. Reduction in PEFR values was directly proportional with exposure duration.

40|$|Abstract—The {{level of}} {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} management depends upon the scope of the industry as it varies according to the functions and scale. Designing the {{occupational health and safety}} management system for the small scale industries is more challenging due to their limited resources and other constraints. The basic groundwork for the proper implementation of occupational health and safety management system in any of the industry is based on hazard identification process in relation to the overall system. The process not only help to understand the severity of these hazards but also proper control measures can be suggested accordingly. In Pakistan, occupational health and safety issues of workers is among one of the main areas that are facing the negligence of government. This domain needs special focus particularly in small scale industries which are often unregistered and not part of social security system developed by government. This potential and observational study targeted the workers employed in the marble industries who havebeen exposed to different types of occupational hazards at the workplace. The study encompasses the identification of occupational health and safety hazards and implies potential measures to reduce the related risks.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of efficient protective clothing against nanoparticulate aerosols is presented. Nanofibrous mats of polyamide 6 (PA 6) were deposited onto a nonwoven viscose substrate by electrospinning technique. The influence of electrospinning parameters, including solution concentration, viscosity, and conductivity, was studied {{for the production of}} nonwovens with controlled fiber diameter showing a size distribution ranging from 66 to 195 [*]nm. By varying several process parameters, textiles with different thickness of the nanofiber layer and thus air permeability were obtained. A hot-press lamination process using a thermoplastic resin as glue was applied to improve the adhesion of the nanofiber layer onto the textile support. After 1500 cycles of repeated compression and torsion, the nanofiber layer was still firmly attached to the support, while mechanical damage is visible in some areas. The penetration of NaCl particles with diameter ranging from 15 to 300 [*]nm through the electrospun textiles was found to be strongly dependent on nanofiber layer thickness. A really thin nanofiber coating provides up to 80 % retention of 20 [*]nm size particles and over 50 % retention of 200 [*]nm size nanoparticles. Increasing the thickness of the nanofiber mat, the filtration efficiency was increased to over 99 % along the whole nanoparticle range.
