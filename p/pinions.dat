5|$|The {{outermost}} primaries—those {{connected to}} the phalanges—are sometimes known as <b>pinions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by <b>pinions</b> {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} <b>pinions</b> {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle <b>pinions</b> on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pinion</b> is {{supported}} both {{in front of}} and behind the <b>pinion</b> teeth, an arrangement {{often referred to as}} [...] "straddle mounting". Straddle mounting greatly reduces <b>pinion</b> deflection under high torque loads, conferring increased longevity and torque capacity. The <b>pinion</b> is also removable from the back as well making for easier access.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two {{linear drive}} systems using roller gear mechanism(RGM), {{one is the}} RRP(roller rack <b>pinion)</b> system that consists of a roller rack and a cam <b>pinion,</b> {{the other is the}} CRP(cam rack <b>pinion)</b> system that consists of a cam rack and a roller <b>pinion.</b> Through the comparison of contact forces and load-stress factors between two linear drive systems, it reveals that the RRP system is superior to the CRP system in the aspect of the bending strength, while the CRP system has higher contact fatigue resistance than that of the RRP system.

25|$|Locomotives and {{carriages}} {{each have}} a hand brake which operates brake blocks that clasp drums {{on either side of}} the <b>pinions.</b> On the steam locomotives the hand brake is applied manually; two identical hand brake levers are fitted, one for the driver and one for the fireman. On the diesel locomotives, the hand brake is applied by a powerful spring and held off by a hydraulic system.|$|E
25|$|For safety {{reasons the}} railcars {{could not be}} run as single {{vehicles}} since they each had only one set of <b>pinions.</b> No.21 {{had to be taken}} out of service by 2001 owing to problems with the speed control mechanism, and Nos.22 and 23 were taken out of service in 2003 for the same reason. The railcars were finally taken away for scrap in July 2010.|$|E
25|$|The gearing {{provided}} some additional technical problems. Smith geared the engines to the propeller via spur-wheels and <b>pinions,</b> {{the largest of}} which was toothed with hornbeam (a white timber traditionally used for gearing in windmills). The gearing arrangement proved to be very noisy, and the ship's stern was subject to considerable vibration in operation. Smith planned to reduce the noise {{by the use of}} spiral gears, but it is unclear whether this modification was ever carried out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pinioning</b> is {{the act of}} surgically {{removing}} one <b>pinion</b> joint, {{the joint}} of a bird's wing farthest from the body, to prevent flight. <b>Pinioning</b> is often done to waterfowl and poultry. It is not typically done to companion bird species such as parrots.|$|R

5000|$|A {{rack and}} <b>pinion</b> {{is a type}} of linear {{actuator}} that comprises a pair of gears which convert rotational motion into linear motion. A circular gear called [...] "the pinion" [...] engages teeth on a linear [...] "gear" [...] bar called [...] "the rack"; rotational motion applied to the <b>pinion</b> causes the rack to move relative to the <b>pinion,</b> thereby translating the rotational motion of the <b>pinion</b> into linear motion.|$|R
25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler <b>pinions.</b> The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E
25|$|Most {{practical}} mechanical analog computers of {{any significant}} complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys {{were used in}} a Fourier synthesizer, a tide-predicting machine, which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision racks and <b>pinions.</b> The racks were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.|$|E
25|$|The rack {{bars are}} machine {{cut from a}} special quality of steel: the profile is not {{symmetrical}} and the bars must be installed the right way round. Bars tend to fracture between the fixings. When spotted these breaks are marked and then supported with wedges until the bar can be replaced. The <b>pinions</b> consist of an outer ring that is easily replaced. This ring is mounted onto a centre disc, and springs between the two reduce shock loads and allow the small movement needed to accommodate joints and curves. The pinion rings have symmetrical teeth and are turned round to double their working life.|$|E
50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the <b>pinion</b> off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the <b>pinion</b> to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the <b>pinion</b> and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the <b>pinion</b> is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid <b>pinion</b> is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel <b>pinion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There is an 8.9" [...] {{diameter}} Dana 44 {{ring and}} <b>pinion</b> {{that is very}} different from the standard Dana 44. This ring and <b>pinion</b> is significantly stronger with a better <b>pinion</b> to ring gear tooth contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups. This ring and <b>pinion</b> does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers. The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter <b>pinion</b> shaft.|$|R
25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} <b>pinions,</b> causing them {{to have to be}} replaced. The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's big ends were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined with dust and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the prime movers before they could be returned to service. The prime movers were manufactured in 1939 and their big ends had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|E
25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} the rack rail. On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the running line, and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the <b>pinions</b> running along the rack. It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with the rack. The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports the rack rail as well as the running rails.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it {{and use it as}} a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway's only locomotive without <b>pinions,</b> and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered rails to shunt a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the <b>pinion</b> in question has failed by overload fracture. Fractographic and microstructural studies indicated that the material of the <b>pinion</b> had high volume fraction of porosity with poor inter-particle bonding. Hence the <b>pinion</b> did not have sufficient strength to withstand the test load. ...|$|R

50|$|This overrunning-clutch <b>pinion</b> {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive <b>pinion</b> on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive <b>pinion</b> assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive <b>pinion</b> to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive <b>pinion</b> is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} <b>pinions,</b> generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that spur gear to the other pinion, and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|E
25|$|In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two <b>pinions,</b> whose axes {{come out}} at V and U; either {{of which may be}} turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the {{terrestrial}} globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.|$|E
500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small <b>pinions),</b> as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD). From his horological treatise, Su Song states: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: wheel and <b>pinion</b> uncoated, wheel and <b>pinion</b> coated, wheel coated and <b>pinion</b> uncoated as well as wheel uncoated and <b>pinion</b> coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (wheel and <b>pinion</b> coated) and uncoated/coated pair (uncoated wheel and coated <b>pinion)</b> a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated wheel and uncoated <b>pinion)</b> – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} <b>pinion</b> {{steering}} mechanisms, where {{the steering wheel}} turns the <b>pinion</b> gear; the <b>pinion</b> moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the <b>pinion,</b> converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R
2500|$|For a {{tooth profile}} {{which is a}} {{theoretical}} involute, the fundamental rack is straight-sided, with sides inclined at the pressure angle of the tooth form, with flat top and bottom. The necessary addendum correction to allow the use of small-numbered <b>pinions</b> can either be obtained by suitable modification of this rack to a cycloidal form at the tips, or by hobbing at other than the theoretical pitch circle diameter. [...] Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle, but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{take-off}} (PTO) was {{integral to}} the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable <b>pinions</b> giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} the architect Samuel Wyatt. The engines were supplied with water taken directly from the River Thames. At the time, they were [...] "the most complete and powerful which had been produced by the Soho Manufactory". [...] The mill's wheels and shafts were made of iron. An exception to this {{were some of the}} cogs, which were of hard wood, though others were of cast iron, as were the <b>pinions.</b> The teeth, some of wood and others of iron, were manufactured by chipping and filing into epicycloidal shapes. The shafts and axles were made of iron and the bearings of brass. The mill's double engine, producing , drove 20 pairs of millstones, each grinding some nine bushels of corn an hour. It also provided power for raising corn, fanning it to free it of impurities, sifting it, dressing the meal and lowering it into the barges, which made the process more efficient.|$|E
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive <b>pinion</b> on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} <b>pinion</b> {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive <b>pinion</b> to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive <b>pinion</b> is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|A safety <b>pinion</b> was an {{alternate}} means of protection, {{used with the}} going barrel. In this, the centre wheel <b>pinion,</b> which the barrel gear engages, was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread. If the spring broke, the reverse recoil of the barrel, instead of being {{passed on to the}} gear train, would simply unscrew the <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the <b>pinion</b> gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's <b>pinion</b> is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the <b>pinion</b> to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the <b>pinion</b> to the flywheel ring gear, but if the <b>pinion</b> remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the <b>pinion</b> will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
