5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between a more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because we have to learn three routines for the same song. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> shocked because it's different for us.

5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

40|$|The suspect {{classification}} {{approach as}} it pertains to women, racial minorities, and the poor <b>will</b> <b>be</b> analyzed first in order to determine what gains, if any, have been achieved and lost via this route. Then the utility of an equal protection-fundamental rights approach which may accent more concerns common to women, minorities, the poor, and other oppressed <b>peoples</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> examined. Finally, the value of a 2 ̆ 2 sliding-scale 2 ̆ 2 route to equal protection issues as a route which might permit the oppressed to present a more reasoned equal protection package to the Court, and simultaneously make it more uncomfortable for the Supreme Court to disregard the societal injustices heaped upon the poor, racial minorities, and other oppressed <b>peoples,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> considered...|$|R

25|$|People's self-verification strivings {{are apt to}} be most {{influential}} when the relevant identities and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, and the behavior itself should be consequential. When these conditions are not met, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.|$|E

25|$|Unlike stroke-based input methods, the pinyin method only {{requires}} {{the user to}} know how to speak Mandarin and be able to recognize the characters. It does not require the user to be able to construct the character from scratch as one would do in writing Chinese. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage in that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to type all the characters they can recognize. It is a disadvantage in that it may cause language attrition and skill loss in adults, and it may be a learning barrier for written Chinese in children.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area of social {{influence}} is conformity. Conformity {{is defined as}} the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members {{plays a key role in}} the dynamic of how willing <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to conform. Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.|$|E
