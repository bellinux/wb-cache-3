5000|$|In Klor’s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., a major California {{department}} store, Broadway-Hale, induced Admiral, Emerson Radio, General Electric, Philco, RCA, Whirlpool, Zenith, {{and other}} major appliance manufacturers to stop selling to Klor's, a price cutter in San Francisco. Klor's brought an antitrust treble damages suit, alleging a conspiracy among Broadway-Hale and the manufacturers. By <b>pre-trial</b> <b>order</b> the case one was limited to a single conspiracy charging a Sherman Act violation. The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the lower courts agreed, {{on the grounds that}} Klor's was only one of many stores selling such goods, so that its elimination as a competitive factor did not substantially lessen competition in the general market—there was no public injury. Whether a conspiracy existed was by-passed, even though the allegations appear to have described a rimless wheel conspiracy, without the spokes (appliance manufacturers) being connected to one another, knowing what one another were doing, or being interdependent. The Supreme Court reversed, on the grounds that Klor's sufficiently pleaded a boycott conspiracy. The Court said, [...] "Alleged in this complaint is a wide combination consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and a retailer." ...|$|E
50|$|FRCP Rule 26 {{provides}} general {{guidelines to}} the discovery process, it requires Plaintiff to initiate a conference between the parties to plan the discovery process after the initial complaint had been filed. The parties must confer {{as soon as practicable}} — and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b). The parties should attempt to agree on the proposed discovery plan, and submit it to the court within 14 days after the conference. The Discovery Plan must state the parties' proposals on subject of the discovery, limitations on discovery, case management schedule and timing deadlines for each stage of the discovery process, including the end-date of the discovery, dispositive motions and <b>pre-trial</b> <b>order</b> deadlines. Unless all parties agree otherwise, the parties should submit to each other the Initial Disclosures under Rule 26(a) within 14 days after the conference. Only after the Initial Disclosures have been sent, the main discovery process begins, that includes: depositions, interrogatories, request for admissions(RFA) and request for production of documents(RFP). There are limitation on interrogatories to twenty-five requests per party each, but there is no limitations on RFAs and RFPs, unless there is a different Local Rule for the State. Depositions are limited to ten per party, with no deposition lasting longer than seven hours per day. A party may request more depositions from the court. See FRCP 30.|$|E
5000|$|United States {{federal law}} allows courts to freeze a {{criminal}} defendant's assets when that individual {{is accused of}} violating federal banking or healthcare laws. However, assets may only be seized if they are [...] "traceable to the crime" [...] or if the property is [...] "obtained as a result" [...] of the crime and the defendant is either {{in the process of}} disposing or alienating those assets or the defendant intends to dispose of or alienate those assets in the future. To freeze these assets, the Attorney General of the United States is authorized to initiate civil proceedings to obtain a restraining order that freezes these assets or [...] "any such property or property of equivalent value". In 2012, Luis Sila was charged by a federal grand jury of committing various health care crimes. Federal prosecutes claimed that Luis fraudulently procured nearly $45 million; prosecutors alleged that Luis spent most of the money she had acquired. In an attempt to preserve the $2 million remaining in her account for the payment of restitution and penalties, prosecutors applied for a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>order</b> that would prevent Luis from spending any of the remaining $2 million. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida approved the prosecutors' request and granted an order that prohibited Luis from [...] "dissipating" [...] her assets [...] "up to the equivalent value of the proceeds of the Federal health care fraud ($45 million)".|$|E

40|$|The New York State Constitution {{provides}} for the assignment of foster children to 2 ̆ 2 an institution or agency governed by persons, or {{in the custody of}} a person, of the same religious persuasion as the child. 2 ̆ 2 It likewise empowers the state to reimburse foster care institutions for the expense of caring for the children. Plaintiffs, six children for whom guardians were appointed, sought a declaratory judgment that provisions of the New York State Constitution and statutes implementing these constitutional provisions violate the first, eighth, and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution. Defendants were public agencies and officials responsible for the administration of the child care system. A special three-judge federal court concluded that the New York program did not, on its face, violate the United States Constitution. Pursuant to a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>order</b> the issue before the court was defined as: 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 [w]hether New York Social Services Law § 373 (1), (2) and (5), New York State Constitution Article 6, § 32, Family Court Act § 116 (a), New York Social Services Law § 153 and New York Constitution Article 7, § 8 (2) violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States on their face.... 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 The court recognized that 2 ̆ 2 the issues now before [it] present a clash between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 ascertainment of the proper 2 ̆ 7 wall 2 ̆ 7 between Church and State... in a given context is, as always, fraught with difficulties. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Balancing these competing claims of the first amendment, the court concluded that when the state acts in loco parentis it assumes the obligation of providing for the total well-being of children entrusted to its care, and may constitutionally provide funds to foster care facilities run by religious organizations which meet a child 2 ̆ 7 s religious needs...|$|E

40|$|This work aims at {{thoroughly}} {{studying a}} phenomenon that today is still not really discussed (i. e., the criminal organization called ‘Ndrangheta). We will particularly deal with the culture and organizational structure of this Mafia phenomenon and analyze its new territories of infiltration and domination (the region of Lombardy, in Northern Italy) after its migration from its original territory (the region of Calabria in Southern Italy). From {{the review of the}} existing literature on ‘Ndrangheta, we can actually point out that the contributions on the theme deal with the Mafia phenomenon, circumscribing it in its original territory, therefore mostly adopting a sociological and historical viewpoint. Up to today, nobody addressed ‘Ndrangheta outside these territorial boundaries and adopting a psychological viewpoint, which is the one this contribution starts from. In more specific terms, a text is analyzed, which is composed by the reports of the <b>pre-trial</b> detention <b>order</b> called Crimine-Infinito [Endless Crime], promoted by investigators in 2010 and so far one of the most relevant actions to fight against ‘Ndrangheta...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} the law of bail has been used to criminalize dissent in Canada. Three case studies are analyzed to demonstrate how the law of bail has been applied to those arrested at global justice demonstrations associated with militant civil disobedience. The first case study examines the bail conditions imposed on protesters arrested at anti-APEC demonstrations in Vancouver 1997. These bail conditions were intentionally designed to prevent those arrested from attending the protests. The second case study focuses on the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), with an analysis of how the bail system has been used to criminalize its activism through a combination of bail conditions prohibiting public protest, <b>pre-trial</b> detention <b>orders</b> of its leaders, and prohibitions on association with OCAP. The final case study turns to arrests at demonstrations against the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001, documenting the intentional violation of the statutory right to a bail hearing within 24 hours, and the denial of bail to a perceived leader of the global justice movement. Viewed together, these case studies demonstrate that the law of bail has provided insufficient protections for civil liberties...|$|R
40|$|This {{articles}} {{addresses the}} collateral order doctrine beginning with {{its inception in}} Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., and continuing through an overview of theCourt 2 ̆ 7 s civil collateral order jurisprudence illustrating {{the development of the}} 2 ̆ 2 requirements 2 ̆ 2 for attaining appellate review under the doctrine. It examines the role of 2 ̆ 2 important rights 2 ̆ 2 in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s collateral order cases and attempts to determine whether 2 ̆ 2 importance 2 ̆ 2 is an additional requirement of the collateral order test. The author seeks to define what the Court means by an 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 right or issue, and to explain the view that some rights are sufficiently 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 to outweigh costs of piecemeal appeals. The author considers the 2 ̆ 2 unreviewability 2 ̆ 2 requirement of the collateral order doctrine, specifically what constitutes an 2 ̆ 2 unreviewable 2 ̆ 2 order under the doctrineand what, if anything, is the distinction between an 2 ̆ 2 unreviewable 2 ̆ 2 order and an order that leads to 2 ̆ 2 irreversible 2 ̆ 2 harm. Finally, the author examines the most recent casein which the Court discussed and applied the collateral order doctrine, Sell v. United States, contending that both the majority 2 ̆ 7 s markedly broad reading and the dissent 2 ̆ 7 s highly restrictive view of both the collateral order doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s requirements and its application to <b>pre-trial</b> involuntary medication <b>orders</b> are inconsistent with and further complicate the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior collateral order jurisprudence. Finally, the author proposes a way that the collateral order doctrine could be applied in the involuntary medication setting while upholding the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s narrow application and furthering the policies behind the final judgment rule...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} speed up a {{criminal}} procedure, especially the trial hearing, procedural alternatives to the ordinary proceeding have been designed in several European countries. These implement simplified mechanisms and consist of various forms of accelerated trial: trials without long and complicated pre-trial proceedings, written proceedings designed to obviate the trial stage altogether. These various proce-dures are usually characterised by simple systems of presenting evidence, and have a common feature in that they allow for consent of the parties, although the judge retains ultimate control. The aim {{of different types of}} special (abbreviated, direct, immediate) criminal proceedings is to eliminate the usual trial hearing by making it possible for a final judgement to be given at an earlier stage or by providing an opportunity for presenting the offender directly to the trial judge, bypassing the preliminary stage. Recently, Slovenian Criminal Procedure Code has introduced a new form of an ordinary proceeding, the criminal order procedure, commonly used in several European countries. This kind of a summary procedure is available to the public prosecutor at any point {{from the end of the}} preparatory phase onwards. Slovenian efforts are now concentrated on the issue of changing the Criminal Procedure in the light of various common law experiences of the continental and common law countries. Negotiated justice finds its most complete expression in such procedures as plea-bargaining or guilty plea, which have long been known in the USA and the UK. Recently, these procedures have made a considerable impact on the criminal procedure issues in our country as well. While some countries seem to place emphasis on the guilty plea in order {{to speed up}} a criminal procedure, others seem to seek to improve the efficiency of their criminal procedure by other means. Slovenia shall try to reach the simplicity, speed and efficiency of the criminal procedure by way of implementing a few special criminal procedures, some of which make it possible for a final judgement to be given at an earlier point in the proceeding, the others eliminate the preliminary or <b>pre-trial</b> phase in <b>order</b> to proceed directly to trial...|$|R
