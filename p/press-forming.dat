40|$|This study {{presents}} a new simulation-based technique for the optimum {{design of a}} multi-stage forging process aiming at reduction {{of the number of}} <b>press-forming</b> stages. This iterative design technique involves response-surface-based numerical optimization and a finite element analysis of the process. The design procedure starts with an initial process design that is deemed too conservative, i. e. allows to arrive at the desired product but involves an excessive number of stages. To obtain a better process design, one stage of the existing multistage process is eliminated using numerical optimization in conjunction with an FE simulation. This is repeated by reducing the number of stages one by one until the minimum possible number of stages is reached. This design technique is applied to stage reduction of a three-stage forging process of an axisymmetric aluminum billet.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop laboratory test methods for characterizing the effects of changed moisture content on paperboard trays produced by <b>press-forming</b> process. Influence of moisture on the properties of unconverted paperboard such as bending stiffness, bursting strength, and curling was studied. Paperboard and tray samples were tested after storing in different relative humidity conditions (35, 50, 65, 80 and 95 % RH). The effect of PE and PET extrusion coatings on these properties was also studied. It was found that increase in moisture content of paperboard decreases bending and bursting strength, dimensional stability and stiffness of paperboard trays. Such physical and mechanical properties as bending stiffness and curling of paperboard seem to define the stiffness of ready-made trays and their dimensional stability. Paperboards and trays with extruded PE and PET one sided coatings demonstrated higher strength properties but at the same time had lower dimensional stability comparing to uncoated paperboards. Samples with smaller polymer coat weight had better dimensional stability than respective samples with higher coat weight.

This new composite was manufactured employing papermaking principles, dispersing the recycled carbon fibers (rCF) in water, and forming them into mats. Two layers of the recycled polypropylene (rPP) films manufactured using <b>press-forming</b> were sandwiched between three rCF pre-form layers in a stack. The stack was heated and press-formed resulting in a composite plate with a nominal thickness of 1. 20 mm and a fiber volume fraction of 40 %. A series of tensile tests using rectangular specimens cut in four different directions (0, 90, 45) in the composite plate were performed to confirm in-plane material isotropy.

40|$|Automobile body usually {{comprises}} many {{sheet metal}} components. Most {{of them are}} usually fabricated by various <b>press-forming</b> operations from sheet metal. The body designers will consider not only the strength for durability but also the structural ability to protect the occupants during impact in a collision event. Sheet metal components are collapsible and this {{plays an important role}} as the shock absorber of the kinetic energy exploit plastic deformation. Shape and material of each part and the loading condition, etc. affect the deformation behavior at collision. Thus the main objective of this thesis is to obtain the basic information in constructing the guidelines when designing energy absOrber. This is done by studying several simple conditions in energy absorbing deformation behavior. In the thesis, two kinds of dome shaped shells made by <b>press-forming</b> were deformed by indentation of the simple shaped indentors. Effects on the shell shape, height and the indentor shape in the deformation behavior were then investigated. The objective is to show the fundamental effective information for crashworthy design of press-formed sheet metal parts. The dome shaped specimen was flat-top or hemispherical axisymmetric shell. This was produced by <b>press-forming</b> operation using a circular blank of aluminum alloy A 5052. The head shape of the indentor was flat or hemispherical. Numerical simulation was also conducted to predict the deformation patterns and the forces in the <b>press-forming</b> and the indentation using the dynamic explicit finite element code DYNA 313 (Public domain version). The energy absorption performance of the shell was evaluated as the consumed energy by the deformation where the indentor travelled up to the length equal to the shell height. The most effective deformation condition for such performance was obtained in the deformation of flat-top shell by flat-headed indentor. Rising tendency in indentation force was duller, when the hemispherical-headed indentor was applied, in contrast to the case where a flat-headed indentor was used. A peculiar crushing load characteristic was observed, when the load was increased, and then decreased for the combination of hemispherical shell and flat-headed indentor. Plastic buckling occurred due to the radial compressive stress upon the material contact to the flat part of the indentor. These phenomena were successfully reproduced in the numerical simulation. Further, when the Bauschinger effect of the material was appropriately introduced into the numerical simulation, the indentation force became closer to the experimental result. In addition, experiment was also conducted on mild steel SPCE sheets using flat or hemispherical headed indentor under impact condition using a drop hammer or quasi-static one. As a result, several characteristic force variations appeared. Almost flat indentation force is available in the combination of hemispherical shell and round headed indentor. The in-plane compressive stress field in the material induces the increase in indentation force, which in turn increases the energy absorption capacity. The force in impact test of SPCE was approximately 1. 5 times higher than that in quasi-static test. The experimental results obtained here implies that the strain-rate effect on the stress tends to be enhanced if the loading direction alters. On the other hand,whe nI we compard the results to aluminium alloy A 5052 - 1134, it did not show the same tendency as SPCE. Aluminum alloy A 5052 -H 34 and mild steel SPCE have comparable performance in energy absorption under impact in the range of the present experiments. '. The positive strain-rate effect f SPCE under the reverse in 5. loading direction may improve the performance When comparing the energy absorption performance uhder impact for the 10 mm diameter indentor with the 30 mmone, the energy absorption performance of 10 mm indentor is around 20...|$|E

To achieve appropriate surface topographies and <b>press-forming</b> behaviour, a new laser coating texturing (LCT) technique aimed at texturing steel work-rolls was proposed. The laser texturing process was realized by applying laser pulses at very high repetition rates to produce innumerable micro-craters with the required shape profile {{on the surface of the}} rolls. Moreover, the surface alloying of the dimples was carried out on the substrates of bearing steel GCr 15. The submicron WC-Co alloy metal powder was melted into the micro-craters by high laser energy.

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloy sheets have a {{potential}} to be widely used in many fields of industry due to their excellent lightweight property. Although magnesium alloys have low ductility at the room temperature due to their hexagonal close-packed structure, their formability can be improved at elevated temperatures. Therefore, warm <b>press-forming</b> of magnesium alloy sheets is an attractive technology. The objective of the present work is to investigate the cyclic plasticity behavior of an AZ 31 sheet at elevated temperatures by performing cyclic tension-compression experiments. The cyclic deformation mechanism is examined by measuring the crystallographic orientation distributions by means of X-ray diffraction method at each stage of the cyclic deformation. The present findings are summarized as follows: (1) Stress-strain responses of an AZ 31 sheet were investigated at various temperatures (R. T, 100, 150 and 200 oC) at strain rates of 0. 001, 0. 01 and 0. 05 s- 1.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of ceramic components, near-net-shape parts are commonly formed by uniaxially pressing granulated powders in rigid dies. Density gradients that are introduced into a powder compact during <b>press-forming</b> often increase the cost of manufacturing, and can degrade the performance and reliability of the finished part. Finite element method (FEM) modeling {{can be used to}} predict powder compaction response, and can provide insight into the causes of density gradients in green powder compacts; however, accurate numerical simulations require accurate material properties and realistic constitutive laws. To support an effort to implement an advanced cap plasticity model within the finite element framework to realistically simulate powder compaction, the authors have undertaken a project to directly measure as many of the requisite powder properties for modeling as possible. A soil mechanics approach has been refined and used to measure the pressure dependent properties of ceramic powders up to 68. 9 MPa (10, 000 psi). Due to the large strains associated with compacting low bulk density ceramic powders, a two-stage process was developed to accurately determine the pressure-density relationship of a ceramic powder in hydrostatic compression, and the properties of that same powder compact under deviatoric loading at the same specific pressures. Using this approach, the seven parameters that are required for application of a modified Drucker-Prager cap plasticity model were determined directly.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} {{are widely}} recognized for their high specific stiffness, strength and toughness, {{in combination with}} the opportunities for rapid processing and recycling. Experience has learnt that composites should not be treated as black metal, amongst others due to their spe-cific deformation behavior during processing. Certain aspects are well known: a low shear re-sistance in fabric reinforced composites, high stiffness in the fiber directions, and a low resistance to extension transverse to the fibers in unidirectional plies. Other aspects are less well known and less well characterized yet, e. g. the frictional behavior between plies and between laminates and tools, and the bending behavior of composite laminates at forming temperatures. Novel develop-ments in unidirectional laminate production pave the way for more optimized pre-forms (near net shaped with e. g. local reinforcement) for subsequent press forming. Design and processing with such tailored laminates involves complexities on the level of the separate plies and their interac-tions, but also on the level of the laminate as a whole, in terms of lay-up which can vary in orienta-tion and thickness, and which can change during the forming process. Process simulations can help to improve control on the design and manufacturing development of thermoplastic composite products. Adequate process simulation tools are currently under development. Constitutive models of unidirectional plies and laminates still require considerable development, certainly when compar-ing to fabric reinforced composites, including characterization experiments and implementation in nonlinear finite element software.

Wood {{used to be}} the most advantageous and everyday material for packaging, worktables, counters, constructions, interiors, tools and as materials and utensils in the food companies in the world. The use of wood has declined vigorously, and other materials like plastic, ceramic, stainless steel, concrete, and aluminum have taken its place. One way that the industry could reduce its cost is by finding possibilities of using wood for primary packaging after which it can be safely recycled or burned as a carbon source for energy. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of <b>press-forming</b> a wood film into primary packaging. In order to achieve the stated objectives, discussion on major characteristics of wood in terms of structure, types and application were studied. Two different wood species, pine and birch were used for the experimental work.

40|$|During the {{manufacture}} of composites parts, press forming of engineering fabrics {{can be used to}} create complex geometries, suitable for subsequent liquid composite moulding and cure. During the <b>press-forming</b> process in-plane tension is generally used to mitigate process-induced defects such as wrinkling and to some degree, to control the final fibre orientation distribution across the component after forming [1]. Tension is controlled through boundary conditions applied to the perimeter of the material using a blank-holder [2]. The shear compliance of dry woven engineering fabrics {{has been shown to be}} related to the in-plane tensions acting along the two sets of tows within the fabric. This can be intuitively understood due to the increased normal forces acting between overlapping tows (weave crossovers) which increases internal sliding friction during deformation of the fabric. Thus, for these materials, blank-holder conditions applied during the forming process are expected to change the material’s shear compliance and the fabric’s forming response, such as its propensity to wrinkle. The ability of a biaxial bias extension test to produce a reliable experimental characterization of the shear-tension coupling of woven engineering fabrics has recently been demonstrated [3]. Results were compared with the more familiar picture frame and uniaxial bias extension tests. However, the deformation in the biaxial bias extension test is complex and extracting the shear force – shear angle – fibre tension measurement from the test is not trivial. Here a method of analyzing the results is presented. The approach involves the assumptions of ideal kinematics (inextensible fibres) and that the shear response of the fabric depends not only on the shear angle, as is often assumed, but also on the fibre-tension within the fabric. The result of the analysis is a final equation, Eq (1), which can be solved using an iterative numerical algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Woven {{engineering}} fabrics generally {{serve as}} advanced composite preforms and {{are an important}} class of engineering material. This thesis focuses on improving the accuracy of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tools for simulating the deformation of such materials during the <b>press-forming</b> manufacture process. Specifically, this has involved better understanding: (i) the material behaviour during deformation and (ii) the extent and influence of material variability on forming behaviour. To this end, {{the use of a}} novel fabric shear test, the BBE test, capable of characterising the shear-tension coupling of engineering fabrics has been used {{for the first time in}} an extensive characterisation program, involving three different woven engineering fabrics. Results show a strong dependence of shear compliance on in-plane tension. Wrinkling behaviour during shear has also been characterised using two new analysis methods, a transmitted backlighting technique and a tracer line analysis technique. The onset of wrinkling is clearly shown to be an increasing function of the in-plane tension applied to the deforming fabric. Variability of fibre orientation, otherwise known as ‘tow meander’ can degrade the final mechanical properties of a textile composite part and can also influence measurements of the fabric’s shear compliance. Accordingly, variability of tow orientation in a pre-consolidated textile composite and three engineering fabrics has been characterised using two different image processing methods: a simple manual method and a semi-automated method. The latter has been found to be a promising tool in terms of increasing accuracy and in reducing manual effort during the characterisation process. Modelling tow meander has also been conducted using a numerical code, VarifabGA, that has been developed during the course of this work. The code has allowed the effects of tow meander on shear compliance to be investigated in numerical simulations using a technique of assigning an initial fibre orientation to each element in a Finite Element (FE) mesh before conducting shear test simulations. The experimentally measured shear-tension coupling has also been modelled by enhancing a pre-existing Non-Orthogonal Constitutive Model (NOCM). A comparison between model predictions and experimental results of the sensitivity of this shear-tension coupling has shown that the model provides good results. Finally, a novel geometrically complex 3 D forming tool of a kart wheel has been designed and manufactured for use in experimental and numerical forming studies. The part provides a challenging modelling problem with which to demonstrate the use of the new computational tools developed during the course of this work...|$|E
