5|$|Colorado <b>pinyon</b> (Pinus edulis), {{in great}} demand as an edible nut, with average annual {{production}} of 454 to 900 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Mexican <b>pinyon</b> (Pinus cembroides), {{found in}} Mexico and Arizona. Nuts are eaten raw, roasted, or made into flour.|$|E
5|$|Single-leaf <b>pinyon</b> (Pinus monophylla) {{grows in}} foothills from Mexico to Idaho. Eaten as other pine nuts. Also {{sometimes}} ground and made into pancakes.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>pinyons,</b> {{the pine}} nut seeds are edible, but the inaccessibility {{of the plants}} {{prevents}} significant collection for food.|$|R
60|$|In {{the ensuing}} silence the fire sputtered, the glare fitfully merged into dark shadows under the weird <b>pinyons,</b> {{and the wind}} moaned through the short branches.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{may have}} visited the Yosemite area {{as long as}} 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. By the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3,000 years ago, {{vegetation}} and game in the region {{was similar to that}} present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer, and salmon, while the eastern Sierra had <b>pinyon</b> nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid.|$|E
5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though <b>pinyon</b> pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or <b>pinyon</b> pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E
50|$|White-throated woodrats {{construct}} {{houses at}} the base of live and dead fallen juniper trees in pinyon-juniper woodlands in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Texas. The base of <b>pinyons</b> are occasionally used.|$|R
60|$|The {{spring was}} pleasantly {{situated}} in a grove of oaks and <b>Pinyons,</b> {{under the shadow of}} three cliffs. Three ravines opened here into an oval valley. A rude cabin of rough-hewn logs stood near the spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lost. Couldn't {{find him}} this morning, an' had a deuce {{of a time}} findin' {{the rest of the}} bunch. Old Baldy was cute. He hid in a bunch of <b>pinyons</b> an' stood quiet so his bell wouldn't ring. I had to trail him." ...|$|R
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with <b>pinyon</b> pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open {{coniferous}} {{and mixed}} forest with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral and other scrubland. It is particularly associated with <b>pinyon</b> pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates {{to the south}} late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, {{it does not appear}} to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It is a fairly common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common and not in rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pinyon</b> jays {{interact}} in a mutual {{relationship with the}} <b>pinyon.</b> <b>Pinyon</b> trees provide <b>pinyon</b> jays with food, nesting and roosting sites, and breeding stimuli. <b>Pinyon</b> jays influence seed dispersal, establishment, and genetic structure of <b>pinyon</b> populations.|$|E
60|$|As our mounts crashed {{back with}} stiff forelegs and haunches, Wallace and I leaped off and darted into the clump of <b>pinyons,</b> whence issued a hair-raising medley of yells and barks. I saw Jones, then Frank, both waving their arms, then Moze and Sounder running wildly, airlessly about.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{to prove}} it except this sudden terrible demoralization of his {{physical}} and spiritual being! While he peered out into the valley, toward the black patch of cedars and <b>pinyons</b> that hid the cabins, moments and moments passed, and in them he was gripped with cold and fire.|$|R
60|$|Across an {{open space}} in the <b>pinyons</b> a gray form flashed. I leaped off Satan and knelt {{to get a better}} view under the trees. I soon made out another deer passing along the base of the cliff. Mounting again, I rode up to the cliff to wait for Sounder.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pinyon</b> jays are morphologically and behaviorally {{specialized}} {{to exploit}} <b>pinyon</b> seeds for food. <b>Pinyon</b> seeds are heavy and wingless, and not suited for wind dissemination. Their dispersal requires birds, animals, and humans. The {{seeds of the}} Colorado <b>pinyon</b> and singleleaf <b>pinyon</b> are very nutritious. Colorado <b>pinyon</b> seeds contain 14% protein, 62% to 71% fat, and 18% carbohydrate. Singleleaf <b>pinyon</b> seeds contain 10% protein, 23% fat, and 54% carbohydrate. Both contain all of the amino acids and abundant phosphorus, iron, vitamin A, and other nutrients. <b>Pinyon</b> cones require 3 growing seasons to mature; however, seeds within 1 year old green cones can be eaten by the <b>pinyon</b> jay and are ripe {{by the end of}} August. Each cone contains approximately 20 seeds. Ponderosa pine seeds are also an important food for the <b>pinyon</b> jay.|$|E
25|$|A {{flock of}} <b>pinyon</b> jays occupying {{residential}} areas near Flagstaff, Arizona, was observed removing and caching sunflower seeds, Colorado <b>pinyon</b> seeds, peanuts, and millet from bird feeders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pinyon</b> jays are {{residents}} from central Oregon to western South Dakota, south to northern Baja California, northwestern and east-central Arizona, central New Mexico, and western Oklahoma. They winter throughout their breeding range and irregularly from southern Washington to northwestern Montana, and south to Mexico and central Texas. When <b>pinyon</b> seed crops are poor, <b>pinyon</b> jays may wander to central Washington, northwestern Oregon, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, throughout the Great Basin, Nebraska, Kansas, central-western and southwestern California, southeastern Arizona, central Texas, and northern Chihuahua. The <b>pinyon</b> jay is casual in Iowa and a sight report exists in Saskatchewan.|$|E
60|$|Shefford {{caught up}} with her and walked at her side, but could not bring himself at once {{deliberately}} to look at her. They entered a narrow, low-walled lane where cedars and <b>pinyons</b> grew thickly, their fragrance heavy in the warm air, and flowers began to show in the grassy patches.|$|R
60|$|Twilight was darkening {{the valley}} {{when he reached}} her house, and the shadows were thick under the <b>pinyons.</b> There was no light in the door or window. He saw a white shape on the porch, and as he came down the path it rose. It was the girl Mary, and she {{appeared}} startled.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not often}} walked with her beyond the dark {{shade of the}} <b>pinyons</b> round the cottage, but this night, when he knew he must tell her, he led her away down the path, through the cedar grove to {{the west end of}} the valley where it was wild and lonely and sad and silent.|$|R
25|$|In a study {{conducted}} in Flagstaff, Arizona, 122 <b>pinyon</b> jays nests were located and studied between 1981 and 1986. The percentages of identified predation events on <b>pinyon</b> jays were: ravens and crows (Corvus spp.) 76.2%; Steller's jays, Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti), and rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus) 18.0%; ground predators including snakes, gray foxes, and domestic cats (Felis silvestris) 4.1%; and accipiters 1.6%. Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) have also been seen consuming <b>pinyon</b> jays.|$|E
25|$|Incubating {{females are}} {{sometimes}} pulled from their nests at night. Female <b>pinyon</b> jays may {{be vulnerable to}} nocturnal and diurnal predators because they are extremely reluctant to leave their nests. Because <b>pinyon</b> jays breed in loose colonies, a predator attuned to finding nests could potentially specialize on incubating or brooding females.|$|E
25|$|Nestlings eat insects, soft plants, and <b>pinyon</b> seeds {{when they}} are plentiful.|$|E
60|$|The roar bothered him, for {{he could}} hear nothing else. Likewise, however, no rustlers could hear him. Emboldened by this and sure that nothing but a bird could see him, he arose from {{his hands and knees}} to hurry on. An opening in the <b>pinyons</b> warned him that he was nearing the height of slope.|$|R
50|$|The edible {{seeds are}} {{occasionally}} collected {{like those of}} other <b>pinyons,</b> and sold as pine nuts. However, in its barren, dry habitat, infrequent and small crops are normal, reducing its economic value. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, where its remarkable tolerance of drought and even semi-desert conditions makes it valuable in hot, dry areas.|$|R
60|$|As we {{paused at}} the head of a depression, which {{appeared}} to be a gap in the rim wall, filled with massed <b>pinyons</b> and splintered piles of yellow stone, caught Sounder going through some interesting moves. He stopped to smell a bush. Then he lifted his head, and electrified me with a great, deep sounding bay.|$|R
25|$|Predation can be {{high for}} <b>pinyon</b> jays; however, flocking, colonial nesting, and mobbing may deter predators. In {{a study by}} Balda and Bateman, near Flagstaff, Arizona, 4–12 <b>pinyon</b> jays of a flock acted as sentinels, {{positioned}} at a high vantage point in a tree, waiting silently for an intruder while the flock was feeding. If an intruder approached, a warning call caused the flock to cease feeding and hide in the trees.|$|E
25|$|Nests {{are built}} in <b>pinyon,</b> western juniper (J. occidentalis), or ponderosa pine trees and are {{composed}} of twigs and shredded bark. <b>Pinyon</b> jays living in urban areas of Flagstaff, Arizona, were observed building their nests from trash, paper, and synthetic materials. Nests were built an average height of 18.4 feet (5.6 m) off of the ground in ponderosa pine trees with large amounts of cover above. Nests are built 50 to 500 feet (15–152 m) apart from each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} and winter, <b>pinyon</b> jays have been noted eating Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) acorns in Gambel oak {{communities}} in New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona.|$|E
60|$|Never {{so long as}} {{he lived}} would that moment be forgotten! They were alone. The others had gotten so far ahead that no sound came back. The stillness was so deep it could be felt. The moon shone with white, cold {{radiance}} and the shining slopes of smooth stone waved away, crossed by shadows of <b>pinyons.</b>|$|R
60|$|A {{crescent}} moon hung above the lofty peak over {{the valley and}} a train of white stars ran along the bold rim of the western wall. A few young frogs peeped plaintively. The night was cool, yet had a touch of balmy spring, and a sweeter fragrance, as if the cedars and <b>pinyons</b> had freshened in the warm sun of that day.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the wind}} blew cool through the <b>pinyons</b> on the rim. There was a sweet tang of cedar and sage {{on the air and}} that indefinable {{fragrance}} peculiar to the canyon country of Arizona. How it brought back to Carley remembrance of Oak Creek! In the west, across the purple notches of the abyss, a dull gold flare showed where the sun had gone down.|$|R
