60|$|This is a {{nightmare}} hypothesis, but the difficulties of the practical problem seem to warrant its entertainment. The {{number of people in}} Russia who can even read and write is extremely small, the need to get them employed industrially as rapidly as possible is very great, hence the system of education which develops out of this situation cannot be very ambitious or enlightened. Further it will have to continue over a sufficiently long period of time to allow of the risk of its becoming stable and traditional. In adult education already the pupil comes for a short period, learns Communism, reading and writing--there is hardly time to give him much more--and returns to leaven the army or his native village. In achieving this the Bolsheviks are already doing a very important and valuable work, but they cannot hope for a long while to become the model of public instruction which they have hitherto been represented to be. And the conditions of their becoming so ultimately are adherence to their ideals through a very long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> and a lessening of fanaticism in their Communist teaching, conditions which, unhappily, seem to be mutually incompatible.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlants are {{constantly}} exposed {{to changes in}} environmental conditions. During <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> the cellular redox homeostasis is altered {{as a result of}} reactive oxygen species accumulation. The change in redox is responsible for the symptoms commonly observed during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and reflects the phytotoxic nature of oxygen radical accumulation. However, oxygen radicals have recently been identified as key actors in the response to stress and their role as secondary messengers is now clearly established.

50|$|A {{maturity}} mismatch generally {{refers to the}} difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A {{maturity mismatch}} affects a company's ability to survive a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, maturity mismatches are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.|$|E

40|$|Heterotrimeric G-proteins {{have been}} shown to be {{involved}} in plant responses to abiotic stress. Recent evidence has shown that a caleosin, RD 20 /AtCLO 3, is involved in stomate and root responses to ABA treatment in addition to interacting with the G alpha subunit (GPA 1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The role of the other caleosin gene family members and their interaction with G-proteins still remains largely unknown. This work demonstrated the interaction of another caleosin, AtCLO 4, with GPA 1 by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC). Phenotypic analysis of clo 4 mutants showed significantly less inhibition of lateral root formation during salt and mannitol stress compared to wild type; while CLO 4 gene expression was characterized in the roots by GUS staining during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> These results present a novel interaction between CLO 4 and GPA 1 and indicate a role for CLO 4 in regulating GPA 1 during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> that culminate in inhibition of lateral root formation...|$|R

50|$|ACADVL {{is linked}} with very {{long-chain}} acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), which has many symptoms, and typically presents {{as one of}} three phenotypes. The first is severe, with an early childhood onset and high mortality rate; the most common symptom is this form is cardiomyopathy. The second is a late onset childhood form, with milder symptoms that present most commonly as hypoketotic hypoglycemia. The final form presents in adulthood, and presents as isolated skeletal muscle involvement, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, which is triggered by exercise or fasting. The disease is typically diagnosed by first performing tandem mass spectrometry on a blood sample of the patient during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> and then performing molecular genetic testing {{for the presence of}} the ACADVL gene. The deficiency is treated systematically, but certain conditions such as fasting, myocardial irritation, dehydration, and high fat diets are avoided in attempt to prevent secondary complications.|$|E
50|$|Levy’s {{work has}} {{centered}} on naval affairs in the period 1933-1945. His broad theme {{has been that the}} British Royal Navy handled this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and change with admirable skill, but operated within an economic, industrial, and political climate largely unfavorable to the Royal Navy’s efforts to meet its strategic goals. Most controversial in this project has been Levy’s wariness (at times bordering on frustrated hostility) of the hagiography surrounding the person of Winston Spencer Churchill. This unease at what he seems to view as an overly reverential attitude on the part of historians towards Churchill is clearly manifested in Levy’s assessment of the career of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Morton Forbes, who led the Home Fleet in 1939-40 while Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty and then Prime Minister.More recently, Levy has begun analyzing the Royal Navy in relationship to its American and Japanese rivals. His latest article deals with the development of the Royal Navy’s Fleet Air Arm {{in the run-up to the}} Second World War. The evidence Levy uncovered in the archives points to a much more prolonged and serious engagement by the Royal Navy with the aircraft carrier and her embarked aircraft than has hitherto been understood or acknowledged by historians.|$|E
40|$|Eusociality {{provides}} {{honey bees}} a broad repertoire of responses, through a colony’s division of labor, to maintain hive homeostasis in the countenance of environmental perturbations. The hive dynamics instrumented by workers must be balanced against losses during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Stress proteins, a component <b>of</b> the cellular <b>stress</b> response {{that is already}} characterized in species from bacteria to man, provide molecular protection against many stressors at the organismal level of biological organization. A capacious stress protein literature reveals several general patterns. Exposure to sublethal stress increases cellular stress protein concentrations and improves survival to subsequent stress.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} (1) {{to test the}} {{hypothesis}} that in man there is a range of plasma osmolality within which the red cell volume (RCV) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) remain essentially constant and (2) to determine the upper limit of this range. During a variety <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> - submaximal and maximal exercise, heat and altitude exposure, +Gz acceleration, and tilting - changes in plasma osmolality between - 1 and + 13 mosmol/kg resulted in essentially no change in the regression of percent change in plasma volume (PV) calculated from a change in hematocrit (Hct) on that calculated from a change in Hct + hemoglobin (Hb), i. e., the RCV and MCV were constant. Factors that do not influence RCV are the level of metabolism, heat exposure at rest, and short-term orthostasis (heat-to-foot acceleration). Factors that may influence RCV are exposure to high altitude and long-term orthostasis (head-up tilting). Factors that definitely influence RCV are prior dehydration and extended <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Thus, either the Hct or the Hct + Hb equations can be used to calculate percent changes in PV under short-term <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> when the change in plasma osmolality is less than 13 mosmol/kg...|$|R
50|$|Neon tetras reach 4 cm in length, and are {{considered}} easy {{to keep in}} a community aquarium of at least 50 cm long, with a pH of 6.0 to 6.5 and a KH of 1.0 to 2.0. However, they will die if traumatized by dramatic changes to their environments. They tend to be timid and, because of their small size, should not be kept with large or aggressive fish which may bully or simply eat them. Fish that mix well in an aquarium are guppies, other types of tetras, such as the rummy-nose tetra, cardinal tetra, and glowlight tetra, and other community fish that live well in an ideal tetra water condition. Mid-level feeders, they are best kept in schools of six or more, for the shoaling effect when they move around the tank. They shoal naturally in the wild and are thus more brightly colored and more active when kept as a shoal as opposed to singly. The color and the iridescent stripe of this fish may become dim at night, and can be virtually invisible {{after a period of}} darkness.

Fish that mix well in an aquarium are other types of slightly larger tetras, such as the rummy-nose tetra, Buenos Aires tetra, and black neon tetra, and other community fish that live well in an ideal tetra water condition. Mid-level feeders, they are best kept in schools of five to six or more, for the shoaling effect when they move around the tank. They shoal naturally in the wild and are thus happier, more brightly colored, and more active when kept as a shoal as opposed to singly. The color may also fade during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Silvertips are best kept in a densely planted tank with subdued light and an ideal temperature of 22-27 degrees Celsius to resemble their native Amazon environment.

If the intention of the aquarist is to breed the species, then the water chemistry of the aquarium water should match that of the wild habitat - filtration of the aquarium water over peat is one means of achieving this. Floating plants providing shade will be welcomed by the species and help with breeding of the fish.|$|E

The predictive abilities of historic simulation Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), Extreme VaR (EVaR) calculated using a Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and stress testing are compared during historic <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> in this market. The iterative cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) algorithm of Inclan and Tiao (1994) is applied to identify significant and large, positive shifts in the volatility of returns, thus indicating the start <b>of</b> a <b>stress</b> <b>period.</b> The FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index Future (known as the ALSI future) is used as a proxy for this market. Two key <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> are identified, namely the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. The maximum daily losses in the ALSI during these stress periods were observed on 28 October 1997 and 6 October 2008. For the VaR-based loss estimates, 2500 trading days’ returns up to 28 October 1997 and 2750 trading days’ returns up to 6 October 2008 is used. The study finds that Extreme VaR predicts extreme losses during these two historic <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> the most accurately and is consequently applied to the quantification of a default fund for Safcom, using 2500 daily returns from 5 June 2003 to 31 May 2013.
