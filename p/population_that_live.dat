5000|$|The {{other major}} factor {{contributing}} to patterns of human genetic variation is [...] "isolation by distance". According to this model, <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> near one another {{are more likely to}} exchange mates than <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> farther apart. As a result, <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> near one another are genetically more similar than <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> far apart.Genetic distance is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle <b>that</b> <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between them, due to isolation by distance and serial founder effects. Genetic admixture increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.|$|R

50|$|A {{classical}} requirement and constraint of {{the model}} is {{that the number of}} individuals within a <b>population</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> to reach senescence must be small in number. If this is not true for a population, then the effects of old age will not be under a selection shadow and instead affect adaptation and evolution of the population as a whole. At the same time, however, this requirement has been challenged by increasing evidence of senescence being more common in wild populations than previously expected, especially among birds and mammals, while the effects of the selection shadow remain present.|$|E

The marshes were once home to millions of birds and the stopover for millions of other migratory birds, including flamingos, pelicans and herons as they traveled from Siberia to Africa.

Seven species are now extinct from the marshes, including the Indian crested porcupine, the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat and the marsh gray wolf. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.|$|E

Two aid data classifications were used: (i) humanitarian, early impact, late impact, and other aid and (ii) humanitarian and non humanitarian aid. The {{results show that the}} elasticity of our measure of night lights to humanitarian aid is negative and statistically significant at the 5 % level for year 0 and 1 and statistically insignificant for year 2 onwards. The elasticities for early impact, late impact and non humanitarian aid are positive and statistically significant for year 1 and onwards. Foreign aid positively impact night light data and suggestively imply that foreign aid positively impact, albeit weakly economic activity. The heterogeneity of the results was investigated. The results were not sensitive to a change from non calibrated satellite images but did differ depending on the percentage electrification of a country, percentage of the total <b>population</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in urban environments, and the initial level of prosperity of a country...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Upper Blue Nile {{is home to}} a large {{human and}} {{livestock}} <b>population</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in diverse biophysical and socio-economic environment. The basin is increasingly experiencing multi-dimensional pressures including population growth, climate change and variability, deforestation, land/soil degradation, as well as increasing upstream-downstream tension on water use rights. Understanding the dynamic interactions of land use and water resources in the basin comes at the forefront of any effort to improving the livelihood and sustainability in the basin. As part of a study to develop a decision support system for an integrated natural resources management for the Upper Blue Nile basin, methods and techniques are developed to identify land use suitably based on various biophysical and socio-economic factors, and water resources availability in the basin. Possible biophysical and socio-economic land use change drivers on a mesoscale catchment, Jedeb, were identified using historical remote sensing data as well as primary data sources such as field observations, questionnaires and interviewing key stakeholder informants. Then, major land use change drivers were ranke...|$|E

40|$|The rural {{population}} of Assam is {{significantly more than}} the <b>population</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in rural India. Similarly, the percentage of population below poverty line in Assam is ten points more than all India percentage. Since, the {{rural population}}s are more close to natural sources, so cooking fuel like firewood, crop residue etc., are available for free. This shows more dependency on biomass as a cooking fuel. However, burning of these could cause health hazards due to the indoor pollution. To reduce in consumption of biomass, the government should make the distribution system of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), efficient. This study was undertaken {{with the objective of}} analyzing the socio-economic conditions of rural poor of Assam with respect to their primary cooking fuel consumption patterns. The questionnaire based survey on demographic, economic, and perceptible parameters of the respondents was used to identify the important variables with the help of Logit model. The income of the respondent has great influence in the decision making of rural poor to switchover to modern cooking fuel. The study further reveals that the smaller household size respondents are prepared to switchover to modern fuel provided the accessibility of the fuel is made easier...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{research on the}} negative outcomes experienced by homeless youth and the protective role social support plays in typical adolescent development. However, current gaps in the literature are found in regard to potential protective factors for homeless youth, showing a need for further research to examine such possible influencers as social support. Homeless youth are a vulnerable <b>population</b> <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in social and residential instability during a critical time of development.

The current study sought to explore social support as a potential protective factor for homeless youth. By utilizing a social support framework, this study researched the relationships between homeless living status (e. g., living with a relative, non-relative, or no permanent home or caregiver), teacher social support, peer social support, academic achievement and psychosocial distress. This study found that teacher social support had a direct effect on the psychosocial functioning of homeless students.
