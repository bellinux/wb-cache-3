50|$|An Examining Division is {{normally}} {{made up of}} three technically qualified examiners: a <b>Primary</b> <b>Examiner,</b> who draws up the search report and conducts most of the correspondence (written or on the telephone) with the applicant; a Chairman who has overall control of {{the examination of the}} application and who chairs any oral proceedings that are held; and a Second Examiner who is responsible for taking the minutes of any oral proceedings. All three members have a vote on any formal issues that have to be decided, including the main decision of whether to allow or refuse the patent application. If the Examining Division is augmented with a legally qualified member, so that the Division consists of four members, then the Chairman has a casting vote.|$|E

50|$|Mouder House — Edwin Richard Denys Moulder (9 October 1875-21 November 1942), born in Barbados, was {{the first}} alumnus to be {{appointed}} principal of the College. He was born at Friendship Village, East Coast Demerara, British Guiana, {{the son of a}} former vicar of St Augustine and Christ Church. He was educated at Queen’s College, won the Guiana Scholarship in 1891 and read Modern History at New College School and Merton College, Oxford earning his BA (Hons) in 1896 and his MA in 1908. Edwin Moulder taught at schools in Kent, Winchester and Barbados from 1899 to 1901 and was appointed Assistant Master at Queen’s College in 1901. He also served as Inspector of Schools, Director of <b>Primary</b> Education, <b>Examiner</b> to the Education Department and as Censor in the First World War (1914-18). He was appointed Principal of Queen’s College in 1920 and retired in 1929. An outstanding cricketer, he represented British Guiana and the West Indies between 1902 and 1911.|$|R
50|$|To perform Bienfang’s test, the {{examiner}} should {{ensure that the}} patient is seated comfortably with head and eyes in <b>primary</b> gaze. The <b>examiner</b> is positioned 2-3 {{feet in front of}} the patient’s face to allow for clear observation of the patient’s eyes. The patient is instructed to tightly squeeze his or her eyelids shut for five to ten seconds. This not only relaxes the levator palpebrae superioris but actively inhibits it. Simultaneously, it fatigues the orbicularis oculi. The patient then opens his or her eyes and fixates on a target directly ahead, maintaining primary gaze. Hence, the balance between these two opposing muscles may be shifted to a higher lid position.|$|R

5000|$|Supervisors at the USPTO are GS-15 {{employees}} who are necessarily primary examiners called Supervisory Primary Examiners (SPE, colloquially called [...] "spee"). They apply for positions competitively and receive management training inside the office. They are responsible for an Art Unit of patent examiners, typically 8-15 examiners who examine cases {{in the same area}} of technology (e.g. GPS devices and aircraft are handled by different art units). Responsibilities include training new examiners, reviewing and signing office actions of junior examiners and acting as an advocate of the examiners they are responsible for to a variety of parties (e.g. other managers in the office, patent applicants and their attorneys). They are the lowest rung of the USPTO's management chain of command, and the only part of management that is paid as part of the general schedule (GS). Higher paid managers are part of the Senior Executive Service and are technically political appointees. For example, a <b>primary</b> <b>examiner</b> (GS-14) and her SPE (GS-15) are part of the general schedule and cannot be fired as part of an administration change, but the SPE's boss (a technology center director paid at SES-1), can be asked to resign by the president, at his pleasure.|$|E
40|$|Building on {{insights}} {{gained from}} interviewing administrators and patent examiners at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we collect and analyze a novel dataset on patent examiners and patent outcomes. This dataset {{is based on}} 182 patents for which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled on validity between 1997 and 2000. For each patent, we identify a USPTO <b>primary</b> <b>examiner,</b> and collect historical statistics derived from their entire patent examination history. These data are used to explore a number of hypotheses about {{the connection between the}} patent examination process and the strength of ensuing patent rights. Our main findings are as follows. (i) Patent examiners and the patent examination process are not homogeneous. There is substantial variation in observable characteristics of patent examiners, such as their tenure at the USPTO, the number of patents they have examined {{and the degree to which}} the patents that they examine are later cited by other patents. (ii) There is no evidence that examiner experience or workload at the time a patent is issued affects the probability that the CAFC finds a patent invalid. (iii) Examiners whose patents tend to be more frequently cited tend to have a higher probability of a CAFC invalidity ruling. The results suggest that all patent examiners are not equal, and that one of the roles of the CAFC is to review the exercise of discretion in the paten...|$|E
50|$|A {{submission}} of the thesis {{is the last}} formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final deadline, the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the <b>primary</b> supervisor, the <b>examiners,</b> and, in some cases, {{the head of the}} student's department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and copyright permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis).

40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} advise that dentists take radiographs {{in children}} to detect caries lesions missed by visual inspection; however, {{due to the}} current low caries prevalence in most countries, we hypothesized that the adjunct methods of caries detection would not significantly improve the detection of primary molar lesions in comparison to visual inspection alone. We evaluated the performance of visual inspection, alone or in combination with radiographic and laser fluorescence pen (LFpen) methods, in detecting occlusal and approximal caries lesions in <b>primary</b> molars. Two <b>examiners</b> evaluated children who had sought dental treatment with these diagnostic strategies. The reference standard involved the temporary separation of approximal and operative interventions for occlusal surfaces. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and utility of diagnostic strategies were calculated. Simultaneous combined strategies increased sensitivities but decreased specificities. Furthermore, no differences were observed in accuracy and utility, parameters more influenced by caries prevalence. In conclusion, adjunct radiographic and laser fluorescence methods offer no benefits to the detection of caries in primary teeth in comparison to visual inspection alone; hence, present clinical guidelines should be re-evaluated.

40|$|Objective: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle {{aspiration}} {{is widely}} used for mediastinal and hilar lesions. Histologic specimens from this procedure are important for specific diagnosis and targeted therapy. Studies on the traditional endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration needles reported yields of only 50 – 60 % for diagnostic histologic specimens. Recently, a new needle has become available in Europe, USA and Asia. The investigators aimed to evaluate the histologic specimen retrieval yields of the two needles. Methods: Patients who underwent endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle as-piration with the new 22 G needle (M group, n 94) were compared with a historical control group who underwent endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration with the traditional 22 G needle (O group, n 82). The quality of needle aspirates from both groups was evaluated. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the two groups in terms of demograph-ics, lesion characteristics, <b>primary</b> disease and <b>examiner</b> experience. The M group had a sig-nificantly shorter procedure time than the O group (P 0. 049). Of the 214 punctures by the M group, 159 (74. 3 %) were diagnostic, 28 (13. 1 %) were non-diagnostic and 27 (12. 6 %) had n...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the performance of fluorescence-based methods (FBMs), compared to visual inspection after histological validation, in detecting and assessing the activity status of occlusal carious lesions in <b>primary</b> teeth. One <b>examiner</b> evaluated 50 <b>primary</b> molars close to exfoliation in 24 children. Teeth were assessed using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) and pen-type laser fluorescence (LFpen). After exfoliation, histological validation was performed. Teeth were cut and sections were evaluated for lesion depth and activity status (after utilization of a pH indicator) under a stereomicroscope. Parameters related {{to the performance of}} the methods in detecting caries lesions at two thresholds (initial and dentin lesions) were calculated. Regarding the activity status, lesions were classified into sound+inactive or active, and the area under the ROC curve and the diagnostic odds ratio values of the methods were calculated and compared. Evaluation of red fluorescence using QLF presented higher sensitivity but lower specificity than visual inspection in detecting dentin caries lesions. However, QLF considering different parameters and LFpen had similar performance to that obtained with visual inspection. Regarding activity assessment, all FBMs and visual inspection also presented similar performance. In conclusion, FBMs did not prove advantageous for the detection and activity assessment of occlusal caries lesions in primary molars when compared to visual inspection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the examiner's accuracy in selecting proximal carious lesions in primary molars for restoration using the atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach. BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: Intervention study. CLINICAL SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 804 {{six to eight}} year-olds from 30 rural schools in Kenya participated in the study. INTERVENTION: Three examiners selected a total of 1, 280 suitable proximal carious lesions in primary molars after examining 6, 002 children from 30 schools randomly selected out of 142 schools in two divisions. Seven operators randomly paired {{on a daily basis}} with eight assistants restored the lesions. An explanation was provided for any cavity that was not restored. Pre-and post-operative radiographs of the cavities were also taken for evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The examiner's choice of suitable proximal cavities restorable using the ART approach was related to the decision made to either restore or not during the operative stage. The radiographic findings of the selected cavities were also compared to the decision made by the operator. The results obtained were used to {{determine the}} examiner's accuracy in selecting suitable proximal cavities for restoration using the ART approach. RESULTS: The majority of the children recruited in the study were excluded due to absenteeism, pulpal-exposure or anxiety during the operative stage. Only 804 children received one restoration in their <b>primary</b> molars. The <b>examiner's</b> accuracy in selecting suitable ART-restorable cavities clinically was 94. 9 % and based on radiographic analysis was 91. 7 %. CONCLUSIONS: A trained and diligent examiner has a very good chance of selecting proximal carious lesions restorable with the use of ART approach, without the threat of dental pulpal-involvement during the excavation of caries...|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{reviewed}} papers {{describing the}} development of instruments for assessing clinical communication in undergraduate medical students. The instruments had important limitations: most lacked a theoretical basis, and their psychometric properties were often poor or inadequately investigated and reported. We therefore describe {{the development of}} a new instrument, the Liverpool Undergraduate Communication Assessment Scale (LUCAS), which is intended to overcome some of these limitations. We designed LUCAS to reflect the theory that communication is contextually dependent, inherently creative and cannot be fully described within a conceptual framework of discrete skills. Methods We investigated the preliminary psychometric properties of LUCAS in two studies. To assess construct and external validity, we examined correlations between examiners’ LUCAS ratings and simulated patients’ ratings of their relationships with students in Year 1 formative (n = 384) and summative (n = 347) objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) samples. Item–total correlations and item difficulty analyses were also performed. The dimensionality of LUCAS was examined by confirmatory factor analysis. We also assessed inter-rater reliability; four raters used LUCAS to rate 40 video-recorded encounters between Year 1 students and simulated patients. Results Simulated patient ratings correlated with examiner ratings across two OSCE datasets. All items correlated with the total score. Item difficulty showed LUCAS was able to discriminate between student performances. LUCAS had a two-dimensional factor structure: we labelled Factor 1 creative communication and Factor 2 procedural communication. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 73 (95 % confidence interval 0. 54 – 0. 85), indicating acceptable reliability. Conclusions We designed LUCAS to move the <b>primary</b> focus of <b>examiners</b> away from an assessment of students’ enactment of behavioural skills to a judgement of how well students’ communication met patients’ needs. LUCAS demonstrated adequate reliability and validity. The instrument can be administered easily and efficiently and is therefore suitable for use in medical school examinations...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{epidemiological}} surveys, a good reliability {{among the}} examiners regarding the caries detection method is essential. However, training and calibrating those examiners is an arduous task {{because it involves}} several patients who are examined many times. To facilitate this step, we aimed to propose a laboratory methodology to simulate the examinations performed to detect caries lesions using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) in epidemiological surveys. Methods: A benchmark examiner conducted all training sessions. A total of 67 exfoliated primary teeth, varying from sound to extensive cavitated, were set in seven arch models to simulate complete mouths in <b>primary</b> dentition. Sixteen <b>examiners</b> (graduate students) evaluated all surfaces of the teeth under illumination using buccal mirrors and ball-ended probe in two occasions, using only coronal primary caries scores of the ICDAS. As reference standard, two different examiners assessed the proximal surfaces by direct visual inspection, classifying them in sound, with non-cavitated or with cavitated lesions. After, teeth were sectioned in the bucco-lingual direction, and the examiners assessed the sections in stereomicroscope, classifying the occlusal and smooth surfaces according to lesion depth. Inter-examiner reproducibility was evaluated using weighted kappa. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated at two thresholds: all lesions and advanced lesions (cavitated lesions in proximal surfaces and lesions reaching the dentine in occlusal and smooth surfaces). Conclusion: The methodology purposed for training and calibration of several examiners designated for epidemiological surveys of dental caries in preschool children using the ICDAS is feasible, permitting the assessment of reliability and accuracy of the examiners previously to the survey´s development.
