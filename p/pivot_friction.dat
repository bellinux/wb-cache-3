40|$|This paper {{presents}} an anallysis of a frictional planar rigid-body motion. Friction occurs on the contact {{area between the}} rigid body and the bearing horizontal plane producing a resultant friction force and a <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> moment. The general solution depends on four distinct integrals. In {{the case of a}} circular contour only two integrals remain which result in closed forms. Their evaluation is made through an integral representation for the reciprocal distance between two points. The solution of the planar circular disk motion with friction is checked against known results on particular motions. Key words: planar motion, friction force, <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> moment, elliptical integrals 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{hard disk}} drive servo system, the {{rejection}} of disturbances at low frequencies is degraded due to the nonlinearities of <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> and flex-cable bias. In this paper, a novel parametrized dynamic model is proposed with the parameters being functions of position. The proposed model provides good matching in both time domain and frequency domain. Based on this nonlinear parametrized model, a feedforward controller with adaptive gain is designed and implemented. The simulation and experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can improve the servo performance effectively. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper expounds on the {{deviation}} of measured {{coefficient of friction}} from the assignment when the friction pair of the spherical bearing changes from plane structure into spherical structure, and summarizes the common explanation of such phenomenon of the past. Through the analysis on the methods of the measurement test for the coefficient of spherical <b>pivoting</b> <b>friction</b> and an in-depth analysis on {{the relation between the}} motion state and relative motion of the internal parts of the spherical bearing generated by rotating it based on this method, a new calculation formula for the coefficient of <b>pivoting</b> <b>friction</b> of the spherical bearing is put forward, which is of great significance to in-depth understanding of the structural principles of spherical bearing, precise structural design and sound bearing applications...|$|R

So the Q of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (Γ). Precision pendulums are suspended on low <b>friction</b> <b>pivots</b> consisting of triangular shaped 'knife' edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a vacuum tank can increase the Q, and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.|$|R
50|$|These {{demands are}} {{contradictory}} and impossible to realize (massless arms and zero-friction bearings {{do not exist}} in the real world), so tone arm designs require engineering compromises. Solutions vary, but all modern tonearms are at least relatively lightweight and stiff constructions, with precision, very low <b>friction</b> <b>pivot</b> bearings in both the vertical and horizontal axes. Most arms are made from some kind of alloy (the cheapest being aluminium), but some manufacturers use balsa wood, while others use carbon fiber or graphite. The latter materials favor a straight arm design; alloys' properties lend themselves to S-type arms.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} friction, {{represented}} by the Dahl model, on a CMG rate control system was investigated by digital simulation. The conclusion from these simulation results is that gimbal <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> can be {{a significant effect on}} the gimbal rate control system. The magnitude of the problem this presents depends on the characteristics of the actual pivot. It would appear from this preliminary look that one solution is to insure that the control system natural frequency is higher by some prescribed amount than the natural frequency of the friction loop...|$|E
40|$|Conditions are {{predicted}} {{under which}} limit cycles {{may be caused}} by the friction torque of the control moment gyroscope (CMG) output gimbal used in the Large Space Telescope (LST). The parameter plane analysis technique is described, and three separate models of the CMG output friction nonlinearity are used in three separate analyses. The results suggest that the Dahl model (included in model 3) is the best available friction model for use in dynamic analysis. The analysis and analog simulation indicate the absence of limit cycle behavior due to the CMG output gimbal friction nonlinearity for presently estimated LST numerical parameters and the occurrence of one stable and one unstable limit cycle if substantially larger numerical values are allowed for the CMG gimbal <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> parameter and/or the running friction torque...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> of voice-coil-motor (VCM) {{actuator}} {{is measured}} for a 1. 8 -inch small disk drive with disk rotating and slider flying. The measurement {{is carried out}} under the conditions that the actuator is controlled and the head movement amplitude is growing by changing the references. The hysteresis of friction versus head position is then obtained. An operator based modeling approach is adopted for the hysteresis, and an optimal model is obtained by minimizing the energy gain between the head position and the modeling error. It is {{also found that the}} frequency response of the actuator model with the inclusion of the hyteresis model matches well with the measured frequency response of the actuator. A friction compensation method based on the nonlinear hysteresis model is then proposed. The simulation and implementation results demonstrate a significant improvement in disturbance rejection in low frequency range. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{pendulum}} is {{a weight}} suspended from a pivot {{so it can}} swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced from its resting equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force will cause it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum. This is a weight {{on the end of}} a massless cord suspended from a <b>pivot,</b> without <b>friction.</b> When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines. A simple pendulum is an idealisation, working on the assumption that: · the rod or cord on which the bob swings is massless, inextensible and always remains taut · motion occurs in a 2 -dimensional plane, i. e. the bob does not trace an ellips...|$|R
50|$|Kater built a {{pendulum}} {{consisting of a}} brass rod about 2 meters long, 1½ inches wide and one-eighth inch thick, with a weight (d) on one end. For a low <b>friction</b> <b>pivot</b> he used a pair of short triangular 'knife' blades attached to the rod. In use the pendulum was hung from a bracket on the wall, supported by {{the edges of the}} knife blades resting on flat agate plates. The pendulum had two of these knife blade pivots (a), facing one another, about a meter (40 in) apart, so that a swing of the pendulum took approximately one second when hung from each pivot.|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{construction}} and properties of bearings and pivots for use in instruments. The static and running friction for both thrust and radial loads was determined {{for a number of}} conical pivots and cylindrical and ball bearings. The static rocking friction was also measured for several conical and ball bearings under a heavy load, especially to determine their suitability for use in N. P. L. (National Physical Laboratory) type wind tunnel balance. In constructing conical pivots and sockets {{it was found that the}} pivots should be hardened and highly polished, preferably with a revolving lap, and that the sockets should be made by punching with a hardened and polished punch. It was found that for a light load the conical <b>pivots</b> give less <b>friction</b> than any other type, and their wearing qualities when hardened are excellent. Very small ball bearings are unsatisfactory because the proportional accuracy of the balls and races is not high enough to insure smooth running. For rocking pivots under heavy loads it was found that a ball-and-socket bearing, consisting of a hemispherical socket and a sphere of smaller diameter concentric with it, with a row of small balls resting between the two, was superior to a pivot resting in a socket. It was found that vibration such as occurs in an airplane will greatly reduce the static <b>friction</b> of a <b>pivot</b> or bearing, in some cases to as little as one-twentieth of its static value...|$|R
40|$|On January 1, 2000, the Amateur Softball Association of America (ASA) imposed maximum bat {{performance}} limitations on commercial softball bats. The ASA adopted a testing standard {{defined by the}} American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) to determine the bat performance factor (BPF), a normalized coefficient of restitution that must be less than 1. 2 for the bat {{to be eligible for}} ASA sanctioned events. The ASTM standard requires that the softball strike the bat, which is free to rotate in the horizontal plane, at 26. 8 mfs ± 0. 3 mfs (88 ftfs ± 1 ftfs) with little or no spin. The central project goal was to develop the ASTM test apparatus, which consisted of a precision ball launcher, a pivoting stage for the bat, and instrumentation for velocity measurements. The key feature of the testing apparatus developed in this project was the ability to measure the rebound velocity of the ball directly-ASTM method derives the ball rebound velocity by assuming the bat behaves as a rigid body and applying conservation of angular momentum. Tests revealed a discrepancy in the BPF between the ASTM method and an alternative method,. termed the direct method, which uses the direct measurement of the ball rebound velocity. Furthermore, the ASTM method proved to be very sensitive to parameter errors, demonstrated by magnification factors between 2. 0 and 3. 0. The direct method was insensitive to parameter variation with magnification factors between o and 1. 0. The ball rebound velocity discrepancy was also analyzed with mechanism simulation software. A three-degree-of-freedom model of the bat was used to test the effects of elasticity and <b>pivot</b> <b>friction.</b> The analysis determined that applying conservation of angular momentum on an elastic body caused transient errors in the derivation of the ball rebound velocity; and <b>pivot</b> <b>friction</b> significantly affected the motion of the bat and thus, the derived ball rebound velocity. The experimental results show that the direct method was more accurate than the ASTM method in calculating the BPF; and the conclusion of the analytical model shows that the ASTM method can be corrected by precisely identifying external moments in the system...|$|E
