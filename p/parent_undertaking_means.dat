Both sexes feed offspring with females brooding, leaving only when the male arrives to feed chicks.

This study presents {{a case study}} of Latino parental involvement and interprets the significance of the acts of involvement observed at the Mary D.

The author seeks to link together the dynamics of engagement of Latino parents within the education institution and the structural limitations present within the spaces designed for parental involvement. Methodology includes an analytic framework drawing upon cultural citizenship, parental involvement theory, and a case study based on fieldnotes...|$|R

50|$|In 1869 the Rev. William Thom, a Presbyterian minister, was {{appointed}} to the Twofold Bay charge, residing at Pambula. His wife (Clarinda Menie) was the eldest daughter of Sir Henry Parkes and both were ardent supporters of public education. Pambula already had a well established school but the Rev. and Mrs. Thom felt there was an urgent need for more schools in the district. It is known that Mrs Thom made a private approach to her father on the matter and received a sympathetic response. Formal application for a school at Merimbula was made to the Council of Education in October, 1869, signed by the Rev. W. Thom, Adam K. Page and Armstrong L. Munn. <b>Parents</b> <b>undertook</b> to pay one third of the cost of a building. School began in temporary premises in 1870. The stone building still standing in Main Street, on land donated by Sir William Montagu Manning, was first used on 8 October 1875 and is believed to be one of only three schools comprising both classrooms and a teacher's residence remaining in New South Wales.|$|R
40|$|Children are an {{important}} market segment and so marketers frame and direct ad messages to them to seek a favourable response. Advertisements are particularly targeted at children as they have consider-able influence over family food purchases. Parents are concerned about extensive exposure of children to ads (foods particularly) which affect consumption behaviour of their children. The {{nature and extent of}} mediation that <b>parents</b> <b>undertake</b> to protect their children against negative effects of advertising is seen to be influenced by their attitude towards advertising. As mothers are seen to be the primary car-egivers to children, the article explores the attitude of mothers towards advertising on TV in general, children advertising and food advertising directed at children in India. The findings of the present article highlight that Indian mothers hold negative attitude towards advertising in general, for ads directed at children and also for food ads on TV. They strongly voice that promotions are directed at children in an unethical manner. Attitude of mothers towards advertising in general and towards food advertising is found to be different for younger versus older children...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore how one group of {{students}} reflect upon their transition into the higher education environment. This qualitative research project followed one group of female undergraduate students as they moved through the first year of study. All of the participants were the first in their family to consider further education and each participated in four semi-structured interviews over one year. Drawing on the conceptual lens of 2 ̆ 7 turning points 2 ̆ 7, the intent is to provide a 2 ̆ 7 close-up 2 ̆ 7 analysis of the complex process of identity formation within the university landscape. By revisiting the students at various points over time, richly descriptive detail about what this <b>undertaking</b> <b>means</b> for those involved can be presented and the significance of these turning points explored in terms of their wider political implications...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{referred}} for chronic constipation frequently report symptoms of straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation, or {{the need to}} facilitate defecation digitally (dyschezia). When such patients show manometric evidence of inappropriate contraction or failure to relax the pelvic floor muscles during attempts to defecate, they are diagnosed as having pelvic floor dyssynergia (Rome I). To evaluate long-term satisfaction of patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia after biofeedback. Forty-one consecutive patients {{referred for}} chronic constipation at an outpatient gastrointestinal unit and diagnosed as having pelvic floor dyssynergia who completed a full course of biofeedback. Data have been collected using a standardised questionnaire. A questionnaire survey of patients' satisfaction rate and requirement of aperients was <b>undertaken.</b> <b>Mean</b> age and symptom duration were respectively 41 and 20 years. Half of patients reported fewer than 3 bowel motions per week. Patients were treated {{with a mean of}} 5 biofeedback sessions. At the end of the therapy pelvic floor dyssynergia was alleviated in 85 % of patients and 49 % were able to stop all aperients. Satisfaction was maintained at follow-up telephone interviews <b>undertaken</b> after a <b>mean</b> period of 2 years, as biofeedback was helpful for 79 % of patients and 47 % still abstained from intake of aperients. Satisfaction after biofeedback is high for patients referred for chronic constipation and diagnosed with pelvic floor dyssynergia. Biofeedback improves symptoms related to dyschezia and reduces use of aperients...|$|R
