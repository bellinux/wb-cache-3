The current multicenter study based in rural Sri Lanka assessed clinical profiles, poison related factors, clinical management, complications, outcomes, and risk factors associated with <b>plant</b> <b>poisoning</b> in the paediatric age group. Among 325 children, 57 % were male with 64 % being below five years of age. 99. 4 % had ingested the poison. Transfer rate was 66. 4 %.

Presence of poisonous plants in home garden was the strongest risk factor for <b>plant</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Mortality rate was 1. 2 % and all cases had Oleander poisoning. The study revealed the value of community awareness regarding risk factors and awareness among healthcare workers regarding the mostly benign nature of <b>plant</b> <b>poisoning</b> in children in view of limiting incidence of <b>plant</b> <b>poisoning</b> and reducing expenditure on patient management...|$|R

50|$|Monarch {{butterfly}}: The {{monarch butterfly}} is {{a species that}} has an orange and black wing pattern that {{is very easy to}} spot. This coloration of the monarch is non-beneficial to its fitness. It is not beneficial because the bright colors will attract their predators. However, they are able to counteract this non-beneficial trait because they have the ability to feed on poisonous milk weed which deposits potent <b>plant</b> <b>poison</b> in their tissues. Therefore, when a predator ingests them it will induce them to vomit, because of the poison within the butterflies system. Though a monarch butterfly will be sacrificing itself through this process, it is able to help its own kind by educating their predators as to the harmfulness of eating them. The genetically similar monarchs will then be able to survive and pass on the shared genes to the next monarch generation.|$|E

40|$|The {{people of}} Chea village, {{centrally}} {{located in the}} great Marovo Lagoon of the western Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, organize annual communal fishing expeditions called kuarao, in which the entire village community takes part. Early in the morning a large circle of bush vines is {{laid out in the}} lagoon waters near the barrier reef. As people swim with the vines and drag them along, large numbers of fish caught by surprise inside the gradually narrowing circle are herded together, until finally a tightly packed mass of fish can be stunned with a <b>plant</b> <b>poison</b> and collected in canoes. The kuarao of the Solomon Islands, as exemplified in this film about the efforts of Chea villagers in September 1996, serves as a powerful linkage between ancestral traditions, customary ownership of the sea, and surplus production for modern cash needs. "Chea's Great Kuarao" is based on the long-term work of anthropologist Edvard Hviding in the Marovo Lagoon.

This is a large retrospective study form the Emergency Department (ED) of Tertiary Care Center of South India to describe the clinicodemographic features of DSH cases. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at ED of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India from January 01, 2011 to December 31, 2013. All cases of DSH {{were included in the}} study. The demographic details, mode of DSH and clinical outcome were extracted from the electronic medical record. Descriptive statistics are presented. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. For all tests, a two-sided P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Total of 1228 patients were admitted to ED for DSH during the study period. Male and female occurred in equal ratio. More than half of the cases occurred among age group below 30 years. Consumption of pesticides (agricultural chemicals) was the single most common mode of DSH (46 %), especially among men, followed by medication overdose (29. 8 %). Consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>poison</b> and tablet overdose was higher among women. Overall mortality due to DSH was low (1. 5 %) in our study.

40|$|Arctic charr is a {{suitable}} host to Gyrodactylus salaris, and G. salaris is a non-pathogen to this host species. This parasite is highly pathogenic to Norwegian Atlantic salmon {{and it has}} driven most affected salmon populations to extinction. In Troms County in northern Norway, two rivers are infected. These two rivers, Skibotnelva and Signaldalselva, are the northernmost G. salaris infected rivers in Norway and the natural salmon populations are regarded extinct or close to extinction due to the parasite. Skibotnelva has been treated twice with the <b>plant</b> <b>poison</b> rotenone. Both treatments failed, and an ongoing hypothesis is that the occurrence of Arctic charr is {{the main cause of}} this. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the role of Arctic charr as a long-term host to G. salaris. Both field and experimental studies have been undertaken. It was found that the abundance of G. salaris varies significantly throughout the year in both Skibotnelva and Signaldalselva, and is highest in the autumn and lowest in the spring. These seasonal fluctuations were repeated between years, and are mainly explained as temperature dependent constraints upon parasite reproduction in combination with host immune responses. Further, it was documented that Arctic charr in allopatry can sustain a G. salaris population during the five winter months, and also that newly hatched charr fry are highly susceptible to the parasite. The newly hatched charr fry experienced additive parasite induced mortality. Furthermore, experimental studies indicated that parasite transmission occurs frequently within the charr fry population at all times during the colonization process. Hence, transmission probably is an important process in determining the infrapopulation structure by reducing the over-dispersion of G. salaris between hosts, and also may contribute to a prolonged period of growth of the parasite metapopulation. In conclusion, this study clearly indicates that Arctic charr has to be valued as an important and adequate host to G. salaris which can sustain the parasite population within watercourses independent of the presence of infected salmon...|$|E
