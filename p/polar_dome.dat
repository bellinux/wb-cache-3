Although {{progress has been made}} in understanding the relevant processes involved, there are several widely held misconceptions that are inhibiting further advances. These include the idea that plasma ``must'' be accelerated from the magnetic polar caps (the basis for the ``Hollow Cone Model'') and the idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large amplitude electromagnetic waves playing no role whatsoever. However, recent theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest HST and CHANDRA images, providing hope for the future. No less than 3 groups have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star consists of two <b>polar</b> <b>domes</b> and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this distribution renders the Goldreich-Julian model irrelevant (i. e., along with most of the theoretical publications over the last 33 years) ...|$|R

40|$|The magnetospheric plasma {{distribution}} {{in the vicinity of}} a pulsar at various inclination angles is investigated using a new relativistic, parallel 3 D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code DYMPHNA 3 D. DYMPHNA 3 D uses a superposition of the electromagnetic fields associated with a rotating magnetised conducting sphere in a vacuum (the pulsar fields) and the electromagnetic fields due to the presence of the magnetospheric plasma surrounding the pulsar (the plasma fields), as the total fields. The plasma is moved self-consistently through the magnetosphere using the PIC methodology. Our initial simulation results are presented here. These show similar solutions to those obtained from previous numerical simulations, which show the fundamental plasma {{distribution in}} the vicinity of an aligned rotating neutron star to consist of two <b>polar</b> <b>domes</b> and an equatorial torus of trapped non-neutral plasma of opposite sign. The aligned case being the case in which the inclination angle between the magnetic dipole moment and the rotation axis of the star is zero. Furthermore, our code allows for off-axis simulations and we have found that this plasma distribution collapses into a Quad-Lobe charge-separated non-neutral magnetospheric plasma {{distribution in the}} case of an orthogonal rotator, i. e., the case in which the magnetic dipole moment is oriented at right angles to the rotation axis of the neutron star, with the plasma remaining trapped close to the stellar surface by the force-free surfaces. We find that if initialised with a Goldreich-Julian type distribution, the system is seen to collapse rapidly into these stable Dome-Torus structures.

40|$|International audienceThe Arctic is warming {{much faster}} than any other {{place in the world}} and {{undergoes}} a rapid change dominated by a changing climate in this region. The impact of polluted air masses traveling to the Arctic from various remote sources significantly contributes to the observed climate change, in contrast there are additional local emission sources contributing to the level of pollutants (trace gases and aerosol). Processes affecting the emission and transport of these pollutants are not well understood and need to be further investigated. We present aircraft based trace gas measurements in the Arctic during RACEPAC (2014) and NETCARE (2014 and 2015) with the Polar 6 aircraft of Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) covering an area from 134 °W to 17 °W and 68 °N to 83 °N. We focus on cloud, aerosol and general transport processes of polluted air masses into the high Arctic. Based on CO and CO 2 measurements and kinematic 10 -day back trajectories we analyze the transport regimes prevalent during spring (RACEPAC 2014 and NETCARE 2015) and summer (NETCARE 2014) in the observed region. Whereas {{the eastern part of the}} Canadian Arctic is affected by air masses with their origin in Asia, in the central and western parts of the Canadian and European Arctic air masses from North America are predominant at the time of the measurement. In general the more northern parts of the Arctic were relatively unaffected by pollution from mid-latitudes since air masses mostly travel within the <b>polar</b> <b>dome,</b> being quite isolated. Associated mixing ratios of CO and CO 2 fit into the seasonal cycle observed at NOAA ground stations throughout the Arctic, but show a more mid-latitudinal characteristic at higher altitudes. The transition is remarkably sharp and allows for a chemical definition of the <b>polar</b> <b>dome.</b> At low altitudes, synoptic disturbances transport polluted air masses from mid-latitudes into regions of the <b>polar</b> <b>dome.</b> These air masses contribute to the Arctic pollution background, but also contain single pollution plumes that perturb the background tracer distribution. These plumes could be traced back to biomass burning or flaring in remote regions, as well as local ship emissions within the measurement region...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a key {{season in}} the annual water cycle (Ls∼ 120 °) a {{mesoscale}} model is used to study atmospheric water vapor and water ice clouds in the northern polar region of Mars. Model results at high-resolution (15 km) allow the examination of various mesoscale aspects of the circulation in this complex (topography, albedo and thermal inertia) region. A simple cloud scheme is used, where only the mean cloud particle size is carried, and nucleation is not explicitly treated. For this study, new high-resolution maps of albedo and thermal inertia were developed (poleward of 60 °N), and model ground temperatures are in good agreement with observations at high resolution, typically within ∼ 5 K of TES (for ice and non-ice locations at AM and PM times of day). Diurnal mean sublimation rates are greatest {{along the edges of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> and the largest outliers (∼ 25 – 50 μm/sol). This is a consequence of widespread stability (atmospheric inversion) over the cold interiors of the largest ice surfaces, as well as strong ventilating winds that are modeled around the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> with sufficient spatial resolution. The structure of high latitude atmospheric water vapor is complex, especially so near Phoenix. Dynamically, two factors are responsible: (1) the transient circulations that form in the baroclinic zone around the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> and (2) a “storm zone” that forms on the poleward slopes of Alba Patera where there is additional transient activity that has a sizeable effect on the Phoenix region. This “storm zone” forms because of a rapidly evolving aspect of the regional circulation, and it {{plays a key role in}} the seasonally recurring annular cloud (that is simulated in this study). Also simulated are observations made during the Phoenix mission that seem to be dynamically related to the appearance of the annular cloud. Together this may signify a seasonal transition in the region. To simulate realistic clouds over the polar region (compared with opacity observations and imagery), a sufficiently realistic circulation appears to be important, and relatively high spatial resolution is needed for this. If a low-resolution run (135 km, no nests) is compared to a high-resolution run (two levels of nesting to 15 km in the polar region), we find that the high-resolution case produces ten times less cloud ice over the most polar latitudes. The activation of the first nest (45 km) produces a sufficiently realistic circulation, such that excess vapor and cloud ice are readily ventilated equatorward from polar latitudes. A more sophisticated cloud scheme might serve to reduce the sensitivity seen in this study. However, sufficient spatial resolution is what causes the circulation to become realistic, and in this regard microphysics is not involved...|$|E

50|$|The {{decomposition}} of CO2 hydrate {{is believed to}} {{play a significant role}} in the terraforming processes on Mars, and many of the observed surface features are partly attributed to it. For instance, Musselwhite et al. (2001) argued that the Martian gullies had been formed not by liquid water but by liquid CO2, since the present Martian climate does not allow liquid water existence on the surface in general. This is especially true in the southern hemisphere, where most of the gully structures occur. However, water can be present there as ice Ih, CO2 hydrates or hydrates of other gases (e.g. Max & Clifford 2001, Pellenbarg et al. 2003). All these can be melted under certain conditions and result in gully formation. There might also be liquid water at depths >2 km under the surface (see geotherms in the phase diagram). It is believed that the melting of ground-ice by high heat fluxes formed the Martian chaotic terrains (Mckenzie & Nimmo 1999). Milton (1974) suggested the {{decomposition of}} CO2 clathrate caused rapid water outflows and formation of chaotic terrains. Cabrol et al. (1998) proposed that the physical environment and the morphology of the south <b>polar</b> <b>domes</b> on Mars suggest possible cryovolcanism. The surveyed region consisted of 1.5 km-thick-layered deposits covered seasonally by CO2 frost (Thomas et al. 1992) underlain by H2O ice and CO2 hydrate at depths > 10 m (Miller and Smythe, 1970). When the pressure and the temperature are raised above the stability limit, clathrate is decomposed into ice and gases, resulting in explosive eruptions.|$|R

To counter these environmental stresses, we offer the innovative artificial Evergreen <b>Polar</b> Zone <b>Dome</b> (EPZD), an inflated half-hemisphere with interiors continuously providing a Mediterranean Sea-like climate. The Evergreen EPZD structural theory is developed, substantiated by key computations that show {{it is possible for}} current building technology to construct and heat large enclosed volumes inexpensively. Specifically, a satisfactory result is reached by using sunlight reflectors and a special double thin film, which concentrates all available solar energy inside the EPZD while, at the same time markedly decreasing the heat loss to exterior Polar Region air. Someday a similar, but remarkably more technological, EPZD design may be employed at proposed Moon and Mars settlements.

40|$|Realistic {{simulation}} {{of physical and}} dynamical processes happening in the Arctic surface and atmosphere, and the interacting feedbacks of these processes is still a challenge for Arctic climate modelers. This is critical when further studies involving for the example transport mechanisms and pathways of pollutants from lower latitudes into the Arctic rely on {{the efficiency of the}} model to represent atmospheric circulation, especially given the complexity of the Arctic atmosphere. In this work we evaluate model performance of the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) according to the choice of two land surface model schemes (Noah and NoahMP) and two reanalyzes data for initialization to create lateral boundary conditions (ERA-interim and ASR) to simulate surface and atmosphere dynamics including the location and displacement of the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> and other features characterizing atmospheric circulation associated to sea ice maxima/minima extent within the Eurasian Arctic conformed by the Nordic countries in Northern Europe and part of West Russia. Sensitivity analyses include simulations at 15 km horizontal resolution within a period of five years from 2008 to 2012. The WRF model simulations are evaluated against surface meteorological data from automated weather stations and atmospheric profiles from radiosondes. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the atmospheric dynamics and vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere reasonably well. The model is, however, sensitive to the choice of the reanalyses used for initialization and land surface scheme with signiﬁcant biases in the simulated description of surface meteorology and winds, moisture and temperature proﬁles. The best choice of physical parameterization is then used in the WRF with coupled chemistry (WRF-Chem) to ssimulate BC concentrations in several case studies within the analyzed period in our domain and assess the role of modeled circulation in concentrations of BC inside our Arctic domain.

40|$|We {{quantify}} source {{contributions to}} springtime (April  2008) surface black carbon (BC) in the Arctic by interpreting surface observations of BC at five receptor sites (Denali, Barrow, Alert, Zeppelin, and Summit) using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and its adjoint. Contributions to BC at Barrow, Alert, and Zeppelin {{are dominated by}} Asian anthropogenic sources (40 – 43  %) before 18  April and by Siberian open biomass burning emissions (29 – 41  %) afterward. In contrast, Summit, a mostly free tropospheric site, has predominantly an Asian anthropogenic source contribution (24 – 68  %, {{with an average of}} 45  %). We compute the adjoint sensitivity of BC concentrations at the five sites during a pollution episode (20 – 25  April) to global emissions from 1  March to 25  April. The associated contributions are the combined results of these sensitivities and BC emissions. Local and regional anthropogenic sources in Alaska are the largest anthropogenic sources of BC at Denali (63  % of total anthropogenic contributions), and natural gas flaring emissions in the western extreme north of Russia (WENR) are the largest anthropogenic sources of BC at Zeppelin (26  %) and Alert (13  %). We find that long-range transport of emissions from Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (also known as Jing–Jin–Ji), the biggest urbanized region in northern China, contribute significantly (∼  10  %) to surface BC across the Arctic. On average, it takes ∼  12  days for Asian anthropogenic emissions and Siberian biomass burning emissions to reach the Arctic lower troposphere, supporting earlier studies. Natural gas flaring emissions from the WENR reach Zeppelin in about a week. We find that episodic transport events dominate BC at Denali (87  %), a site outside the Arctic front, which is a strong transport barrier. The relative contribution of these events to surface BC within the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> is much smaller (∼[*] 50  % at Barrow and Zeppelin and ∼  10  % at Alert). The large contributions from Asian anthropogenic sources are predominately in the form of chronic pollution (∼  40  % at Barrow, 65  % at Alert, and 57  % at Zeppelin) on about a 1 -month timescale. As such, it is likely that previous studies using 5 - or 10 -day trajectory analyses strongly underestimated the contribution from Asia to surface BC in the Arctic...|$|E
40|$|A {{realistic}} {{simulation of}} physical and dynamical processes in the Arctic atmosphere and its feedbacks with the surface conditions is still a challenge for state-of-the-art Arctic climate models. This is of critical importance because studies of, for example, transport of pollutants from middle latitudes into the Arctic rely on the skill of the model in correctly representing atmospheric circulation including the key mechanisms and pathways of pollutant transport. In this work {{the performance of the}} Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) with two land surface model schemes (Noah and NoahMP) and two reanalysis data sets for creation of lateral boundary conditions (ERA-interim and ASR) is evaluated focusing on meteorological surface properties and atmospheric dynamics. This includes the position and displacement of the <b>polar</b> <b>dome</b> and other features characterizing atmospheric circulation associated to sea ice maxima/minima extent within the Eurasian Arctic. The model simulations analyzed are carried out at 15 -km horizontal resolution over a period of five years (2008 to 2012). The WRF model simulations are evaluated against surface meteorological data from automated weather stations and vertical profiles from radiosondes. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the atmospheric dynamics and vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere reasonably well. The influence of the choice of the reanalyses used as initial and lateral boundary condition and of the LSM on the model results is complex and no combination is found to be clearly superior in all variables analyzed. The model results show that a more sophisticated formulation of land surface processes does not necessarily lead to significant improvements in the model results. This suggests that other factors such as the decline of the Arctic sea ice, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, atmosphere-ocean interaction, and boundary layer processes are also highly important and can have a significant influence on the model results. The “best” configuration for simulating Arctic meteorology and processes most relevant for pollutant transport (ASR + NoahMP) is then used in a simulation with WRF including aerosols and chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate black carbon (BC) concentrations in and around the Arctic and to assess the role of the modeled atmospheric circulation in the simulated BC concentrations inside the Arctic domain. Results from simulations with chemistry are evaluated against aerosol optical depth from several Aeronet stations and BC concentrations and particle number concentrations from several stations from the EBAS database. The results with WRF-Chem show a strong dependency of the simulated BC concentration on the modeled meteorology and the transport of the pollutants around our domain. The results also show that biases in the modeled BC concentrations can also be related to the emission data. Significant improvements of the models and of our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic BC emissions on the Arctic strongly depends on the availability of suitable, long-term observational data of concentrations of BC and particulate matter, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity and wind...|$|E

The detailed snowpack model Crocus is such a scheme, and has been run operationally for avalanche forecasting over the French mountains for 20 years. It is also used for climate or hydrological studies. To extend its potential applications, Crocus has been recently integrated {{within the framework of}} the externalized surface module SURFEX. SURFEX computes the exchanges of energy and mass between different types of surface, and the atmosphere and includes in particular the land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere). It allows Crocus to be run either in stand-alone mode, using a time series of forcing meteorological data or in fully coupled mode (explicit or fully implicit numerics) with atmospheric models ranging from meso-scale models to general circulation models. This approach also insures a full coupling between the snow cover and the soil beneath. Several applications of this new simulation platform are presented. They range from a 1 D stand-alone simulation (Col de Porte, France) to fully-distributed simulations in complex terrain, either in forced mode over a whole mountain range (Massif des Grandes Rousses, France), or in coupled mode such as a snow transport simulation (Col du Lac Blanc, France), or a surface energy balance and boundary layer simulation over a <b>polar</b> ice cap (<b>Dome</b> C, Antarctica) ...|$|R

With an orbital period of 11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8 th, is identified tentatively. Its midtime, T_C= 2, 457, 640. 1990 ± 0. 0017 HJD, is consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1 σ confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence level of 2. 5 σ. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima Centauri in next <b>Polar</b> night at <b>Dome</b> A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of continuous darkness.

This is the first evidence of this for H- 2402 and H- 1202. A 2 -D atmospheric model was run with emissions previously derived using archive air measurements from the southern hemisphere mid-latitudes to produce historical trends in atmospheric concentrations at the firn sites, which were then input into a firn diffusion model to produce concentration depth profiles for comparison with the firn measurements. This comparison provides an evaluation of the model-derived atmospheric concentration histories in both hemispheres and thus an indirect evaluation of the emission rates and distributions used in the atmospheric model. Atmospheric concentration trends produced using global emissions previously determined from measurements at Cape Grim are found to be consistent with the firn data from the southern hemisphere. Further emissions of H- 1202 in recent years (late 1980 s onwards) are likely to have come from latitudes mostly south of 40 ° N, but emissions prior to that may have come from further north. Emissions of H- 1211 may also have shifted to latitudes south of 40 ° N during the late 1980 s.
