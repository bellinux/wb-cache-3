This used a 2268x1512×3 (3.54×3 MP) iteration of the sensor, and was built on a Sigma-designed body using the Sigma SA mount. The camera was followed in 2003 by the improved but technically similar Sigma SD10, which was in turn superseded in 2006 by the Sigma SD14, which used a higher-resolution, 2640×1760×3 sensor. Sigma announced a successor, the Sigma SD15, in 2008, although the camera did not go on sale until June 2010. It used the same 2640×1760×3 (4.7×3 MP) sensor as the SD14. As of 2011, it is Sigma's current <b>prosumer</b> digital SLR.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this article}} concerns the fact that consumers of the eSports experience {{can be regarded as}} <b>prosumers.</b> This conclusion is based on an observational study carried out at Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice. Consumers of the eSports experience take on the role of <b>prosumers</b> as they contribute with resources such as time, money, skills and efforts, as well as engagement and creativity, which creates value not only for themselves, but adds to the entire experience.

We conclude that the motivations of <b>prosumers</b> are similar to the motivations of the consumers of the eSports experience. However, not all consumers of eSports are <b>prosumers.</b> Marketing actors within eSports cannot force the consumers to take on the role of <b>prosumers,</b> but they can however encourage them to collaborate by providing the consumers with opportunities to contribute with their resources in co-creational efforts such as collaborative marketing.

In this paper, a Stackelberg game approach for ESM is proposed. First, according to feed-in-tariff of PV energy, a system model of ESM is introduced, which includes the profit model of microgrid operator (MGO) and the utility model of PV <b>prosumers.</b> Moreover, an hour-ahead optimal pricing model of ESM is proposed. The model is designed based on Stackelberg game, where the MGO acts as the leader and all participating <b>prosumers</b> are considered as the followers. With the proof of equilibrium and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, the MGO is obligated to coordinate the sharing of PV energy with maximization of the own profit, while the <b>prosumers</b> are autonomous to maximize their utilities with demand response availability. Finally, a billing mechanism is designed to deal with the uncertainty of PV energy and load consumption.

Equipped with {{renewable}} energy generators, pro-sumers produce, store and consume energy {{and become an}} important entity in smart grids. With time-variant power demands and generation capacities, <b>prosumers</b> can exchange energy via local power lines with less transmission loss than the long-distance power lines to the traditional power plants. In this paper, we develop a local power exchange game and address the cheating problem that seller <b>prosumers</b> actually supply insufficient energy instead of the promised amount in the trade. We apply the indirect reciprocity principle to build an anti-cheating local energy exchange system that maintains reputations for the <b>prosumers</b> according to their selling histories. By supplying less energy to the buyers who cheated in previous trades, this system motivates the autonomous <b>prosumers</b> to cooperate instead of cheating. Simulation results have shown that this strategy significantly reduces the number of cheating <b>prosumers</b> and improves the overall system utility. Compared with the direct reciprocity-based counterpart, this system reaches the desirable equilibrium much faster and requires less energy from the traditional energy plants. ? 2014 IEEE...|$|R

First, the dynamic internal pricing model for the trading between PVCO and <b>prosumers</b> is formulated according to the economic principle of demand and supply relation. Moreover, in order to improve the local consumption of PV energy, the DR model is formulated as a non-cooperative game among the <b>prosumers.</b> Meanwhile, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) are proved, and a distributed solving algorithm is introduced to approach the NE solution.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of energy trading between smart grid <b>prosumers,</b> who can {{simultaneously}} consume and produce energy, and a grid power company is studied. The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower Stackelberg game between the power company and multiple <b>prosumers.</b> In this game, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits, while the <b>prosumers</b> act as followers who react by choosing {{the amount of energy}} to buy or sell so as to optimize their current and future profits. The proposed game accounts for each <b>prosumer's</b> subjective decision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random future price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory (PT), is used to account for each <b>prosumer's</b> valuation of its gains and losses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference point changes between <b>prosumers</b> and stems from their past experience and future aspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory (CGT) which is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended to account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an NE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load varies significantly with the prosumers' reference point and their loss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that the power company's profits considerably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective perceptions under PT...|$|R

The DR module is, in essence, an optimization problem that seeks to meet the objective of the distribution system operator (DSO); it minimizes active power losses, by utilizing the potential flexibility <b>prosumers</b> can provide.

40|$|This paper studies {{optimal control}} of a micro grid of biogas <b>prosumers.</b> The biogas {{production}} is kept at a nearly constant level due to {{the time and effort}} associated with establishing the right microbial populations. However, as (bio) gas is predominantly used for space heating, the consumption level fluctuates over a year due to climate and weather patterns. It leads to mismatch between supply and demand that <b>prosumers</b> can mitigate by using local storage device. The <b>prosumers</b> may contribute to supply-demand balance of other <b>prosumers</b> by selling their excess production. Furthermore, excess production can be upgraded and injected into the low-pressure gas grid or, alternatively, shipped per lorry to be used elsewhere in order to create revenue. Since a storage installation and the integration in the grid is costly, it is of interest to study which size of the storage device is best suited and provides the best value for such integration in the grid. In this paper, given a storage size we formulate a profit maximization done by maximizing expected revenue and minimizing all costs involved.

40|$|As the European Union is {{on track}} to meet its 2020 energy targets on raising the share of {{renewable}} energy and increasing the efficiency in the energy consumption, considerable attention has been given to the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the restructured distribution system. This thesis proposes market-oriented operations of micro virtual power <b>prosumers</b> (J. lVPPs) in the distribution system operator framework, in which the J. lVPPs evolve from home-oriented energy management systems to price-taking <b>prosumers</b> and to price-making <b>prosumers.</b> Considering the diversity of the DERs installed in the residential sector, a configurable J. l VPP is proposed first to deliver multiple energy services using a fuzzy logic-based generic algorithm. By responding to the retail price dynamics and applying load control, the J. lVPP achieves considerable electricity bill savings, active utilisation of energy storage system and fast return on investment. As the J. lVPPs enter the distribution system market, they are modelled as price-takers in a two-settlement market first and a chance-constrained formulation is proposed to derive the bidding strategies. The obtained strategy demonstrates its ability to bring the J. l VPP maximum profit based on different composition of DERs and to maintain adequate supply capacity to meet the demand considering the volatile renewable generation and load forecast. Given the non-cooperative nature of the actual market, the J. l VPPs are transformed into price-makers and their market behaviours are studied in the context of electricity market equilibrium models. The resulted equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) are presented and solved using a novel application of coevolutionary approach. Compared with the roles of home-oriented energy management systems and price-taking <b>prosumers,</b> the J. lVPPs as price­ making <b>prosumers</b> have an improved utilisation rate of the installed DER capacity and a guaranteed profit from participating in the distribution system market...|$|R
