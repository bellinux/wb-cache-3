5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation, another {{complication of}} rhabdomyolysis {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing platelet count or prolongation of the <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time.</b> The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as D-dimer.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time,</b> partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels.

5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time.</b> After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the predictive value of physical signs for ascites, {{we compared the}} results of physical examination with those of abdominal sonography in 90 men in hospital with liver disease. The positive predictive values of shifting dullness and prominent fluid waves were low (51 % and 73 %). We divided the patients into two groups: those with prolonged <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> (72 % prevalence of ascites by sonogram), and those with normal <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> (15 % prevalence). In patients with prolonged <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times,</b> a prominent fluid wave had a very high positive predictive value for ascites (96 %). Many patients with prolonged <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> had ascites despite negative physical signs. In contrast, in those with normal <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times,</b> both shifting dullness and prominent fluid waves were usually falsely positive. Patients with normal <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> and no shifting dullness rarely (2 %) had ascites...|$|R
40|$|Warfarin sodium was {{compared}} with bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) in 16 patients on long-term anticoagulant therapy.

The tests were performed on postcolostral calves and on mature cows to compare their values with those of precolostral calves. The mean values of <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> and partial thromboplastin times of precolostral calves in the first group were 18. 8 seconds and 54. 8 seconds respectively. The mean values of <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> and partial thromboplastin times of precolostral calves in the second group were 18. 8 seconds and 50. 8 seconds respectively.

5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time,</b> vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: In {{patients}} with mechanical prosthetic heart valves or atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events, several factors influence adherence and anticoagulation complications. Objective: To evaluate {{the factors that}} interfere with the quality and complications of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 100 patients, in the period from 2011 to 2014, was performed. Anticoagulation conditions in the last year, regarding the presence of complications (embolisms/bleeding) and inadequate treatment were assessed: achievement of less than 8 annual <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> and International Normalized Ratio outside therapeutic target in more than 40 % of <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times.</b> Results: There were 31 complications (22 minor bleeding without hospitalization and 9 major complications: 7 bleeding with hospitalization and two emboli); 70 were with International Normalized Ratio outside the target in more than 40 % of the tests and 36 with insufficient number of <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times.</b> Socioeconomic factors, anticoagulant type and anticoagulation reason had no relationship with complications or with inadequate treatment. There were more complications in {{patients with}} longer duration of anticoagulation (P= 0. 001). Women had more International Normalized Ratio outside the target range (OR 2. 61, CI: 1. 0 - 6. 5; P= 0. 04). Patients with lower number of annual <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> had longer times of anticoagulation (P= 0. 03), less annual consultations (P= 0. 02) and less dose adjustments (P= 0. 003). Patients with longer duration of anticoagulation have more complications (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: There was {{a high rate of}} major complications and International Normalized Ratio was outside the goal. Less annual <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> was related to longer duration of anticoagulation, less annual consultations and less dose adjustments. More major complications occurred in patients with longer duration of anticoagulation...|$|R

5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time,</b> or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E

40|$|Although {{coagulopathy}} is {{a well-known}} complication of severe niacin- induced hepatotoxic reaction, it is not found in patients with minimal aminotransferase level elevations. Three patients with significant clotting factor synthesis deficiency and coagulopathy (<b>prothrombin</b> <b>times,</b> > 1. 5 times control) from sustained-release niacin had only mild aminotransferase level elevations (1. 5 to 2. 0 times normal). In each case, protein deficiency, coagulopathy, and aminotransferase level elevation resolved promptly after withdrawal of niacin therapy. In one case, this syndrome recurred after rechallenge with sustained-release niacin, whereas the coagulopathy did not recur in a second patient rechallenged with crystalline niacin. Deficiency in protein synthesis, including coagulation factors, and coagulopathy are unrecognized complications of sustained-release niacin therapy. These cases indicate the need to measure <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> routinely in patients who develop even mild aminotransferase level elevation while receiving sustained- release niacin therapy. These data are important {{in light of the}} increasing use of sustained-release niacin in the treatment of patients with lipid disorders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sweet clover {{poisoning}} in cattle {{is caused}} by an anticoagulant (dicumarol) that is formed in moldy sweet clover hay. Previous experiments with vitamin K 3 and vitamin K 3 in therapy trials indicated that vitamin K 3 was effective in reducing <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> but vitamin K 3 was not. As a possible alternative {{in the use of}} toxic sweet clover hays, vitamin K 3 was evaluated to see if it would prevent hemorrhagic crises when fed to cattle consuming toxic sweet clover hay. Vitamin K 3 levels of 0, 0. 45, 4. 5, 11, and 45 mg/kg body weight/day were fed to 173 - 235 -kg steers consuming toxic (40 - 50 ppm dicumarol) sweet clover. The 45 -mg K 3 /kg/day supplement was not palatable and had to be discontinued. The 0. 45, 4. 5, and 11 -mg K 3 /kg/day supplements did not significantly reduce the <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> as compared to the 0 -mg K 3 /kg/day group. Sweet clover poisoning is a common livestock prob-lem in the northern plains. It {{is caused by}} dicumarol, a fungal metabolite produced from substrates in sweet clover hay. 3, 7, 9 Despite the potential toxicity of sweet clover, it is still fed to animals in the northern plains as it compares favorably with alfalfa hay in quality, utility, and cost. 2 Previously, North Dakota State Uni...|$|R
40|$|Arterial {{thrombosis}} and renal {{vein thrombosis}} occurred in {{two men and}} one woman, respectively, treated with steroids for the nephrotic syndrome. Raised serum cholesterol occurred in one patient only. Though bleeding, clotting, and <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times,</b> {{as well as the}} platelet counts, were normal, the rate of thromboplastin generation was increased in all three patients. Adding heparin to the plasma of one patient slowed the rate, and suggested that the raised rate could be due to removal or suppression of such normal circulating coagulation inhibitors. The thromboplastin generation test seems to be useful in diagnosing and managing such hypercoagulable states, and may help in further investigations of their causes...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-three general {{surgical}} patients {{completed the}} standardized bleeding history questionnaire, and screening tests of platelet counts, <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times,</b> partial thromboplastin times, and Ivy bleeding times were done on these patients.

25|$|The <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> is {{the time}} it takes plasma to clot after {{addition}} of tissue factor (obtained from animals such as rabbits, or recombinant tissue factor, or from brains of autopsy patients). This measures the quality of the extrinsic pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. The speed of the extrinsic pathway is greatly affected by levels of functional factor VII in the body. Factor VII has a short half-life and the carboxylation of its glutamate residues requires vitamin K. The <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> can be prolonged as a result of deficiencies in vitamin K, warfarin therapy, malabsorption, or lack of intestinal colonization by bacteria (such as in newborns). In addition, poor factor VII synthesis (due to liver disease) or increased consumption (in disseminated intravascular coagulation) may prolong the PT.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{is drawn}} into a test tube {{containing}} liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> is most commonly measured using blood plasma). In newborns, a capillary whole blood specimen is used.|$|E
25|$|The <b>prothrombin</b> <b>time</b> (PT) test {{measures}} {{the time required}} for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid {{and put in a}} fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{thromboplastin}} was a lab reagent, usually {{derived from}} placental sources, used to assay <b>prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> (PT time). Thromboplastin, by itself, could activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. When manipulated in the laboratory, a derivative could be created called partial thromboplastin. Partial thromboplastin {{was used to}} measure the intrinsic pathway. This test is called the aPTT, or activated partial thromboplastin time. It was not until much later that the subcomponents of thromboplastin and partial thromboplastin were identified. Thromboplastin is the combination of both phospholipids and tissue factor, both needed in the activation of the extrinsic pathway, and partial thromboplastin is just phospholipids without tissue factor. Tissue factor is not needed to activate the intrinsic pathway.|$|R
50|$|Automated {{coagulation}} machines or Coagulometers {{measure the}} ability of blood to clot by performing any of several types of tests including Partial thromboplastin <b>times,</b> <b>Prothrombin</b> <b>times</b> (and the calculated INRs commonly used for therapeutic evaluation), Lupus anticoagulant screens, D dimer assays, and factor assays. Coagulometers require blood samples that have been drawn in tubes containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. These are used because the mechanism behind the anticoagulant effect of sodium citrate is reversible. Depending on the test, different substances {{can be added to}} the blood plasma to trigger a clotting reaction. The progress of clotting may be monitored optically by measuring the absorbance of a particular wavelength of light by the sample and how it changes over time.|$|R
