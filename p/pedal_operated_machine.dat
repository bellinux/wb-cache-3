Authors designed this pedal operated injection moulding machine to reduce the manual effort to operate the machine. Human fatigue can also be reduced as the posture of the operator changes and leg is used to operate the <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> <b>machine.</b> The efficiency of an operator may also be improved and operation will be quick, resulting improved productivity by using this machine.

5000|$|Another area of {{innovation}} for Tony Jr. {{has been the}} pick imprinting processes. From the very beginning, simple hot stamping {{had been used to}} identify the picks, first with a D'Andrea logo and then simple block letter dies for a player name. These were originally imprinted in one shot, foot <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> <b>machines.</b> One of the first to make the player imprint popular was Nick Lucas. In the 1930s, using the old round top #351 pick Luigi developed for him, each pick was imprinted with his logo and sold as a [...] "Nick Lucas" [...] pick. The 1950s saw the advent of mass-producing private labeled picks for guitar companies, requiring sophisticated automated printing and packaging. The 1960s was the heyday of rock and every player and store wanted their pick personalized. Tony developed some of the fastest multi-shot equipment for punching, imprinting and bagging. In the 1990s he revolutionized the imprint process with the introduction of pad printing. It overcame some of the speed and design limitations of hot stamping. Now very intricate logos can be produced by computer generation and they can be multicolored. By 1996, even a photograph could be imprinted on a pick! ...|$|R
40|$|Winnowing of cowpea {{has been}} widely done {{manually}} in developing countries, such as Nigeria. The need to develop machines to ease this task cannot be overemphasized. As such, a <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> cowpea winnower <b>machine</b> was designed and fabricated in the Department of Agricultural and Bio-Environmental Engineering Department of Federal College of Agriculture, Akure with locally sourced materials. The machine which required 0. 12 Kw energy was evaluated based on three different speeds of feeder rotation of 54 rpm, 108 rpm and 216 rpm and at a constant speed of fan rotation of 108 rpm. The result of the machine, after testing shows that the winnower has a maximum capacity of 374 kg/h and 90 % cleaning efficiency. This is better than manual operated winnower. Also, the optimum speed of feeder, capacity and cleaning efficiency were 195 rpm, 310 kg/h and 63 % respectively. The cost of production of machine was N 66, 500...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} {{of a low}} cost <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> incense-stick making <b>machine</b> to alleviate the labor intensive work associated with the production of bamboo-cored incense sticks is outlined in this paper. The machine {{is based on the}} mechanism of extruding the incense stick paste over the bamboo stick. The main components of this machine include a foot-pedal a compound gear-train system rack and pinion system and an extruder. As the paste used is of a semi-solid nature and a high force was needed for extrusion a confined compression test using Universal Testing Machine was carried out to obtain rough estimates of the force required for the extrusion. During this experiment a known force was applied varied and exerted on the rack until the paste was extruded out of the die. Using this force estimate FEA analysis and theoretical calculations a suitable two-stage compound gear-train system and a foot-pedal was designed. The lever and gear-train system was designed ergonomically so that the applied force results in a minimal muscle fatigue for the operator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The socio {{economic}} conditions of peoples living in village sides {{of developing countries}} like India, ever increasing energy crises, and the increasing awareness to ourselves physically fit are the driving forces {{for the development of}} <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> mechanisms for performing many day to day activities. Such human energized mechanisms are used to generate power, to operate flour mill etc. But one common oblivious question that stuck in everyone’s mind is about the level of comfort that it provide during its operation. Wheat and wheat flour forms the staple food of majority of population in India. Hence to encompass all these needs and facts, in this paper an attempt is made to develop an <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> flour mill with giving due respect to human capabilities. To make this design of <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> flour mill is ergonomically viable the structure (geometry) of the flour mill is made by taking into consideration the anthropometric data so as to provide comfortable posture during its operation.

50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} front brake lever {{operates}} both {{the front and rear}} brakes, while the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>operates</b> only the rear brake. In the inverse, Honda's system that features both combined brakes and anti-lock brakes is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the rear brake <b>pedal</b> <b>operates</b> both front and rear brake, and the front brake lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear brake. ABS modulators are installed on both the front and rear wheel.|$|R

50|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum <b>pedal</b> <b>operates</b> much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.A double bass drum <b>pedal</b> <b>operates</b> much the same way only with a second footplate controlling a second beater on the same drum. Most commonly this is attached by a shaft to a remote beater mechanism alongside the primary pedal mechanism. One notable exception to this pattern is the symmetrical Sleishman twin bass drum pedal.|$|R
50|$|The AC50 class yachts {{used in the}} America's Cup {{competition}} {{have four}} positions (on each side) for grinders.

However, in 2017 Team New Zealand changed their grinding system to <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> positions similar to exercise bikes. This change reportedly gained a 40% increase in power delivered to the hydraulic system.|$|R

25|$|The first 800 {{units were}} sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the clutch and brake pedals. The middle pedal {{was used to}} engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> the {{transmission}} brake – there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the parking brake, which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{most modern}} {{motorcycles}} use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the <b>pedal</b> <b>operated</b> selector on modern motorcycles, with no neutral position between gears (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is {{not conducive to}} having the long shift time of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either to stop, slow down, or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.|$|R
50|$|The foot <b>pedal</b> <b>operates</b> by rod a {{transmission}} brake {{mounted on the}} rear end of the gearbox's second motion shaft. It {{is described as a}} powerful double-acting band brake. The brake's drum is surrounded by a water jacket. The hand lever operated side brakes (on the rear wheels) are also double-acting band brakes. These drums are fixed to the rear wheels. The operating lever is inside the car by the right hand of the driver. The system of rods and levers incorporates an equalising arrangement.|$|R
