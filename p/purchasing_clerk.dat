5000|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Malaya Leong Sin Nam first worked as a mining {{labourer}} then as a <b>purchasing</b> <b>clerk</b> in Perak. He worked and lived in a mining [...] "kongsi" [...] under the [...] "Co-Operative System", {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Fun-Si-Kai", whereby the employed entered himself as a shareholder, identifying his fortune with those of the mine. It was a long and hard struggle to make ends meet in the beginning, but with perseverance and self-denial, he succeeded brilliantly. He steadily climbed the ladder to become a supervisor. He was hardworking and made the best of his job. His employer, Leong Pit Loo, trusted and relied heavily on him for advice. In 1906, at age 25 years, they both went to Keng Chiow, China to investigate and learn more about the mining industry. This and other experiences laid the foundation for his future mining business. Leong Sin Nam once worked in the Leong Fee's tin mine at Tambun, four miles (6 km) away from Ipoh.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{research}} project which examines the feasibility of developing a machine-independent audit trail analyser (MIATA). MIATA is a knowledge based system which performs intelligent analysis of operating system audit trails. Such a system is proposed as a decision support tool for auditors when assessing the risk of unauthorised user activity in multi-user computer systems. It is also relevant to the provision of a continuous assurance service to clients by internal and external auditors. Monitoring user activity in system audit trails manually is impractical because of the vast quantity of events recorded in those audit trails. However, if done manually, an expert security auditor would be needed to look for 2 main types of events - user activity rejected by the system's security settings (failed actions) and user's behaving abnormally (e. g. unexpected changes in activity such as the <b>purchasing</b> <b>clerk</b> attempting to modify payroll data). A knowledge based system is suited to applications that require expertise to perform well-defined, yet complex, monitoring activities (e. g. controlling nuclear reactors and detecting intrusions in computer systems). To permit machine-independent intelligent audit trail analysis, an anomaly-detection approach is adopted. Time series forecasting methods are used to develop and maintain the user profile database (knowledge base) that allows identification of users with rejected behaviour as well as abnormal behaviour. The knowledge based system maintains this knowledge base and permits reporting on the potential intruder threats (summarized in Table 1). The intelligence of the MIATA system is its ability to handle audit trails from any system, its knowledge base capturing rejected user activity and detecting anomalous activity, and its reporting capabilities focusing on known methods of intrusion. MIATA also updates user profiles and forecasts of behaviour on a daily basis. As such, it also 'learns' from changes in user behaviour. The feasibility of generating machine-independent audit trail records, and the applicability of the anomaly-detection approach and time series forecasting methods are demonstrated using three case studies. These results support the proposal that developing a machine-independent audit trail analyser is feasible. Such a system will be an invaluable aid to an auditor in detecting potential computer intrusions and monitoring user activity...|$|E
5000|$|Individuals whose trades weren't {{directly}} and obviously linked to specific environments [...] - [...] doctors, <b>purchasing</b> <b>clerks,</b> military police, etc. [...] - [...] might find themselves assigned {{to any one}} of the three environments. A fighter aircraft wing might end up with a medic in navy black and a procurement clerk in army green. As working in the occupation is often barely different, if at all, from one element to another, soldiers, sailors and aircrew are often placed on the same service branch or trade-specific course. For example, Military Police course candidates consist of members of the Army, Navy and Air Force on one course.|$|R

50|$|His break {{came when}} he got a call from Rotheray telling him Whitaker had left The Housemartins. Rotheray {{recommended}} him to Housemartins guitarist Stan Cullimore, who phoned him. He was working as a <b>purchase</b> ledger <b>clerk</b> at the time for the Crystal Motor Group. Hemingway quit his job on 6 March 1987, and soon found himself in the studio, recording the band's second album, The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to England Akenside unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} practice in Northampton. In 1744, he published his Epistle to Curio, attacking William Pulteney (afterwards Earl of Bath) for having abandoned his liberal principles to become {{a supporter of the}} government, and in the next year he produced a small volume of Odes on Several Subjects, in the preface to which he lays claim to correctness and a careful study of the best models. His friend Dyson had meanwhile left the bar, and had become, by <b>purchase,</b> <b>clerk</b> to the House of Commons. Akenside had come to London and was trying to make a practice at Hampstead. Dyson took a house there, and did all he could to further his friend's interest in the neighbourhood. But Akenside's arrogance and pedantry frustrated these efforts, and Dyson then took a house for him in Bloomsbury Square, making him independent of his profession by an allowance stated to have been £300 a year, but probably greater, for it is asserted that this income enabled him to [...] "keep a chariot", and to live [...] "incomparably well". In 1746 he wrote his much-praised [...] "Hymn to the Naiads", and he also became a contributor to Dodsley's Museum, or Literary and Historical Register. He was now twenty-five years old, and began to devote himself almost exclusively to his profession. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753.|$|R
50|$|Following the fire, in 1906, Frederick Mossop, {{a former}} hotel <b>clerk,</b> <b>purchased</b> the site at 56 Yonge Street with the {{intention}} of building a hotel. Mossop hired the renowned Canadian architect J.P. Hynes to design the building, which was intended from the outset to be completely fireproof. After three years of planning and construction, the 48-room, eight-storey hotel was finished at a cost of $250,000.|$|R
40|$|The Cocoa Livelihood Programme (CLP), an {{initiative}} of corporate organizations {{in collaboration with}} the World Cocoa Foundation (WFC) in line with their corporate social responsibility (CSR), was introduced in Ghana by Solidaridad West Africa in the year 2009. This CSR initiative is to promote sustainable livelihoods of cocoa farmers. Qualitative research method of approach was used to examine the impact of the CLP on the livelihoods of participating cocoa farmers in the Ahafo Ano South District using the five capitals of the Sustainable Livelihood (SL) Framework. Two research questions were answered using thematic coding and analysis. The findings show that the cocoa livelihood programme (CLP) is impacting positively on the lives of cocoa farmers studied thereby contributing to their social, natural, physical, financial and human capital livelihoods. The CLP programme has resulted in sound environmental management and practices among the cocoa farmers, preventing landing degradation whiles yields from their cocoa cultivation has increased which is helping them to save some money for future use. The study also reveals some challenges to cocoa farmers, which inhibit the realization of sustainable livelihood, even with the achievements under the CLP. Cheating through weighing scale adjustments by cocoa <b>purchasing</b> <b>clerks</b> (PCs) confirms earlier researches. Providing legal support to get official registration of the lands of cocoa farmers and business trainings are some of the findings, which were not captured in the literatures reviewed under this study. The conditions that farmers needs to fulfil in order to participate in the CLP initiative should be reviewed as some farmers may be excluded from the program. Also there should be effective enforcement of laws to prevent illegal encroachment of farmlands by both gold seekers and timber merchants to enable cocoa farmers achieve sustainable livelihood...|$|R
25|$|TA’s queuing studies {{concluded}} that <b>purchasing</b> tokens from <b>clerks</b> was not efficient. Preventing ‘slug’ use required sophisticated measures like tokens with metal alloy centers and electronic token verification devices. To provide better access control, the NYCTA experimented with floor-to-ceiling gates and “high wheel” turnstiles. Prototypes installed at 110th Street/Lexington Avenue station during a “target hardening” trial reduced evasions compared to nearby “control” stations. However, controls consisting entirely of “high-wheels” created draconian, prison-like environments, with detrimental effects on station aesthetics. Compromises with more secure low-turnstile designs were difficult, as AFC {{did not prevent}} fare evasion.|$|R
50|$|Some {{expensive}} merchandise {{will be in}} {{a locked}} case requiring an employee to get items at a customer's request. The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout register (under the supervision of a cashier) for the customer to purchase when finished shopping. This prevents the customer from having a chance to conceal the item. Another way of locking merchandise, especially popular in liquor stores, is to place it in a secure, store-administered hard-plastic cap on a regular bottle top. Once <b>purchased</b> the <b>clerk</b> will remove the cap with a store key. It is not otherwise easily removable. Many stores also lock CDs, DVDs, and video games in locking cases, which can only be opened by the checkout operator once the item has gone through the checkout. Many stores have certain items on locking pegs which are secure hooks to where the item cannot be removed from the hook.|$|R
5000|$|On Saturday, March 5, Judge Julius DuBose, {{a former}} Confederate soldier, {{was quoted in}} the Appeal-Avalanche {{newspaper}} as vowing to form a posse {{to get rid of the}} [...] "high-handed rowdies" [...] in the Curve. [...] That same day John Mosby, a black painter, was fatally shot after an altercation with a clerk in another white grocery in the Curve. As reported in the paper, Mosby cursed at the clerk after being denied credit for a <b>purchase</b> and the <b>clerk</b> responded by punching him. Mosby returned that evening and hit the clerk with a stick, whereupon the clerk shot him.|$|R
50|$|Soon Becky's resolve is {{weakened}} {{when she}} encounters what she feels {{is the chance}} of a lifetime - the opportunity to possess an Angel handbag, the bag of the season which she simply is determined to <b>purchase.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>clerk</b> tells her that there is a waiting list for the bag and she has to be put on there. A wealthy businessman, Nathan Temple, helps Becky jump {{to the head of the}} waiting list, because he and the owner are friends. She shows her gratitude by promising to pay him back somehow. Becky gives Luke the new belt, which he's pleased with believing she has changed.|$|R
2500|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an inked ribbon against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a <b>purchase,</b> a <b>clerk</b> retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.|$|R
50|$|Flagg {{was born}} in the parish of St. Thomas, near Charleston, South Carolina, January 5, 1792. His father, whose exact name he bore,was a native of Rhode Island, who served through the American Revolutionary War. Some of his early studies were pursued in Newport, Rhode Island. He {{graduated}} from Yale College in 1811. After leaving college he returned to South Carolina, and remained there for some years. He returned to New Haven, Connecticut and studied law with S.P. Staples, Esq., and began to engage in the practice of law. He took an active part in the political movements opposed to the Federalist Party in Connecticut, both as a public speaker and as an editor of the Connecticut Herald, which he had <b>purchased.</b> He was <b>Clerk</b> of the New Haven County Court.|$|R

50|$|The tub file was a {{technique}} {{used in the}} punched card era to speed generation of data files. Multiple copies of frequently used cards were prepunched and stored in trays with index tabs between card sets, arranged so that cards {{would be easy to}} find. For example, a wholesaler might have a tub file with cards for frequent customers and for each inventory item. Instead of keypunching a set of cards for each <b>purchase</b> order, a <b>clerk</b> would pull out a customer card and then a card for each item that customer ordered. The resulting deck could then be run through a tabulating machine to produce an invoice. This technique was an early form of random access memory and was the initial inspiration for the invention of the hard disk at IBM's San Jose Laboratory, what eventually became the IBM 305 RAMAC.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1924 Ontario {{prohibition}} plebiscite Ontarians voted narrowly, by {{a margin}} of 51.5% to 48.5%, to retain the Ontario Temperance Act as opposed to the government-controlled sales of beverage alcohol. The Conservative government of Howard Ferguson contested the 1926 provincial election on a platform of easing the temperance law. On being re-elected, it introduced the Liquor Control Act as a compromise between the complete prohibition demanded by the temperance movement and the unregulated sale of alcohol. Premier Ferguson stated that the Liquor Control Act was [...] "... to allow people to exercise a God-given freedom under reasonable restrictions". Ferguson was further quoted as saying the purpose of the LCBO was to [...] "promote temperance sobriety, personal liberty and, above all, to restore respect for the law".To achieve these goals LCBO was mandated by Ferguson’s Government to employ an oversight mechanism in order to know “exactly who is buying and how much, and what disposition is being made of it”.From 1927-1962 the LCBO required people who wanted to purchase liquor to possess a permit. They had to present these permits at the point of <b>purchase,</b> and the <b>clerk</b> at the liquor store would enter information about what, precisely, the individual purchased.|$|R
60|$|In one way, he had {{undergone}} a moral revolution. Her cleanness and purity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean. He must be {{that if he were}} ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her. He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and divined its use. While <b>purchasing</b> it, the <b>clerk</b> glanced at his nails, suggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional toilet- tool. He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr. Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water. Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers. Now that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class. Also, he learned the reason why, and invaded his sister's kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board. He had misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying another, which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to sea.|$|R
