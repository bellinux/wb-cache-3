40|$|Abstract. The {{experimental}} study {{deals with the}} effect of modification of the surface layer by irradiation cross-linking on the micromechanical properties of the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) tested using the instrumented nanohardness test. The surface layer of LDPE specimen made by injection technology was modified by irradiation cross-linking using beta irradiation, which significantly influences micromechanical properties of the surface layer. Compared to the heat and chemical-heat treatment of metal materials (e. g. hardening, nitridation, case hardening), cross-linking in polymers affects the surfaces in micro layers. These micromechanical changes of the surface layer are observed in the instrumented microhardness test. Our research confirms the comparable properties of surface layer of irradiated LDPE with highly efficient polymers. The subject {{of this research is}} the influence of irradiation dosage on the changes of micromechanical properties of surface layer of LDPE. Introduction. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is a commodity polymer used extensively in extrusion operations such as coating, blown film, blow molding, and foaming.

40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} effect of various substances {{was measured in}} rats implanted with cotton wool <b>pellets.</b> <b>Injection</b> or implantation of irritant materials decreased the deposition of granulation tissue on the pellets. As the amount of irritant material increased there was a corresponding decrease {{in the amount of}} tissue deposited on the pellets. There is evidence that this could not be explained by a limit to the amount of granulation tissue available within the body, and competition for it between the cotton pellets and the implanted substances. An alternative hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory substance is produced at the site of irritation (the site of implantation of the irritant substance, such as polyester sponges) was investigated. The evidence obtained supports this hypothesis. Inflammatory exudate, squeezed from polyester sponges which had been implanted subcutaneously in the backs of adrenalectomized rats.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{ablation}} cloud drifts to the lower field side in tokamak plasmas, which leads to a good performance on fueling in tokamak. Such a good performance, however, has not been obtained yet in the planar axis heliotron; Large Helical Device (LHD) experiments, even if a pellet has been injected from the high field side. The purpose of the study is to clarify the difference on the cloud motion between tokamak and LHD plasmas by using the MHD simulation including ablation processes. It is found in tokamaks that the drift motion is induced by a tire tube force and 1 /R force in the major radius direction, and that the pressure and density of the plasmoid have oscillation due to fast compressional Alfven wave. The first trial simulations on the motion of the plasmoid in a straight helical and LHD plasmas also show that the plasmoid drifts to the lower field side similarly to tokamaks. However, an plasmoid drifts inward or outward of the flux surfaces depending on the location along the magnetic field lines, since the plasmoid expands along the magnetic field with time, the magnetic field strength and the direction of the magnetic curvature change along the magnetic field lines due to both toroidicity and helicity of the helical coils, and the rotational transform is greater than that in tokamaks in the plasma periphery. Thus, it is suggested that the difference of the <b>pellet</b> <b>injections</b> between the high field and the low field sides is reduced in helical plasmas. ...|$|R

We tested a hypothesis that lubiprostone can reverse the constipating action of morphine and investigated the mechanism of action. Short-circuit current (Isc) was recorded in Ussing chambers as a marker for chloride secretion during pharmacological interactions between morphine and lubiprostone. Measurements of fecal wet weight were used to obtain information on morphine-lubiprostone interactions in conscious mice. Morphine decreased basal Isc, with an IC 50 of 96. 1 nM. The action of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP), a nicotinic receptor agonist that stimulates neurogenic Isc, was suppressed by morphine. Lubiprostone applied after pretreatment with morphine reversed morphine suppression of both basal Isc and DMPP-evoked chloride secretion. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of submucosal neurons evoked biphasic increases in Isc. Morphine abolished the first phase and marginally suppressed the second phase. Lubiprostone reversed, in concentration-dependent manner, the action of morphine on {{the first and second}} phases of the EFS-evoked responses. Subcutaneous lubiprostone increased fecal wet weight and numbers of pellets expelled. Morphine significantly reduced fecal wet weight and number of <b>pellets.</b> <b>Injection</b> of lubiprostone, 30 -min after morphine, reversed morphine-induced suppression of fecal wet weight. We conclude that inhibitory action of morphine on chloride secretion reflects suppression of excitability of cholinergic secretomotor neurons in the enteric nervous system.
