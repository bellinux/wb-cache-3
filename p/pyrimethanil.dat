50|$|Resistance {{to common}} {{fungicides}} is currently combated {{through the use}} of other chemicals. For example, sodium o-phenylphenate-resistant strains are dealt with via formaldehyde fumigation while imazalil-resistant strains are controlled {{through the use of}} <b>pyrimethanil,</b> a fungicide also approved for fighting strains resistant to other fungicides. As fungicide resistance increases globally, other measures of control are being considered including that of biocontrol. Effective biocontrol agents include bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas syringae as well as fungi such as Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida guilliermondii. In Clementines and Valencia oranges, Candida oleophila, Pichia anomala and Candida famata have been shown to reduce disease. Despite the ability of various biocontrol agents to exhibit antagonistic activity, biocontrol has not been shown to provide complete control over P.digitatum and is therefore commonly used in conjunction with another measure of control. Alternative measures of control include essential oils such as Syzygium aromaticum and Lippia javanica, ultraviolet light, curing, vapour heat and cell-penetrating anti-fungal peptides.|$|E

40|$|Background. The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} persistence of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in strawberries and cucumbers following good agricultural practices under field conditions. A secondary objective was to validate a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method for the determination of <b>pyrimethanil</b> levels in strawberries and cucumbers using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Methods. <b>Pyrimethanil</b> (20 % wettable power (WP)) was sprayed on strawberries and cucumbers grown under field conditions at the dosage recommended by the manufacturer. The dissipation rates of <b>pyrimethanil</b> were described using first-order kinetics and its half-life was 2. 9 days in strawberries and 2. 2 days in cucumbers. A risk assessment was performed using the risk quotient (RQ). Results. At fortification levels of 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg in strawberries and cucumbers, recoveries ranged from 90. 1 to 109 % with a relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging from 2. 0 – 7. 9 %, which is within the acceptable limits for routine analysis of <b>pyrimethanil</b> residues.

40|$|International audiencePyrimethanil is an anilino-pyrimidine {{fungicide}} particularly active against gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) and {{pear scab}} (Venturia inaequalis and Venturia pirina) on grapes, strawberries, tomatoes, fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants in greenhouses and open field situation. [1 - 5] According to the European Food Safety Authority, <b>pyrimethanil</b> has no evident mutagenic, genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, but a short-term toxicity study on {{rats and mice}} has shown an increase in liver weight accompanied by changes in the histopathology of the liver and thyroid. [6] To avoid these side effects, the concentration of <b>pyrimethanil</b> has been limited by legislation. The European Commission set the Maximum Residue Level of <b>pyrimethanil</b> at 10 [*]mg/l in citrus fruits, 5 [*]mg/l in pome fruits, strawberries, table and wine grapes and 0. 05 [*]mg/l in tree nuts (EC/ 600 / 2010). [7] It is thus important to increase our knowledge regarding the concentration of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in environmental matrices, its degradability and the factors affecting it. One of these factors is the photo alteration by sunlight, which is known to {{play a significant role}} in the degradation of this compound, due to the prolonged half-life (77 [*]days approximately) of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in the environment. [8] Previous studies on the degradation of <b>pyrimethanil</b> were carried out mainly in a waste water treatment context and focused on the photo catalytic degradation using various salts as catalysts. Agüera et al. [9] used TiO 2, Vanni et al. [10] and Anfossi et al. [11] added iron III, Navarro et al. [12] added ZnO and Gomis et al. [13] used thiopyrylium. Irradiation was carried out using a mercury or xenon lamp or direct sunlight. These studies have showed that a long irradiation time (between 150 and 1400 [*]min, depending on the conditions and catalyst) is required for total disappearance of <b>pyrimethanil.</b> Degradation of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in water using the technique of photo-Fenton was investigated by Sirtori et al. They reported that the addition of sodium chloride accelerated the reaction and characterized four chlorinated photo-Fenton by-products. [14] The aim of the present study was the identification of UV-visible photo transformation products of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in water. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled with multi stage mass spectrometry (GC-MSn) were used for analysis, with the aim of covering a large range of polarities for the detection of the potential transformation products. Elucidation of the structures of photoproducts was carried out performing high-resolution measurements and collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Photolysis mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the formation of photo products of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in water...|$|E

We applied a bifactorial multigeneration study in order to test if GCC conditions alter the effects of low pesticide concentrations on life history and genetic diversity of the aquatic model organism Chironomus riparius. Experimental populations of the species were chronically exposed to a low concentration of the fungicide <b>pyrimethanil</b> (half of the no-observed-adverse-effect concentration: NOAEC/ 2) under two dynamic present-day temperature simulations (11. 0 – 22. 7 °C; 14. 0 – 25. 2 °C) and one future scenario (16. 5 – 28. 1 °C). During the 140 -day multigeneration study, survival, emergence, reproduction, population growth, and genetic diversity of C. riparius were analyzed. Our results reveal that high temperature and <b>pyrimethanil</b> act synergistically on the midge C. riparius. In simulated present-day scenarios, a NOAEC/ 2 of <b>pyrimethanil</b> as derived from a life-cycle toxicity test provoked only slight-to-moderate beneficial or adverse effects on C. riparius.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic {{pathogen}} {{causing a}} major problem in the export and post-harvest of strawberries. Inappropriate use of fungicides leads to resistance among fungal pathogens. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of B. cinerea to various classes of fungicide and to determine the effectiveness of different concentrations of commonly used fungicides. We thus evaluated the effectiveness of six classes of fungicide in inhibiting the growth and development of this pathogen, namely, fludioxonil, iprodione, <b>pyrimethanil,</b> tebuconazole, fenpyrazamine, and boscalid. Fludioxonil was the most effective (EC₅₀ < 0. 1 μg/ml), and <b>pyrimethanil</b> was the least effective (EC₅₀ = 50 μg/ml), at inhibiting the mycelial growth of B. cinerea.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A rapid, {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} gas chromatographic method is described {{for the analysis}} of four fungicides - <b>pyrimethanil,</b> metalaxyl, penconazol and dichlofluanid, widely used in vineyards - in must and wine, as well as samples during alcoholic fermentation. The effect of alcoholic fermentation on <b>pyrimethanil</b> concentration in synthetic and real musts was studied. RESULTS: The proposed method was based on liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detector. n-Hexane was the most appropriate solvent for extracting the target fungicides in synthetic and real samples. Quality parameters of the proposed method presented good recovery (ca 78. 3 % for almost all compounds) and precision (between 1. 4 % and 6. 1 %), and quantification limits lower than maximum residue limits. However, for dichl of luanid recovery levels of well over 100 % were found. CONCLUSIONS: There was no matrix effect in the analysis of <b>pyrimethanil,</b> metalaxyl or penconazol, but this effect was observed for dichlofluanid in synthetic and real matrices. The application of the fermentative process on <b>pyrimethanil</b> fungicide caused a high decrease in the concentration of this compound, and no product appeared in degradation.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of climate change is meanwhile not only discussed {{in the scientific community}} but also in the general public. However, {{little is known about the}} interaction between climate change and pollutants like pesticides. A combination of multiple stressors (e. g. temperature, pollutants, predators) may lead to severe alterations for organisms such as changes in time of reproduction, reproductive success and growth performance, mortality and geographic distribution. The questions if aquatic organisms tend to react more sensitive towards incidents under climate change conditions remains. Therefore, within the present thesis the aquatic ecotoxicological profile of the fungicide <b>pyrimethanil,</b> as an exemplarily anthropogenic used contaminant, was examined. A large test battery of ecotoxicological standard tests and supplement bioassays with non-model species was conducted to investigate if species-specific or life stage-specific differences occur or if temperature alteration may change the impact of the fungicide. Two of the most sensitive species (Chironomus riparius and Daphnia magna) were used to investigate the acute and chronic thermal dependence of <b>pyrimethanil</b> effects. The results clearly depict that the ecotoxicity of <b>pyrimethanil</b> at optimal thermal conditions did not depend on the trophic level, but was species-specific. With regard to EC 10 values the acute <b>pyrimethanil</b> toxicity on C. riparius increased with higher temperature (6. 78 mg L- 1 at 14 °C and 3. 06 mg L- 1 at 26 °C). The chronic response of D. magna to the NOEC (no observed effect concentration) of the fungicide (0. 5 mg L- 1) was examined in an experiment which lasted for several generations under three simulated near-natural temperature regimes (‘cold year, today’ (11 to 22. 7 °C), ‘warm year, today’ (14 to 25. 2 °C) and ‘warm year, 2080 ’ (16. 5 to 28. 1 °C)). A pyrimethanil-induced mortality increase was buffered by the strongly related increase of the general reproductive capacity, while population growth was stronger influenced by temperature than by the fungicide. At a further <b>pyrimethanil</b> concentration (LOEC – lowest observed effect concentration: 1 mg L- 1), a second generation could not be established by D. magna under all thermal regimes. Besides daphnids, the midge C. riparius was used for a second multigeneration study. In a bifactorial test design it was tested if climate change conditions alter or affect the impact of a low fungicide concentration on life history and genetic diversity. The NOAEC/ 2 (half of the no observed adverse effect concentration derived from a standard toxicity test) was used as a low <b>pyrimethanil</b> concentration to which laboratory populations of the midges were chronically exposed under the mentioned temperature scenarios. During the 140 -day-multigeneration study, survival, emergence, reproduction, population growth, and genetic diversity of C. riparius were analyzed. The results reveal that high temperatures and <b>pyrimethanil</b> act synergistically on life history parameters of C. riparius. In simulated present-day scenarios, a NOAEC/ 2 of <b>pyrimethanil</b> provoked only slight to moderate beneficial or adverse effects. In contrast, an exposure to a NOAEC/ 2 concentration of <b>pyrimethanil</b> at a thermal situation likely for a summer under the future expactations uncovered adverse effects on mortality and population growth rate. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably reduced by <b>pyrimethanil</b> in the ‘warm year, 2080 ’ scenario, but only slightly under current climatic conditions. The multigeneration studies under near-natural thermal conditions indicate that not only the impact of climate change, but also low concentrations of pesticides may pose a reasonable risk for aquatic invertebrates in the future. This clearly shows that thermal and multigenerational effects should be considered when appraising the ecotoxicity of pesticides and assessing their future risk for the environment. In addition to temperature further multiple abiotic and biotic stressors alterate pollutant effects. Moreover, to better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, it was experimentally unraveled how the effects of a low-dose of <b>pyrimethanil</b> on daphnids becomes modified by different temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C) and in the presence/ absence of predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans larvae. The usage of a fractional multifactorial test design provided the possibility to investigate the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex via different exposure routes to the fungicide <b>pyrimethanil</b> at an environmentally relevant concentration (0. 05 mg L- 1) - either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via algae food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population). The number of neonates increased with increasing temperatures. At a temperature of 25 °C no significant differences between the individual treatment groups were observed although the growth was overall inhibited due to <b>pyrimethanil.</b> Besides, at 15 and 20 °C it is obvious that daphnids which were fed with contaminated algae had the lowest reproduction and growth rate. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of daphnids to pollutants. The exposure routes of the contaminant are of minor importance, while temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors impacting the reproduction of D. pulex. It can be concluded that low concentrations of <b>pyrimethanil</b> may disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked if chaoborid larvae are present. Therefore it seems necessary to observe prospectively if the combination of several stress factors like pesticide exposure and suboptimal temperature may influence the life history and sensitivity of several aquatic invertebrates differently. Besides standard test organisms it is inevitable to conduct test with aquatic invertebrate which are not yet considered regularly in ecotoxicological experiments. For example molluscs represent one of the largest phyla of macroinvertebrates with more than 100. 000 species, being ecologically and economically important. Therefore, within the present study embryo, juvenile, half- and full-life cycle toxicity tests with the snail Physella acuta were performed to investigate the impact of pollutants on various life stages. Different concentrations of <b>pyrimethanil</b> (0. 06 - 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg L- 1) assessed at three temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C) revealed that <b>pyrimethanil</b> caused concentration-dependent effects independent of temperature. Interestingly, the ecotoxicity of <b>pyrimethanil</b> was higher at lower temperature for the embryo hatching and F 1 reproduction, but its ecotoxicity for the growth of juveniles and the F 0 reproduction increased with increasing temperature. More specifically, it could have been observed that especially during the reproduction test high mortality rates occurred at the highest concentration of 1 mg L- 1 at all temperatures. Due to high mortality rates no snails were available for the F 1 at the highest concentrations (0. 5 and 1. 0 mg L- 1). Compared to the F 0, overall more egg masses were produced in the F 1, being all fertile and no mortality occurred. For the F 1 -generation the strongest <b>pyrimethanil</b> effects were detected at 15 °C. A comparison of effect concentrations between both generations showed that the F 1 is more sensitive than the F 0. These results indicate that an exposure over more than one generation may give a better overview of the impact of xenobiotics. With the establishment of an embryo and reproduction test under different temperatures and various concentrations of <b>pyrimethanil</b> with P. acuta we could successfully show that molluscs can respond more sensitive than model organisms and that both, chemical and thermal stressor strongly influence the behaviour of the pulmonates. It can be concluded that the high susceptibility for the fungicide observed in gastropods clearly demonstrates the complexity of pesticide-temperature interactions and the challenge to draw conclusions for the ecotoxicological risk assessment of pesticides under the impact of global climate change...|$|E

40|$|Impact {{of three}} {{fungicides}} against B. cinerea (iprodione, <b>pyrimethanil</b> and f ludioxonil plus cyprodinil) {{on the population}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains during the spontaneous alcoholic fermentation was studied. With regard {{to the use of}} fungicides in the vineyard at two stages of the grapevine growth we followed four different spontaneous fermentations: control, iprodione, <b>pyrimethanil</b> and f ludioxonil plus cyprodinil. The fungicide residues in the grapes were determined by GC/MS system and the fermentations were followed by changes in yeast, sugar, and ethanol concentrations using colony counting and HPLC. The karyotype analysis of 473 isolates was done by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The fungicide residues in the grapes at the harvest were below the maximum residue limits. Isolates of S. cerevisiae were classified into 15 karyotype groups. The duration of the processes and the populations of the karyotypes differed between the fermentations. The iprodione and control fermentations lasted 36 days with the prevalence of karyotype A while the fludioxonil plus cyprodinil fermentation lasted 50 days and karyotype D led the process. In the <b>pyrimethanil</b> fermentation, none of the karyotypes prevailed in the must and the fermentation lasted much longer than others did (68 days). The results showed that the fungicide residues have an influence on the fermentation kinetics and selection of S. cerevisiae strains during the spontaneous alcoholic fermentation and therefore should be considered as an important factor that may indirectly influence the formation of fermentation aroma in the wine produced by such process...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fungicides}} on grape (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir) pollen germination and tube growth were stud-ied in vitro, and a related field trial examined effects of time of fungicide application during flowering on seed number and fruitset. Fungicides <b>pyrimethanil,</b> cyprodinil + fludioxonil and chlorothalonil incorporated into in vitro ger-mination medium at the recommended mixing rate for field application all prevented pollen germination. When the fungicides were diluted to 10 % of the recommended mix-ing rate, pollen grain germination was still completely in-hibited. Further dilution to 1 %, resulted in some pollen grains germinating but the level was {{significantly less than}} the control, and the grains that did germinate had stunted pollen tubes (< 100 µm in length), compared with controls not exposed to fungicide (800 µm in length). In a 0. 1 % dilution of the fungicides, germination percent was not sig-nificantly different to untreated control, however pollen tube length was still slightly suppressed in media containing <b>pyrimethanil</b> (523 µm) and cyprodinil + fludioxonil (366 µm). In spite of these marked effects on pollen germi-nation and tube growth in vitro, plants sprayed with <b>pyrimethanil</b> at either 5 or 80 % cap fall, resulted in no significant reduction in fruitset. Seed set however was af-fected, with seed number per berry being significantly re-duced on inflorescences that were sprayed at 5 % cap fall.

40|$|Fungicides are {{regularly}} applied in horticultural production systems and may migrate off-site, potentially posing an ecological risk to surface waterways. However, {{few studies have}} investigated the fate of fungicides in horticultural catchments. This study investigated the presence of 24 fungicides at 18 sites during a 5 -month period within a horticultural catchment in southeastern Australia. Seventeen of the 24 fungicides were detected in the waterways, with fungicides detected in 63 % of spot water samples, 44 % of surface sediment samples, and 44 % of the passive sampler systems deployed. One third of the water samples contained residues {{of two or more}} fungicides. Myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin, <b>pyrimethanil,</b> difenoconazole, and metalaxyl were the fungicides most frequently detected, being present in 16 - 38 % of the spot water samples. Iprodione, myclobutanil, <b>pyrimethanil,</b> cyproconazole, trifloxystrobin, and fenarimol were found at the highest concentrations in the water samples ([0. 2 lg/l). Relatively high concentrations of myclobutanil and <b>pyrimethanil</b> (C 120 lg/kg dry weight) were detected in the sediment samples. Generally the concentrations of the fungicides detected were several orders of magnitude lower than reported ecotoxicological effect values, suggesting that concentrations of individual fungicides in the catchment were unlikely to pose an ecological risk. However, there is little information on the effects of fungicides, especially fungi and microbes, on aquatic ecosystems. There is also little known about the combined effects of simultaneous low-level exposure of multiple fungicides to aquatic organisms. Further research is required to adequately assess the risk of fungicides in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of a pesticide on target and non-target {{elements of a}} greenhouse, and its fate after application, was studied. The experiments were performed in a round arched greenhouse with vertical side walls containing a tomato crop, located in the mainland area of Eastern Greece. The case {{study was designed to}} monitor the fate of the fungicide <b>pyrimethanil,</b> by measuring its concentration in the greenhouse air, on the different surfaces of greenhouse, and on the leaves of the tomato crop for several days after application. The ground within the greenhouse, which was covered by a plastic film, was the most exposed non-target element receiving about 15 % of the total amount of the pesticide applied. Approximately 10 % of the pesticide applied was deposited on the greenhouse walls and roof surfaces and 6 % leaked to outside air through openings and ventilation. Globally, 61 % of the total amount applied reached the target, i. e. the crop. In order to model the fate of pesticides in the different elements inside and outside the greenhouse, four different modelling approaches with increasing complexity and realism regarding the experimental conditions and the observed fluxes of the pesticide, were developed. Agreement between measured and estimated values of <b>pyrimethanil</b> concentration in the different elements improved as the complexity and realism of the model used increased. The results of the models with the greatest realism showed that after application of <b>pyrimethanil</b> in the greenhouse, almost no active ingredient reached outside soil and water. (C) 2012 IAgrE.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} biomixtures on soil respiration was studied {{under the influence}} of two different pesticides, namely Bentazone and <b>Pyrimethanil,</b> in varying concentrations. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the difference between the CO 2 release from soil amended with biochar in comparison to soil amended with digestate, compared with soil amended with biochar and digestate, and (2) to compare the effect of bio-mixture treatment with <b>Pyrimethanil,</b> Bentazone, as well as a mixture of them on respiration rate, and (3) regard the effect of pesticide concentration on respiration rates. Focus was set on the microbial activity in all samples over a period of 99 days. Since bio-mixture composition determines the microbial activities, in the present work substrate induced respiration was evaluated by measuring CO 2 production in respective biomixtures which were incubated in jars [1]. Therefore, evolved CO 2 was trapped by KOH and determined by HCl titration. The application of digestate resulted in progressive mineralisation rates throughout the experiment with an assumable rapid loss of organic matter in the biomixtures, released as CO 2 -C. The application of biochar had no strong influence on the soil microbial activity or respiration rate. This indicates the chars’ potential to long term storage of carbon in soil while acting as a carbon sequester. Irrespective of pesticide type, respiration rates of digestate based biomixtures exceeded those, measured in biochar based biomixtures. No differences in respiration behaviour were found between <b>Pyrimethanil</b> and Bentazon individual application or their combination. Regardless of pesticide concentration, no differences to the pesticide untreated samples could be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} {{for the removal}} of <b>pyrimethanil</b> and fenhexamid, two fungicides commonly used for the control of Botrytis cinerea in vineyards, has been evaluated during an alcoholic fermentation process in batch system. Commercial and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used. Batch fermentations were carried out in yeast extract-malt extract medium (YM) with 18. 0 % (by mass) glucose, and the fungicides were added separately at three concentrations: 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10. 0 mg/L. The removal capacity of yeast strains was also examined in stationary phase cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Stationary assays were performed with yeast biomass harvested from the stationary phase of an anaerobic fermentation process, with separate additions of 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10. 0 mg/L of both fungicides. Removal studies with stationary phase cells were performed with viable and non-viable cells inactivated with sodium azide. This study clearly shows that both Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were able to remove fenhexamid and <b>pyrimethanil</b> in stationary and fermentative assays. The removal potential is shown to be strain dependent in stationary but not in fermentative assays. However, the removal potential is dependent on the type of fungicide in both stationary and fermentative assays. In stationary phase cultures no significant difference in fungicide removal potential between viable and non-viable cells was observed, indicating that both pesticides were not degraded by metabolically active cells. However, the presence of both pesticides influenced fermentation kinetics and only <b>pyrimethanil</b> at 10. 0 mg/L increased the production of volatile acidity of both strains...|$|E
40|$|In 1999 and 2000, {{the effects}} of scab {{fungicides}} on yeast composition and russeting of Elstar apples were assessed. Yeast composition of fungicide-treated and untreated young apple fruit with or without russet symptoms was investigated and enzyme activity of the yeasts was studied. Cryptococcus albidus, C. laurentii,Rhodotorula glutinis, Sporobolomyces roseus andMetschnikowia pulcherrima dominated the apple fruit surface. Russeted apple fruitlets had a higher red yeast density than non-russeted fruitlets. Invitro fungicide susceptibility of the dominant yeast species varied. Dithianon and dodine were active against all tested species, captan and tolylfluanid showed specificity for certain species, whereas <b>pyrimethanil</b> and bupirimate were largely ineffective. Fungicide treatment in the field had a clear effect on the yeast composition. Metschnikowia etschnikowia pulcherrima was eliminated from the phyllosphere and cryptococco$ï species diminished by both captan and dithianon. The red yeast population was not significantly changed by either fungicide. Captan, dithianon, tolylfluanid and <b>pyrimethanil</b> reduced russet {{in the field in}} both years, dodine and kresoxim-methyl only in 2000.

40|$|In enchytraeid {{reproduction}} tests lambda-cyhalothrin and <b>pyrimethanil</b> {{were examined}} under three different soil moisture levels (30, 50 and 70 % {{of the soil}} water holding capacity). The tests were performed with Enchytraeus bigeminus Nielsen & Christensen, 1963, a species that differs from other enchytraeid test species by its asexual mode of reproduction (fragmentation). The effect of chemical stressors depended on the soil moisture content. A higher toxicity was observed in soil with lower moisture levels. For lambda-cyhalothrin, the 21 -day EC 50 values for reproduction at the three levels of soil moisture were calculated to be 1. 33, 3. 79 and 4. 75 mg active substance/kg dry weight soil, respectively. For <b>pyrimethanil</b> the values were 435, 499 and 829 mg active substance/kg dry weight soil. Apart from {{the evaluation of the}} combined effects of chemical stress and soil moisture, the appropriateness of the fragmenting test species Enchytraeus bigeminus was assessed. E. bigeminus tolerated temperature and pH variations, allowed obtaining reliable concentration-response relationships and was easy to handle and to culture in the laboratory.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique for the determination of residues of the <b>pyrimethanil,</b> pirimicarb and buprofezin pesticides in surface waters from irrigated areas, with analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The optimized method used a 100 µm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber, agitation speed of the sample of 900 rpm and pH 7. 0. Extraction and desorption times were 30 and 7 min, respectively. Linearity was achieved in the concentration range 0. 1 - 4. 0 µg L- 1, and coefficients of determination (R²) were > 0. 991. Precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), was < 15 %, and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were in the ranges 0. 04 - 0. 1 µg L- 1 and 0. 1 - 0. 2 µg L- 1, respectively. Surface water samples were collected from irrigated regions of the Platô de Neópolis in Sergipe State (Brazil) and from Distrito de Irrigação Senador Nilo Coelho in Pernambuco State (Brazil).

40|$|In {{the years}} 2005 – 2007 in a {{collection}} of 527 cultivars of tall large-flowered irises (Iris × barbata group Elatior) in the Botanical Garden and Arboretum of MZLU in Brno the fungus Botrytis convolute in­fes­ted the plants. Within three years, {{as a consequence of the}} infestation, some cultivars showed symptoms of poor growth, in isolated cases the plants died. Control of irises against this pathogen has not yet been satisfactorily solved. At the present time no fungicides against B. convolute have been re­gis­te­red, only fungicides protecting ornamental plants against Botrytis cinerea. We explored the effect of seven active substances – captan, carbendazim, fenhexamid, iprodione, mancozeb, <b>pyrimethanil</b> and tolylfluanid (in vitro) in four different concentrations on the growth of the mycelia, germination of conidia and sklerotia. We evaluated the germination of B. convoluta conidia over 24 and 48 hours, my­ce­lium growth and germination of sclerotia over 5 days. In control plants the germination capacity of conidia over 48 hours reached 98 – 99 [*]%. Over 24 hours all the tested concentrations of preparations containing the active substances tolylfluanid and captan markedly affected the germination of conidia; their effectiveness ranged between 88 and 100 [*]%. All the active substances in the registered concentration (mancozeb 0. 2 [*]%, tolylfluanids 0. 2 [*]%, carbendazim 0. 2 [*]%, <b>pyrimethanil</b> 0. 25 [*]%, ipro­dio­ne 0. 3 [*]%, fenhexamid 0. 15 [*]% and captan 1 [*]%) prevented, or considerably reduced, the growth of B. convoluta mycelia (98. 8 – 100 [*]%). The active substances carbenazim, iprodione and fenhexamide very effectively (96. 4 – 100 [*]%) inhibited mycelium growth, at all the tested concentrations. Without an addition of fungicide all the sclerotia on the nutrient solution germinated and formed a mycelium disk 36 [*]mm in diameter.

To explore new potential fungicides against B. cinerea, a series of 4 -phenyl- 6 -trifluoromethyl- 2 -amino-pyrimidine compounds (compounds III- 1 to III- 22) were synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by 1 H-NMR, IR and MS. Most of these compounds possessed excellent fungicidal activity. The compounds III- 3 and III- 13 showed higher fungicidal activity than the positive control <b>pyrimethanil</b> on fructose gelatin agar (FGA), and compound III- 3 on potato dextrose agar (PDA) indicated high activity compared to the positive control cyprodinil.

40|$|Volatilisation of {{pesticides}} after {{application to the}} soil or the crop is {{an important source of}} emission into the atmosphere. As a result, workers, residents and bystanders are potentially at risk when exposed to these volatilised substances. Nonetheless, data on measured concentrations are quite scarce, especially in greenhouses. The objective of this work is to present the results of volatilisation experiments performed in greenhouses. Results: The results indicate that the concentrations are highest in the hours after application and rapidly decline during the days following application. The volatilisation experiments were conducted in the greenhouse complex of the Research Station for Vegetable Production (RSVP) in Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Belgium. Two types of ventilation regimes were used {{during the course of the}} experiments. In the cucumber and tomato greenhouses, a mixture of Scala (400 g L− 1 <b>pyrimethanil,</b> SC, BASF Belgium) and Corbel (750 g L− 1 fenpropimorph, EC, BASF Belgium) was applied to the mature crop. Sampling units were placed in the centre of the treated area and in the main greenhouse aisle. At each location, sampling was done at two different heights: just above the crop and at breathing height. This resulted in sampling heights of approximately 1. 5 m and 2. 5 m for tomato and cucumber, respectively. Concentrations of volatilised pesticides in the air were measured with an active sampling system. Fenpropimorph and <b>pyrimethanil</b> samples were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MSD). In this study, measurable concentrations of fenpropimorph and <b>pyrimethanil</b> were found in the air for up to 4 days after application but sampling height seemed to have little effect on the pesticide concentration in the air. The concentrations of <b>pyrimethanil</b> and fenpropimorph were highest during the first hours after application and showed a considerable decrease in the days after application. Volatilisation of the applied substances is not the only process taking place in the plant environment after application. Competing processes such as penetration into the crop may take place and limit the volatilisation of the substances as well as additives present in the formulation. Greenhouse temperature, ventilation rate, the substance vapour pressure and the rate of competing processes were identified as important factors influencing volatilisation in greenhouses. Recently, the PEARL model has been extended to include volatilisation under glasshouse conditions. The results from this study could be used to test the model calculations against measured pesticide concentrations in greenhouse air. Analysis of the differences between measured and computed concentrations may indicate possibilities for model improvements. Moreover, the study results may identify processes that need further study. Computational models and experimental work will both be helpful to extend the current knowledge about volatilisation of plant protection products under varying conditions...|$|E
