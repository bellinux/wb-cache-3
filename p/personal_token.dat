50|$|Once, while Shakuntala {{was in the}} hermitage in a pensive dreaming mood {{thinking}} about her husband Dushyanta, she did not pay the desired reverential attention to sage Durvasa who was visiting the place. Durvasa, known for his short temper, felt offended by this slight, cursed Shakuntala saying that the person she was dreaming of would forget about her altogether. However later, Durvasa toned down his curse to mean {{that the person who}} had forgotten Shakuntala would remember everything again if she showed him a <b>personal</b> <b>token</b> that had been given to her. As per the curse, Dushyanta refused to recognise her.|$|E
50|$|Shakuntala {{spent much}} time dreaming of her new husband and was often distracted by her daydreams. One day, a {{powerful}} rishi, Durvasa, came to the ashrama but, lost in her thoughts about Dushyanta, Shakuntala failed to greet him properly. Incensed by this slight, the rishi cursed Shakuntala, saying that the person she was dreaming of would forget about her altogether. As he departed in a rage, one of Shakuntala's friends quickly explained to him the reason for her friend's distraction. The rishi, realizing that his extreme wrath was not warranted, modified his curse saying {{that the person who}} had forgotten Shakuntala would remember everything again if she showed him a <b>personal</b> <b>token</b> that had been given to her.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- In many {{applications}} user authentication {{has to be}} carried out by portable devices. These kinds of devices must deal with constraints like computational performance, power consumption while also maintaining high performance rates in the authentication process. This paper provides solutions to designing such <b>personal</b> <b>tokens</b> where biometric authentication is required. In this paper, a 3 D median filter design for iris biometrics has been chosen to be implemented due to the low error rates...|$|R
50|$|Lin's {{conception}} was {{to create}} an opening or a wound in the earth to symbolize {{the gravity of the}} loss of the soldiers. The design was initially controversial for what was an unconventional and non-traditional design for a war memorial. Opponents of the design also voiced objection because of Lin's Asian ethnicity, her being female, and her lack of professional experience. The memorial has since become an important pilgrimage site for relatives and friends of the American military casualties in Vietnam, and <b>personal</b> <b>tokens</b> and mementos are left at the wall daily in their memory. In 2007, the American Institute of Architects ranked the memorial #10 on their list of America's Favorite Architecture.|$|R
50|$|A time-synchronized OTP {{is usually}} {{related to a}} piece of {{hardware}} called a security token (e.g., each user is given a <b>personal</b> <b>token</b> that generates a one-time password). It might look like a small calculator or a keychain charm, with an LCD that shows a number that changes occasionally. Inside the token is an accurate clock that has been synchronized with the clock on the proprietary authentication server. On these OTP systems, time {{is an important part of}} the password algorithm, since the generation of new passwords is based on the current time rather than, or in addition to, the previous password or a secret key. This token may be a proprietary device, or a mobile phone or similar mobile device which runs software that is proprietary, freeware, or open-source. An example of time-synchronized OTP standard is Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP).|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a work of}} utilizing multi-space random mapping (MRM) to formulate a dual-factor identification system, which combines speaker biometric and <b>personal</b> <b>token.</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>token</b> will be assigned to the client to constitute a unique random subspace during enrollment and the speaker template will be generated within the random subspace. Test features will be mapped to the random subspace that is described by the <b>personal</b> <b>token</b> presented during identification. Our work has shown that MRM-system exhibits stronger discriminative ability when comparing test features to its counterfeit templates, which lied in other different random subspaces. This advantage thus contributes to better F-ratio and greater accuracy recognition. Experiments on YOHO corpus demonstrate a remarkable result where the system achieves the perfect identification rate.

In this paper a system is described that makes it possible to compare different interaction styles for identifying and selecting resources in an environment shared by multiple users. An experiment was conducted to test two different interaction styles, one based on selecting devices by matching labels and another one in which participants selected devices by physically connecting to them with a <b>personal</b> <b>token.</b> This experiment showed that participants were more inclined to employ a cooperative selection strategy when using a <b>personal</b> <b>token,</b> as opposed to a solitary strategy when matching labels. ...|$|E
50|$|Boddington {{summarised}} {{the characteristics}} of Final Phase burials {{as a series of}} eight points. First, it involved a new set of cemeteries being established under the influence of Christianity. Second, these cemeteries were often located close to settlements, in contrast to their Early Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Third, the burials are almost entirely inhumations, with very few cremation burials having been found from this period.Fourth, these inhumations tend to be oriented on a west-to-east direction. Fifth, some of the graves are located in, or under, barrows. Sixth, there is a high proportion of graves with few or no grave goods. Seventh, those items that are featured are predominantly relating to utilitarian clothing or represent small <b>personal</b> <b>tokens.</b> The final point {{is that some of the}} grave goods, notable the cross forms, have Christian symbolic significance.|$|R

Although much {{research}} was conducted on devising intuitive interaction paradigms with pervasive computing devices, {{it has not been}} realized that authentication, an important need in this context, has a strong impact on the ease of use.

This article describes a drag-and-drop interaction paradigm that enables strong authentication by embedding such a protocol within <b>personal</b> authentication <b>tokens.</b> This article also discusses how this paradigm can be used as the basis for performing user-friendly pervasive multi-party secure interactions. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{pervasive}} computing is the automatic personalization of computer infrastructure to create a customized user experience that’s better suited to the task at hand. The ideas presented in this article are a significant step toward that goal. The authors provide a convenient and accurate mechanism to convey a unique identifier using no more than a signet ring pressed against the capacitive touchscreen of a computer. It brings to mind the “secret decoder ring ” used by the fictional character, Dick Tracy—but this time it’s for real. � — Roy Want In this emerging era of pervasive computing, we interact with and rapidly switch among a diverse set of digital devices. We tend to transition from a smartphone to a notebook when arriving in the office, and when we return home, we often switch to a tablet. In between, we might use large wall-mounted displays, car navigation systems, selfcheckout kiosks at retail stores, and home security or smart home controls. Many of these devices—even if only used in the home—have multiple users. Over the next decade, this range of devices will likely increase, and our time with any single device will grow shorter. We argue that it’s time for touchbased personal tokens that let devices unobtrusively identify who is interacting with the device at any given time. This would let devices tailor services to users and apply authentication to control access to sensitive information and online services. Consider, for example, that a child reportedly spent more than $ 1, 000 on in-app purchases while playing games on his mother’s iPhone. 1 Devices that know their users could limit such spending from unauthorized users and serve age-appropriate content and media. Our approach is to use a wearable <b>personal</b> <b>token</b> to communicate an identification code through touch...|$|E
25|$|Until {{the advent}} of bookplate {{collectors}} and their frenzy for exchange, the devising of bookplates was almost invariably left to the routine skill of the heraldic-stationery salesman. Near {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the composition of <b>personal</b> book <b>tokens</b> became recognized as a minor branch of a higher art, and there has come into fashion an entirely new class of designs which, for all their wonderful variety, bear as unmistakable a character as that of the most definite styles of bygone days. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the purely heraldic element tends to become subsidiary and the allegorical or symbolic to assert itself more strongly.|$|R
40|$|Many {{eligibility}} or entitlement certificates {{in every}} day life are non-transferable between persons. However, they are usually implemented by <b>personal</b> physical <b>tokens</b> that owners can easily pass around (e. g. credit card), driver's license). So there must either be negligible incentives to pass these certificates or the tokens around, or the tokens must allow to authenticate the persons who show certificates, e. g., by imprinted photographs. However, any kind of easily accessible personal identifying information threatens the owners' privacy. To solve these somehow paradoxical requirements, we assume for each owner a kind of pilot that {{is equipped with a}} tamper resistant biometric authentication facility. We draft cryptographic protocols for issuing and showing non-transferable yet privacy protecting certificates. Unforgeability of certificates relies on a well-established computational assumption, nontransferability relies upon a physical assumption and owners' privacy is protected un [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{increase}} the hostile attack resilience of distributed and internet-worked computer systems is critical and pressing. This thesis contributes to concrete improvements in distributed systems trustworthiness through an enhanced understanding of a technical approach known as trusted computing hardware. Because of its physical and logical protection features, trusted computing hardware can reliably enforce a security policy in a threat model where the authorised user is untrusted or when the device is placed in a hostile environment. We present a critical analysis of vulnerabilities in current systems, and argue that current industry-driven trusted computing initiatives will fail in efforts to retrofit security into inherently flawed operating system designs, {{since there is no}} substitute for a sound protection architecture grounded in hardware-enforced domain isolation. In doing so we identify the limitations of hardware-based approaches. We argue that the current emphasis of these programs does not give sufficient weight to the role that operating system security plays in overall system security. New processor features that provide hardware support for virtualisation will contribute more to practical security improvement because they will allow multiple operating systems to concurrently share the same processor. New operating systems that implement a sound protection architecture will thus be able to be introduced to support applications with stringent security requirements. These can coexist alongside inherently less secure mainstream operating systems, allowing a gradual migration to less vulnerable alternatives. We examine the effectiveness of the ITSEC and Common Criteria evaluation and certification schemes as a basis for establishing assurance in trusted computing hardware. Based on a survey of smart card certifications, we contend that the practice of artificially limiting the scope of an evaluation in order to gain a higher assurance rating is quite common. Due to a general lack of understanding in the marketplace as to how the schemes work, high evaluation assurance levels are confused with a general notion of 'high security strength'. Vendors invest little effort in correcting the misconception since they benefit from it and this has arguably undermined the value of the whole certification process. We contribute practical techniques for securing personal trusted hardware devices against a type of attack known as a relay attack. Our method is based on a novel application of a phenomenon known as side channel leakage, heretofore considered exclusively as a security vulnerability. We exploit the low latency of side channel information transfer to deliver a communication channel with timing resolution that is fine enough to detect sophisticated relay attacks. We avoid the cost and complexity associated with alternative communication techniques suggested in previous proposals. We also propose the first terrorist attack resistant distance bounding protocol that is efficient enough to be implemented on resource constrained devices. We propose a design for a privacy sensitive electronic cash scheme that leverages the confidentiality and integrity protection features of trusted computing hardware. We specify the command set and message structures and implement these in a prototype that uses Dallas Semiconductor iButtons. We consider the access control requirements for a national scale electronic health records system of the type that Australia is currently developing. We argue that an access control model capable of supporting explicit denial of privileges is required to ensure that consumers maintain their right to grant or withhold consent to disclosure of their sensitive health information in an electronic system. Finding this feature absent in standard role-based access control models, we propose a modification to role-based access control that supports policy constructs of this type. Explicit denial is difficult to enforce in a large scale system without an active central authority but centralisation impacts negatively on system scalability. We show how the unique properties of trusted computing hardware can address this problem. We outline a conceptual architecture for an electronic health records access control system that leverages hardware level CPU virtualisation, trusted platform modules, <b>personal</b> cryptographic <b>tokens</b> and secure coprocessors to implement role based cryptographic access control. We argue that the design delivers important scalability benefits because it enables access control decisions to be made and enforced locally on a user's computing platform in a reliable way...|$|R
