It is produced from chromite ore, the only economically exploitable natural chromium resource, through carbothermic smelting in submerged arc or direct current furnaces. The <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process is currently the industrially applied ferrochromium production process with the lowest specific electricity consumption. Results obtained from this study proved that the pre-oxidation of chromite ore prior to milling, agglomeration and pre-reduction significantly enhances the level of chromite pre-reduction achieved in the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process. The optimum pre-oxidation temperature was established as the temperature where a balance was achieved between maximising iron (Fe) migration to the surface of ore particles that were pre-oxidised, while avoiding the formation of free eskolaite (Cr 2 O 3). For the case study metallurgical grade chromite ore considered, the optimum pre-oxidation temperature was found to be 1000 C.

40|$|The {{production}} of ferrochrome is an energy intensive process. At present, the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process {{is most likely}} the ferrochrome production process with the lowest specific energy consumption, i. e. MW h/t ferrochrome produced. Higher chromite pre-reduction levels correspond to lower specific energy consumptions. It was previously proven that various compounds could enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction. In this paper the effect of CaCO 3 addition on <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction is presented. CaCO 3 (as limestone) is already used as a flux in some FeCr production processes, hence its use does not constitute the addition of an extra raw material. Results indicated that CaCO 3 addition enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction achieved significantly, which could results in substantial specific energy consumption improvements. However, CaCO 3 addition caused severe decreases in both compressive and abrasion strengths of pre-reduced pellets, which {{is unlikely to be}} negated by mitigation measures. The addition of CaCO 3 in the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process is therefore likely to result in the formation of excessively fine feed materials. In practise, this reduces the usefulness of this technique for submerged arc furnace ferrochrome production significantly, since excessive fines in the feed material are likely to result in increased operational instabilities, equipment damage and safety risks. TGA and thermochemical calculations also indicated that CO 2 released from the CaCO 3 will result in in situ carbon and energy consumption, which is an additional negative associated with its use as an additive during pre-reduction of composite chromite pellets. Although this paper was not specifically aimed at obtaining mechanistic information, thermo-mechanical analysis indicated that especially iron pre-reduction rates were enhanced by CaCO 3 addition.

The influence of the addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feed on the analytical performance of the official methods for the determination of mycotoxins was studied {{and the results are}} presented. Where possible standardised methods for analysis were applied. Samples of 20 commercial mycotoxin binders were collected from various companies. The following mycotoxins were included in the study: aflatoxin B 1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B 1 and B 2, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins. A binder (or binders combined in a group) was mixed with feed material containing the mycotoxin, and the feed material was analysed. For data evaluation, the mean values were compared by Student’s t-test (an independent two-sample t-test with unequal sample sizes and equal variance). The repeatability standard deviation of each method was used as an estimate of method variability. No significant differences (p¼ 0. 05) in mycotoxin levels between binder-free material and the material containing different binders were found. Further, the possible effects of binder addition in combination with processing (<b>pelletising)</b> on the amount of aflatoxin B 1 determined in feed were studied.

40|$|Accelerated {{carbonation}} involves {{exposing a}} material to a concentrated atmosphere of carbon dioxide, {{and can be}} used to treat hazardous wastes and soils and create new construction materials. The present work examines the use of accelerated carbonation to reduce the hazardous properties of wastes as a means of reducing the costs of disposal to landfill, and then develops the process to manufacture aggregate from the waste removing it from landfill disposal completely. A range of thermal wastes, including those from cement, metallurgical and paper processes, were found to be reactive with carbon dioxide. Many of these wastes are hazardous on account of their alkaline pH, which carbonation partially neutralizes, effectively allowing reclassification of the materials as stable non-reactive hazardous wastes under the Landfill Regulations. Cement and paper wastes were highly reactive with carbon dioxide, and were considered for use as cement substitutes to reconstitute non-reactive wastes into aggregate. Previous work had suggested that carbonation and <b>pelletising</b> were not compatible due to differing optimum conditions. This issue was investigated by considering the effects of the mix formulations and machinery parameters. The <b>pelletising</b> and carbonation processes require widely different moisture contents. The disparity is due to the need for total saturation of the material to form bonds between grains during <b>pelletising,</b> and an open pore network for carbon dioxide to penetrate. To achieve the two simultaneously, several methods were investigated. Chemical catalysts including sodium hypochlorite and sodium sulfite increased carbonation in a saturated material. However, curing the formed aggregates in carbon dioxide was found to be the most economic solution. A pilot scale process was developed based upon the laboratory results. A bespoke rotary carbonation reactor was developed to produce aggregate in bulk for commercial testing. Aggregate which was subjected to accelerated carbonation, has enhanced strength and durability compared to aggregate exposed to natural carbonation.

40|$|MSc (Engineering Sciences in Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Ferrochrome (FeCr) is a crude alloy {{containing}} chromium (Cr) {{and iron}} (Fe). FeCr is mainly {{used for the}} production of stainless steel, which is an important modern-day alloy. FeCr is produced from chromite ore through various smelting methods. In this study, the focus was on the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process, which is also referred to as the solid state reduction of chromite. In this process, fine chromite ore, a clay binder and a carbon reductant are dry milled, agglomerated (<b>pelletised)</b> and pre-reduced (solid state reduction) in a rotary kiln. The pre-reduced pellets are then charged hot, immediately after exiting the rotary kiln, into a closed submerged arc furnace (SAF). This production process option has the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC), i. e. MWh/ton FeCr produced, of all the FeCr production processes that are commercially applied. Other advantages associated with the application of the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process are that it eliminates the use of chromite fines, has a high Cr recovery, and produces low sulphur- (S) and silicon (Si) -containing FeCr. The main disadvantage of the <b>pelletised</b> chromite pre-reduction process is that it requires extensive metallurgical control due to the variances in the levels of pre-reduction achieved and carbon content of the pre-reduced <b>pelletised</b> furnace feed material. This implies that the metallurgical carbon balance has to be changed regularly to prevent the process from becoming carbon deficient (also referred to as ‘under coke’) or over carbon (also referred to as ‘over coke’). The analytical technique currently applied to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction is time consuming, making it difficult and expensive to deal with large numbers of samples. In an attempt to develop a technique that would be faster to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction, a new analytical method using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image processing and computational techniques was investigated in this study. Metallurgical grade chromite (< 1 mm), anthracite breeze (< 1 mm), and fine FeCr (< 1 mm) that were used to prepare pellets in the laboratory, as well as industrially produced pre-reduced pellets that had already been milled in preparation for the determination of the pre-reduction level with wet chemical analysis were received from a large South African FeCr producer. These laboratory prepared pellets and the industrially produced pellet mixtures were considered in this investigation. Samples were moulded in resin and polished in order to obtain SEM micrographs of the polished cross sections. Elements with higher molecular weights are indicated by lighter greyscale, while elements with lower molecular weights are indicated by darker greyscale in SEM micrographs. This basic principle was applied {{in the development of the}} new analytical technique to determine the level of chromite pre-reduction, with the hypothesis that the pixel count of white pixels (representing metallised particles), divided by the combined pixel count of white (representing metallised particles) and grey (representing chromite particles) pixels would be directly related to the level of chromite pre-reduction determined with the current wet chemical method. This hypothesis can be mathematically expressed as: The newly-developed analytical method was validated by correlating the white pixel% calculated with the chromite pre-reduction levels (%) determined with wet chemical analysis of laboratory prepared and industrially produced pellet mixtures, which had R 2 values of 0. 998 and 0. 919, respectively. This suggests that the method can be used to determine chromite pre-reduction accurately. Master...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{national}} and international emissions legislation, in particular sulphur-dioxide, and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels are forcing power producing industries to look at various alternatives, such as biomass and co-firing techniques. Biomass may be transported to the burners of a pulverised fuel (PF) boiler either mixed with the primary fuel, in general coal, or used in dedicated pipelines. In both cases, the transportation of biomass is different due to its composition, size and shape to the transportation of coal. This thesis investigates the computational modelling techniques for a biomass and biomass blend particle transportation (arboreal and flour) in a pipeline with a transverse elbow, the three-phase flow of a coal and biomass co-fire blend in the primary air annulus of a swirl burner and the combustion of a coal and <b>pelletised</b> straw mixture in a full scale furnace using dedicated burners for the biomass injection. The comparison of spherical and non-spherical drag models, under gravity, as well as Saffman lift, inter-particle collision and randomised impulsive wall collision models has been investigated. Good agreement was observed between the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and the experimental data, using a non-spherical drag model. In both cases, due to the dilute volume fraction and secondary air flow, inter-particle collisions and lift were insignificant. In the annulus, lateral regions of high particle concentration were predicted, which are not observed physically.

40|$|This thesis assesses several value chains for {{bioenergy}} {{production in}} Norway and combines these representing two Norwegian scenarios. The environmental impacts are assessed using {{the methodology of}} life cycle assessment (LCA). A complete assessment of climate change impact has been a core task, and biogenic CO 2 emissions are accounted for throughout the value chains investigated. Surface albedo effects {{are included in the}} assessment of forest resources. In addition to global warming potential, the value chains are assessed for three other impact categories; acidification potential, particulate matter formation potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Life cycle inventories are constructed for a set of six feedstocks, seven treatment options, ten energy conversion options and three energy distribution choices. The different options are then combined to 80 feasible value chains. Transport is included throughout all the value chains. All inventories are assembled to represent Norwegian conditions. Energy flows for the different value chains investigated are found to represent the current bioenergy system, with a potential increase for each value chain towards 2020 - representing the alternative scenario. Results are generated for the individual value chains, the reference scenario and the alternative scenario. The results show large differences between the different value chains. Energy wood and waste wood are the most beneficial feedstocks for bioenergy production, highly dependent on both the GWPbio factors utilised and inclusion of surface albedo effects. <b>Pelletising</b> is the pre-treatment option resulting in the lowest GWP, while integrated torrefaction and <b>pelletising</b> results in the highest GWP. Overall, a CHP plant with electricity demand is the most advantageous conversion route. A stand-alone thermal electricity plant has the definite highest impact, mainly because of low conversion efficiency. Heat distribution shows high impacts compared to electricity and steam distribution, and the resources resulting in lower impacts is therefore recommended as inputs for such units. Generally, handling of biogenic CO 2 emissions is of high importance. The same is the case for surface albedo effects, changing the GWP for forest resources considerably. CHP plants are recommended for electricity production from biomass, and use of TOP, forest residues and stemwood are recommended to take place in the same conversion technology. The environmental impacts from a CHP plant is low, and TOP, forest residues and stemwood show high GWP. The GWP from energy wood, wood waste and pellets are low, and are therefore recommended for use in district heating plants. As stand-alone electricity production is not recommended, the GWP from a district heating plant is limited {{with the use of the}} mentioned resources. <b>Pelletising</b> is recommended for pre-treatment of Norwegian biomass because of low climate change impacts. The Norwegian Government has put forth ambitious goals to reduce the GHG emissions substantially towards 2020 and become climate neutral by 2030. The reference scenario assessed show a GWP of 134 grams CO 2 -equivalents per kWh, while the scenario for 2020 results in a climate change impact of 136 grams CO 2 -equivalents per kWh. Based on this, Norwegian bioenergy can offer a means to reduce the GHG emissions towards 2020, but because of considerable GWP from biogenic CO 2 emissions, bioenergy should not be pursued for a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030. </p...|$|E

Results from a comprehensive, long-term field evaluation of CRP at four contrasting sites under permanent pasture over 3 years confirmed and extended the findings of the preliminary glasshouse study with CRP. Apart from some initial differences, <b>pelletised</b> CRP was as effective as superphosphate at all four sites and at two of the hill-country sites (Ballantrae and Wanganui) it showed a marked residual effect in the third year. This was particularly pronounced in the clover component of the sward at these two sites. In fact at these two sites a single, initial application of 70 kgP ha- 1 as CRP was agronomically as effective in the third year as three annual applications of 35 kgP ha- 1 as superphosphate. This finding has implications to the strategy of fertilizer use. The origin of the marked residual effect shown by CRP at Ballantrae and Wanganui in the third year appears to result from the effect of CaCO 3 on the rate of release of P from CRP. The findings that <b>pelletised</b> CRP was almost always as effective as both powdered CRP and superphosphate in the field contrasts with the results of the preliminary glasshouse study with four soils. This discrepancy probably results from the fact that in glasshouse studies a number of factors which can operate in the field and which may contribute to an increased effectiveness of a surface-applied, <b>pelletised</b> phosphate rock (PR) material are excluded (e. g. earthworms). In a glasshouse study, earthworms increased the effectiveness of CRP as a source of P to ryegrass by 15 to 30 % over seven hervests. Subsequent studies showed that both the burrowing and casting activity of earthworms indirectly increased the availability to ryegrass of P in the PR by improving the physical distribution and degree of contact of the PR particles with the soil. Interestingly, good agreement was found between the agronomic effectiveness of <b>pelletised</b> CRP in the field and in the glasshouse when earthworms were included as a treatment in the glasshouse. Consequently, care must be taken in extrapolating to the field situation, the results obtained with <b>pelletised</b> PR materials in the glasshouse in the absence of biological mixing. In a comparison in the glasshouse, using six soils and both ryegrass and white clover as indicator species, CRP was as effective as North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR) and Sechura phosphate rock (SPR), both of which are reactive PR materials. The agronomic data from this glasshouse study were used to evaluate a number of conventional, single chemical-extraction procedures used for assessing the likely agronomic effectiveness of PR materials. Of these, 2 % formic acid appears to offer the most promise. However, sequential extraction appears to be necessary with PR materials which contain appreciable amounts of CaCO 3. A procedure involving a single extraction with 0. 5 M NaOH was developed for measuring the extent of dissolution of a PR in soil. Because apatite minerals are largely insoluble in dilute NaOH and because this reagent extracts sorbed inorganic P, increases in 0. 5 M NaOH-extractable P in a soil to which a PR is added, provide a good estimate of the amount of P dissolved and retained on sorption sites. The extent of dissolution of SPR, measured by NaOH extraction, was found to vary from 22 % of added P on the low P-sorbing Tokomaru soil to 48 % on the high P-sorbing Egmont soil during incubation at 15 °C for 90 days. A high correlation (r = 0. 935 **) was obtained for the relationship between the dissolution of SPR, measured by NaOH extraction, and the P-sorption capacity of the six soils used. Whereas increasing the P status of the Wainui soil, by the addition of KH 2 PO 4, had no measurable effect on the extent of dissolution of SPR, increasing addition of Ca(OH) 2 markedly decreased the dissolution of SPR in this soil. Of the decrease measured in the dissolution of SPR on liming the Wainui soil from pH 5. 2 to 6. 9, 75 - 79 % of the decrease could be accounted for by the effect of Ca, which also increases on liming. Recults with the Egmont soil indicate that a PR can dissolve at pH 6. 5. This suggests that the effect of a higher pH on dissolution is decreased in a soil of high P-sorption capacity. Although the extent of dissolution or SPR increased as the P-sorption capacity of the soils increased, the amounts of water-, Bray-, and bicarbonate-extractable P in the same soils decreased. Of these three estimates of plant-available P, both the Bray and bicarbonate procedures were found to be useful indicators of short-term, plant-available P when SPR and CRP were added to three contrasting soils. Of the two procedures, the Bray procedure accounted for more of the variability, possibly reflecting the difference in the mechanisms by which these two extractants remove P from soil. In contrast, a single water-extraction procedure grossly underestimated the amount of short-term, plant-available P in the soil to which a PR was added. A simple model, based on a modified Mitscherlich equation, was developed to describe and predict the dissolution of SPR in soil. The model, which was developed and evaluated using contrasting soils, appears to have good practical application and should prove useful in future studies of the reactions of PR materials in soils. Although not yet commercially available, CRP appears to have very good potential as a direct-application P fertilizer for pasture and, of particular relevance to hill country farming, it shows a good residual effect. A possible disadvantage is the relatively low P content...|$|R
