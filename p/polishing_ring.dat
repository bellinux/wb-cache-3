40|$|One of {{the most}} rapidly {{advancing}} branches of precision machining is polishing. However, despite of the wide automation of machining processes through the increasing usage of CNC machines, polishing is still mainly executed manually due to its complexity and large number of affecting parameters. Experienced workers, through countless hours of experimenting with many different polishing tools and techniques, manage to achieve surfaces with exquisite levels of dimensional precision accompanied with extremely low levels of roughness, that approach “mirror” quality. However, the process is particularly time-consuming and strenuous. In addition to that, even the most insignificant mistake could be proven to be irreversible, ruining the mould and obliging the worker to repeat the entire process from scratch. In this work, the tool movement that is manually forced by the worker is modeled {{through the use of}} the trochoid curve. Additionally, a general methodology of trochoid parameters selection for each polishing tool is presented. As polishing tools we select polishing rings of different materials and dimensions combined with diamond pastes of various grain sizes. Furthermore, models that create trochoid curves by the use of random guide curves are developed. This makes possible the creation and use of any tool path on both 2 D and 3 D planes. Also, a model that analyzes the behavior of the spinning <b>polishing</b> <b>ring</b> is presented. This model is based on the interaction between tool and surface and establishes the necessary restrictions that must be fulfilled in order for the polishing rings to be effective and lead to the desirable results. Finally, after some first manual and automized tests, Taguchi analysis is proposed to be used in order to formalize the experiments and reach to safe conclusions. The experiments were run on the HAAS CNC machining centre of the Laboratory of Manufacturing Technology of NTUA. This happens by using a special base we have created to attach the free end of the grinder on the CNC machine. The experimental setup that is described in this work allows us to measure and control the applied force. The tool path is controlled through G-code that is fully defined using the developed models we present...|$|E

40|$|Results of {{simulation}} {{investigations of}} the influence of changes in the spinning zone ge-ometry of a ring spinning machine on the tension and quality of the yarn manufactured are presented in this study. Changes in the geometry resulted from modification of the conven-tional drafting system into a compact drafting system. For the investigations, construction parameters of the machine and the technological process of spinning were taken into con-sideration. Numerical investigations were based on the mathematical model for the dynam-ics of yarn motion through the twisting-winding unit. Experimental tests were performed on the <b>Polish</b> <b>ring</b> spinning machine type PJ 35, equipped with a conventional drafting system and the author’s compact drafting system. It was shown that changes in the spinning zone geometry on the spinning machine caused by modification of the conventional drafting system into a compact system had no effect on the mean tension value of the yarn. Instead it diminished the amplitude of tension during the revolution around the spindle. Key words: compact spinning, mathematical model, numerical experiment, yarn motion dynamics...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of {{different}} process parameters on the material removal rate (MRR) of phosphate laser glass during <b>ring</b> <b>polishing</b> had been investigated. Experiments were performed on a <b>ring</b> <b>polishing</b> machine that had a pad diameter of 4. 4 m, and the MRR was obtained by the measurements of depth reduction of a groove on phosphate glass sample. The experimental results and analyses showed that size of the abrasive particles and the ceria concentration had significant effects on the polishing rate. The MRR of glass being polished on the annular-grooved pad was almost three times as when polished on the square-grooved pad. When the pad was periodically cleaned with water and glass was polished with fresh slurry, the value of MRR tended to be constant. Based on the experimental results, a combined process was designed to optimize MRR.

5000|$|Dendrochronology is {{the science}} of dating and study of annual rings in trees. A tree in {{temperate}} and colder climates typically will grow one new ring every year, therefore {{the age of the}} tree can theoretically be determined by counting the number of rings present. The problem {{lies in the fact that}} some years, particularly in years of drought, a tree will not grow an annual ring. In other years where the growing season is interrupted a tree may grow a second false ring. The trees rings are commonly measured by taking a series of core samples. A borer is used to extract a pencil-size diameter or smaller core from a living tree or from a log. For downed and dead trees a disk section or [...] "tree cookie" [...] may also be taken, these are <b>polished,</b> the <b>rings</b> identified, and the number of rings and the distance between each are recorded. By comparing rings from multiple trees, through cross-dating, a dendrochronologists can determine if rings are missing or if false rings are present. Through this process the tree ring record can be used to investigate past climatic conditions. Tropical trees often lack annual rings and ages for these trees can be measured using radiocarbon dating of wood samples from the trees.|$|R

Fifteen trees were sampled in October-November 2003 and stem discs taken at three height levels of its height (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m and 18. 7 m), and cores were collected at DBH. Transverse surfaces of the discs and cores were <b>polished</b> for <b>ring</b> identification. Core cross sections were first digitized and disc cross sections were observed under the microscope. Three randomly selected radii were analyzed in each disc. Ring width measurement and ring counting were done using image analysis software. The distinction between heartwood and sapwood was performed macroscopically by colour difference, and heartwood radius and sapwood width were measured. The relationship between stem and heartwood radius was studied for each disc and heartwood percentage by radius was determined. Radial ring width curves are presented for the different axial positions within the stem, and ring width variability was analyzed. Growth rates were calculated and age-radius relationships were estimated using cumulative growth curves. Growth rings were large and well defined in the juvenile phase, reflecting the specie’s fast-growing character. The year-to-year variation of ring width showed a similar pattern among trees. Mean ring width ranged between 4. 3 - 7. 3 mm for the first 20 years and 3. 3 - 5. 1 mm for 30 to 45 years. Pith eccentricity was evident in the lower part of the stem and ring wedging occurred. On average, heartwood represented 84 % of the radius and sapwood contained 6 to 11 rings. The age-related variation of ring width and the occurrence in the lower part of the tree stems of eccentricity and wedging rings, highlights the importance of appropriate stand management, particularly regarding basal density distribution over time, whenever optimized timber production is envisaged...|$|R
40|$|A novel type of {{hydrodynamic}} ultramicroelectrode (UME) is described, {{which employs}} a ring UME coupled {{to a high}} speed perpendicular impinging microjet. Two types of ring UME have been fabricated, both based on an optical fibre, coated in a thin metal film, which is then sealed using either epoxy resin or glass. After <b>polishing,</b> a thin <b>ring</b> UME (approximate to 300 - 1000 nm) is obtained. When employed in the impinging microjet system, both UMEs show an increase in mass-transport-limited current with flow rate, for simple redox processes such as the reduction of Ru(NH 3) (6) (3 +) or methyl viologen dication in aqueous solution. However, the mass-transport rates observed are significantly lower than predicted by solving the Navier-Stokes and diffusion equations for an idealised coplanar UME. Characterisation of the UMEs with microscopy reveals imperfections on a 10 nm- 1 pin length scale which impact mass-transport significantly. When these imperfections {{are included in the}} simulations, it is possible to account for the transport-limiting currents observed experimentally. A general implication of the studies in this paper is that even small perturbations in electrode structure can dramatically influence high-speed convective flow across small-scale UMEs, such that thorough geometric characterisation of UMEs employed in fast-flow systems is important.

La madera de teca (Tectona grandis L. f.) es una de las más valiosas en el comercio internacional y una especie importante para la silvicultura tropical. La teca se encuentra en la isla de Timor Leste, pero no existe información disponible sobre su crecimiento en esta región. Se estudió una plantación pura no manejada que fue establecida entre 1940 y 1950 en el Norte de Timor Leste. Entre Octubre- Noviembre 2003 se cosecharon 15 árboles y al tronco se les extrajeron discos a tres niveles de altura (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m y 18. 7 m), y se recolectaron núcleos a la altura del pecho (DAP). El conteo y la medición de los anillos se realizaron mediante el software de análisis de imagen. La distinción entre el duramen y la albura se realizó macroscópicamente por la diferencia de color, y se midieron el radio del duramen y el ancho de la albura. Para cada disco se estudió la relación entre el tallo y radio del duramen y el porcentaje del duramen. Las curvas de variación del ancho de los anillos se presentan para las diferentes posiciones axiales dentro del tronco y se analizó la variabilidad del ancho de los anillos. Las tasas de crecimiento fueron calculadas y las relaciones de radio con la edad se calcularon usando las curvas de crecimiento acumulado. Los anillos de crecimiento eran grandes y bien definidos en la fase juvenil, lo que refleja el carácter de crecimiento rápido de esta especie. La variación en la anchura de los anillos año a año mostró un patrón similar entre los árboles. La anchura media del anillo osciló entre 4. 3 - 7. 3 mm para los primeros 20 años y 3. 3 - 5. 1 mm para los de 30 a 45 años. La excentricidad de la médula fue evidente en la parte inferior del tallo y se observó la formación de anillos sobrepuestos. En promedio, el duramen representó el 84 % del radio y la albura mostró entre 6 y 11 anillos.
