Paid sick leave was available to 75 percent of full-time workers and 27 percent of part-time workers.

Access to paid sick leave benefits ranged from 21 percent for the lowest wage category to 87 percent for the highest wage category. These data are from the National Compensation Survey (NCS), which provides comprehensive measures of compensation cost trends and incidence and provisions of employee benefit plans.|$|E
40|$|To date, Australia has no {{national}} <b>paid</b> maternity <b>leave</b> scheme, {{and access to}} such leave remains limited.

25|$|Mr Barker was {{employed}} by the Commonwealth Bank from when he left school in 1981. By 2004 he had been promoted to a position as an executive manager. On 2 March 2009, Mr Barker was told that his position was to be made redundant and {{that if he was}} not redeployed within the Bank his employment would be terminated. Mr Barker was placed on <b>paid</b> <b>leave</b> and his access to the Bank's intranet and email facilities was terminated. Having been deprived of access to his Bank email account and voicemail, Mr Barker was not informed about an alternative position within the Bank until 26 March 2009. He was not contacted by the recruitment consultant involved in facilitating the recruitment process for that position, nor was the possibility of retraining for that role discussed with him. The Commonwealth Bank terminated Mr Barker's employment on 9 April 2009 by reason of redundancy. At the time of his dismissal, Mr Barker's salary was approximately $150,000 per annum. Mr Barker claimed that the Bank acted in breach of its own policies and in so doing breached his contract of employment because (1) the policies were incorporated into his contract or (2) of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence. Mr Barker also claimed the Commonwealth Bank engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and <b>paid</b> <b>leave.</b> The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade union rights, but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E

There he {{attended the}} Bourges and University of Paris. But religious persecution forced him to leave Paris for Strassburg, but being unable to secure employment, returned to Zürich. One of his teachers in Zürich acted as a foster father to him {{after the death of his}} father at the Battle of Kappel (1531), another provided him with three years of board and lodging, while yet another arranged his further education at the upper school in Strassbourg, the Strassbourg Academy. There he broadened his knowledge of ancient languages by studying Hebrew. In 1535, religious unrest drove him back to Zürich, where he made what some considered an imprudent marriage at the age of 19, of a woman from another poor family who had no dowry. Although some of his friends again came to his aid, he was appointed to obtaining a teaching position for him, this was in the lowest class and attracted a stipend barely more than a pittance.
