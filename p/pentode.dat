Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 <b>pentode.</b> Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of their invention, such devices were known as rectifiers. In 1919, the year tetrodes were invented, William Henry Eccles coined the term diode from the Greek roots di (from δί), meaning 'two', and ode (from ὁδός), meaning 'path'. (However, the word diode itself, as well as triode, tetrode, <b>pentode,</b> hexode, were already in use as terms of {{multiplex}} telegraphy; see, for example, The telegraphic journal and electrical review, September 10, 1886, p.252).|$|E

25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a <b>pentode,</b> which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E
25|$|Except for diodes, {{additional}} electrodes {{are positioned}} between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes {{are referred to}} as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass {{on their way to the}} plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, <b>pentode,</b> etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the <b>pentode</b> tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.|$|E
25|$|A system {{widely used}} in Europe known as the Mullard–Philips tube designation, also {{extended}} to transistors, uses a letter, followed {{by one or more}} further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power <b>pentode</b> with no consumer equivalent.|$|E

Often, but not always, in the European valve naming scheme for <b>pentodes</b> an even number indicated a sharp-cutoff device while odd indicated remote-cutoff; the EF37 was an exception to this general trend, perhaps due to its history as an update to the EF36 ("The Mullard EF36, EF37 and EF37A" [...] at the National Valve Museum).|$|R

The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 <b>pentode</b> valves, which had been widely used during wartime. The SSEM used one Williams tube to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory.

[...] A {{deceptively simple}} design, the circuit {{provided}} {{a tap on}} the primary winding of the output transformer to provide feedback to the second grid, which improved the amplifier's linearity. [...] With the tap placed at the anode end of the primary winding, the tube (valve) is effectively connected as a triode, and if the tap was at the supply end, as a pure <b>pentode.</b> [...] Blumlein discovered that if the tap was {{placed at a distance}} 15–20% down from the supply end of the output transformer, the tube or valve would combine the positive features of both the triode and the <b>pentode</b> design.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a <b>pentode,</b> meaning five electrodes. The <b>pentode</b> was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing <b>pentode</b> behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
2500|$|To {{further reduce}} the cost and {{complexity}} of radio equipment, two separate structures (triode and <b>pentode</b> for instance) could be combined in the bulb of a single multisection tube. An early example was the Loewe 3NF. This 1920s device had three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, {{it was able to}} substantially undercut the competition since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the US, Cleartron briefly produced the [...] "Multivalve" [...] triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also had a single tube socket, but because it used a four-pin base, the additional element connections were made on a [...] "mezzanine" [...] platform {{at the top of the}} tube base.|$|E
50|$|Loewe were to {{also offer}} the 2NF (two tetrodes plus passive components) and the WG38 (two <b>pentodes,</b> a triode and the passive components).|$|R
50|$|Larger, higher-power types {{such as the}} 316A, 368A, 388A, and 703A triodes and the 713A and 717A <b>pentodes</b> were {{referred}} to as Doorknob tubes.|$|R
50|$|The Mercury was {{an early}} {{commercial}} computer from the mid 1950s built by Ferranti. It was the successor to the Ferranti Mark 1, adding a floating point unit for improved performance, and increased reliability by replacing the Williams tube memory with core memory and using more solid state components. The computer had roughly 2000 vacuum tubes (mostly type CV2179/A2134 <b>pentodes,</b> EL81 <b>pentodes</b> and CV2493/ECC88 double triodes) and 2000 germanium diodes. Nineteen Mercuries were sold before Ferranti moved on to newer designs.|$|R
2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff <b>pentode</b> connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentode</b> tubes {{were first}} used in consumer-type radio receivers. A {{well-known}} <b>pentode</b> type, the EF50, was designed {{before the start}} of World War II, and was extensively used in radar sets and other military electronic equipment. The <b>pentode</b> contributed to the electronic preponderance of the Allies.|$|E
50|$|The 12BV7, 12BY7, 12BY7A, and {{equivalents}} were a {{class of}} medium-low gain, <b>pentode</b> vacuum tube amplifiers using the Noval socket configuration. Although originally marketed as <b>pentode</b> tubes for use in early television receivers, they found additional uses in audio and radiotelephone equipment. The series shares the EIA 9BF pinout {{with a number of}} other miniature <b>pentode</b> tubes of the era.|$|E
50|$|For signal <b>pentodes,</b> an odd {{numerical}} identifier {{most often}} identified a variable transconductance (remote-cutoff) valve whereas an even number identified a 'high slope' (sharp-cutoff) valve.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} valve amplifiers {{operate in}} Class AB1 (typically <b>pentodes</b> in the ultra-linear configuration), trading open-loop linearity against higher power; some run in pure class A.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pentode operation" [...] of beam power tubes {{is often}} {{described}} in manufacturers' handbooks and data sheets, resulting in some confusion in terminology.They are not <b>pentodes,</b> of course.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch. This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic. [...] This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the grid bias changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device. This variation usually appears in the <b>pentode</b> form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu <b>pentode</b> or remote-cutoff <b>pentode.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{secondary}} emission from the anode (US: plate) in the tetrode tube was solved by Philips/Mullard {{with the introduction}} of a suppressor grid which resulted in the <b>pentode</b> design. Since Philips held a patent on this design, other manufacturers were keen to produce <b>pentode</b> type tubes without infringing the patent. In the UK, two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, produced and patented an alternate design in 1932. Their design had the following features (compared to the normal <b>pentode).</b>|$|E
