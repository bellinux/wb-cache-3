40|$|Background: Noise mapping in {{industry}} {{can be useful}} to assess the risks of harmful noise, or to monitor noise in machine rooms. Using GIS -based software for plotting noise maps in an indoor noisy work environment can be helpful for occupational hygienists to monitor noise pollution. Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} a noisy <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> of a food industry in Ghazvin industrial zone, to evaluate noise levels by GIS technique. For this reason the floor of <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> was divided into squares of 2 Ã— 2 meters and the center of each square was marked as a measurement station based on NIOSH method. The sound pressure level in each station was measured and then the measurement values were imported into Arc GIS software to plot noise map. Results: Unlike the current method, the noise maps generated by GIS technique are consistent with the nature of sound propagation. Conclusion: This study showed that for an indoor work environment, the application of GIS technology rendering the assessment of noise levels in the form of noise maps, is more realistic and more accurate than the routine method which is now being used by the occupational hygienists. ...|$|E
40|$|Bio-composites are {{materials}} {{made up of}} a bio-fibre and a polymer, {{the latter}} being either bio-based or fossil-based, and are developed for various reasons, for example to decrease the use of non-renewable resources such as crude oil. DuraPulp, a bio-composite of wood pulp and poly-lactic acid (PLA) developed by SÃ¶dra in Sweden is such a material. The goals of this study were to evaluate the main environmental impacts arising from the different life cycle phases of DuraPulp using life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare its impacts with those of several other composites and to evaluate two applications of the material from an environmental point of view. These two applications are a car door panel (a product with a long lifespan) and a <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> (a product with a short lifespan). The results show that bio-composites have a smaller environmental impact than composite materials made of 100 % fossil-based plastics. The results also indicate that the <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> is the preferred application from an environmental point of view. Furthermore, the main contributors to the impact depend on the application. Lastly, the results indicate that replacing PLA with bio-polyethylene lowers the environmental impact of DuraPulp regardless of its application...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{mutations}} and aberrations are {{a problem}} for all forms of life. Eukaryotes specifically have developed ways of identifying and repairing various DNA mutations in a complex and refractory chromatin environment. The chromatin structure {{is much more than}} a <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> for DNA; it is dynamic. Cells utilize and manipulate chromatin for gene regulation, genome organization and maintenance of genome integrity. Once a DNA aberration has occurred, the various DNA repair machineries interact with chromatin proteins, such as the histone variant H 2 A. X, and chromatin remodeling machines of the SWI/SNF family to gain access and repair the lesion in a timely manner. Recent studies have thus begun to address the roles of chromatin proteins in DNA repair as well as to dissect the functions of DNA repair machinery in vitro on more physiological, nucleosomal templates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As the Model Driven Development (MDD) and Product Line Engineering (PLE) {{appear as}} major trends for {{reducing}} software development complexity and costs, an important missing stone becomes more visible: {{there is no}} standard and reusable assets for packaging the know-how and artifacts required when applied these approaches. To overcome this limit, we introduce in this paper the notion of MDA Component, i. e., a <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> for encapsulating business know-how and required resources {{in order to support}} specific operations on a certain kind of model. The aim of this work is to provide a standard way for representing this know-how packaging units. This is done by introducing a two-layer MOF-compliant metamodel. Whilst the first layer focuses on the definition of the structure and contents of the MDA Component, the second layer introduces a language independent way for describing its behavior. For a full specification, both layers can be merged using the UML 2. 0 package merge facility...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic cells contain long DNA {{molecules}} (about {{two meters}} {{for a human}} cell) which are tightly packed inside the micrometric nuclei. Nucleosomes are the basic <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> of the DNA which allows this millionfold compactification. A long-standing puzzle is to understand the principles which allow cells to both organize their genomes into chromatin fibers in the crowded space of their nuclei, and also to keep the DNA accessible to many factors and enzymes. With the nucleosomes covering about {{three quarters of the}} DNA, their positions are essential because these influence which genes can be regulated by the transcription factors and which cannot. We study physical models which predict the genome-wide organization of the nu-cleosomes and also the relevant energies which dictate this organization. In the last five years, the study of chromatin knew many important advances. In particular, in the field of nucleosome positioning, new techniques of identifying nucleosomes and the competing DNA-binding factors appeared, as chemical mapping with hydroxyl rad-icals, ChIP-exo, among others, the resolution of the nucleosome maps increased by using paired-end sequencing, and the price of sequencing an entire genome decreased...|$|E
