40|$|Privileged Spaces: Agricultural Productivity and Urban <b>Provisioning</b> <b>Zones</b> in Pre-industrial Europe. G. Grantham. Urbanized regions {{constituted}} the privileged economic space of pre-industrial societies. It {{was here that}} the gains from the division of labour were most fully realized. This paper investigates the question whether agricultural productivity set an effective limit {{to the extent of}} such gains of constraining the size of pre-industrial cities. Simulations of the provisioning regions for cities of different sizes using contemporary input coefficients indicate that zones defined by direct marketing of produce by farmers could readily support cities up to 250, 000. The binding constraint on cities below this size was demographic; above this size it was the cost of organizing a stable long-distance trade in foodstuffs. Productivity was highest within the zone of direct marketing. These findings suggest that pre-industrial agricultural productivity was determined more by commercial opportunity than autonomous technological change. Grantham George W., Sarget Marie-Noëlle.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of innovation is a theme that is commonly found in many Labour Government policies and publications since 1997, especially in education. However, in practice, innovation {{is often difficult to}} define and can be challenging to implement. Since April 2000, small (Excellence in Cities) Education Action Zones have been developed as one strand of the Government's 'Excellence in Cities' (EiC) programme to raise standards of education in deprived urban areas of England. The whole Education Action Zone initiative (both large and small) has been promoted by the Government as a test-bed for innovation in order to improve educational standards. This study reviews the development of the Education Action Zone initiative and through an empirical study, investigates the impact that the introduction of small (EiC) Education Action Zones has had on stimulating educational innovation in zone schools in the inner city areas of England. The study considers how the directors of the small zones have interpreted the meaning of innovation, the types of innovation that have been implemented in the zones and the impact that these innovations have had on improving education <b>provision</b> in the <b>zone</b> schools, as well as the barriers and constraints that the directors have experienced when introducing innovations. The key findings from this study indicate that there is uncertainty about the meaning of innovation amongst zone directors, especially whether innovations have to be original ideas or just new within the context of their zone. The impact of the innovations that have been implemented so far is difficult to assess, due to the short timescales involved and the wide variety of innovations introduced. The innovations that have been introduced into the zones, mainly in the areas of pupil support, partnerships, curriculum, ICT and involving the wider community, have been new to the individual zones rather than 'new' per se. The zone directors do appear to have overcome many of the barriers and constraints that they have encountered when implementing innovations in the zones, resulting in thriving active partnerships developing between zone schools which should have positive outcomes for raising achievement in the future...|$|R
40|$|Development {{and testing}} of {{mathematical}} relationships describing the infiltration, surface runoff, percolation and soil moisture status in the crop root zone in an irrigated or non-irrigated crop land are presented and discussed in detail. ^ The developed relationships, along with Penman 2 ̆ 7 s evaporation formula, were then structured into a single digital computer model to simulate the hydrologic response of an agricultural watershed. ^ This model {{can be used to}} determine the amount of precipitation and/or irrigation water which moves vertically downward and percolates out of the crop root zone on a daily basis for various soil conditions. ^ Major daily climatic data and the soil moisture characteristics are required input data to the model. ^ The model applies the developed equations to compute surface runoff, infiltration, potential and actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage and deep percolation from the crop root <b>zone.</b> <b>Provision</b> to estimate the crop irrigation water requirement is also included in the model. ^ Infiltration and surface runoff are related to the antecendent moisture condition of the surface soil layer, soil cover, slope, and the amount of precipitation received in a specific time increment. ^ Soil moisture movement in the crop root zone occurs under unsaturated condition and is determined by expansion of the one-dimensional differential form of the continuity equation. ^ Potential evapotranspiration is based on Penman 2 ̆ 7 s equation and a set of monthly crop coefficients developed from experimental data. The actual crop evapotranspiration is then a function of its potential and is limited to the amount of available moisture in the crop root zone of the soil. ^ Irrigation amounts during the crop growing season are computed based on the crop type, soil moisture deficiency and an empirically derived irrigation factor. ^ Daily amount of percolation from the crop root zone is estimated using a statistical relationship developed by analysis of 7 -year daily measured percolation and soil moisture data. This relationship has an exponential form and relates percolation to the degree of soil saturation, the saturation hydraulic conductivity and the slope of the soil moisture retention curve on log-log scale. ^ To evaluate the performance of the complete model, it was applied to the 7 -year continuous daily records from two weighing lysimeters. The results indicate excellent agreement between measured and simulated evapotranspiration, percolation and the soil moisture status in the root zone profile (r (GREATERTHEQ). 93). ^ The developed equation for estimating surface runoff was tested separately. The major rainfall-runoff events and their corresponding soil moisture status, recorded in a small watershed during the 1964 - 1973 period, were used for this purpose. The results of the test showed an excellent relationship (r =. 93) between computed and measured runoff for all events. ^ Further, the model was combined with a groundwater flow model and applied to an agricultural watershed where both surface and groundwater factors are important and interdependent. The resultant hydrologic response including the groundwater levels are presented. A unique feature of model application was partitioning the watershed area into a large number of computational units, providing a grid work for data definition based on land capability classes and land use effects. An important step toward improving historical matching of groundwater levels was taken by this application. ...|$|R
