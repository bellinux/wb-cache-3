AOD is a leading provider of private‐label organic milk to retailers throughout the U. S., and operates five farms in Colorado and Texas as well as a processing plant in Colorado. This study extended Phase I results to include a second year of data on energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the milk <b>production</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle.</b> It also added three new categories of environmental impact— nutrient use, water use, and solid waste generation—based on their relevance to agricultural production systems.

The functional unit of analysis was one gallon of packaged fluid milk.

One {{of the problems that}} we have to consider in developing such reservoirs is the stress-dependent formation properties (permeability and porosity) during the <b>production</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> of the reservoir. In general, producing from a hydrocarbon reservoir may result in a decrease of fluid pressure and thus a subsequent increase of effective overburden load on porous reservoir rock, which will compact the reservoir rock and alter the detailed pore geometry (as a matter of course, injection into a reservoir will have the opposite situation). If fluid flow properties of the reservoir rocks are highly sensitive to effective stress changes and rock deformation, the reservoir should be considered to be stress-sensitive (Chin et al. 2000 a).|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} variable characteristics of estuary water are {{the concentration of}} dissolved oxygen, salinity and sediment load. There is extreme spatial variability in salinity, {{with a range of}} near zero at the tidal limit of tributary rivers to 3.4% at the estuary mouth. At any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons, making it a harsh environment for organisms. Sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize. No points of attachment exist for algae, so vegetation based habitat is not established. Sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species, and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem. Lastly, dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms. Nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary <b>production</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycles,</b> perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water; thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{efficient}} approach to model stochastic hybrid systems and to implement Monte Carlo simulation for such models, thus allowing {{the calculation of}} various probabilistic indicators: reliability, availability, average <b>production,</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> cost etc. Stochastic hybrid systems can be considered, most of the time, as Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP). Although PDMP have been long ago formalized and studied from a theoretical point of view by Davis (Davis 1993), they are still difficult to use in real applications. The solution proposed here relies on a novel method to handle the case when the hazard rate of a transition λ depends on continuous variables of the system model, {{the use of an}} extension of Modelica 3. 3 and on Monte Carlo simulation.

One option is to balance demand over the season and <b>production</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> by sourcing a specific product from different locations. A manufacturing firm can then order products that matches the lowest forecasted sales volume from distant locations, complementing orders over the season or product life cycle from closer places and emergency orders from suppliers in adjacent countries.
