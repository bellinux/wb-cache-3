5|$|However, {{shortly after}} {{returning}} to the French Riviera in 1929, Hunter suffered a severe breakdown, forcing his sister to bring him home to Scotland in September. He recovered, and began to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait {{may have been a}} gesture of thanks.|$|E
5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

Nellie later asks Pam to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> mural in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{inspired}} by Jacques-Louis David's series of five Napoleon Crossing the Alps paintings (1801–1805). David's works also show Napoleon's journey through the Great St. Bernard Pass, but there are significant stylistic {{differences between the two}} conceptions. Delaroche's Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David's wears a pristine uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> realistic portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.|$|E
50|$|By {{the next}} year he had <b>painted</b> <b>a</b> Marriage of the Virgin and Flight from Egypt for the church of San Giuseppe.

50|$|For years, {{the bridge}} was <b>painted</b> with <b>a</b> silver {{aluminum}} <b>paint</b> under <b>a</b> special work order, but people complained about glare off the bridge. The concrete pylons were initially <b>painted</b> <b>a</b> sky-blue color. In June 1976 as part of Bicentennial projects, it was <b>painted</b> <b>a</b> yellow-ochre color to match the gold leafed cupola on the nearby State Capitol.|$|R

5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E
5|$|While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to {{what exactly}} he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty, {{and most of all}} his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> feast.|$|E
50|$|He <b>painted</b> <b>an</b> Apparition of the Virgin to St Stanislao Kostka (1824) for {{the chamber}} {{in which the}} Saint died; in the Jesuit Novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale.

He also <b>painted</b> <b>a</b> {{remarkable}} portrait of himself as an asthenic artist in a squalid studio (1813, now in the Uffizi, Florence). He <b>painted</b> <b>a</b> mural depicting Propagation of Faith for the throne room of the Palazzo Quirinale. Minardi left behind a trove of drawings and designs.|$|R

There she trained with her uncle Robert Hawker Dowling and teacher Jane Sutherland and took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, becoming a professional artist in the late 1880s. In 1892 she left Australia, travelling first to South Africa, where she met and painted for Cecil Rhodes, {{and then on to}} Europe. She lived and studied there for the subsequent decade, except for a return to South Africa in 1899 to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> portrait of Rhodes. Between 1895 and 1904 her works were exhibited at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Like other Florentines {{of their}} {{financial}} means, Francesco's {{family members were}} art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolomeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> fresco at the family's burial site in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze. Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another member of his family. Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait {{of his wife and}} to Domenico Puligo for a painting of Saint Francis of Assisi.

5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E
