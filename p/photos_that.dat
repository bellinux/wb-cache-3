25|$|On February 23, 2010, Facebook {{was granted}} a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed.

One {{of the most popular}} applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos. Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of <b>photos</b> <b>that</b> a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200photos per album.|$|E
