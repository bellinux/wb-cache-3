5000|$|Figure 1 shows a graph of the {{behaviour}} of {{an ordinary}} viscous (or Newtonian) fluid in red, for example in a pipe. If the pressure {{at one end of}} a pipe is increased this produces a stress on the fluid tending to make it move (called the shear stress) and the volumetric flow rate increases proportionally. However, for a Bingham Plastic fluid (in blue), stress can be applied but it will not flow until a certain value, the yield stress, is reached. Beyond this point the flow rate increases steadily with increasing shear stress. This is roughly the way in which Bingham presented his observation, in an experimental study of paints. These properties allow a Bingham plastic to have a textured surface with peaks and ridges instead of a featureless surface like a Newtonian fluid. Figure 2 shows {{the way in which it}} is normally presented currently. The graph shows shear stress on the vertical axis and shear rate on the horizontal one. (Volumetric flow rate depends on the size of the pipe, shear rate is a measure of how the velocity changes with distance. It is proportional to flow rate, but does not depend on pipe size.) As before, the Newtonian fluid flows and gives a shear rate for any finite value of shear stress. However, the Bingham plastic again does not exhibit any shear rate (no flow and thus no velocity) until a certain stress is achieved. For the Newtonian fluid the slope of this line is the viscosity, which is the only parameter needed to describe its flow. By contrast, the Bingham plastic requires two parameters, the yield stress and the slope of the line, known as the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity.</b>|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{parallel}} plates {{determined the}} higher {{values for the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities</b> {{as compared with the}} concentric cylinders. A possible reason may be the settlement of suspended particles. As parallel plates have the large spread diameter as compared with the concentric cylinders. Thus, suspended cement and graphene particles start to settle down and provide great hindrance against the deformation of cement paste. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sedimentation or creaming will be a key factor in indicating the higher <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities</b> for parallel plates (Nehdi and Rahman 2004; Barnes 2000).|$|R

In this particular case Bingham yield stresses and Bingham <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities.</b> Predictive models were developed from analysing data in a slurry database to predict the Bingham yield stresses and Bingham <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities</b> from their material properties. The overall goal {{of this study was}} to develop a validated set of mathematical models to predict Bingham yield stresses and Bingham <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities</b> from their material properties. The interaction of the non-Newtonian material properties is very complex at varying mass solids concentrations. The evaluation of these interactions in terms of constitutive equations is almost impossible and the relationship between material properties, mass solids concentration and rheology can only be modelled in a statistical manner. The validity of each model is checked to ensure that predictions and interpretations are unbiased and efficient. This is done by comparing the resulting models to experimental data generated from test work. An in-depth analysis was conducted to see the interrelationship between the material properties and how they affect the yield stress and viscosity values...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the workability of fresh portland cement concrete while it is still in the mixing truck by determining fundamental rheological parameters (<b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> and yield stress). Nine concrete mixtures with different values of yield stress and <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> were tested in a concrete truck. The measurements made with the truck were based on the typical method of determining the flow behavior in a traditional fluid rheometer; that is, the shear rate in the mixing truck was swept from high to low by varying the rotation speed of the drum.

40|$|Structural {{failure of}} the {{erythrocyte}} membrane in shear deformation occurs when the maximum shear resultant (force/length) exceeds a critical value, the yield shear resultant. When the yield shear resultant is exceeded, the membrane flows with a rate of deformation characterized by the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficient. The temperature dependence of the yield shear resultant and the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficient have been measured over the temperature range 10 - 40 degrees C. Over this range the yield shear resultant does not change significantly (+/- 15 %), but the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficient changes exponentially from a value of 1. 3 X 10 (- 2) surface poise (dyn s/cm) at 10 degrees C to a value of 6. 2 X 10 (- 4) surface poise (SP) at 40 degrees C. The different temperature dependence of these two parameters is not surprising, inasmuch as they characterize different molecular events. The yield shear resultant depends on the number and strength of intermolecular connections within the membrane skeleton, whereas the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity</b> depends on the frictional interactions between molecular segments as they move past {{one another in the}} flowing surface. From the temperature dependence of the <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosity,</b> a temperature-viscosity coefficient, E, can be calculated: eta p = constant X exp( [...] E/RT). This quantity (E) is related to the probability that a molecular segment can "jump" to its next location in the flowing network.

As expected the apparent viscosity reduced with increasing temperature (55 to 37. 5 from 60 o- 100 oC for Sample B).

An attempt {{has been made to}} focus on the case of two-dimensional Casson fluid flow over a horizontal melting surface embedded in a thermally stratified medium. Since the viscosity of the non-Newtonian fluid tends to take energy from the motion (kinetic energy) and transform it into internal energy, the viscous dissipation term is accommodated in the energy equation.

To ensure a constant plastics part quality the set process parameters of the {{injection moulding}} machines are kept constant by appropriate closed loop control strategies today. Assuming a constant quality of the processed plastic raw material, this strategy is effective.

The surface morphological features seen in the panoramic images made by the Venera 13 and 14 landers are examined in detail. The major element compositions measured by the Soviet probes indicate that the surface rocks at the Venera 13 site resemble a terrestrial tholeite composite whereas the Venera 14 rocks are similar to terrestrial alkali basalts. Few data exist on the rheological properties of such magma types on Earth; these properties are a strong function of magma volatile content, and there are important gaps in our knowledge of the typical volatiles {{to be associated with the}} magmas on Venus. However, the suggestion that Venusian magmas may be water poor together with consideration of the fact that the high Venusian surface temperatures may cause magmas to experience up to 50 K less cooling during their rise to the surface than corresponding terrestrial counterparts, leads to the finding that Venusian magmas may typically have <b>plastic</b> <b>viscosities,</b> E, up to a factor of three greater than terrestrial counterparts on eruption. A similar analysis of yield strength variations with temperature, magma composition and volatile content suggests that temperature will exert the main control and that Venusian magma yield strengths, Y, may be a factor of several times smaller than those of terrestrial equivalents...|$|R

Since the rheological behaviour of the molten chocolate mass is key in chocolate production, the rheology of fibre-rich materials in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) is studied and {{compared to the}} rheology of sucrose in MCT. The materials studied are side streams of the fruit and vegetable processing industry: lemon peels, spent grain, grape pomace and pecan fibre. All suspensions showed shear thinning behaviour at volume fractions > 0. 2, where side stream materials showed lower shear thinning behaviour than sucrose. The values for the maximum packing fraction, obtained via the Maron–Pierce equation and using the Casson <b>Plastic</b> <b>Viscosities,</b> were lower for the side stream materials than for sucrose. Addition of lecithin resulted in {{a decrease in the}} Casson Yield Value of sucrose suspensions, which was not observed with the fibre-rich materials. The rheological behaviour of the fibre-rich materials suspended in MCT is explained by the effective volume of the irregularly shaped particles. The behaviour of sucrose suspensions is explained by the formation of aggregates, which seem to be promoted by water bridges between the particles. Overall, the behaviour of the sucrose dispersions was very different compared to the other materials with respect to the shear thinning behaviour, the impact of lecithin as well as the impact of water. Therefore it is suggested that only partial replacement of sucrose by fibre-rich materials will be successful in industrial product development...|$|R
