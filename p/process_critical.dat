50|$|Acute {{inflammation}} {{is characterized}} by marked vascular changes, including vasodilation, increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced {{by the actions of}} various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the arteriole level, progressing to the capillary level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of plasma into the tissues, with resultant stasis due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood - a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows leukocytes to marginate (move) along the endothelium, a <b>process</b> <b>critical</b> to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the shearing force along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood {{into the middle of the}} vessel.|$|E
