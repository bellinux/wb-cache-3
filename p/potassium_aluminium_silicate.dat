50|$|The crust {{ranges from}} 5 - 70 km in depth {{and is the}} {{outermost}} layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5-10 km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories - sial and sima (Suess,1831-1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11 km below the Conrad discontinuity (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most {{commonly known as the}} Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{medium-term}} performance of inorganic polymer (geopolymer) concretes derived from both fly ash and metakaolin precursor materials. The strength development and mineralogical changes of {{this class of}} concretes were evaluated over a three-year period, using an equivalent conventional Grade N 40 (40 MPa) ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete as the reference product. The initial strength gain of the metakaolin samples was high, as the concrete reached 57 MPa at seven days compared to 11 MPa for the fly ash samples. However, the overall strength gain for fly ash samples at three years was about 64 % {{higher than that of}} OPC concretes, and 8 % higher than the corresponding metakaolin concrete. Also, binders used in all concretes fell well below the 0. 1 % expansion threshold in standard accelerated ASR tests. After three years of curing, the early-age reaction products of inorganic polymer samples appeared to be mainly amorphous solid solutions of sodium <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> structures. However, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggested that the resulting compounds were gradually becoming more ordered with time. Clear similarities in respect of the position of the X-ray amorphous band - characteristic of the gel phase - could be established for concretes made with metakaolin and fly ash; although marginal differences were evident in the evolution of isolated crystalline peaks between the two formulations. These results indicate medium-term phase stability, suggesting that inorganic polymers may yet be viable candidate binders in specialized concrete applications, with predictable medium-term performance characteristics...|$|E

50|$|The {{stone is}} a chalk from the Lower Chalk of the Cretaceous age, {{the period of}} {{geological}} time approximately 145 - 66 million years ago. It is greyish-white to light beige in colour, often with a greenish tinge.

The stone has a gritty texture due to the frequent presence of shell fossils. This stone has been quarried at Totternhoe Quarry in Dunstable, Bedfordshire by H.G. Clarke & Son since 1920.|$|R
40|$|Combustion of a biomass with an {{enhanced}} content of chlorine (Cl) {{can result in}} operational problems including deposit formation and superheater corrosion. The strategies to reduce such problems include co-combustion {{and the use of}} additives. The positive effects of such measures are mainly due to sulphation of the alkali chlorides (KCl for biomass) to less corrosive alkali sulphates or capture of released alkali (K) in components such as <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates.</b> A mixture of wood pellets and straw pellets was fired in a 12 MW circulation fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. PVC was added to the fuel in order to achieve a further enhanced reference level of gaseous KCl during certain tests. Two strategies were applied to decrease the risk for superheater corrosion by reducing gaseous KCl and content of chlorine in deposits. The strategies were sulphation of KCl by injection of ammonium sulphate and co-combustion with peat. During co-combustion of biomass with peat both sulphation of KCl and capture of released K in ash components can be of importance. The results were evaluated by means of several advanced measurement tools including IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous KCl), deposit measurements (chemical composition in collected deposits, initial corrosion), ash analysis (chemical composition in fly ashes). The overall performance was better for ammonium sulphate, which significantly reduced gaseous KCl. Meanwhile almost no chlorine was found in the deposits. Only a minor reduction of gaseous KCl was obtained during co-combustion of biomass with peat although the chlorine content in the deposits was greatly reduced...|$|R
50|$|Phillipsite is {{a mineral}} {{series of the}} zeolite group; a {{hydrated}} <b>potassium,</b> calcium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> approximating to (Ca,Na2,K2)3Al6Si10O32·12H2O. The members of the series are phillipsite-K, phillipsite-Na and phillipsite-Ca. The crystals are monoclinic, but only complex cruciform twins are known, these being exactly like twins of harmotome which also forms a series with phillipsite-Ca. Crystals of phillipsite are, however, usually smaller and more transparent and glassy than those of harmotome. Spherical groups with a radially fibrous structure and bristled with crystals on the surface are not uncommon. The Mohs hardness is 4.5, and the specific gravity is 2.2. The species was established by Armand Lévy in 1825 and named after William Phillips. French authors use the name Christianite (after Christian VIII of Denmark), given by A. Des Cloizeaux in 1847.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the use of propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes as drug reservoirs in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose tablets. The matrix tablets containing the complexes were prepared and characterised with respect to propranolol release and were subsequently compared with those loading propranolol or a propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> physical mixture. Additionally, the effects of varying viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, compression pressures and calcium acetate incorporation on the drug release characteristics of the complex-loaded tablets were also examined. The results showed that the complex-loaded tablets have higher tablet hardness than those containing propranolol or a physical mixture. The drug release from the complex-loaded tablets followed a zero-order release kinetic, whereas an anomalous transport was found in the propranolol or physical mixture tablets. The drug release rate of the complex tablet significantly decreased with increasing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose viscosity grade. Increase in the compression pressure caused a decrease in the drug release rate of the tablets. Furthermore, the incorporation of calcium ions could accelerate propranolol release, particularly in acidic medium, because calcium ions could be exchanged with propranolol molecules intercalated in the silicate layers of magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate.</b> These findings suggest that propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes show strong potential for use as drug reservoirs in matrix tablets intended for modifying drug release...|$|R
