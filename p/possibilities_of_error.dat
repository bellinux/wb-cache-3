Farther, I {{know that}} many {{conscientious}} persons are desirous of encouraging art, but feel {{at the same time}} that their judgment is not certain enough to secure their choice of the best kind of art. To such persons I would now especially address myself, fully admitting the greatness of their difficulty. It is not an easy thing to acquire a knowledge of painting; and it is by no means a desirable thing to encourage bad painting. One bad painter makes another, and one bad painting will often spoil a great many healthy judgments. I could name popular painters now living, who have retarded the taste of their generation by twenty years. Unless, therefore, we are certain not merely that we like a painting, but that we are right in liking it, we should never buy it. For there is one way of spending money which is perfectly safe, and in which we may be absolutely sure of doing good. I mean, by paying for simple sculpture of natural objects, chiefly flowers and animals. You are aware that the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in sculpture are much less than in painting; it is altogether an easier and simpler art, invariably attaining perfection long before painting, in the progress of a national mind. It may indeed be corrupted by false taste, or thrown into erroneous forms; but for the most part, the feebleness of a sculptor is shown in imperfection and rudeness, rather than in definite error. He does not reach the fineness of the forms of Nature; but he approaches them truly up to a certain point, or, if not so, at all events an honest effort will continually improve him: so that if we set a simple natural form before him, and tell him to copy it, we are sure we have given him a wholesome and useful piece of education; but if we told him to paint it, he might, with all the honesty in the world, paint it wrongly and falsely, to the end of his days.|$|E

30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of right ventricle dilation is {{of paramount importance}} in the bedside {{diagnosis of}} pulmonary embolism in emergency situations and unstable patients. However, not always the dilation is clearly visible and many <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> should be considered. The diagnosis of dilation basically relies on a comparison between the end-diastolic diameters of the RV and LV. A wrong and incomplete visualization of the cardiac chambers may lead to misdiagnosis. Moreover, the possibility of a chronic dilation not linked to acute right overload may induce further errors. This possibility may be encountered in case of evaluation of patients with chronic volume overload status (e.g., chronic significant tricuspid or pulmonary regurgitation) and chronic pressure overload conditions (e.g., chronic pulmonary hypertension) [15]. RV infarction is another condition coursing with RV dilation and impairment of RV function and sometimes hardly to differentiate from pulmonary embolism. In patients with cardiac arrest from any cause, ventricular chambers tend to equalize in short time, and thus applying RV dilation criteria may not be accurate for RV strain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract According to David Lewis ’ contextualist {{analysis}} of knowledge, {{there can be}} contexts in which a subject counts as knowing a proposition just because every possibility that this proposition might be false is irrelevant in those contexts. In this paper I argue that, in some cases at least, Lewis ’ analysis results in granting people non-evidentially based knowledge of ordinary contingent truths which, intuitively, cannot be known but {{on the basis of}} appropriate evidence. In his 1996 paper ‘Elusive Knowledge’, David Lewis, one of the leading proponents of epistemological contextualism, offers an intriguing {{analysis of}} knowledge according to which there can be contexts in which a subject counts as knowing a proposition just because in these contexts every possibility that this proposition might be false is properly being ignored. This idea of an ‘ignorance-based knowledge’ is supposed to help us deal with some aspects of the problem of scepticism. In this paper I hold that it can be of no such help for it has an untenable consequence: in some cases it results in granting people non-evidentially based knowledge of ordinary contingent truths about which it is nonetheless intuitively absurd to think that they could be known in the absence of appropriate evidence. 1. Ignorance-based knowledge According to so-called ‘relevant alternatives analyses of knowledge’, knowing requires excluding all relevant <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>error,</b> where relevance is defined by some criterion to be made more precise. According to what I will call ‘relevant alternatives contextualism’, that criterion is a criterion of contextual relevance. In David Lewis’ own version of relevant alternatives contextualism, given a context of knowledge attribution, a relevant alternative is characterized as a possibility of error that is not properly being ignored in that context...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a simple way}} to control, in a sensorless way, a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor for electric vehicle applications. To control this machine it is generally required to count with a position sensor because the inverter phases, acting at any time, must be commuted depending on the rotor position. Encoders and resolvers have been used for sensing rotor position with respect to stator. These sensors, however, make the motor system more complicated and mechanically unreliable. In this paper, a simple solution is presented to determine the commutation sequence of a BLDC motor with a sinusoidal flux distribution. The method is based on a two phase current sensing and the determination of the back emf. For trapezoidal flux distributions the solution may be implemented with some minor changes. The main characteristic of this type of motor, fed with quasi-square-wave currents, is that it only needs a six position sensor, and only one current controller for its full torque control. In contrast, the sinusoidal current type, the angular position needs to be known at any moment in order to control each of the three phase currents. The solution proposed makes use of information contained in the back emf, calculating the six commutation points required. This method is only applicable while currents can be sensed, so it needs to be complemented with a starting method. The system was implemented using a fast digital signal processor (TMS 320 F 241) which is programmed with a closed loop PI current control in order for the motor to produce a constant torque. Additionally, a fiber optic link is used between the controller and the inverter. This minimizes noise production and <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> on commutations. As current transducers LEM sensors were used. The motor tested is a 12 kW (16 HP) Brushless Permanent magnet Motor, with an IGBT inverter with a commutation frequency of 15 kHz. Experimental results of the currents are shown. Copyright 2002 EVS 1...|$|E
