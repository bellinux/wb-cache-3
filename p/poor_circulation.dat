5|$|The Laguna Madre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and unspoiled lagoon ecosystems in Texas. It is also one of the most protected in the United States; 75% of its shores are protected by the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge to the west and the Padre Island National Seashore on the east. Fish, shrimp and crab, which feed the bird populations, depend on the lagoon and its plentiful beds of seagrass for survival. The seagrass of Laguna Madre accounts for 80% of all seagrass found off the Texas Coast; however, it is threatened by brown tides caused by <b>poor</b> <b>circulation</b> and dredging. An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital seagrass with oyster beds.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2006, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Buchwald {{had had a}} leg amputated below the knee and was staying at Washington Home and Hospice. The amputation was reportedly necessary because of <b>poor</b> <b>circulation</b> in the leg.|$|E

25|$|Tinamous have a pneumaticized {{skeleton}} with a sternal keel, 16–18 cervical vertebrae, and fused thoracic vertebrae. They have <b>poor</b> <b>circulation,</b> {{evidenced by}} a greenish tint to the skin. They also have relatively the smallest hearts and lungs of all birds, comprising only 1.6–3.1% {{of their body}} weight, whereas the equivalent in a domestic chicken is 12%. Despite their poor flying ability, the percentage of their body mass that is muscle is 28.6–40%, {{which is similar to}} that of hummingbirds. The preen gland is small and tufted. The male has a corkscrew shaped penis, similar to those of the ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles. The female has a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends {{to speed up the}} process of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects both large and small blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become non-compliant and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals whom do not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and <b>poor</b> <b>circulation</b> of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should know that even mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times {{the risk of heart disease}} compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E

There are also the usual dangers associated with caverns: claustrophobia, <b>poor</b> air <b>circulation,</b> floor/ceiling collapses and getting lost.|$|R
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with <b>poor</b> <b>circulation</b> for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

This is an O-type boiler with a single lower water drum and curved tubes, rather than the triangular arrangement with two drums used by the Admiralty. The first boiler design suffered from <b>poor</b> <b>circulation</b> and so external cold downcomers were added, making the reworked boiler 10% heavier. The boiler was well-regarded in service as it reduced the amount of potentially troublesome refractory firebrick usually used for {{the base of the}} furnace.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to <b>poor</b> <b>circulation,</b> neuropathy, and difficulty moving, {{factors that contribute}} to chronic wounds include systemic illnesses, age, and repeated trauma.

[...] Immune suppression can be caused by illnesses or medical drugs used over a long period, for example steroids. [...] Emotional stress can also negatively affect the healing of a wound, possibly by raising blood pressure and levels of cortisol, which lowers immunity.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} a number of terms that {{describe}} the type of amputation. An acquired amputation {{is one in which}} a limb is removed as a result of disease or trauma.

50|$|Rising {{levels of}} {{androgen}} during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over {{many areas of}} the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with pubic hair being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a sexual differentiation in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes facial hair, chest hair, abdominal hair, leg hair, arm hair, and foot hair. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women. It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a noticeable reduction in body hair especially in the legs. The reason for this is not known but it could be due to <b>poorer</b> <b>circulation,</b> lower free circulating hormone amounts or other reasons.|$|R
