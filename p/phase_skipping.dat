For some intervals, the sonic digital tool produced extremely noisy velocity logs that made {{interpretation of the}} data very difficult, even impossible. Three types of noise were observed: <b>phase</b> <b>skipping,</b> oscillations caused by noncompensated heave, and discrete aberrant velocity values. The heave-related oscillations recorded on the velocity logs were eliminated by deriving a simple model simulating the tool movement. The aberrant velocity values, essentially caused by failures in recording the signal {{from one of the}} two transmitters, were eliminated by inspection of the individual waveforms using an interactive software package. This software program was also used to pick the compressional arrival time. A composite velocity log accounting for all these corrections and complemented for the unlogged part of the hole with the core-measured velocities was used to derive a synthetic seismogram at Site 747. The synthetic seismogram was correlated with a multichannel seismic reflection profile and the lithologic units, which allowed us to define four seismic sequences that could be identified with the K 2 -K 3, P 1 -P 2, PN 1, and NQ 1 sequences of the Raggatt Basin in the Southern Kerguelen Plateau...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{signals and}} queues at intersections are major {{components}} {{of public transportation}} (transit) delay. Active transit signal priority (TSP) strategies are used as an effective way of reducing that delay. They can be divided in green split adjustment and phase resequencing measures. However, the effectiveness of TSP strategies {{is dependent on the}} traffic conditions, the frequency of priority requests, and their specific impact on the signal control. Some strategies can add significant delay to non-priority flows. From the transit operator’s point of view, this becomes problematic when an intersection contains several conflicting transit lines in mixed traffic conditions. Serving priority for one phase can lead to substantial additional delay for a transit line served by another phase. In networks, TSP strategies could cause spillbacks to other intersections serving transit lines. From the road operator’s point of view, spillbacks of non-priority flows are mostly not desired. The key feature of a proper multimodal optimization of the signal settings is to take conflicting objectives into account in a balanced manner. In this research, models and insights are delivered for optimizing signal settings (i. e. offsets, green splits and cycle lengths) when TSP strategies are applied. The focus is on active TSP strategies such as phase extension (i. e. green extension), phase advance (i. e. red truncation), and phase resequencing strategies like rotation of the transit phase for early service, insertion of an extra transit phase, and skipping of non-priority phases. The thesis can be divided in three research parts: 1) Development and validation of a new stochastic traffic and optimization model CAPACITEL for optimizing green splits, cycle lengths of isolated intersections (chapter 3) and extra optimization dimension of offsets of corridors with TSP (chapter 4). 2) Development and validation of analytical formulas for optimal signal settings of isolated intersections with transit signal priority using CAPACITEL (chapter 6 and chapter 5); 3) Comparison of the effectiveness of various active TSP strategies for isolated intersections (chapter 7 and chapter 8) and in combination with coordination recovery strategies for arterials (chapter 9). In the first part, new signal setting formulas are proposed for optimizing the green splits and cycle lengths. The scope of these equations is isolated intersections when TSP strategies are applied, applicable for undersaturated, near-saturated and oversaturated traffic demands. Webster’s optimal green split and cycle length formulas are still considered relevant in many signal timing manuals. However, TSP strategies can influence the optimal green splits and cycle lengths of isolated intersections. These effects are now researched for adapting the Webster formulas accordingly. For updating the Webster formulas for a multimodal environment, signal settings are optimized for various combinations of the following parameters: intersection flow ratio, transit and non-transit phase flow ratio, transit frequency, detector location, lost time, and the type of TSP strategy. The coefficients of the new formulas are then calibrated with those results by a linear regression analysis. Two categories of formulas of minimal delay are identified: 1) TSP strategies with limited capacity shift like phase rotation in combination with green extension, but without red truncation (chapter 5); 2) TSP strategies with red truncation (chapter 6); TSP strategies with red truncation significantly change green splits. A new optimal green split formula is developed that is applicable for 2, 3 and 4 -phase intersections. The critical lane method – as proposed by Webster – is used for calculating the green splits for TSP strategies without red truncation. The main reason is that a TSP request impacts the green split significantly when red truncation is applied. When milder TSP strategies are used, the green split is hardly influenced when considering a full hour of simulation. For both categories of TSP, a new optimal cycle length formula is suggested. The regression formula for the TSP strategies with red truncation has 29 parameters and correlations of those parameters. The number of parameters and their correlations in the formula is limited to 3 for the strategies without red truncation. The latter formula is thus more suitable for practitioners and easier to use. Both categories of formulas have a significantly better performance in minimizing delay compared to existing alternatives and are best applicable for near-saturated and oversaturated traffic demands. In {{the second part of the}} research, various TSP strategies are compared on their effectiveness in reducing person or vehicle delay. A dynamic TSP control with an early call detection and a confirmation detection is developed and compared with full priority in chapter 7. For comparing their effectiveness, a sensitivity analysis is performed for different intersection flow ratios, weights for the performance function, location of the detector and impact of a transit stop. Dynamic TSP is preferred in undersaturated conditions because of its flexibility of redistributing green lengths without going to oversaturation. When the intersection gets saturated, the favour shifts to full priority with a short distance detector (150 m). Transit stops shift the favour towards a TSP strategy with a detector beyond the stop. Twelve TSP strategies are compared for their effectiveness in chapter 8. The impact of these TSP strategies is investigated for undersaturated, near-saturated and oversaturated conditions for a wide range of transit and traffic demand scenarios. In order to guarantee a fair comparison, the basic signal settings are optimized and tailored to each TSP strategy and demand so that the total person delay at the intersection is properly minimized. This is in contrast with chapter 7 where TSP strategies were applied after the optimization of the signal settings. <b>Phase</b> <b>skipping</b> and strategies that apply red truncation are not effective in reducing person delay. They are mostly effective in reducing bus delay but they come at a cost of adding person delay to other users. Green extension, phase insertion, phase insertion with green extension and phase rotation with green extension appear to be the most effective TSP strategies in minimizing intersection person delay. For undersaturated conditions the choice of the TSP strategy has a limited effect on the objective function and travel time reliability. Once an intersection reaches near-saturated or undersaturated conditions, strategies with red truncation or <b>phase</b> <b>skipping</b> shouldn’t be used. In the last part, the performance of a new stochastic mesomodel for corridors, CAPACITEL, is validated. CAPACITEL incorporates microscopic arrivals and departures, but models spillbacks and queues macroscopically. By using less detail for the queuing, it is able to perform simulations a lot faster than VISSIM. That makes the model more suitable for optimization purposes. On the other hand, CAPACITEL is detailed enough to simulate buses and grasp the stochastic impact of TSP strategies on the signal settings and the corresponding flows. Besides the aforementioned TSP strategies, a fixed cycle length and a green compensation strategy is available for coordination recovery after a transit vehicle is served. In this way local – i. e. serving TSP – and global – i. e. arterial progression – multimodal objectives can be combined. The optimization of the signal settings in CAPACITEL is split in three subproblems. Green splits, cycle lengths and offsets are optimized in series with the new multimodal formulas of chapter 5 as a starting point. When optimizing the network, the optimization of each subproblem starts at the heaviest loaded intersection. Neighbouring intersections are optimized one by one starting from the heaviest loaded intersection till the end of the arterial. CAPACITEL demonstrates its superiority for optimizing the signal settings of multimodal arterials by outperforming TRANSYT 15 for a test case in Zeebrugge, Belgium. In conclusion, a decision tree is developed where all the insights from this research are incorporated. This decision tree proposes a methodology for designing optimal multimodal signal settings. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Cross Cutting TechnologiesSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopFuture Mars missions requiring increased landing accuracy, higher landed mass, and higher elevation landing are driving the development of entry, descent and landing (EDL) technology. Understanding the envelope of trajectories of which a lander is capable of flying is important for mission analysis and design. In this paper trajectory optimization is used to characterize the envelope of entry trajectories and in particular to evaluate the impact of the vehicle aerodynamic performance (low or mid lift-over-drag ratio (LoD)) and the parachute deployment velocity (Mach 2 or Mach 5) on the envelope. Two characteristic are the focus of our attention: (1) the landing footprint (LFP), or more generally, the reachable set of parachute deployment states from a given entry state, and (2) the set of controllable entry states (CES), set of entry states from which there exists a feasible trajectory to a given parachute deployment state. We are especially interested in using this information in entry guidance development. The first part of the paper addresses the computation and interpretation of the LFP. A trajectory optimization program is used to compute trajectories from the entry state to the different deployment points that form the LFP. Trajectories are optimized to have maximum deployment altitude and are constrained to have high control authority to compensate for the dispersions due to modeling errors for the atmosphere and the vehicle aerodynamic performance. For a given nominal EDL mission, the study of the LFP qualitatively indicates the difficulty of the nominal mission. The second part of the paper addresses the computation and interpretation of the CES. The CES directly shows the allowed dispersions on the entry state. As with the LFP, the trajectories used to find the boundaries of the CES are constrained to have high control authority. It is shown how the CES can be used to provide the target for the <b>skip</b> <b>phase</b> guidance algorithm in a skip-entry guidance system. The target (for the end of the <b>skip</b> <b>phase</b> and beginning of the entry phase) is chosen from the CES so that the margins for errors both in the <b>skip</b> <b>phase</b> and the entry phase are large, ensuring high parachute deployment accuracy in the presence of large uncertainties. In both parts, a Viking- type capsule (low LoD) and an ellipsled-type vehicle (mid LoD) are considered, with deployment speeds of Mach 2 and Mach 5. Entry capability is studied from a guidance point of view, evaluating the performance of the guidance algorithms provided the LFP and CES. Lateral as well as longitudinal motion is considered.

The analysis centered itself around the proposed design of NASA's Crew Exploration Vehicle. The primary aerodynamic guidance system must execute an atmospheric skip maneuver when attempting to reach distant landing sites. These maneuvers result in the loss of aerodynamic control authority during the <b>skip</b> <b>phase.</b> The physics of the problem were studied through an analysis of the minimum impulsive AV. This analysis was completed for a number of different trajectories with varying energies. The framework of the propulsive guidance algorithm, derived from the Powered Explicit Guidance law of the Space Shuttle, was presented and the augmented design was explained. The sensitivity of the propulsive guidance solution to a given trajectory was explored as well as its response to altitude constrained maneuverability. The robustness of the algorithm is measured using Monte Carlo techniques. The results showed that the current design of the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the current implementation of the primary aerodynamic guidance system are inadequate for a precise, long range, crewed return from the Moon. It was also shown that the lower energy trajectories are more favorable given the altitude reorientation constraint. It was recommended that the <b>skip</b> <b>phase</b> be redefined such that it does not begin until the altitude reorientation constraint is met.

Stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) {{is the most effective}} manner in inducing swallowing.

At present, however, the neuronal mechanisms of the swallowing CPG, thought to be located in the medulla oblongata, are not well clarified. Two groups of swallowing-related neurons which have been identified in the areas of the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) and the nucleus ambiguus (NA) (Jean, 1972; Kessler & Jean, 1985; Umezaki et al. 1998), are called the dorsal and ventral swallowing groups (DSG and VSG), respectively (Jean, 2001). The neurons in the DSG discharge during pharyngeal or oesophageal phases, and are assumed to provide the temporal sequence for pharyngo-oesophageal co-ordination.

Based on these observations, Jean (2001) has presented an intriguing model of the swallowing CPG in which the pattern generation is completed within the DSG, and the VSG neurons are passively driven by the DSG activity.

This research aimed to investigate the decrease of the seed number depending on sowing time lettuce seed crop. Ten lettuce varieties (Nansen, Majska kraljica, Safir, Univerzal, Ravel, Atraction, Superble, Type- 5140, Ljubljanska ledenka and Brauner) for total flower number and the number of flowers per flower head in two sawing periods were compared. Two-factorial trial in random block system with four replications was performed. The correlation of the two researched traits was medium (r = 0, 706) without significance. Regression coefficient showed the correlation of these traits. Variance analysis showed that variance of genotype was not significant: the other factor, sowing time and interaction (genotype x sowing time) were not significant. The coefficient of phenotype variance was higher than the genetic variance coefficient for both traits...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} predictor-corrector (NPC) {{method for}} trajectory planning and closed-loop guidance of low lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio vehicles during the <b>skip</b> entry <b>phase</b> of a lunar-return mission is presented. The strategy calls for controlling the trajectory by modulation {{of the magnitude}} of the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s bank angle. The magnitude of the bank angle used in the <b>skip</b> <b>phase</b> is determined by satisfying the downrange requirement to the landing site. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear univariate root-finding problem. Full three degree of freedom (3 DOF) nonlinear trajectory dynamics are included to achieve high accuracy of the landing prediction. In addition, the proposed approach automatically yields a direct entry trajectory when the downrange is such that a skip entry is no longer necessary. The same algorithm repeatedly applied on-board in every guidance cycle realizes closed-loop guidance in the <b>skip</b> entry <b>phase.</b> A number of issues are identified and addressed that are critical in closed-loop implementations. Extensive 3 DOF dispersion simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, and the results demonstrate very reliable and robust performance of the algorithm in highly stressful dispersed conditions. Comparison is made between the proposed algorithm and an earlier skip algorithm developed for the Apollo space program. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is superior to the Apollo algorithm especially when used for entries with long downranges...|$|R
40|$|Full-waveform {{inversion}} (FWI) {{suffers from}} the <b>phase</b> wrapping (cycle <b>skipping)</b> problem when the frequency of data is not low enough. Unless we obtain a good initial velocity model, the phase wrapping problem in FWI causes a result corresponding to a local minimum, usually {{far away from the}} true solution, especially at depth. Thus, we have developed an inversion algorithm based on a space-domain unwrapped phase, and we also used exponential damping to mitigate the nonlinearity associated with the reflections. We construct the 2 D phase residual map, which usually contains the wrapping discontinuities, especially if the model is complex and the frequency is high. We then unwrap the phase map and remove these cycle-based jumps. However, if the phase map has several residues, the unwrapping process becomes very complicated. We apply a strong exponential damping to the wavefield to eliminate much of the residues in the phase map, thus making the unwrapping process simple. We finally invert the unwrapped phases using the back-propagation algorithm to calculate the gradient. We progressively reduce the damping factor to obtain a high-resolution image. Numerical examples determined that the unwrapped phase inversion with a strong exponential damping generated convergent long-wavelength updates without low-frequency information. This model {{can be used as a}} good starting model for a subsequent inversion with a reduced damping, eventually leading to conventional waveform inversion...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare changes in heart rate, oxygen uptake, blood {{pressure}} and oral temperature between subjects eating breakfast and subjects skipping breakfast when they exercise each day at 11 : 00 AM and 2 : 00 PM. The study design included two different groups, a breakfast group and a skipping group. Subjects rested for five minutes, and they exercised on a pendulum ergometer for twenty minutes. After exercising, the resistance was returned to zero for a one minute cool down followed by five more minutes of complete rest(recovery phase). Oral temperatures of the skipping group were lower than those of the breakfast group at 11 : 00 AM. Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT), which increases core body temperature, is generated by eating breakfast. In the skipping group, the resting heart rates at 11 : 00 AM were lower than at 2 : 00 PM. A significant difference in heart rate after the first minute of exercise was seen between 11 : 00 AM and 2 : 00 PM in the skipping group. These results suggested that when skipping breakfast, the heart rate response immediately after beginning exercise is slow in the morning. Although all subjects did cooling down for one minute after exercising, oxygen uptake during the recovery <b>phase</b> in the <b>skipping</b> group at 11 : 00 AM was significantly higher than at rest. These results suggest that eating breakfast has a physiological influence on both heart rate and oxygen uptake...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a system for analyzing circuits with respect to their path-delay fault testability. The system includes a path-delay fault simulator and an ATPG for path-delay faults combined into a test tool. This test tool can run standalone on a single machine, or as one of several clients that communicate through a central server. The test tool is used in this thesis in order to evaluate the performance of 14 different test vector generators {{that can be used in}} various built-in self-test arrangements. The test generators exploit pseudo-random stimuli generation. We have used six different strategies for weighting of input signals, and performed comprehensive experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the strategies. Each of the experiments typically consists of three phases: • In the first phase, the ATPG is used in order to find the K-longest nonrobust testable path-delay faults. The corresponding path numbers are then saved together with the corresponding test vector for later use. The paths constitute the target fault list during simulation. Experiments that consider all possible faults <b>skip</b> this <b>phase.</b> • In the second phase, weights are generated for the weighted pseudorandom generators. These weights are stored for later use. This <b>phase</b> is <b>skipped</b> for experiments where the generator is unweighted. • In the third phase the actual simulation takes place. In all experiments 10 M single-input-change test patterns were applied and repeated ten times for each generator and circuit in order to cover some statistical variations. Only non-robust faults (including robust faults) were considered. Two groups of pseudo-random generators have been evaluated. The first group, GA, consists of accumulator based pseudo-random generators. The second group, GT, consists of Mersenne twister based pseudo-random generators. The result has shown that the GT group of pseudo-random patterns give marginally better results than the GA group. Since GA generators are much less computationally intensive, GA generators are reccommended over GT generators in practical applications. Experiments have also been conducted in order to evaluate the benefit of weighted stimuli compared to unweighted stimuli. The results show that test time can be reduced with up to 15 times for the circuits in the ISCAS’ 85 benchmark suite. Based upon comprehensive experiments with various weighting schemes on ISCAS benchmarks, one can conclude that the following three-phase approach works well: First, generate test patterns to detect the K(20000) longest paths. Subsequently, compute weights for each input based upon the gennerated patterns. Finally, employ an accumulator based BIST scheme with the weights on non-robust path-delay faults. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|A mid‐infrared mission {{would enable}} the {{detection}} of biosignatures of Earth‐like exoplanets around more than 150 nearby stars. The mid‐infrared spectral region is attractive for characterizing exoplanets because contrast with the parent star brightness is more favorable than in the visible (10 million vs. 10 billion), and because mid‐infrared light probes deep into a planet’s troposphere. Furthermore, the mid‐infrared offers access to several strong molecular features that are key signs of life, and also provides {{a measure of the}} effective temperature and size of a planet. Taken together, an infrared mission plus a visible one would provide a nearly full picture of a planet, including signs of life; with a measure of mass from an astrometric mission, we would have a virtually complete picture. A small infrared mission would have several telescopes that are rigidly connected, with a science return from the detection and characterization of super‐Earth sized to larger planets near the HZ, plus a direct measure of the exozodi brightness in the HZ. In a large infrared mission, with formation‐flying telescopes, planets from an Earth‐twin and upwards in mass could be detected and characterized, as well as the exozodi. If proceeded by an astrometric mission, the detection <b>phase</b> could be <b>skipped</b> and the mission devoted to characterization, as in the visible case; lacking an astrometric mission, an infrared one could proceed alone, as was discussed for a visible coronograph, and with similar caveats. The technology needed for a large formation‐flying mission is similar to that for a small connected‐element one (e. g., cryogenics and detectors), with the addition of formationflying technology. The technology is now in hand to implement a probe‐scale mission; starlight suppression has even been demonstrated to meet the requirements of a flagship mission. However, additional development of formation‐flying technology is needed, particularly in‐space testing of sensors and guidance, navigation, and control algorithms...|$|R
