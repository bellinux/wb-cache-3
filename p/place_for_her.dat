5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
5|$|Palmetto Leaves is {{a memoir}} and travel guide written by Harriet Beecher Stowe about her winters {{in the town}} of Mandarin, Florida, {{published}} in 1873. Already famous for having written Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.|$|E

Bhutan, along with Chad, was one of only two nations with only female athletes at the 2012 games.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, Madonna {{suggested}} {{that she was in}} a revolutionary mood, which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of Swept Away, Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter, with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara. French design team M/M Paris (Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) were responsible for the artwork of American Life. The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes. The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes, combat boots, and guns.|$|E

Moreover, Surratt still owed money on both the tavern and the townhouse and would take out yet another mortgage against the townhouse in January 1865.|$|E
25|$|Once in New York, Tallchief {{looked up}} Serge Denham. A {{secretary}} {{told her that}} the company did not need any more dancers and she left crying. A few days later, she was told there was a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> after all. Denham did not actually remember her, but she had something he needed– a passport. Many of his dancers were Russian émigrés who lacked passports and the troupe had a Canadian tour coming up. Based on a combination of her talent and her passport, Tallchief was taken on as an apprentice. Her first performance was in Gaîté Parisienne. After the Canadian tour, one of the dancers left the troupe due to pregnancy and Tallchief was offered the woman's place and a $40 per week salary.|$|E
25|$|Essinger {{realized}} that Germany {{was no longer}} a hospitable <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> school and sought to relocate it in a more secure environment abroad.

The house is called Bunce Court, after the family that owned the property in the 17th century. Essinger raised funds in England, primarily from Quakers, initially to rent and later, to purchase Bunce Court.

The children all went home for summer vacation, not knowing they were leaving Landschulheim Herrlingen for the last time.|$|E

500|$|Lisa {{tries to}} {{convince}} Homer and Marge that college suits her, but {{they refuse to}} listen, saying that college is no <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Lisa is also ridiculed by Groundskeeper Willie and all of her friends at school, saying that she is too [...] "college for them". In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings {{him a lot of}} popularity. Bart tells Lisa what she should do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his dress polyester, Bart rolls Lisa (inside his bubble) {{to the edge of the}} school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent, but gets sucked in.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} burial place was symbolic. Victoria Thompson argues that if Æthelflæd had chosen Edward's royal {{mausoleum}} in Winchester as the burial <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband and herself, {{that would have}} emphasised Mercia's subordinate status, whereas a traditional Mercian royal burial place such as Repton {{would have been a}} provocative declaration of independence; Gloucester, near the border with Wessex, was a compromise between the two. Martin Ryan sees the foundation as [...] "something like a royal mausoleum, intended to replace the one at Repton (Derbyshire) that had been destroyed by the Vikings". Æthelflæd died a few months too early to see the final conquest of the southern Danelaw by Edward. She was succeeded as Lady of the Mercians by her daughter, Ælfwynn, but in early December 918 Edward deposed her and took Mercia under his control. Many Mercians disliked the subordination of their ancient kingdom to Wessex, and Wainwright describes the Mercian annalist's description of the deposition of Ælfwynn as [...] "heavy with resentment". Edward died in 924 at Farndon in Cheshire a few days after putting down a rebellion by Mercians and Welshmen at Chester.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth season}} explores {{the concept of}} Life Model Decoys (LMDs), which were first {{referenced}} in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously {{did not want to}} explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
