40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we propose}} a {{set-theoretic}} approach to collaborative <b>position</b> <b>location</b> for wireless networks. The proposed method borrows the concept from the parallel projection method (PPM), originally developed for signal recovery with inconsistent convex feasibility sets, modifies and extends the technique to an iterative and distributed numerical algorithm to estimate node locations, based on incomplete and noisy internode distance estimates. We demonstrate {{that in the}} case of noncollaborative <b>position</b> <b>location,</b> the proposed method is analytically equivalent to the parallel implementation of Kaczmarz Algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local minimizer and thus a stationary point. For collaborative <b>position</b> <b>location,</b> the proposed iterative PPM is computationally much more efficient than existing methods such as SDP and MDS-MAP, while achieving comparable or better localization accuracy and robustness to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias. Finally, our proposed method can be implemented in a parallel and distributed fashion, and is scalable for large network deployment.

The RFID technologies are getting considerable attentions not only academic research {{but also the}} applications of enterprise. One of most important issues of applications is the indoor <b>position</b> <b>location.</b> Many researchers have used varied technologies to perform the tracking of indoor <b>position</b> <b>location.</b> In this paper, we will purpose a new method using RFID tags to perform indoor <b>position</b> <b>location</b> tracking, too. This method uses Received Signal Strength (RSS) to collect signal strength from reference tags beforehand. Next, signal strength is used to set up Power Level areas of ranges by reference tags. And then, using signal strength from reference tags to match signal strength by track tags. Finally, when track tags is set up into indoor environments, it will find out the position of neighboring reference tags, and using arithmetic mean to calculate the location values. A preliminary experiment proves that our method provides a better precision than LANDMRC system.
