50|$|<b>Propiomazine</b> (Largon, Propavan, Indorm, Serentin, Dorevane, Dorevan) is an {{antihistamine}} blocking H1 receptors. It is used {{to treat}} insomnia, and to produce sleepiness or drowsiness and to relieve anxiety before or during surgery or other procedures and in combination with analgetics also during labor. <b>Propiomazine</b> is a phenothiazine, but is not used as a neuroleptic {{because it does not}} block dopamine receptors well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propiomazine</b> is an {{antagonist}} at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Propiomazine's antipsychotic {{effect is}} due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. <b>Propiomazine</b> {{does not appear to}} block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone.|$|E
40|$|Ventricular {{tachycardia}} {{was produced}} in the dog by intravenous injection of 2 - 3 (j. g/kg of adrenaline during nitrous oxide-halothane anaesthesia. On a weight basis, propio-mazine {{was found to be}} as effective as perphenazine in preventing the arrhythmias. Promethazine and promazine showed similar effects in much higher doses. The protec-tion provided by all these drugs could be surmounted by doses of adrenaline of 4 - 6 [Ag/kg. <b>Propiomazine</b> did not produce any action on blood pressure whereas the other drugs tested produced a prolonged fall in pressure in all the experiments. Since the clinical dose of <b>propiomazine</b> is 2 - 4 times that of perphenazine, {{it is possible that the}} former may prove superior to the latter in clinical trials. The occurrence of adrenaline-induced ventricular arrhythmias under halothane anaesthesia in the dog and in man is well documented (Raventos...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study conducted}} on data containing drug concentrations. The data was obtained from femoral venous blood samples collected at medico legal autopsies in Sweden. Cases positive for antidepressant drugs were scrutinized and divided in to two groups for 15 antidepressant drugs: B‑cases, where {{the cause of death}} was intoxication with more than one drug detected in the blood sample. C‑cases, where {{the cause of death was}} NOT intoxication and at least one drug (the antidepressant) was detected in the blood sample. This data was then processed to find frequencies of concomitant drugs taken together with the antidepressant drugs. Frequencies of the most common concomitant drugs were then compared between B-cases and C-cases for each antidepressant drug. This revealed that the drugs dextropropoxyphene, ethanol, codeine, flunitrazepam, paracetamol, <b>propiomazine</b> and alimemazine were signifcantly more common as concomitant drugs in B-cases (intoxications) than in C‑cases (non‑intoxications). With regards to unknown interactions the most interesting combinations were: <b>Propiomazine</b> with mirtazapine, venlafaxine, citalopram or fluoxetine; Paracetamol with paroxetine; Flunitrazepam with mirtazapine, venlafaxine or citalopram; Codeine with mirtazapine or sertraline. These combinations should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{delivery}} is a feasible alternative to oral or parenteral administration for some drugs {{because of the}} high permeability of the nasal epithelium, rapid drug absorption across this membrane and avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate factors influencing the permeability of the nasal mucosa to various compounds and to evaluate implications for drug absorption via the nasal route. Porcine nasal mucosa mounted in an Ussing chamber system was established as an in vitro model, and glucose, insulin, lidocaine, mannitol, melagatran, nicotine, PEG 4000, propranolol, sumatriptan, verapamil, vinblastine and an aminodiether were used as model compounds. The pharmacokinetics of melagatran and <b>propiomazine</b> were investigated in absorption studies in rats, and the influence of the enhancers SDS and EDTA on melagatran absorption was evaluated and compared with in vitro permeability data. The expression of P-glycoprotein in porcine nasal mucosa was investigated and compared with that in human nasal epithelial biopsies using the Western Blot technique. The results demonstrated that the Ussing chamber model using porcine nasal mucosa has potential as a tool for evaluating mechanisms of nasal absorption and predicting the in vivo effects of absorption enhancers. Moreover, porcine nasal mucosa is comparable to human nasal mucosa in its morphology and P-glycoprotein expression. The in vitro permeability data were found to weakly correlate with literature data on human absorption after nasal administration of the corresponding compounds. In vivo absorption studies of the sedative <b>propiomazine</b> demonstrated that nasal administration of this drug offers an interesting alternative to the oral formulation currently on the market, since the absorption was rapid and the bioavailability was promising. The bioavailability of melagatran in rats was moderate but variable, and responded to the addition of enhancers. Finally, the establishment and characterisation of an in vitro method for prediction of nasal drug absorption, and the investigation of factors influencing nasal membrane permeability and absorption offer substantial contributions for nasal drug delivery...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of {{pethidine}} 100 mg, atropine 0 - 6 mg and six phenothiazine derivatives {{were studied}} as premedication before minor operations carried out under methohexitone-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. None {{proved to be}} ideal, but each had some advantage. Promazine and triflupromazine increased the hypnotic action of the analgesic and the incidence of hypotension. Perphenazine and thiethylperazine both markedly reduced the emetic effects attributable to pethidine but were not very good sedatives. <b>Propiomazine</b> in 20 -mg doses was a mild non-toxic hypnotic with a moderate anti-emetic action. A high incidence of restlessness marred the beneficial effects of promethazine 50 mg, but 25 and 10 mg were both very satisfactory adjuvants to pethidine. In the previous paper in this series Dundee et al. (1965) compared the effects of fourteen pheno-thiazine derivatives and two phenothiazine-like drugs when used as premedication for minor operations. None of these compounds could be recommended as the main pre-anaesthetic hypno...|$|E
40|$|Background. Polypharmacy {{is known}} to {{increase}} the risk for drug-related problems, and some drugs, potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), are especially troublesome. Objective. To analyse the effects on prescription of PIMs of the SäKLäK project, an intervention model created to improve medication safety for elderly patients in primary care. Method. The SäkläK project was a multiprofessional intervention in primary care consisting of self-assessment, peer review, feedback and written agreements for change. Five Swedish primary care centres participated in the intervention and five served as comparison group. Data were collected from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register on PIMs (long-acting benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, tramadol, <b>propiomazine,</b> antipsychotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) prescribed to patients aged 65 years and older. Total number of patients and change in patients using PIMs before and after intervention with-in groups was analysed as well as differences between intervention and comparison group. Results. A total of 32 566 prescriptions of PIMs were dispensed before the intervention, 19 796 in the intervention group and 12 770 in the comparison group. After intervention a decrease was seen in both groups, intervention- 22. 2 % and comparison- 8. 8 %. All groups of PIMs decreased, except for antipsychotics in the comparison group. For the intervention group, {{a significant decrease in}} mean dose/patient was seen after the intervention but not in the comparison group. Conclusion. Our study shows this method has some effects on prescription of PIMs. The evaluation indicates this is a feasible method for improvement of medication use in primary care and the method should be tested on a larger scale...|$|E
