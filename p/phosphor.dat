5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a <b>phosphor</b> that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the <b>phosphor,</b> as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E

That is, the blue electron gun will strike blue <b>phosphors,</b> but will find a wire blocks the path to red and green <b>phosphors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Herein, {{we report}} a {{strategy}} to synthesize a highly efficient yellow light emitting Y 3 -xAl 5 O 12 :Ce-x (x = 0. 03 to 0. 3) based bulk as well as nano (rod-shaped) <b>phosphors,</b> which are {{the main component of}} solid state white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). The as-synthesized <b>phosphors</b> were well characterized by several experimental techniques related to material characterization and spectroscopy. The bulk and nano <b>phosphors</b> emit with maximum photoluminescence intensities at 549 and 530 nm, respectively, upon excitation at a wavelength of 468 nm. These <b>phosphors</b> exhibit higher photoluminescence intensity as compared to commercially available bulk <b>phosphors</b> coated on WLED strips. Moreover, the integration of commercially available InGaN blue LED strips with the synthesized bulk and nano <b>phosphors</b> demonstrates better CIE coordinates and lower colour temperature with high brightness (> 81 % quantum yield) compared to commercially available WLED-based strips, lanterns and torches. These highly efficient light-emitting <b>phosphors</b> are a feasible candidate for potential use in commercial WLED application...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a broadband luminescent downshifting (LDS) layer with multiple species of europium (Eu) -doped silicate <b>phosphors</b> using spin-on film technique to enhance the photovoltaic efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. The surface morphology of the deposited layer was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The chemical composition of the Eu-doped silicate <b>phosphors</b> was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The fluorescence emission of the Eu-doped silicate <b>phosphors</b> was characterized using photoluminescence (PL) measurements at room temperature. We also compared the optical reflectance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) response of cells with combinations of various Eu-doped <b>phosphors</b> species. The cell coated with two species of Eu-doped <b>phosphors</b> achieved a conversion efficiency enhancement (∆η) of 19. 39 %, far exceeding the ∆η = 15. 08 % of the cell with one species of Eu-doped <b>phosphors</b> and the ∆η = 8. 51 % of the reference cell with the same silicate layer without Eu-doped <b>phosphors...</b>|$|R
5|$|Lutetium {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography.

Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a <b>phosphor</b> in LED light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a <b>phosphor</b> that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, several {{persistent}} <b>phosphors</b> were intensively studied, such as CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu, Nd (blue) and SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu, Dy (green).

All these <b>phosphors</b> are normally evaluated by measuring their afterglow {{as a function of}} time in photometric units. However, the eye sensitivity curve shifts from photopic vision to scotopic vision upon decreasing light intensity, with a corresponding decrease in red-sensitivity. Performance of red-emitting persistent <b>phosphors</b> thus cannot be described with usual photometry. An alternative description is presented, based on recent vision research in the intermediate (mesopic) region and using a unified system of photometry.

50|$|The <b>phosphors</b> used in {{the bulbs}} were {{somewhat}} brittle, necessitating care in handling. Shaking or jarring the bulbs would cause flaking and migration of the <b>phosphors</b> {{to other parts of}} the metallic sculpture. Such handling would leave non-fluorescing portions of the sculpture and/or migration of <b>phosphors</b> to other surfaces within the bulb.|$|R
25|$|Various {{phosphors}} {{are available}} {{depending upon the}} needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of <b>phosphor</b> used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond to several seconds. For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence <b>phosphor</b> may be desirable. For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence <b>phosphor</b> is generally preferable.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electrons}} {{move in a}} straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves collimation, and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until they hit a <b>phosphor</b> screen {{at the other end of}} the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the <b>phosphor</b> screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the microchannel plate stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The <b>phosphor</b> is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce <b>phosphor</b> screens produced green light (hence the soldiers' nickname 'green TV' for image intensification devices).|$|E
