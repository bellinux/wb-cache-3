50|$|In {{the very}} early days of {{electricity}} generation, the generators at power stations had been single-phase AC or direct current. The direction of the power industry were changing in 1895 when more efficient polyphase generators were successfully implemented at Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant {{which was the first}} large-scale polyphase power station. Newer power stations started to adopt the <b>polyphase</b> <b>system.</b> <b>In</b> the 1900s, many railways started the electrification of their lines. During that time, the single-phase AC system had been widely used for their traction power networks beside the direct current system. The early generators for those single-phase traction networks are single-phase generators. Even with newer three-phase motors which were introduced to some modern trains, the single-phases transmission for traction networks survive their time and are still in use in many railways today. However, many traction power stations have replaced their generators over time to use three-phase generators and convert into single-phase for transmission.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the mean-field approximations in various interacting models of statistical physics and measures of classical and quantum correlations is explored. We present a method {{that allows us to}} bound the total amount of correlations (and hence entanglement) <b>in</b> a physical <b>system</b> <b>in</b> thermal <b>equilibrium</b> at some temperature in terms of its free energy and internal energy. This method is first illustrated using two qubits interacting through the Heisenberg coupling, where entanglement and correlations can be computed exactly. It is then applied to the one dimensional Ising model in a transverse magnetic field, for which entanglement and correlations cannot be obtained by exact methods. We analyze the behavior of correlations in various regimes and identify critical regions, comparing them with already known results. Finally, we present a general discussion of the effects of entanglement on the macroscopic, thermodynamical features of solid-state <b>systems.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we exploit the fact that a $d$ dimensional quantum <b>system</b> <b>in</b> thermal <b>equilibrium</b> can be made to corresponds to a d+ 1 classical <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>equilibrium</b> to substitute all entanglement for classical correlations.
