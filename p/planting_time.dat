In September, they {{returned}} to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival; they then cached {{a portion of their}} food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt, from which they did not return until <b>planting</b> <b>time</b> in the spring.

5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or <b>planting</b> <b>time</b> dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E

25|$|Railroads allowed harvests {{to reach}} markets {{more quickly and}} Gustavus Franklin Swift's {{refrigerated}} railroad car allowed fresh meat and fish to reach distant markets. Food distribution also became more mechanized as companies like Heinz and Campbell distributed previously perishable foods by canning and evaporation. Commercial bakeries, breweries, and meatpackers replaced locally owned operators and drove demand for raw agricultural goods. Despite increasing demand, rising production caused a drop in prices, creating substantial discontent among farmers. Organizations like The Grange and Farmers Alliance emerged to demand monetary policy that allowed for money supply expansion (as most farmers carried significant debt from <b>planting</b> <b>time</b> to harvest time), railroad regulations, and protective tariffs.|$|E
2500|$|Hundreds {{of years}} ago, here in Central Luzon, landlords in the haciendas made the farmers build the [...] "damara", just before <b>planting</b> <b>time</b> of palay.

2500|$|There is an {{alternative}} explanation without this difficulty that {{is at least as}} old as Adam Clarke's 1837 commentary. The Assyrian siege had lasted until after <b>planting</b> <b>time</b> in the fall of 701 BCE, and although the Assyrians left immediately after the prophecy was given (2 Kings 19:35), they had consumed the harvest of that year before they left, leaving only the saphiah to be gleaned from the fields. In the next year, the people were to eat [...] "what springs from that", Hebrew sahish (סחיש). Since this word occurs only here and in the parallel passage in Isaiah 37:30, where it is spelled שחיס, there is some uncertainty about its exact meaning. If it {{is the same as the}} shabbat ha-arets (שבת הארץ) that was permitted to be eaten in a Sabbath year in Leviticus 25:6, then there is a ready explanation why there was no harvest: the second year, i.e. the year starting in the fall of 700 BCE, was a Sabbath year, after which normal sowing and reaping resumed in the third year, as stated in the text.|$|E

2500|$|Successful {{cultivation}} of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from [...] Soils usually {{need to be}} fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients {{does not need to}} be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. <b>Planting</b> <b>time</b> in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer.|$|E
