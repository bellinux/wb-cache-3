5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} <b>protozoa</b> and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, <b>protozoa</b> break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, <b>protozoa</b> benefit from more energy.|$|E
5|$|In {{anaerobic}} <b>protozoa,</b> such as Plagiopyla frontata, archaea reside {{inside the}} <b>protozoa</b> and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the sponge Axinella mexicana.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the food web formed from a <b>protozoon,</b> two bacteria, and a glucose minimal medium in {{chemostat}} culture. The system was also divided into simpler parts, first by omitting the <b>protozoon</b> to obtain a competition system, and then by omitting {{one or the other of}} the bacteria to obtain two food chains. In the competition studies, one bacterium was displaced by the other at all holding times used. In the food chain studies, sustained oscillations of the population densities of predator and prey developed at short holding times, and then changed to damped oscillations at longer holding times. In addition, the level of residual glucose remained high at long holding times. A new model of microbial growth is necessary to explain these results. In the food web studies, predation of the <b>protozoon</b> on the two bacteria stabilized the competition between the latter and allowed their coexistence in the same habitat.

40|$|Outcome of {{infection}} varies greatly among people, {{and in the}} case of three very different viruses, it is determined by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. APOE might affect out-come of malaria infection also, since apoE protein and the <b>protozoon</b> (like the viruses) share cell entry mediators (heparan sulphate proteoglycans and/or specific apoE receptors). APOE polymorphisms give rise to protein vari-ants that differ in binding strength to these mediators; thus, the extent of competition between apoE and <b>protozoon</b> for cell entry, and hence magnitude of protozoan damage, might depend on apoE isoform. Genotypes of infants infected with malaria were examined.

5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots.

40|$|The {{presence}} in Paramecium of gamma-aminobutyric acid A-type receptors (GABA(A)) and {{the capability of}} the <b>protozoon</b> to synthesize and release the GABA neurotransmitter into the environment have already been demonstrated. This study investigates {{the involvement of the}} GABA(A) complex in the swimming control of the ciliated <b>protozoon.</b> The GABA(A) receptors were pharmacologically activated by the selective agonist muscimol and the effect on Paramecium primaurelia swimming behavior was analyzed. Paramecium normally swims forward, but the activation of GABA(A) receptors induced a peculiar response, characterized by alternate periods of whirling and forward swim. This effect was inhibited by the GABA(A) selective antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the application of benzodiazepines did not enhance the agonist action but only reduced it. Response to muscimol was also suppressed by nimodipine, a selective antagonist of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. This inhibition suggests that an inflow of calcium ions through L-type channels mediates the muscimol-induced swimming behavior...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The coccidian <b>protozoon</b> Cyclospora cayetanensis is a treatable {{cause of}} prolonged, watery {{diarrhoea}} in humans. Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales often restrict testing {{to those who}} have recently travelled abroad. Only 44 to 66 laboratory reports of C. cayetanensis are made in England and Wales each year and a large proportion are found to have visited developing countries. Large foodborne outbreaks of infection have arisen in North America among people who have not travelled abroad but no such outbreaks have been identified in the United Kingdom. Public health laboratories in England and Wales were surveyed in 1998 to investigate their procedures for identifying C. cayetanensis. Sixty-eight per cent actively looked for the <b>protozoon,</b> but only half used a recommended method of direct microscopy of formol ether concentrates. National external quality assurance results for all participating UK laboratories were reviewed to assess laboratory proficiency in identification.

5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), <b>protozoa,</b> comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish).

Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{leishmaniasis}} and neoplasia, although rare, {{have been}} already reported in humans and dogs. This study describes {{the presence of}} this <b>protozoon</b> within the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells in three different tumors. Specifically, Leishmania amastigotes were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a T cell lymphoma, a fibrosarcoma and a corticosurrenalic adenoma. Furthermore transmission electron microscopy examination confirmed the intracytoplasmic localization of amastigotes within the neoplastic cells and in occasional mitotic cells. Only two papers have been published in dog describing similar features, but the new interesting finding of this study is the association – never reported before – between this <b>protozoon</b> and neoplasms with different histogenesis.

5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic <b>protozoa</b> (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut <b>protozoa,</b> such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

40|$|Rangelia vitalii is a <b>protozoon</b> {{that causes}} {{diseases}} in dogs, and anemia {{is the most}} common laboratory finding. However, few studies on the biochemical changes in dogs infected with this <b>protozoon</b> exist. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the biochemical changes in dogs experimentally infected with R. vitalii, during the acute phase of the infection. For this study, 12 female dogs (aged 6 - 12 months and weighing between 4 and 7 kg) were used, divided in two groups. Group A was composed of healthy dogs (n = 5); and group B consisted of infected animals (n = 7). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 10, 20 and 30 after infection, using tubes without anticoagulant to obtain serum and analyze the biochemical parameters. An increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on day 20 (P < 0. 05) was observed. Also, increased creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were observed throughout the experimental period (P < 0. 05). No changes in the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine levels were observed. Thus, is possible to conclude that experimental infection with R. vitalii in dogs causes changes to the biochemical profile, with increased ALT, AST and CK enzyme levels...|$|R
40|$|Background: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate, {{intracellular}} <b>protozoon</b> {{that develops}} its sexual stage in cat’s intestinal epithelial cells as definitive host and develops its asexual stage in different tissues {{of a wide}} range hosts called intermediate host. The <b>protozoon</b> is a food-borne and worldwide parasite that can cause serious complications such as abortion in pregnant women, encephalitis, and ocular toxoplasmosis. The present study aimed to genotype T. gondii strains isolated from patients with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Methods: Fifty-two blood samples were taken from patients with ocular toxoplasmosis, from July 2013 to July 2014. The specimens were collected from three ophthalmological hospitals of Tehran, Iran. After that, DNA extraction was performed using kit on separated buffy coats of serologically positive blood samples. Then PCR was done in GRA 6 gene. For digestion of products, MseI endonuclease was used. Finally, some of the PCR products were sequenced. Results: All of 52 samples were found positive by serological and PCR-RFLP methods and all of isolated strains belong to type III genotype.
