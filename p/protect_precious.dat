5000|$|The MWRD began {{recovering}} phosphorus {{and nitrogen}} from its Stickney Water Reclamation Plant {{in the fall}} of 2015. Environmental advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke Oct. 8 in Chicago about the significant benefits nutrient recovery will provide to Chicago area watersheds. “Nutrient pollution is the number one challenge facing this country’s waterways,” said Kennedy. “So it isextremely encouraging to see the largest wastewater treatment plant in the world in one of our largest urban centers take a leading role by implementing Ostara’s advanced nutrient recovery technology to recover phosphorus and nitrogen from their wastewater streams. This will not only reduce their nutrient load but help <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> area waterways that are part of Mississippi River basin.” Kennedy shared the stage at the Water Environment Federation’s 86th Annual Technical Exhibition & Conference (WEFTEC) with MWRD Chairman of Finance Mariyana Spyropoulos and Executive Director David St. Pierre, who officially announced that the MWRD will complete the installation of Ostara’s nutrient recovery technology at the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant in Cicero, IL, within two years, when WEFTEC returns to Chicago. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, nutrient pollution is among the biggestenvironmental problems of the 21st century, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has statedthat the “the problem of nutrient pollution is nationally significant, expanding, and likely to substantially accelerate.” Excess nutrients promote algae blooms and create dead zones, which can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and economies. The MWRD’s nutrient recovery facility will greatly reduce its nutrient effluent load to the Mississippi river basin, in turn, reducing its impact on hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Ostara’s technology recovers phosphorus and nitrogen from municipal and industrial wastewaterstreams and transforms them into an environmentally responsible, enhanced efficiency fertilizer called Crystal Green, which is used by growers in the agriculture, turf and ornamental sectors throughout North America and in Europe. The MWRD has partnered with Black & Veatch and Ostara to design and build the nutrient recoveryfacility at the Stickney Plant. Once fully operational in 2015, the plant will be the largest such facility in the world, with the potential capacity to produce between 10,000 and 15,000 tons of Crystal Green fertilizer annually. “The MWRD’s decision to install a nutrient recovery facility is at the forefront of a growing trend we’re seeing within the wastewater treatment sector,” said F. Phillip Abrary, president and CEO of Ostara. “Increasingly, these utilities see themselves as more than simply water treatment plants. Rather, they are resource recovery centers, recycling water, energy and nutrients for beneficial reuse. Our technology helps them fulfill this mandate by recovering phosphorus and nitrogen {{in a way that is}} both economically and environmentally sustainable.” Advising the project team is Dr. James L. Barnard, Water Global Practice and Technology Leader at Black and Veatch, and often referred to as “The Father of Biological Nutrient Removal.” According to Dr. Barnard, phosphorus is a non-renewable resource that is critical to farming and food production. “Nothing grows without it but too much of it can negatively impact water quality,” said Barnard.“Biological nutrient removal enables us to address water quality challenges and recover this precious nutrient for beneficial reuse purposes.” “Technologies like Ostara’s are really miracle technologies,” added Kennedy. “Not only does the process help protect waterways by removing the nutrients from wastewater streams, but the resulting fertilizer, Crystal Green, further reduces nutrient loss due to leaching and runoff because it is highly waterinsoluble and instead releases nutrients in response to plant demand.” ...|$|E

The combined effects of ZnPT and Cu on marine organisms, however, have not been fully investigated. This study examined the toxicities of ZnPT alone and in combination with Cu to the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, polychaete larvae Hydroides elegans and amphipod Elasmopus rapax. Importantly, ZnPT and Cu resulted in a strong synergistic effect with isobologram interaction parameter λ > 1 for all test species. The combined toxicity of ZnPT and Cu was successfully modelled using the non-parametric response surface and its contour. Such synergistic effects may be partly due to the formation of copper pyrithione. It is, therefore, inadequate to assess the ecological risk of ZnPT to marine organisms solely based on the toxicity data generated from the biocide alone. To better <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> marine resources, it is advocated to develop appropriate water quality criteria for ZnPT with the consideration of its compelling synergistic effects with Cu at environmentally realistic concentrations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Because of {{the limited}} supply of land resource, it is {{unavoidable}} that farmland is being transferred to non-agricultural use {{in the course of}} economic development, but there is different basic nature between agricultural and nonagricultural land. It is well-known that recovery of land productivity may be difficult or impossible under improper conversion or application. In order to <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> agricultural areas as well as the agricultural production environment, farmland resources should be balanced against the needs of all sectors in future, and land use should be comprehensively planned on the whole. Otherwise, the pollution problem will aggravate and agricultural productive environment will be destroyed. Accordingly, {{it is very important to}} use land resources reasonably, in order to meet the need for land of the whole nation's economic development, and to protect the precious farmland resources from irregularly scattering. Because of the scarcity of land resources, many countries strongly support the importance and protection of farmland though legislation. For example, in German "Federal Territorial Order Law", land suitable for agricultural production must not be considered for the use of other purposes except for very special need. Those farmland resources are well maintained and preserved in developed countries may be important experience worthy of learning for Taiwan. This paper intends to investigate rural land use planning and management in Taiwan from the aspects of land-use planning and control in Germany. Besides, the problems of agricultural land use in Taiwan will be expounded by current legal regulations so as to propose policy for sustainable development of land resources...|$|E

40|$|By {{every new}} day {{alternative}} technologies {{are being developed}} which in turn are helping {{to increase the speed}} of trains. Indian Railways aims to increase the speed of its passenger trains to 140 – 180 km/h on conventional tracks. Thus it {{can be seen from the}} trending aspects of railways that they are primarily focusing on increasing the speed rather than the SAFETY of the passengers. The primary focus should be the safety of passengers. Generally it is seen that when a train compartment catches fire due to any reason it’s not easy to detect the fire initially and react to it. Due to which train does not stop instantly, which results in casualties and heavy damage to train. The objective of this paper is to design an Automatic Fire initiated braking and alert system for trains. This system consist a microcontroller, motor, fire and smoke sensor, alarm, and alert system. This paper proposes an embedded system that will be used to alert people so that life as well as the damage can be minimized. If the train coach catches fire, the smoke sensor will sense it and send a signal to the microcontroller. This microcontroller activates the motor to pull the chain and also activates an emergency alert system which sends an alert message to the train driver and guard room and activates the alarm. If the chain system to stop the train does not work properly, then even in that case, this system is very effective. So this system is useful to <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> lives of passengers and minimize the heavy damages due to the fire accidents...|$|E
40|$|River water plays a {{key role}} in human health, and in social and {{economic}} development, and is often affected by both natural factors and human activities. An in-depth understanding of the role of these factors can help in developing an effective catchment management strategy to <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> water resources. This study analyzed river water quality, patterns of terrestrial and riparian ecosystems, intensity of agricultural activities, industrial structure, and spatial distribution of pollutant emissions in the Haihe River Basin in China for the year of 2010, identifying the variables that have the greatest impact on river water quality. The area percentage of farmland in study area, the percentage of natural vegetation cover in the 1000 -m riparian zone, rural population density, industrial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) /km(2), and industrial amino nitrogen emissions were all significantly correlated with river water quality (P < 0. 05). Farming had the largest impact on river water quality, explaining 43. 0 % of the water quality variance, followed by the coverage of natural vegetation in the 1000 -m riparian zone, which explained 36. 2 % of the water quality variance. Industrial amino nitrogen emissions intensity and rural population density explained 31. 6 % and 31. 4 % of the water quality variance, respectively, while industrial GDP/km(2) explained 26. 6 %. Together, these five indicators explained 67. 3 % of the total variance in water quality. Consequently, water environmental management of the Haihe River Basin should focus on adjusting agricultural activities, conserving riparian vegetation, and reducing industrial pollutant emissions by optimizing industrial structure. The results demonstrate how human activities drive the spatial pattern changes of river water quality, and they can provide reference for developing land use guidelines and for prioritizing management practices to maintain stream water quality in a large river basin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of palm oil and its sustainability from different perspectives. We consider {{the role of}} palm oil within the GHG context. We discuss the impact of palm oil on biodiversity and analyse how palm oil can contribute to economic growth and development in tropical countries. Finally, based on this analysis, we assess the current concerns about and politics towards palm oil with special focus on the EU. Palm oil is a low-energy and low-fertilizer crop that offers much higher yields per hectare than other oil crops. Furthermore, if the energy obtained by the residuals in the production process is used properly, the energy balance of palm oil production is much more favourable compared to other biofuels. Overall, palm oil {{turns out to be}} much more efficient than other oil crops and therefore offers significant advantages within the context of GHG savings. Contrary to some recent campaigns and the perception among European citizens, oil palm plantings are not a major contributor to deforestation in tropical countries. Deforestation associated with oil palm plantings is much less significant than postulated by some recent campaigns. Furthermore, biodiversity in oil palm plantations is much higher than in most monocultures in the EU. Palm oil is an important driver of economic development and growth in tropical countries and contributes to the reduction of poverty and hunger in the developing world. The EU Renewable Energy Directive is discriminatory from the outset and the GHG saving values and their interpretation are based on wrong assumptions and faulty calculations. Therefore, the EU should reshape its policies towards palm oil, conduct objective and non-discriminatory calculations regarding the GHG emissions saving values and support palm oil imports from developing countries rather than restricting them. Together with certain initiatives to further enhance energy efficiency and to <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> habitats combined with strategies to strengthen property rights and encourage efficient land use and successful strategies of agricultural development, this would not only prevent political conflicts and trade disputes in conjunction with the issue of palm oil but also foster economic growth and development, reduce poverty and - not least - contribute to the ambitious GHG emissions savings goals on a fair and reasonable basi...|$|E

40|$|Saline water {{disposal}} {{is one of}} the most pressing issues with regard to increasing petroleum and natural gas production in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah. Conventional oil fields in the basin provide 69 percent of Utah?s total crude oil production and 71 percent of Utah?s total natural gas, the latter of which has increased 208 % in the past 10 years. Along with hydrocarbons, wells in the Uinta Basin produce significant quantities of saline water ? nearly 4 million barrels of saline water per month in Uintah County and nearly 2 million barrels per month in Duchesne County. As hydrocarbon production increases, so does saline water production, creating an increased need for economic and environmentally responsible disposal plans. Current {{water disposal}} wells are near capacity, and permitting for new wells is being delayed because of a lack of technical data regarding potential disposal aquifers and questions concerning contamination of freshwater sources. Many companies are reluctantly resorting to evaporation ponds as a short-term solution, but these ponds have limited capacity, are prone to leakage, and pose potential risks to birds and other wildlife. Many Uinta Basin operators claim that oil and natural gas production cannot reach its full potential until a suitable, long-term saline water disposal solution is determined. The enclosed project was divided into three parts: 1) re-mapping the base of the moderately saline aquifer in the Uinta Basin, 2) creating a detailed geologic characterization of the Birds Nest aquifer, a potential reservoir for large-scale saline water disposal, and 3) collecting and analyzing water samples from the eastern Uinta Basin to establish baseline water quality. Part 1 : Regulators currently stipulate that produced saline water must be disposed of into aquifers that already contain moderately saline water (water that averages at least 10, 000 mg/L total dissolved solids). The UGS has re-mapped the moderately saline water boundary in the subsurface of the Uinta Basin using a combination of water chemistry data collected from various sources and by analyzing geophysical well logs. By re-mapping the base of the moderately saline aquifer using more robust data and more sophisticated computer-based mapping techniques, regulators now have the information needed to more expeditiously grant water disposal permits while still protecting freshwater resources. Part 2 : Eastern Uinta Basin gas producers have identified the Birds Nest aquifer, located in the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation, as the most promising reservoir suitable for large-volume saline water disposal. This aquifer formed from the dissolution of saline minerals that left behind large open cavities and fractured rock. This new and complete understanding the aquifer?s areal extent, thickness, water chemistry, and relationship to Utah?s vast oil shale resource will help operators and regulators determine safe saline water disposal practices, directly impacting the success of increased hydrocarbon production in the region, while protecting potential future oil shale production. Part 3 : In order to establish a baseline of water quality on lands identified by the U. S. Bureau of Land Management as having oil shale development potential in the southeastern Uinta Basin, the UGS collected biannual water samples over a three-year period from near-surface aquifers and surface sites. The near-surface and relatively shallow groundwater quality information will help in the development of environmentally sound water-management solutions for a possible future oil shale and oil sands industry and help assess the sensitivity of the alluvial and near-surface bedrock aquifers. This multifaceted study will provide a better understanding of the aquifers in Utah?s Uinta Basin, giving regulators the tools needed to <b>protect</b> <b>precious</b> freshwater resources while still allowing for increased hydrocarbon production...|$|E
