50|$|The minimum <b>priority</b> <b>item</b> in a min-heap (or {{the maximum}} <b>priority</b> <b>item</b> in a max-heap) may always {{be found at}} {{position}} 0 of the array. To remove this item from the priority queue, the last item x in the array is moved into its place, {{and the length of}} the array is decreased by one. Then, while item x and its children do not satisfy the heap property, item x is swapped with one of its children (the one with the smallest priority in a min-heap, or the one with the largest priority in a max-heap), moving it downward in the tree and later in the array, until eventually the heap property is satisfied. The same downward swapping procedure may be used to increase the priority of an item in a min-heap, or to decrease the priority of an item in a max-heap.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Although {{there are}} many quality {{measurement}} theories and models, all are imperfect; that is, {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages. Particularly, some models cannot indicate accurate improvement priorities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an integrated performance model that improves service quality and acquires accurate improvement priorities that promote customer satisfaction and eliminate resource wastage. Design/methodology/approach – This study applied a performance matrix and quality loss function (QLF) theory to determine <b>priority</b> <b>items</b> needing improvement. A questionnaire was designed to determine the priority of improvement objectives derived from certain questionnaire items that do not fall into the appropriate performance zone (APZ) of the performance matrix. Finally, the QLF was adopted to rank the improvement objectives in terms of priority. A large QLF area indicates customer satisfaction needs improvement. Findings – This study utilized an employee satisfaction survey to demonstrate this matrix, and found that it reflects the improvement <b>priorities</b> of different <b>items</b> and avoids the shortcomings of other models. In this case study, 11 items must be improved; furthermore, five items with the greatest QLF areas became the <b>priority</b> <b>items</b> for improvement. Originality/value – This performance matrix also considers the items of surplus resource investment, which can be included in improvements, thereby avoiding resource wastage...|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{integration}} of Uruguay to Telesur {{was long and}} controversial. On March 3, 2005 Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez signed several agreements with then-recently elected Uruguayan president Tabaré Vázquez regarding the energetic and communicational integration of both countries, one of them being the joint creation and financing of Telesur. After just under a year of signing the agreements, {{they had not been}} carried out, although the party of President Vázquez was a majority in the country's legislative branch. Venezuelan journalist Andrés Izarra, president of Telesur, confirmed in an interview in January 2006 the delay in the approval of the full incorporation of the country to the network: [...] "There is a special situation (in Uruguay), because although the country is a member of Telesur, until their Congress does not approve it, we can't broadcast the channel locally or receive government funding. The situation requires a political decision and we hope that the government of Tabaré Vázquez support the initiative". The president of the Uruguayan Deputies' Education Commission, Jorge Brovetto confirmed in February of that year the country still wasn't part of the network's sponsors and asked that, until the parliament has not decided on a final status, the removal of the country's name as sponsor from its promotions and the website. In June of that year, and as the nation's Minister of Education and Culture, Brovetto expressed worries regarding the network's editorial line on certain issues and governments in the region, and how the diplomacy of his country could be affected by it. Uruguay's Chamber of Senators approved the bill that would ratify the agreements on August 8, 2006 by votes of the legislators belonging to ruling party, but the Chamber of Deputies postponed several times the debate on the draft. Although sources close to the Congress told the press in February 2009 that the issue of incorporation to Telesur [...] "was not a <b>priority</b> <b>item</b> in their agenda", and that the issue would not be discussed during the remainder of that year, the agreement was finally ratified on June 2, 2009.|$|E

30|$|Sprint pre-planning {{sessions}} (the Sprint preplanning {{activity in}} Fig.  3) {{are needed to}} evaluate whether high <b>priority</b> release backlog <b>items</b> include enough information for moving them from the preliminary state to a ready state. Features in the ready state can be inserted into following sprint backlogs. The release manager, ScrumMaster, team architects and other team representatives usually participate in sprint pre-planning sessions. There can also be other experts who have experience with high <b>priority</b> <b>items</b> in release backlogs. The release manager should have the responsibility on refining the information. Should the development involve more than one team, the pre-planned release backlog items are to be divided among the teams. This may require further refining the backlog items and synchronising the work between teams. The identified preceding dependencies between MCFSs and architectural features help dividing the development work among multiple teams.|$|R
