40|$|We use {{experimental}} methods {{to investigate whether}} <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> can improve cooperation in endogenously formed partnerships facing a social dilemma. Treatments vary {{in terms of the}} individual’s (a) opportunity to commit to their partner, (b) the cost of dissolving committed partnerships, and (c) the distribution of these dissolution costs between partners. Our findings show that <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> alone can increase cooperation and welfare in committed partnerships. The introduction of relatively large and equally split costs yields similar gains. In contrast, when costs to dissolve committed partnerships fall solely on the individual choosing to break up, <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> fail to improve cooperation and welfare...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses {{experimental}} methods {{to investigate whether}} <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> can improve cooperation in partnerships facing a social dilemma. In the game studied, subjects form partnerships endogenously and choose contribution levels to a partnership account. The treatments vary {{in terms of the}} individual’s (a) opportunity to commit to their partner, (b) the cost of dissolving committed partnerships, and (c) the distribution of these dis-solution costs between partners. I find that <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> can increase cooperation levels within partnerships. Cooperation increases when committed partnerships can be dissolved without cost due to an increase in partnership stability; stable partnerships are more cooperative. I also find <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> improve cooperation when it is costly to dissolve a committed partnership. Dissolution costs are most effective when they are shared between committed partners because both partners respond to the threat of costly dissolution. Surprisingly, the increase in average cooperation when committed partnerships can be dissolved without cost is of similar magnitude to the increase when dissolution costs are equally shared between committed partners.

2500|$|The {{exchange}} of the rings. Based on biblical references, {{it has always}} been the tradition of the Church to place the wedding ring on the right hands of the couple. This is seen very clearly in one of the prayers in the Betrothal Service. A portion of the prayer refers to the biblical references: [...] "For You, O Lord, have declared that a pledge is to be given and held inviolate in all things. By a ring Joseph was given might in Egypt; by a ring Daniel was exalted in Babylon; by a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion upon His prodigal son, for He said, ‘Put a ring upon his right hand, kill the fatted calf, and let us eat and rejoice.’ Your own right hand, O Lord, armed Moses in the Red Sea. By word of Your truth were the Heavens established and the earth set upon her sure foundations; and the right hands of Your servants shall be blessed by Your mighty word, and by Your uplifted arm." [...] As we see, it was scripturally the practice to wear rings on the right hand, the hand of authority and power completing the <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The power and authority comes from the right hand of God.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} TRIPS {{is not only}} to further {{competition}} but also to further fair competition. This is, however, done rather indirectly through the implementation of IP rights and the determination of their scope and limitations. Apart from this, TRIPS does not monitor acts in trade and commerce under the aspect of commercial fairness. In particular, TRIPS does not deal with commercial practices in connection with the negative side effects of a globalized economy, which, for instance, outsources production to countries with laxer standards in the field of labour, environment, and human rights. If at all, this is regarded as the domain of Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention, which expressly prohibits “any act contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters”. This paper addresses the issue of whether Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention is part of TRIPS—or whether TRIPS could at least be interpreted in such a manner as to (directly or indirectly) include a general prohibition of unfair competition. As a second step it addresses {{the question of whether the}} obligation to combat unfair commercial practices under the Paris Convention (and possibly also under TRIPS) in its turn can be extended to cases where a company disregards its own <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to so-called “corporate social responsibility”. This relatively new strategy used frequently by multinational companies tries to establish a favourable image in the public perception—typically by more or less explicitly pledging to respect certain principles of “business ethics”. Can non-compliance with one’s own standards of corporate social responsibility, often presented on the company’s website, be contrary to “honest practices” pursuant to Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention? And if so, can this in its turn (also) be in breach of TRIPS...|$|R

40|$|Canada’s role in {{greenhouse}} gas reduction {{and climate change}} policy development has received far less scholarly attention than the roles of either the United States or the European Union. However, Canadian emissions are significant, comparable to the annual levels of the United Kingdom and ranking eighth among {{the nations of the}} world. These emissions, when measured on a per capita basis, are much closer to the higher levels of the United States and Australia than those of most EU nations. In turn, Canadian emissions have grown since 1990 at a rate substantially greater than that of the EU and somewhat greater than that of the United States. Stabilization and reduction of these emission levels thus poses an extraordinary challenge for Canada’s multi-level governance system. To date, the federal government has taken the lead in the negotiation of international agreements and <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> Canadian <b>commitments,</b> consistent with its powers to make treaties. However, given the very limited role of the Canadian federal government in environmental and energy policy governance in Canada, much of the responsibility for policy development and implementation to honor these agreements is likely to be concentrated in provincial hands. Consequently, this case offers an intriguin...|$|R
