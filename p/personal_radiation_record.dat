40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of two {{specific types of}} radionuclide detectors for conducting an on-board search in the maritime environment was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation implemented in AVERT{reg_sign}. AVERT{reg_sign}, short for the Automated Vulnerability Evaluation for Risk of Terrorism, is personal computer based vulnerability assessment software developed by the ARES Corporation. The {{sensitivity of}} two specific types of radionuclide detectors for conducting an on-board search in the maritime environment was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. The detectors, a RadPack and also a <b>Personal</b> <b>Radiation</b> Detector (PRD), were chosen from the class of Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS). Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS) serve multiple purposes. In the maritime environment, {{there is a need}} to detect, localize, characterize, and identify radiological/nuclear (RN) material or weapons. The RadPack is a commercially available broad-area search device used for gamma and also for neutron detection. The PRD is chiefly used as a <b>personal</b> <b>radiation</b> protection device. It is also used to detect contraband radionuclides and to localize radionuclide sources. Neither device has the capacity to characterize or identify radionuclides. The principal aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of both the RadPack and the PRD while being used under controlled conditions in a simulated maritime environment for detecting hidden RN contraband. The detection distance varies by the source strength and the shielding present. The characterization parameters of the source are not indicated in this report so the results summarized are relative. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicate the probability of detection of the RN source at certain distances from the detector which is a function of transverse speed and instrument sensitivity for the specified RN source...|$|R

40|$|The {{leaf area index}} (LAI) of {{boreal forest}} can be {{estimated}} using reflected <b>radiation</b> <b>recorded</b> by satellite sensors. Measurements of visible and near infrared radiation are commonly used in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate LAI. However, research, mainly in tropical forest, has demonstrated that LAI is related more closely to radiation of middle infrared wavelengths than of visible wavelengths. This paper derives a vegetation index, VI 3, based on <b>radiation</b> from vegetation <b>recorded</b> at near and middle infrared wavelengths. For a boreal forest canopy, the relationship between VI 3 and LAI was observed to be much stronger than that between NDVI and LAI. In addition, the LAI estimated using VI 3 accounted for about 76 % {{of the variation in}} field estimates of LAI, compared with about 46 % when using the NDVI. We conclude that information provided by middle infrared radiation should be considered when estimating the leaf area index of boreal forest...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>radiation</b> shields currently worn in hospital and other diagnostic environments. This study was performed with four different radioisotopes; 18 F, 99 mTc, 124 I and 131 I. 18 F results showed a decrease in dose with 0. 5 -mm Pb shielding but the reduction provided does not warrant its use clinically. 124 I testing demonstrated that dose enhancement can occur in greater shield thicknesses. PET isotope 124 I can be adequately shielded using 0. 25 -mm Pb equivalent aprons but any higher thickness increase the wearer&# 039;s dose. As a result more shielding does not always equal more protection. The 131 I test showed that no dose reduction occurred, even when tested with up to 1. 25 -mm Pb equivalent shielding. Novel radioisotopes being used in the laboratory and clinic should be individually tested as each requires specific shielding testing...|$|R
