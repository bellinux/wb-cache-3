25|$|In the OSI model, the {{definition}} of its application layer is narrower in scope. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer</b> below it.|$|E
25|$|From an OSI model {{protocol}} stack viewpoint, the technologies used on DAB inhabit the following layers: the audio codec inhabits the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer.</b> Below {{that is the}} data link layer, in charge of statistical time division multiplexing and frame synchronization. Finally, the physical layer contains the error-correction coding, OFDM modulation, {{and dealing with the}} over-the-air transmission and reception of data. Some aspects of these are described below.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the session}} and {{presentation}} {{layers of the}} OSI suite {{are considered to be}} included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like Telnet and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Session layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer</b> are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the MIME standard in data exchange.|$|E

50|$|APPC {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the similarly named APPN (Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking). APPC manages communication between programs, operating at the application and <b>presentation</b> <b>layers.</b> By contrast, APPN manages communication between machines, including routing, and operates at the transport and network layers.|$|R
25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer</b> and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|E
2500|$|TLS and SSL {{do not fit}} {{neatly into}} any single layer of the OSI model or the TCP/IP model. TLS runs [...] "on top of some {{reliable}} transport protocol (e.g., TCP)," [...] which would imply that it is above the transport layer. It serves encryption to higher layers, which is normally {{the function of the}} <b>presentation</b> <b>layer.</b> However, applications generally use TLS {{as if it were a}} transport layer, even though applications using TLS must actively control initiating TLS handshakes and handling of exchanged authentication certificates.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are managed}} {{applications}} written using the WMC API and packaged as CLI assemblies. <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer</b> applications can have {{full access to}} both the [...]NET Framework {{as well as the}} Windows Media Center API, with the latter exposing a managed object model to access and manipulate the current states of the media management and playback, live television, video recording as well as the presentation capabilities of Windows Media Center. <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer</b> applications are rendered using the bitmap-based Windows Media Center <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer,</b> the user-input and presentation system of WMC. <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer</b> includes support for animations, dynamic layout, keyboard/mouse as well as remote navigation. <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer</b> applications can be streamed over RDP to Windows Media Center Extenders; so <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer</b> applications run on the extenders without any modification. <b>Presentation</b> <b>Layer,</b> however, exists only in the Windows Vista version of WMC.|$|E

5000|$|SAE J1939 defines five layers in the seven-layer OSI network model, {{and this}} {{includes}} the Controller Area Network (CAN) ISO 11898 specification (using only the 29-bit/"extended" [...] identifier) for the physical and data-link layers. Under J1939/11 and J1939/15, the data rate is specified as 250 kbit/s, with J1939/14 specifying 500 kbit/s. The session and <b>presentation</b> <b>layers</b> {{are not part of}} the specification. The later use of CAN FD is currently discussed.|$|R
5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and <b>presentation</b> <b>layers,</b> most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|R

XSLT, the standard transformation language for XML, is increasingly popular among programmers and Web developers for separating the application and <b>presentation</b> <b>layers</b> of Web applications.

Furthermore, <b>presentation</b> <b>layers</b> are added to enable ad-vanced multimedia viewers to optimally present the inter-esting parts of a video in case the user wants to zoom in.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} {{for the creation of}} community web portals. The framework provides the necessary infrastructure for the management of several portlets, which divide the available space for information display on the portal page. The management infrastructure includes authentication, layout and user profile services. The framework also provides a portlet infrastructure for displaying and filtering information from heterogeneous information sources of structured information. This infrastructure is based on a layered approach which keeps the source integration, filtering and <b>presentation</b> <b>layers</b> quasi-independent. Available filter templates can be freely assigned to any information source with any display template for display in a portlet. We achieve this layer independence by using a standard set of information fields for internal processing. The heterogeneous information sources are then mapped to this standard field set. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the development of}} an online authoring system that can be integrated into a typical digital archive system to facilitate the construction of online exhibitions. One common approach for the efficient online authoring is based on a principle that decomposes a hypermedia presentation into a “content document ” and a “style template. ” This study proposes a layer-based architecture to further decompose a style template into a number of <b>presentation</b> <b>layers.</b> The approach eases the burden for implementing large-scale style templates in digital museum projects demanding versatile presentation styles. Particular attention has been focused on the mechanism for affective background image composition that incorporates the concerns of the affective colour scheme and the page layout. A system implementation has been successfully applied in real world digital museum projects for constructing aesthetic online exhibitions...|$|R
