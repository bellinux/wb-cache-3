Tolkachev refused to leave the Soviet Union because his wife believed she would become homesick. Although he did eventually request the interest from his accounts be paid to him in rubles, so that he could attempt to bribe any co workers that may discover his activity. In case he could not bribe his way out of a situation, Tolkachev requested poison pills in order to commit suicide in case he was captured, and to limit the information the KGB could acquire from interrogating him.
