5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Despite Winmark's {{specializing in}} used goods, its stores sell new goods too. Through its many stores, Winmark uses its buying power to {{negotiate}} competitive <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stores' new goods.

5|$|Dhoom 2 was {{released}} on 24 November 2006 in India, where it received the widest release in Indian cinema history at the time with over 1800 prints, including 250 digital copies. Some locations raised ticket <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ordinary}} good is a microeconomic concept used {{in consumer}} theory. It {{is defined as}} a good which creates increased demand when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> good drops or conversely decreased demand if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> good increases, ceteris paribus. It is the opposite of a Giffen good.|$|R

5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} {{much of the}} issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West Berlin S-Bahn {{were kept}} {{slightly}} below the fares of the West Berlin BVG. In East Berlin, a flat fee of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. West Berlin politics {{and most of}} the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by the East German railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|The finalists {{received}} a total allocation of approximately 52,000 tickets, {{which was an}} estimated increase of 10% on previous Wembley finals. Seat <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final exceeded £70, though some ticket touts charged as much as £1,000. The cheapest tickets cost £20; the rest were priced at £40 and £55.|$|E

According to the contract from 1716 the ironwork until 1730 delivered around 2,500 skippund worth around 30,000 riksdaler. In 1713 Moss Jernverk also produced 1,000 rifles.|$|R

5|$|Zirconium is a {{by-product}} of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The allocation was enough for the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, but not for Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved {{at the lack of}} tickets, including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an allocation in the region of 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive tickets cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season. The cheapest tickets available at £45, up £5 from 2010.|$|E
50|$|Tony, sent to {{negotiate}} a lower <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stunt, is taken on a wild ride in a tuned-up stunt car by Hooper, who refuses to lower <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gag. Tony agrees to pay him and Ski the $100,000 due to the danger involved in jumping a car 325 feet and an uncertain landing.|$|R

50|$|A {{potential}} buyer bids a specific <b>price</b> <b>for</b> a stock, {{and a potential}} seller asks a specific <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same stock. Buying or selling at the market means you will accept any ask price or bid <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders or askers at a given price.|$|R
5|$|In April 2014, Chipotle {{announced}} {{an increase in}} menu <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in nearly}} three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 {{through the end of the}} third quarter. In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Mindful of {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> existing product. As of February 2015, the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, 1971, the Mint {{announced}} the <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 40% silver pieces {{which would be}} struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced proof pieces, with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 {{did not include the}} Eisenhower dollar.|$|E

5|$|The LS 460 and LS 460 L {{arrived at}} dealerships in Japan, the U.S., and Europe in late 2006, and the vehicle reached Australia, East Asia, and the Middle East in 2007. The U.S. base <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L were US$61,000 and US$71,000, respectively. In 2006 and 2007, {{the average price}} paid for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans {{exceeded}} US$80,000, due largely to added options packages, placing the Lexus LS in the same average price range as its long-wheelbase Audi, BMW, and Jaguar rivals for the first time.|$|E
5|$|As {{with last}} season's event, the final was {{scheduled}} {{before the end}} of the domestic season. This was partly because the Premier League chose to end its campaign a week later, but with the World Cup starting on 31 May, the FA wanted to give players considerable time to prepare for the finals. This season's staging of the competition offered a greater financial incentive to clubs, given the BBC and Sky Sports signed a joint-deal with the FA, worth £400 million to broadcast matches. Finalists stood to receive £1 million in prize money; the winners would pocket an extra million with additional TV revenues. The BBC spent a million promoting the FA Cup, and as part of their pre-match coverage included a sketch featuring Ricky Gervais. Seat <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final exceeded £70, with some ticket touts charging as much as £600 outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a monopsony that drove down <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E

5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the medieval period.|$|E
