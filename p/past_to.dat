However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E

5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} item is the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the <b>past</b> <b>to</b> the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E

With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone <b>past</b> <b>to</b> take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E

However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water hyacinth include introducing weevils for the biological control of water hyacinth, which {{was carried out in}} collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling water hyacinth.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the <b>past</b> <b>to</b> track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, {{and brings}} her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by {{revealing}} her <b>past</b> <b>to</b> her family. Irma tells them Eve {{was once a}} prostitute and drug addict while living in Boston, and {{was involved in a}} relationship with Julian, who is T.C.'s sworn enemy. The revelations destroy Eve and T.C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a whore or a slut. When Eve's daughter Simone tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously been kind to her, tells Simone homosexuality is vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress Marla Gibbs on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} planned that United States President Ronald Reagan should {{take part in}} the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag, shifting the emphasis from remembering the <b>past</b> <b>to</b> highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc. On Weizsäcker's strong urging, the occasion was marked without Reagan, who visited West Germany several days earlier instead, surrounding the G7-summit in Bonn. Reagan's visit nevertheless sparked controversy, especially in the United States. In an attempt to reproduce the gesture made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun, the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg. This raised objections, since the cemetery included the last resting place for several members of the Waffen-SS.|$|E
5|$|Link {{receives}} a sword from Impa {{and makes his}} way to the Maku Tree in Lynna City, the capital of Labrynna. The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; Link uses a time portal to travel to the <b>past</b> <b>to</b> prevent this. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Time to defeat Veran. Link sets out to retrieve the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, Link is told he has the opportunity to save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi. Link gathers the remaining Essences and brings them to the Maku Tree, who uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed that allows Link to enter Veran's Black Tower. Link ascends the tower and defeats Veran. He rescues Queen Ambi, and Nayru tells him that all has returned to normal. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that Veran has lit the Flame of Sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E.

Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the <b>past</b> <b>to</b> kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E
