The program, which has initially undergone a <b>pilot</b> <b>phase</b> and expects to replace 5 million incandescent lamps {{in the next six}} months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall.

The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) {{was supported by the}} world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its <b>pilot</b> <b>phase.</b> The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Objective Our {{goal was}} to conduct the item {{generation}} and <b>piloting</b> <b>phases</b> of a new discriminative and evaluative tool for pediatric post-thrombotic syndrome. Methods We followed a formative model {{for the development of}} the tool, focusing on the signs/symptoms (items) that define post-thrombotic syndrome. For item generation, pediatric thrombosis experts and subjects diagnosed with extremity post-thrombotic syndrome during childhood nominated items. In the <b>piloting</b> <b>phase,</b> items were cross-sectionally measured in children with limb deep vein thrombosis to examine item performance. Result Twenty-three experts and 16 subjects listed 34 items, which were then measured in 140 subjects with previous diagnosis of limb deep vein thrombosis (70 upper extremity and 70 lower extremity). The items with strongest correlation with post-thrombotic syndrome severity and largest area under the curve were pain (in older children), paresthesia, and swollen limb for the upper extremity group, and pain (in older children), tired limb, heaviness, tightness and paresthesia for the lower extremity group. Conclusion The diagnostic properties of the items and their correlations with post-thrombotic syndrome severity varied according to the assessed venous territory. The information gathered in this study will help experts decide which item should be considered for inclusion in the new tool...|$|R

Secondly, the origin of the European Language Portfolio within the Turkish national education system is described. The next section dwells upon the issues relating to the present stage of European Language Portfolio implementation in Turkey. Positive outcomes of European Language Portfolio implementation in other Member States are shortly addressed. Finally, while the study illustrates that the European Language Portfolio has proved to be an important innovation in foreign language learning, the implementation change in Turkey necessitates sustained effort to promote the concepts of the European Language Portfolio so as to reach long lasting effect...|$|R
