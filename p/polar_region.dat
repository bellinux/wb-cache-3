5|$|During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region {{near the}} south pole. Temperatures {{in this region}} ranged from 85–90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm to be {{explained}} by solar heating, indicating that parts of the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> are heated from the interior of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2009, Cassini's VIMS {{observed}} a specular reflection {{indicative of a}} smooth, mirror-like surface, off what today is called Jingpo Lacus, a lake in the north <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{water vapor}} plumes above the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> of Europa, one of Jupiter's Galilean moons.

40|$|The inaccessibility of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions</b> {{explains}} the relative pristine state of these regions to date. The human presence {{in these regions}} is presently limited by the extreme climatological circumstances. This will change {{as a result of}} polar warming. The ecological boundaries of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions</b> will shift in the directions of the geographical poles resulting in a diminishing area of the ecological <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions.</b> Climate change and other ecological processes with an anthropogenic origin, such as the acidification of soils and waters, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants in people and animals constitute serious threats for the fragile ecosystems of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions.</b> These processes will impact on the capacity of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions</b> to supply goods and services of a certain quality in a certain quantity. The use of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions</b> will change accordingly. There will be positive changes, but there will also be negative changes. Existing activities will disappear and new activities will emerge. The paper analyzes the legal implications of the changing human footprint the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Bloom’s ongoing work on gender, {{climate change}} and the <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> {{includes}} co-editing with Laura Kay and Elena Glasberg a special issue on polar art for the online journal, The Scholar and Feminist Online at Barnard College (2008), a 2012 article on climate change, art, and the <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> co-written with Elena Glasberg titled Disappearing Ice and Missing Data: Visual Culture of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Regions</b> and Global Warming, and a 2015 article on oil and the <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> titled Witnessing Climate Change: Oil, Geopolitics and Landscapes of Invisibility.|$|R
5|$|Specular {{reflections}} {{are indicative}} of a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference {{of the presence of}} a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging.

5|$|Triton's south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> {{is covered}} by a highly {{reflective}} cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little {{is known about the}} north pole because it was on the night side during the Voyager 2 encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar ice cap.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
50|$|The axial tilt of the Earth {{has a major}} {{effect on}} climate of the <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b> Since the <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> are the {{farthest}} from the equator, they receive {{the least amount of}} sunlight and are therefore frigid. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects a large part of what little sunlight the <b>Polar</b> <b>regions</b> receive, contributing to the cold. <b>Polar</b> <b>regions</b> are characterized by the polar climate, extremely cold temperatures, heavy glaciation wherever there is sufficient precipitation to form permanent ice, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with twenty-four hours of daylight in summer, and complete darkness at mid-winter.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> are {{distinguished}} from the other two climatic and biomatic belts of Earth, a tropics belt near the equator, and two middle latitude regions located between the tropics and <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Joerg {{published}} {{many books}} articles on geography, including volumes on {{the geography of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b> Although he personally never travelled to the <b>polar</b> <b>regions,</b> he {{was considered to be}} the world's greatest expert on the geography of these regions.|$|R
5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south <b>polar</b> <b>region.</b> This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The {{first child}} {{born in the}} {{southern}} <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> was Norwegian girl Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen, born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of South Georgia. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{high-resolution}} {{radar coverage}} of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested {{the existence of}} nonuniformities in its crater distribution. Xanadu has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than the trailing hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).|$|E

50|$|The {{range is}} about 500 km in length, {{and is the}} most heavily glaciated {{part of the world}} outside the <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b> The Siachen Glacier at 76 km and the Biafo Glacier at 63 km rank as the world's second and third longest glaciers outside the <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding of {{escaping}} internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> during the July encounter.|$|E

These cloud decks are at lower altitudes than the clouds detected by Mariner 10 and Pioneer Venus probes, and are uniform in absorption characteristics in the <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b> The regions close to the polar hot spots have depressed the upper cloud heights and increased polar density; these areas are free of thermal inversions characteristic of the north <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> away from the hot spots...|$|R
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite <b>polar</b> <b>region.</b> A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land masses between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E

5|$|Siberia is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> owing to the dryness of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high Altai Mountains, Verkhoyansk Range, Cherskiy Range and Suntar-Khayata Range, plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near Lake Baikal, which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989. Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers. The Altai region has also experienced an overall temperature increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last 120years {{according to a report}} from 2006, with most of that increase occurring since the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to pass by}} Io were the twin Pioneer 10 and 11 probes on 3 December 1973 and 2 December 1974, respectively. Radio tracking provided an improved estimate of Io's mass, which, along with the best available information of Io's size, suggested that Io had the highest density of the four Galilean satellites, and was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice. The Pioneers also revealed {{the presence of a}} thin atmosphere at Io and intense radiation belts near the orbit of Io. The camera on board Pioneer11 took the only good image of Io obtained by either spacecraft, showing its north <b>polar</b> <b>region.</b> Close-up images were planned during Pioneer 10s encounter with Io, but those observations were lost because of the high-radiation environment.|$|E
