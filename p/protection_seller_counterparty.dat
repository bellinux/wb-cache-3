Bad {{news about the}} risk of the asset underlying the derivative increases the expected liability of a <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> and undermines her risk prevention incentives. This limits risk-sharing, and may create endogenous counterparty risk and contagion from news about the hedged risk to the balance sheet of <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> Margin calls after bad news can improve <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> incentives and enhance the ability to share risk.

40|$|International audienceCredit default swaps (CDSs), {{initially}} {{intended as}} instruments for hedging and managing credit risk, have been pinpointed {{during the recent}} crisis as being detrimental to ﬁ nancial stability. We argue {{that the impact of}} credit default swap markets on ﬁ nancial stability crucially depends on clearing mechanisms and capital and liquidity requirements for large <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> In particular, the culprits are not so much speculative or “naked” credit default swaps but inadequate risk management and supervision of <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> When <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> are inadequately capitalised, OTC (over-the-counter) CDS markets may act as channels for contagion and systemic risk. On the other hand, a CDS market where all major dealers participate in a central clearing facility with adequate reserves can actually contribute to mitigating systemic risk. In the latter case, a key element is the risk management of the central counterparties, for which we outline some recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Investments in {{any form}} of {{financial}} product, other than a bank deposit at the risk-free interest rate, involve some sort of risk due to the volatility of the economy. Interest rate risk is the most critical risk factor affecting fixed income securities. However, the growing credit derivatives market is based primarily on credit or default risk. This is the risk caused by {{the possibility that a}} company will have financial troubles and will have to default on payments which it owes to its lenders. US treasury securities are considered to be free of credit risk because they are backed by the government. In order to protect investors from this risk, the credit derivatives market emerged with various products whose sole purpose is to hedge credit risk. A credit derivative is a contract between a protection buyer and a <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> to transfer the credit risk of an asset without the actual transfer of the asset. The most fundamental credit derivative is the credit default swap. In a credit default swap, the protection buyer makes periodic premium payments to the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> in exchange for the promise that if default occurs, the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> will receive the defaulted security and repay the protection buyer a percentage of what was owed.

40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} {{and show that}} although hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the <b>protection</b> <b>seller.</b> This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking.

30|$|A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is {{a credit}} {{derivative}} via which one party buys {{protection against the}} default of a reference entity from another party. In particular, the protection buyer pays a fee to the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> who, in turn, promises to pay a notional amount to the protection buyer {{in the event that}} the reference entity defaults.|$|R
5000|$|Movements of {{financial}} capital are normally dependent on either credit or equity transfers. The global credit market {{is three times}} the size of global equity. [...] Credit is in turn dependent on the reputation or creditworthiness of the entity which takes responsibility for the funds. Credit is also traded in financial markets. The purest form is the credit default swap market, which is essentially a traded market in credit insurance. A credit default swap represents the price at which two parties exchange this riskthe <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> takes the risk of default of the credit in return for a payment, commonly denoted in basis points (one basis point is 1/100 of a percent) of the notional amount to be referenced, while the protection buyer pays this premium and in the case of default of the underlying (a loan, bond or other receivable), delivers this receivable to the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> and receives from the seller the par amount (that is, is made whole).|$|R
2500|$|Another kind of {{risk for}} the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk. A seller of a CDS could be {{collecting}} monthly premiums with little expectation that the reference entity may default. [...] A default creates a sudden obligation on the <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers. This risk is not present in other over-the-counter derivatives.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the event}} of a [...] "Failure to Pay", or a [...] "Bankruptcy" [...] credit event, the <b>{{protection}}</b> <b>seller</b> makes a payment to the protection buyer on the credit event settlement date.

50|$|Any {{protection}} {{contract is}} essentially providing a hedge {{to the owner}} against declining home prices. The provider (<b>protection</b> <b>seller)</b> of the contract will generally have a significant reserve in place and will also hedge their risk using housing futures from the CBOE Chicago Board Options Exchange & CME Chicago Board of Trade and other real estate short strategies to help mitigate losses. Some providers utilize reinsurance from A rated carriers to provide more durable secondary risk protection.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 1990 s, the {{surfacing}} of credit derivatives and collateralised debt obligations enlarged the range of instruments for transferring credit risk. Although the characteristics and purposes of the former are very similar to those of the latter, the tradability of the new instruments has resulted in the creation of true markets for credit risk transfer (CRT), which are very rapidly developing. CRT markets are of great interest as regards financial stability: while offering extended risk management opportunities for market participants, they also alter “traditional” relationships (between lenders and borrowers) as well as creating new types of relationships (lenders and credit <b>protection</b> <b>sellers).</b> The present review relies on existing theoretical and empirical work as well as on contacts with market practitioners to explore, from an analytical standpoint, the financial stability implications of all types of CRT instruments. In particular, it analyses the characteristics of differing CRT instruments in light of risk management and asymmetric information problems arising in financial markets. It also proposes possible avenues for further work. Four questions are successively raised: For what purposes are these products designed; why use one instrument rather than another? Who assesses credit risk: lenders, <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> or both? How are CRT instruments priced in practice: does pricing primarily reflect credit risk or does it also incorporate additional elements, such as counterparty, documentation or market risks? What are the potential macro-financial implications of CRT markets?...|$|R
