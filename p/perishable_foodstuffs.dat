50|$|Air cargo is very {{important}} for Greenland. Most <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuff</b> is imported from Denmark by air. It uses the Air Greenland Copenhagen-Kangerlussuaq passenger aircraft, and this is a reason why such a large aircraft is used. The air containers are then transported to the other airports by the small planes that can use the small runways. Some air cargo is transported by boat from Kangerlussuaq, but not in the winter when the Kangerlussuaq Fjord freezes (one of the reasons to build the Sisimiut-Kangerlussuaq road).|$|R

Royal Arctic Line organises freight ships, for example {{container}} ships, with regular sailings from Denmark. Arctic Umiaq Line runs a passenger ship which also carries freight. The distance from Denmark to Nuuk by ship is 3,800 kilometres (2,400 mi/2,000 nmi/4 days at 20 knot), so more <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuff</b> is imported by air.|$|R

The impact of modeling detail is also investigated by considering two lumped layers for the floor versus four layers. The time tset, which is initially about 1. 5 hours, increases by approximately 10 % when the concrete floor thickness is increased from 10 cm to 30 cm for typical initial conditions and desired chamber and specimen temperatures of 32. 5 °C and 7. 5 °C, respectively. The specimen insulation thickness has a significant impact-reducing the insulation U-factor from 1 to 0. 2 W/(m 2 K) reduces the time required tset by about 16 %...|$|R
40|$|Isothermal {{tanks are}} widely used for {{transport}} of <b>perishable</b> liquid <b>foodstuffs</b> like milk, wine, juice etc., {{and according to the}} international ATP Agreement, they have to be tested periodically in officially recognized national ATP Test Stations to ensure that they meet the specifications. The testing of a multicompartment isothermal tank presents special difficulties in comparison to the testing of a refrigerated truck {{because of the number of}} compartments that have to be measured. The instrumentation needed for testing a specimen in these cases is complex and that is why only a few ATP Test Stations can conduct such tests. In this study, a heat transfer numerical simulation is described of a multi-compartment isothermal tank for the transport of <b>perishable</b> liquid <b>foodstuffs</b> tested at a new environmental ATP chamber recently constructed at the Zografou Campus of the National Technical University in Athens. The tests were conducted according to the regulations specified in the United Nations ATP Agreement. A transient finite difference model is developed for a typical specimen multi-compartment isothermal tank tested inside an ATP Testing Chamber. To adjust the cooling or heating system, a PI controller is used. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements under real conditions and show good agreement. The study describes also a method for testing multi-compartment isothermal tanks according to the ATP specifications using only the measuring equipment normally existing in every ATP laboratory. With the proposed method, the testing of a three compartment liquid foodstuff tank is possible using only one heating capacity adjuster, e. g. one PI controller and one thyristor instead of the three independent PI controllers and three thyristors normally needed in order to adjust the required heating capacity inside each compartment.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} numerical investigation of ejection refrigeration system dedicated for short time storage of food products for local retail market, especially in rural areas. This work {{was sponsored by}} US Dept. of Agriculture under Phase I SBIR program. This novel method does not use electricity and is cleaner for the environment than other refrigeration techniques. One of the crucial problems of the retail market of <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuff</b> {{is a lack of}} efficient and appropriate refrigerated storage capacity. The existing technology in most cases uses conventional refrigeration systems that consume a large amount of electricity, they are expensive as well as use harmful working substances (usually artificial GHG gases that have high greenhouse warming potential in comparison with most of the natural substances). In addition, ensuring required storage conditions in terms of the stability of the product temperature and humidity may be a challenge for most of the existing short time storage refrigerators. Â Responding to these challenges we developed an ejector based refrigeration system that 1) utilizes solar or waste heat (below 100 C temperature) as a main source of energy, 2) eliminates the mechanical compressor, which is a main user of electricity and the main contributor to maintenance and reliability issues in cooling systems and 3) operates without any ozone depletion effects and any greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, when used with natural refrigerants. Until recently, ejector use in refrigeration systems was considered as controversial because most of the research conducted inÂ the past has yielded only theoretical results without visible, commercial products. The main issue was a relatively low value of coefficient of performance (COP) in comparison with classical compression systems. Selection of the working fluid for the refrigeration or air-conditioning system is the crucial problem because the system efficiency is strongly influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant. We found that the maximum efficiency can be achieved with natural refrigerants, of which isobutane {{is by far the most}} favorable. However, primarily due to its flammable nature, isobutane is not currently allowed in commercial systems in USA and Canada although it has been used for many years in all domestic refrigerators in Germany and other EU countries where appropriate safety precautions and regulations were developed. For US market, we identified two other environmentally friendly equivalents to isobutane: R 245 fa and R 1234 ze both with zero ozone depletion potential. The research described here had overcome another limitation - a lack of appropriate methods for the design of ejector geometry. Such methodology was developed and tested in a variety of thermodynamic cycles for cooling, heating and heat pumps. The test stand and the experimental results of investigation for isobutane as a working fluid along with CFD modelling results are shown and discussed in the paper in details. ...|$|R
50|$|The staple right can be {{compared}} to the market right (the right to hold a regular market) as being extremely important for the economic prosperity of the river cities that possessed the right, such as Leipzig, Mainz, or Cologne (where a Stapelhaus still stands as a reminder of the former right). At the same time it erected a strong barrier against long-distance trade due to the increased costs and the time required to unload and load ships especially as a river might have multiple staple-right cities in a row. This especially affected the transport of <b>perishable</b> goods like <b>foodstuffs,</b> though traders could often pay a fee to avoid having to display their wares, thus turning the staple right into a form of trade taxation, with similar, but less severe results.|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a fogou is no longer known. Their central {{location}} in settlements and the work that evidently went into constructing them is indicative of their importance to the community. It has been conjectured that they were used for religious purposes, as refuges, or for food storage. Many are oriented south-west-north-east, facing the prevailing wind. Their use as refuge during raiding trips was first suggested by Darvill in his book 'Prehistoric Britain' (London: Batsford. 1987, page 177). An argument was put forward by Kenneth L MacGregor; was that they mainly served as refuges since food storage is impractical due to the damp conditions and ritual use is unlikely because the Celtic Druid tradition focused more on the living world. Both documentary and archaeological evidence support their use as refuges. Nancy Edwards wrote that [...] "evidence would support this: creeps, hidden chambers and sally-ports, {{as well as the}} fact that most sonterrains were invisible above ground, would all have helped to provide protection in the case of sudden attack. They could, however, turn into death-traps if the aggression was prolonged." [...] Where they were open at both ends, a fogou could provide ideal conditions for food storage, especially the drying of meat or storage of dairy products such as milk, butter and cheese where natural moulds would assist in preservation of <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs.</b> Ashpits found at Trewardreva and in the circular side-chamber at Carn Euny were probably for preserving gulls' eggs, as was done on Saint Kilda in Scotland. A layer of black greasy mould with charcoal, animals and bird bones at Treveneague is also very suggestive of food storage. Diodorus Siculus stated that Iron Age people in Britain stored their grain in [...] "underground repositories", adding contemporary evidence [...] to the speculation that they were mainly used for food storage. Excavated examples at Halliggye, Carn Euny and Boden suggest fogous may have been deliberately filled after use or upon abandonment of the associated settlements.|$|E

40|$|The {{preservation}} of the cold chain {{is one of the}} most important requirements in order to maintain quality in the transport of <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs.</b> A significant part of the aggregate of the universally transported <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and more specific liquid foodstuffs like milk, wine, juice, etc. is carried out by multi-compartment isothermal tanks. According to the international ATP Agreement these special equipment used for international transport of <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> have to be tested periodically in officially recognized national ATP Test Stations to ensure that they meet the specifications. Because of the number of the compartments that have to be measured the testing of a multi-compartment isothermal tank presents special difficulties in comparison to the testing of a refrigerated truck. The instrumentation needed for testing a specimen in these cases is complex and that is why only few ATP Test Stations conduct such tests. In this study a heat transfer numerical simulation is described by a four compartment isothermal tank for the transport of perishable liquid foodstuffs tested inside an ATP chamber. The simulated tests were conducted according to the regulations specified in the United Nations ATP Agreement. A transient finite difference model is developed for a typical four compartment isothermal tank tested inside an ATP Testing Chamber with dimensions and specifications like that of the ATP chamber of the Zografou Campus of the National Technical University in Athens. For the control of the cooling/heating system a proportional-integral controller is employed. The study describes a method for measuring the k-coefficient of a four compartment isothermal tank according to ATP specifications using ordinary laboratory equipments. With the suggested method, the testing of a four compartment tank is possible using only one P-I controller and one thyristor instead of the normally needed four independent P-I controllers and four thyristors in order to adjust the heat power needed inside each compartment of the four compartment isothermal tank.

Using a transient finite difference model, a simulation is developed for a modern ATP test chamber and a typical specimen refrigerated vehicle to be tested. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements taken under real conditions by a data acquisition system and a refrigerated semitrailer as specimen. Proportional-integral control is employed for the regulation of the cooling and heating system. The impact of various parameters on the time required to reach the set-point temperature (is,,) is investigated and the energy consumption is simulated for a period of 22 h. In particular, the impact of specimen insulation thickness and the thickness of the chamber insulation floor are considered in detail. The total energy consumption increases by approximately 16 % when the concrete floor layer thickness is increased from 8 to 16 cm for typical initial conditions and desired chamber and specimen temperatures of 32. 5 and 7. 5 degreesC, respectively. Using a floor insulation of 6 cm extruded heavy strain-resistant polystyrene reduces the energy consumption by at least 13 %. Specimen insulation thickness increase from U-value of 0. 35 Wm(- 2) K to 0. 75 W m(- 2) K result to an increase in energy consumption by a percentage of 28 %. Thermal capacity, temperature of car body and specimen dimensions are also treated as variables that affect the total duration of an ATP test and its total energy consumption.

40|$|The {{investigation}} herein described {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} performance characteristics of the oscillating vane-type fan. The fan was the invention of Mr. Van Dorn and Mr. Cornwell, primarily for use in circulating air in railroad refrigerator cars. In the present system of railroad refrigeration for the transportation of <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> the refrigerator car is a heat insulated car, with bunkers at each end for the cakes of ice. When the car is loaded and the doors shut, cooling is obtained only due to the natural circulation of air in the car, caused by the difference in temperature between the ice in the bunker and the fruit. This circulation has not been found sufficient, in {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the top and bottom fruit (see Appendix B) and the top half is too warm, often spoiling during transportation. Also, because of this, the car cannot be filled to its volumetric capacity. Therefore the requirements which led to the invention of this type of fan were as follows: 1. To provide a sufficient volume of air, against the resistance developed in passing through the fruit, to obtain the cooling characteristics required. 2. To provide a fan which would not require major changes in the structural design of the car, or lessen the amount of fruit which could be carried. 3. To provide a fan, simple in construction and installation, and in its drive mechanism from the car axle. The oscillating vane-type fan met conditions 2 and 3 in that it could be situated in the four and one half inch space between the floor racks and the floor of the car, through which the air naturally circulated, and in that it could be driven by a simple wheel and crank drive directly off the axle.

The main accent is put on the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), which was negotiated by the contracting parties in Geneva, 19 May 1956 and which is the most important and comprehensive document in this branch of law. There is also mentioned the national law as a supportive source of law to be used for cases which are not covered by the CMR Convention as well as the Incoterms rules which are standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts. The third part analyzes the regulations with respect to the Czech Republic. It gives more details about the CMR Convention and its regulation of rights and liabilities of the contracting parties of the contract for the international carriage of goods by road and regulation of related documents. There are mentioned articles and provision of "Zákon o mezinárodním právu soukromém a procesním and Obchodní zákoník", which are applicable in the area of international carriage of goods and there is also referred to how the Incoterms influence logistics. The fourth part briefly describes other contract known by the Czech law and compares them with each other. There is also mentioned the current situation on the field of logistics and usage of individual contracts among the carriers and related contracting parties. The fifth part gives a brief overview of logistics from the international trade perspective. In conclusion there is a recapitulation of the above mentioned sources of law for the logistic area and it is stressed out, how important it is for the contracting parties of the contract for the international carriage of goods by road, mainly for the carrier, to be familiar with the regulations and to take account of them when negotiating the contract and choosing and training his employees...|$|E
40|$|African {{countries}} have recently experienced an extraordinary and largely unanticipated {{boom in the}} uptake of mobile phones, and increasing rates {{of access to the}} internet. This thesis investigates how and why these information and communication technologies (ICT) are being adopted for use in Tanzanian micro and small enterprises (MSEs), and explores the changes they are bringing about to the existing business culture of marginalised economies. The study covers three sub-sectors of the Tanzanian economy: <b>perishable</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> trading, the informal construction industry and the export of African blackwood carvings. The analysis is based on fieldwork undertaken over a total of 15 months in 2002 and 2003, during which time business networks were revealed by physically following entrepreneurs and their contacts operating in different locations throughout the country. Entrepreneurs were asked to draw their own comparisons between the traditional pre-ICT situation and the improved ICT access of today. The discussion is informed by the findings of semi-structured interviews with these individuals, excerpts of which are presented in the text to give voice to the entrepreneurs. Various ingenious and at times unconventional methods of access to, and appropriation of, ICT is uncovered. Together these suggest that official indicators underestimate the thirst for digital consumption, especially for mobile phones, and help explain the flourishing informal economy of handset acquisition. Internet penetration and uptake for use in business, on the other hand, is revealed to be far slower. Nevertheless, the research does reveal that a sizeable amount of poorer entrepreneurs are using a triumvirate of hired or shared ICT – mobile phones, the Internet and the ‘old’ ICT of fax – to create what can appear to be a more formal enterprise than it may actually be. The ‘mobile office’ effectively allows poorer entrepreneurs to operate without premises, thereby saving costs on rent and allowing the enterprise to remain informal. This heralds a considerable change in the working practices of a significant branch of informal sector operators who have gone unnoticed, and calls for a reconstruction and redefinition of this crucial source of entrepreneurship in developing economies. Despite the huge uptake of mobile phones in particular, the work also cautions that some traditional pre-ICT aspects of the African business culture look set to remain for some time. It becomes clear that where entrepreneurs do decide to use ICT, reputation and recommendation are still very significant. This information is usually passed on when an entrepreneur meets in person with contacts from his very fluid informal networks of knowledge. Trust, and the need for direct, personal interaction through face-to-face contact – one of the most pervasive features of African MSE economies – emerge as a common theme across the case study industries and are likely to remain a crucial aspect of the way most MSE business is conducted. Mobile phones are seen to {{play a crucial role in}} improving the exchange of supply-anddemand information domestically, while a combination of applications (particularly e-mail) appear to act as tools with which to refresh relationships with sources of market information outside the country. It is suggested that ICT may be able to help entrepreneurs in moving from the personal to the impersonal exchange – a challenge that many other African businesses will also have to come to terms with as the Internet becomes an ever more important global trading tool...|$|E
