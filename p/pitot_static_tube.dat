A laboratory setup with a cyclic flow of water was used. The flow cross section was divided into ten equal sections with nine verticals in between. <b>Pitot</b> <b>static</b> <b>tube</b> was used to measure static and stagnation pressure heads at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 point on the verticals. These measurements were conducted at a depth corresponding to 0. 1 h, 0. 2 h, 0. 4 h, 0. 6 h 0. 8 h and 0. 9 h from the free surface of the water in the canal. The different between stagnation head and static head was used to compute the local instantaneous velocity at each measured point. Three different discharges ware used 3. 5, 9. 5, and 11. 4 l/s. The results of the study reaffirms the non equal to unity of energy and momentum correction factors and that for regular canal the value of α range from 1. 10 to 1. 20 and β from 1. 03 to 1. 07. It is recommended that the energy and momentum correction factors be taken into consideration even for simple hydraulic analysis in open channel flow.

The goal of this project is to generate different types of atmospheric boundary layers for scale model testing in the UNH Flow Physics Facility (FPF).

The wall shear stress is a primary contribution to the drag force on streamline bodies, such as aircraft. By reducing this force airlines could save {{tens of billions of}} dollars per year. The wall shear stress measurement is also used to obtain the friction velocity, which is a scaling number needed in turbulence theory. The completion and validation of the drag plate will allow for future research in these areas of importance.

There is always a prevalent concern about lateral load resistance capacity of tie-down system of manufactured homes when subjected to windstorms. This study is performed {{to determine the effects}} of hurricane wind on manufactured homes foundations. Approach: A 1 : 120 th scale model of single wide manufactured home of size 14 ft by 80 ft was designed for the wind tunnel test. Proper instrumentations and simulations were considered to measure wind forces applied on the model. Sting balance and <b>Pitot</b> <b>static</b> <b>tube</b> were used to measure forces and air velocity during the wind tunnel test. Displacements of anchors were observed during the test. Results: The ultimate forces as well as the displacements of the anchors were determined at different angles of wind direction ranging from 30 - 180 °. Wind speed inside the tunnel was increased at the rate of 5 miles h - 1. Conclusion/Recommendations: Test result showed that auger anchors used to support lateral load are incapable to resist hurricane wind loads. It was found that anchors displaced 2 in. vertically and 4 in. horizontally at loads less than 4725 lb. Tested manufactured homes anchors experienced maximum force of 4087 lb when 45 miles h - 1 wind acted in transverse direction to the wall.

40|$|Because {{the large}} {{emission}} {{of gas and}} solid particles into the atmosphere, the volcanic eruptions represent {{one of the most}} important source of natural pollution. Among different gases (mainly H 2 O, CO 2, SO 2 and HCl), the volcanic clouds contain a mix of silicate-bearing ash particles in the size range 0. 1 μm to mm size or larger. Interest in determining the properties, movement and extent of volcanic ash clouds is an important scientific, economic, and public safety issue because the effects on environment, public health and aviation. In particular the problem to track in real time and forecast the volcanic cloud transport is the key task for the aviation safety problems and for the political decision making. Several encounters of en-route aircrafts with volcanic ash clouds have demonstrated the harming effects of ash particles on modern aircrafts (loss of power, failure of high-bypass turbine engines, abrasion of turbine blades, windscreens, fuselage, and <b>Pitot</b> <b>static</b> <b>tubes).</b> Alongside these considerations also the economical problem induced by an airport closure must be taken into account. Both security and economical requirements make essential a great effort to realize robust and affordable ash cloud detection and trajectory forecasting, combining remote sensing and modeling. In this work a quantitative comparison between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals of volcanic ash cloud mass and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) with the FALL 3 D ash dispersal model has been performed. MODIS, aboard the NASA-Terra and NASA-Aqua polar satellites is a multispectral instrument with 36 spectral bands in the wavelength range from Visible (VIS) to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) and spatial resolution varying between 250 and 1000 m at nadir.

40|$|Summary. Measurements on the {{centreline}} of {{a circular}} jet confirm {{the suggestion of}} Barat and Toomre that the error in static-tube reading due to turbulent fluctuations depends on {{the ratio of the}} size of the tube to the size of typical turbulent eddies.

40|$|Summary. An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} at the National Gas Turbine Establishment into the performance of turbines having high pressure ratios per stage. The present Report discusses the mode of operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines, and describes a cascade experiment. Both theory and experiment demonstrate that the conditions imposed upon the supersonic flow immediately downstream of the nozzles (e. g., by a following row of rotor blades) exert an overriding influence t~pon the nozzle outlet flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure ratio obtainable across the nozzle [...] providing that the axial component of velocity is subsonic. This is an important difference from the more familiar flow of subsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, the downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the nozzle blade shape and spacing. A suitable test technique using a closed-jet tunnel is demonstrated. The particular nozzles tested, of convergent-divergent form, had a straight-sided divergent portion of 16 deg total angle, a blade outlet angle of 76 deg (relative to axial direction) and a design Mach number of 2 -. The flow {{was found to be}} well behaved as regards shock pattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressure ratios tested [...] between 9 / 1 and 19 / 1. In particular the efficiency at the design pressure ratio of 16 - 6 / 1 was high, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses of <b>pitot</b> and <b>static</b> <b>tubes</b> being 0 - 98.

40|$|The {{force of}} wind {{on the ground}} created by {{turbulent}} eddies is commonly {{used to describe the}} horizontal flux of material during wind erosion. Here we present the Murdoch Turbulence Probe, an instrument for use in both clean and eroding flows which uses pressure differences to measure the three components of wind velocity. Correlation techniques calculate the forces near the ground and turbulence statistics in nearly real time, including turbulent velocity fluctuations from less than 0. 1 Hz to 200 Hz, mean flow velocities, Reynolds stresses as well as the integral length and time scales. In the portable wind-tunnel used by Agriculture Western Australia, turbulence statistics were recorded over stable surfaces and in blowing sand from the initiation of erosion up to the time the sand supply was exhausted. Estimates of the friction velocity derived from the turbulence probe were compared with estimates obtained from the wind speed profile measured with a rake of <b>pitot</b> and <b>static</b> <b>tubes.</b> The Murdoch Turbulence Probe appears to work well in sandblasting conditions. Relative turbulence intensities ranged from 0. 11 to 0. 2 and are in close agreement with values in the literature. The ratio of the turbulence to the friction velocity (3 to 3. 2) is at {{the high end of the}} reported range. The Reynolds stress measurements agree closely with predictions of the threshold friction velocities of the sand and estimates from the wind speed profile with a von Kármán constant of about 0. 3, lower than the commonly accepted value of 0. 4. We suggest that the wind-tunnel profile represents the 'outer layer' of the boundary-layer that may best be described by a 'Wake Law' or 'Defect Law'. At about 54 mm above the surface, the friction velocity decreases from 0. 64 m/s to 0. 39 m/s and the mean velocity increases from 9. 6 m/s to 11. 6 m/s as the supply of sand is depleted. In addition to the friction velocity, other scales may be necessary to characterise the overriding effect of the wind and in extending wind-tunnel results to the field...|$|R
