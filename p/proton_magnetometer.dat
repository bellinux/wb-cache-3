Excavations were next undertaken in 1960, by which time new technology meant non-invasive techniques such as magnetometery could be used alongside digging. About half the fort was surveyed using a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer.</b> Several features identified through this geophysical survey were partially excavated; {{they turned out to be}} storage pits and produced artefacts such as animal bones, quern stones for grinding, and various shards of Iron Age and Roman pottery. The entrance was also examined, and excavations revealed a cobbled surface leading into the fort as well as what may have been a guardhouse. More animal bone was found here as well as Iron Age and Roman pottery, and a brooch from the La Tène culture.|$|E
50|$|The caesium and {{potassium}} magnetometers are typically used where a higher performance magnetometer than the <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> is needed. In archaeology and geophysics, where the sensor sweeps through an area and many accurate magnetic field measurements are often needed, caesium {{and potassium}} magnetometers have advantages over the <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer,</b> {{also known}} as the proton {{precession}} magnetometer (PPM), uses the principle of Earth's field nuclear magnetic resonance (EFNMR) to measure very small variations in the Earth's magnetic field, allowing ferrous objects on land and at sea to be detected.|$|E
25|$|Various magnetometers use NMR {{effects to}} measure {{magnetic}} fields, including <b>proton</b> precession <b>magnetometers</b> (PPM) (also known as <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers),</b> and Overhauser magnetometers. See also Earth's field NMR.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Proton</b> {{precession}} <b>magnetometers</b> (PPM) or <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers,</b> {{which produce}} magnetic resonance in a known sample in {{the magnetic field}} to be measured, measure the sample's resonant frequency, then calculate and display the field strength.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proton</b> {{precession}} <b>magnetometers,</b> {{also known}} as <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers,</b> PPMs or simply mags, measure the resonance frequency of protons (hydrogen nuclei) in the magnetic field to be measured, due to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Because the precession frequency depends only on atomic constants {{and the strength of}} the ambient magnetic field, the accuracy of this type of magnetometer can reach 1 ppm.|$|R
50|$|Rex Cowan {{began his}} search for Hollandia in 1968, {{starting}} with Dutch and English archives and using advanced (for the time) equipment such as a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer,</b> finally locating the wreck on 16 September 1971. A large quantity of coins was recovered, as well as bronze cannons and mortars.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Bob Hawley and his sons, Greg and David, {{set out to}} {{find the}} Arabia. They used old maps and a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> to figure out the {{probable}} location, and finally discovered it half a mile (800 m) from the modern location of the river under 45 ft of silt and topsoil.|$|E
50|$|Two of the {{vehicles}} each carried several altimeters and a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer,</b> and traveled such that one led the other by 8 km.Every 8 km they paused for simultaneous readings of the altimeters and magnetometers; and for measurements of gravity, surface slope, and snow density, and for weather observations.The surface slope was measured by scanning the horizon with a theodolite and recording the azimuth and vertical angle of the highest and lowest points.Beginning with SPQMLT-2, the ice thickness was profiled en route with a new radio sounder.|$|E
40|$|Introducing late <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers,</b> it was {{necessary}} to determine their quality and instrument calibration. Therefore, both magnetometers were measuring daily variation during the eight hours. Obtained results were compared and differences follow normal distribution curve (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
30|$|Observing conditions, such as {{a change}} in {{temperature}} and the tilt of the magnetometers, are the most plausible causes of annual variations, but cannot fully explain the observed annual variations. The annual variations shown in Fig. 2 are already corrected using tiltmeters installed in the sensors of the magnetometers, and are out of phase with the temperature variation of the magnetometers. Furthermore, differences in total geomagnetic intensities, obtained with three <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers</b> installed at different locations within MMB, show annual variations with amplitudes of ~ 1 nT (Nishimura et al., 2012). As observations with <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers</b> {{are not likely to}} be largely affected by observing conditions, the observed annual variations can be considered to be actual geomagnetic variations.|$|R
30|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{features}} of modulus magnetic field measurements by means of <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers.</b> Inertial characteristics of the magnetometers and dynamic errors of variable magnetic field measurements are discussed. Three basic magnetometers averaging algorithms, processing zero crossing times of free precession, are compared. Theoretical and some numerical estimations of the algorithms work are presented for the linear, square and harmonic variations of magnetic field.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 Glenn A. Black and Eli Lilly, {{following}} {{the work of}} M. J. Aitken and his associates at the Oxford University (UK) Archaeometric Laboratory, used proton magnetometers to locate and map buried archaeological features, including iron objects in the soil, thermoremanent magnetization of fired clays, and differences in the magnetic susceptibility of disturbed soils. During 1961 - 1963, they surveyed more than 100000 sq ft of the Angel Mounds State Historic Site in Indiana and excavated more than 7000 sq ft to match anomalous magnetometer readings with the archaeological features that produced them. This was the first systematic use of a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> for archaeological research in North America.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1994 Paul Forsythe Johnston of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History {{applied for}} the first {{underwater}} archaeological permits issued {{by the state of}} Hawaii to find and investigate the wreckage. Johnston was formerly a curator of the Peabody Museum. Permits were finally secured, Richard W. Rogers (known as [...] "Captain Rick") volunteered his research vessel Pilialoha outfitted with a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer,</b> and in July 1995 the search began.The first season turned up mostly trash that had washed down the river that emptied into the bay. After several years of work, the ship remains were finally located, carefully excavated, and many artifacts were recovered. A section of the stern was uncovered, documented, and re-buried.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellite}} {{was launched}} from the Eastern Test Range into a geocentric orbit. The {{objectives of the}} flight were to measure the Earth's magnetic field, the solar X-ray radiation {{and its effects on}} the Earth's atmosphere, and the near-Earth micrometeoroid environment. Instrumentation included a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer,</b> X-ray ionization chambers, and various micrometeoroid detectors. The spacecraft was a 50.8-cm-diameter magnesium sphere. The magnetometer was housed in a glass fiber phenolic resin conical tube attached to the sphere. Data transmission stopped on December 11, 1959, after 84 days of operation. The data obtained provided a comprehensive survey of the Earth's magnetic field over the area covered, defined the lower edge of the Van Allen radiation belt, and provided a count of micrometeoroid impacts. Vanguard 3 has an expected orbital lifetime of 300 years.|$|E
40|$|Daily {{variation}} in Earth's magnetic field is changed {{during the time}} of the day and according to Earth's latitude and lengthwise. Due to great sensitivity of new <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers</b> there is a question how daily variation vary according to distance from the base. To solve this problem, simultaneously was surveyed daily variation on the base and on the points which were on different distances from the base point (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
5000|$|The proton's {{gyromagnetic ratio}}, symbol γp, is [...] rad·s−1·T−1.

50|$|Dowsing in psychic {{archaeology}} {{can take}} on many forms. One of the better publicized methods {{and the subject of}} psychic archaeologist Karen Hunt’s 1981 masters thesis at Indiana University involves dowsing for Electromagnetic Photo-Fields (EMPF) using two L-shaped Ferrous coat hangers bent about 17.8 cm from the end as electromagnetic photo sensors. Hunt stated that the electromagnetic photo sensors detect EMPF similar to a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> detecting magnetic fields. Crossed dowsing rods indicated the crossing of an EMPF, which are said to be three-dimensional patterns generated by man-made objects left in place for at least six-months.There are other methods of dowsing employed in psychic archaeology with less inherent scientism than EMPF. Often conventional dowsers will offer their services to archaeologist with varying explanation for their methods.Straddling the border of dowsing and channeling is a technique known as map dowsing, in which a medium or psychic dangles a pendulum over a map of the area of a potential dig to divine ideal locations for test pits or excavation.|$|E

50|$|Preliminary {{excavations}} at {{the beginning}} of January 1961 began near a remote valley named Taruga near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of wrought iron, a quantity of iron slag, fragments of tuyere, pottery, figurine fragments, red ocher, quartz hammer-stones, and small concentrations of charcoal. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with diced patterns to produce a sharp abrasive surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of slag and nine of them contained in situ structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the Iron Age.|$|E

40|$|Results of <b>proton</b> {{precession}} <b>magnetometer</b> observations over Nagano Prefecture {{are reported}} {{for a period}} from September to November 1966. After the sudden changes {{at the beginning of}} August, 1966, the total geomagnetic intensity at Hoshina and Matsushiro shows considerably different variations towards the end of October. No significant changes were observed at other array stations during the period concerned. The fifth dip survey was carried out over the Matsushiro area, but the poor accuracy of the present survey prevented the finding of something new to supplement the <b>proton</b> precession <b>magnetometer</b> observations. 松代を中心とした群発地震は 1966 年 8 月に至つて,いわゆる第三の活動期と呼ばれる新たな高まりを示し,同年 9 月末頃まで続いた. 特に注目されるのは皆神山を中心とした異常な地形変動でありその規模は 4 月の活動期に比べ,格段に大きい. 北信地域に設置されたプロトン磁力計網によつて,われわれはこの第三の活動期に伴なう地磁気変化を検出することができた...|$|R
50|$|Leach's strong {{commitment}} to archaeological science and archaeometry was fostered during his undergraduate years by early correspondence with, and encouragement from, Martin Aitken FRS of the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in Oxford. Under Aitken's instruction and guidance he built a <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> as a class project in 1965. He later spent two sabbatical years as a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Laboratory and as a Royal Society (Great Britain) Anglo-Australasian Visiting Fellow, in 1976 and 1983. He organised the first Archaeometry Conference outside the United Kingdom in 1980 in Christchurch. His first hand experience with the scientific facilities relating to archaeology at both Oxford and Bradford Universities persuaded him that something {{needed to be done}} to take the existing archaeological facilities in New Zealand out of the stone age. As a result, one of Leach's most notable, and perhaps now least recognised, contribution to archaeology was his development of the archaeological laboratories at Otago University. In 1968, an old army shed served the archaeologists as a laboratory. After moving to progressively larger buildings in 1972 and 1973, the archaeologists were finally allocated adequate space in the new building that was then to be called the Hocken Building. Leach helped develop the plan for the then state-of-the-art laboratories, including proper facilities for obtaining and displaying a comparative osteological collection, an archaeological conservation facility, and finally a laboratory devoted to archaeometry.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} and stability of the frequency measurement of <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> precession signal, most of existed methods had been taken. However, many of them may be much better if they had considered the signal detection in a dynamic measurement and strong noisy environment. So a new method based on SCW-controller (Superposition-correlation and Wavlet Controller) is proposed in this study. It focuses on discussing the mathematical model of <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> precession signal, describing the design of SCW-controller, then the <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> precession signal is processed both in this new ways, and the performance parameters such as SNR and RMSE are calculated.

40|$|The Research Group for <b>Proton</b> <b>Magnetometer</b> {{designed}} and constructed a nuclear precession magnetometer for station-use {{as has been}} already reported in this bulletin. Since April, 1959, the magnetometer has been installed at Oshima Geophysical Observatory {{in the hope of}} detecting changes in the earth's magnetic field related to volcanic activities. It is approximately proved that averages of the observations made there four times every 20 minutes may represent the hourly smoothed value. By comparing them with those at Kakioka Magnetic Observatory, influences of magnetic storms, daily variations, general secular variations and such like may be eliminated. The activity of the Research Group is still continuing.

30|$|Scalar <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometers,</b> whose sensors are {{insensitive}} to their azimuthal position, ensured the necessary {{accuracy of measurement}} of magnetic gradients {{with the use of}} rope systems. Deviations from the vertical line of the 6  km measuring base of the gradiometer, caused by possible disturbances in the carrying airflow attaining 1500  m (hodograph), were obtained experimentally. The method of correcting these deviations (based on the data of GPS receivers and the analytical model of the main geomagnetic field) is described in Tsvetkov et al. (2007 b). Taking into account the height of balloon magnetic survey (30  km), only large regional structures can be reflected in the resulting anomalous magnetic field.|$|R

The electromagnetic induction allows measuring both the apparent magnetic susceptibility in part per thousand (ppt) and the apparent electrical conductivity in millisiemens (mS/m). A <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> measures the total magnetic intensity in nanotesla (nT), caused by the induced and remanent magnetisations.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} preliminary {{measurements of}} the Earth magnetic field made at the future geomagnetic observatory in Slovenia located {{at the bottom of}} the mountain peak Sinji Vrh above the town of Ajdovščina. Operation of the <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> has been verified for longer periods. This instrument is used to indicate the absolute value of the geomagnetic-field vector. These measurements provide the basis for continuous three-axis measurements of changes in the geomagnetic field as well as for evenly distributed, recurrent absolute measurements. Measuring results of the preliminary {{measurements of the}} absolute values of changes in the geomagnetic-field vector were treated as signals. The basic geophysical explanations were added to the results of data processing. Conclusions drawn from the preliminary measurements will be used for the future measuring equipment of the observatory necessary for its formal operational licensing and for its integration with the international information network.

30|$|The older dataset of {{magnetic}} measurements used {{here is the}} total intensity F measured {{by means of a}} <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> around 1990.0 by the former Geophysical Enterprise of Tirana and covers all Albanian territory with an array of 28 sites (Duka and Bushati, 1991). In September 1994 (epoch 1994.75), in the framework of a joint project between the CGG, PDTU and the former ING a new vector magnetic survey measuring F, inclination I and declination D (Chiappini et al., 1997, 1999) covered the Albanian territory. The measurements were taken by using a Geometrics <b>proton</b> <b>magnetometer</b> and a Bartington fluxgate theodolite, together with a gyro-theodolite for the absolute determination of the geographical azimuth. In August 2003 (epoch 2003.6; Duka et al., 2004) another scalar field campaign was conducted for the total intensity F only using an Overhauser effect magnetometer, repeating the scalar measurements at 10 of the 28 sites of the previous F survey. At each site data were recorded for 1 – 2 hours in order to obtain a satisfactory accumulation of total intensity data.|$|E
50|$|The Overhauser effect {{magnetometer}} or Overhauser magnetometer {{uses the}} same fundamental effect as the <b>proton</b> precession <b>magnetometer</b> to take measurements. By adding free radicals to the measurement fluid, the nuclear Overhauser effect can be exploited to significantly improve upon the <b>proton</b> precession <b>magnetometer.</b> Rather than aligning the protons using a solenoid, a low power radio-frequency field is used to align (polarise) the electron spin of the free radicals, which then couples to the protons via the Overhauser effect. This has two main advantages: driving the RF field takes {{a fraction of the}} energy (allowing lighter-weight batteries for portable units), and faster sampling as the electron-proton coupling can happen even as measurements are being taken. An Overhauser magnetometer produces readings with a 0.01 nT to 0.02 nT standard deviation while sampling once per second.|$|R
