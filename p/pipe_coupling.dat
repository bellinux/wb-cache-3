40|$|Abstract – Deep {{plans are}} a common {{practice}} in middle and high-rise office building design, and large open plans have become the preferred office layout by modern businesses due to {{the flexibility of the}} space and economic benefits achieved from maximum plot to gross floor area ratios. Consequently, the deep core areas of these buildings cannot be naturally illuminated by side windows, and depend entirely on electricity for illumination. This paper describes the benefits of daylight piping technologies; in particular, hollow mirrored light <b>pipes</b> <b>coupled</b> with laser cut panel collectors to enhance natural illumination of deep plan office buildings. Light pipes are assessed by testing two scale models of buildings, one with horizontal and the other with vertical light pipes as daylight devices. Testing was carried out under sunny sky conditions and an artificial sky that closely simulates the CIE overcast sky.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the problem}} of {{environmental}} pollution and energy shortage is becoming increasingly serious, researches on electric vehicle (EV) are {{getting more and more}} attention. As an important energy source of EV, the working status of power battery will affect the performance of the vehicle. The performance and lifespan of battery is tied up with its temperature distribution. In this paper, experiment bench is established to study the impact of heat pipe on the temperature distribution in the battery pack. As to the experiment bench, ten electric heating plates are used to imitate the power batteries in the pack, and the heat of battery pack is soaked up by the composite phase change materials (PCM) of paraffin and graphite, and the heat is transferred outside by four heat pipes. The research shows that it has positive cooling effect on the battery pack to adopt PCM-heat <b>pipe</b> <b>coupled</b> system, which can basically ensure the battery is operating within the best temperature range. Compared with the pure PCM system, the using of heat pipes can reduce the temperature rise of the battery up to 10 °C.

In the rotating turbulent pipe flow, {{it is found that}} the tendency towards a relaminarized flow appears and the axial velocity fluctuation is suppressed; however, the azimuthal fluctuation is enhanced due to the presence of the pipe wall rotation. The joint probability density function (joint PDF) of the velocity fluctuations and the probability density function (PDF) of the helicity fluctuation are analyzed in detail. It is revealed that the resolved Reynolds stress and helicity fluctuation in the wall region are closely related to the correlation between the velocity and vorticity fluctuations and affected significantly by the rotation-induced azimuthal mean flow. Further, the budgets of resolved Reynolds stresses indicate that the rotation effect is responsible for the more active turbulent energy redistribution and the production of the azimuthal turbulence fluctuation. The near-wall inclined streaky structures with respect to the axial direction are ascribed to the spiral motion of the fluid induced by the rotating pipe. The turbulence characteristics revealed in this study are of great help for the understanding of physical fundamentals in the rotating turbulent flows and for the development of reliable turbulence model...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} light is very {{beneficial}} in office buildings because energy consumption can be reduced, and working conditions can be enhanced, which positively affect workers' health and productivity. However, bringing natural light into deep plan office buildings is not possible with simple windows or skylights, and light transport systems are necessary to bring natural light into the deep cores of buildings. Light transport systems usually need sun-tracking devices to collect natural light that are complicated, expensive and require continual maintenance. Mirrored light <b>pipes</b> <b>coupled</b> with laser cut panels (LCP) are a passive and simpler daylight transport solution and {{are the focus of}} this PhD research. The primary aim has been to improve the technology and achieve the most efficient passive solution possible through the interactive use of theoretical modelling, experimental measurements and case studies. Applications of this technology were investigated in two case studies: 1) as horizontal light pipes for daylight illumination of a high rise building proposal in the tropics; and 2) as vertical light pipes for daylight illumination of a middle-rise deep plan building proposal in a subtropical environment. In both cases, quantitative system performance under best (clear sunny sky) and worst (overcast) case scenarios was undertaken via scale model testing and mathematical modelling. The major conclusion for both case studies was that mirrored light <b>pipe</b> technologies, when <b>coupled</b> with LCP, were effective in introducing sufficient ambient light levels inside buildings and over distances > 20 m from the façade or roof. Average lux levels achieved in the space were 150 to 350 lux for the horizontal light pipes and 50 to 300 lux for vertical light pipes. However, as a passive solution, this technology has two major limitations: 1) the dependence on sun azimuth and elevation angles, which result in variations in illuminance levels during the day and the year; and potentially 2) pipe size, as pipes with a large diameter (e. g. 2 m in diameter for 20 m long pipes) are required for optimal performance, such that the large pipes may limit integration in building design. Two other solutions were assessed to circumvent these limitations to the mirrored light pipe technology: 1) a passive collector that concentrate natural light by using a fluorescent panel {{to reduce the size of}} the pipe, and 2) an active collector comprising a LCP rotating 360 degrees in a 24 hour cycle to reduce system dependence on sun azimuth and elevation angles. The low light-to-light efficiency of the fluorescent panels made them inappropriate for collecting sufficient amounts of daylight necessary for daylighting of large buildings. In contrast, the rotating LCP is a very simple active system that by rotating constantly at 15 degrees per hour, reduces the deviation angle between the panel orientation and sun azimuth angle, and significantly increased the system performance. The performance was generally better (e. g. 2. 5 times better for light collection under low sun elevation angles) than the passive light pipe system with fixed LCP. However, active systems raise other issues in terms of cost-benefit in constructing, operating and maintaining such systems. Passive mirrored light <b>pipes</b> <b>coupled</b> with LCPs or simple active systems with rotating LCPs have great potential as daylight solutions for deep plan buildings as they can contribute to lowering overall energy consumption, improve workplace health and become an architectural design element. Research is still required on the implementation of the technology into buildings, but the growing trend towards 'green buildings', sustainable design and government regulations or building codes will require more daylighting use in buildings, and will motivate designers to increasingly consider and incorporate such daylighting strategies into future building designs...|$|R

It is also called ``bumping`` when non-uniformly heated water or a chemical suddenly boils in laboratory glassware. In engineering, the stability and predictability has importance to the onset of bulk boiling in a natural and forced circulation loops.

We illustrate the equivalence of the onset of geysering to the onset of static instability in subcooled boiling. We also derive the stability boundary for geysering, utilizing turbulent transport analysis {{to determine the effects of}} pressure and other key parameters. This new result explains the greater stability region observed at higher pressures. The paper builds on the 30 years of quite independent thermal hydraulic work that is still fresh and useful today.

One such small reactor design consists of a fast spectrum reactor cooled with an array of in-core alkali metal heat <b>pipes</b> <b>coupled</b> to thermoelectric or Stirling power conversion systems. Heat pipes advantageous attributes include a simplistic design, lack of moving parts, and well understood behavior. Concerns over reactor transients induced by heat pipe instability as a function of extreme thermal transients require experimental investigations. One particular concern is rapid cooling of the heat pipe condenser that would propagate to cool the evaporator. Rapid cooling of the reactor core beyond acceptable design limits could possibly induce unintended reactor control issues. This paper discusses a series of experimental demonstrations where a heat pipe operating at near prototypic conditions experienced rapid cooling of the condenser. The condenser section of a stainless steel sodium heat pipe was enclosed within a heat exchanger. The heat pipe - heat exchanger assembly was housed within a vacuum chamber held at a pressure of 50 Torr of helium. The heat pipe was brought to steady state operating conditions using graphite resistance heaters then cooled by a high flow of gaseous nitrogen through the heat exchanger. Subsequent thermal transient behavior was characterized by performing an energy balance using temperature, pressure and flow rate data obtained throughout the tests. Results indicate the degree of temperature change that results from a rapid cooling scenario will not significantly influence thermal stability of an operating heat pipe, even under extreme condenser cooling conditions...|$|R
