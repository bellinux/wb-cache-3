5|$|Being {{popular in}} Australia with players {{as well as}} the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936. He was on the point of {{accepting}} a <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–48) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.|$|E

In 1795, and again in 1796, he held the chief command of an army temporarily, but declined a <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> as commander-in-chief. On 13 October 1795 he fought a brilliant rearguard action at the bridge of Neuwied, and in the offensive campaign of 1796 he served as Jourdan's most active and successful lieutenant.|$|E

25|$|A police {{employee}} {{becomes a}} constable by swearing the oath under s 22 of the New Zealand Policing Act 2008.

A recently graduated constable is considered a Probationary Constable for up to two years, until he or she has passed ten workplace assessment standards.

25|$|Cooke is {{supposed}} to have been the son of a tanner and to have been brought up in the household of Sir Edmund Brudenell, an ardent genealogist. Cooke matriculated as a pensioner in St. John's College, Cambridge, 10 November 1553, earning his BA there in 1557–8. He was appointed Rose Blanche pursuivant extraordinary, 25 January 1561–2 and succeeded William Flower as Chester Herald of Arms four days later. Both events were recorded in the diary of Henry Machyn, who twice identified Cooke as the servant of Lord Robert Dudley. Cooke was promoted to Clarenceux King of Arms on 21 May 1567. Cooke was appointed Acting Garter King of Arms on the death of Sir Gilbert Dethick on 3 October 1584, and served in that capacity until the <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> of Sir Gilbert's son William Dethick on 21 April 1586.

That result was enough to convince the Yeovil board to appoint manager Steve Thompson on a permanent basis. Thompson celebrated his <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> with a 1–0 victory over league leaders Swansea City, a result which saw Yeovil rise to eighth in the table. On 10 October, Yeovil appointed former Plymouth Argyle manager Kevin Hodges as their new assistant manager to work with Steve Thompson. Yeovil then faced two away matches recording a goalless draw against Gillingham, before losing 2–0 to Leyton Orient {{in the first round}} of the Football League Trophy. The Gillingham match saw midfielder Darren Way suffer a fractured cheekbone and eye socket that ruled him out for four weeks. On 20 October, Yeovil confirmed Andy Lindegaard had extended his loan at Crawley Town for another month. On 22 October, Yeovil recorded an impressive a 3–0 win against Nottingham Forest, with Jevons scoring a brace. On 24 October, the club confirmed the departure of Uruguay Alejandro Meloño after his contract terminated by mutual consent having only started two matches. Yeovil ended the month losing 3–2 away at Colchester United.|$|E

500|$|In ca. 959/961, he {{defeated}} a raid by the Magyars into Thrace, taking {{many of them}} prisoner.

It is unclear, however, whether this means a <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> or was an ad hoc position, i.e. as strategos of Macedonia and temporary overall commander of detachments from the other European themes. The latter is more likely, as it is documented that Leo Phokas the Younger held the post of Domestic of the West, but was fighting against the Arabs in the east at the time.|$|E
500|$|Having {{left the}} conservatoire, Offenbach was {{free from the}} stern academicism of Cherubini's curriculum, but as the biographer James Harding writes, [...] "he was free, also, to starve." [...] He secured a few {{temporary}} jobs in theatre orchestras before gaining a <b>permanent</b> <b>appointment</b> in 1835 as a cellist at the Opéra-Comique. He was no more serious there {{than he had been}} at the conservatoire, and regularly had his pay docked for playing pranks during performances; on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues' music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance. Nevertheless, his earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Halévy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that the young man {{was going to be a}} great composer. Some of Offenbach's early compositions were programmed by the fashionable conductor Louis Antoine Jullien. Offenbach and another young composer Friedrich von Flotow collaborated on a series of works for cello and piano. Although Offenbach's ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entrée to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris.|$|E

Card has worked closely with colleagues to develop ways to educate aspiring writers and has published two books on the subject. He was eager for the opportunity to apply these techniques in a university environment—his assorted workshops did not allow the follow-through he desired.

Specific measures were enacted that prohibited child labor and night-shift work for women, that regulated the hours of the working week and the Sunday holiday, and allowed for labor organizations. Venizelos also took measures for the improvement of management, justice and security and for the settlement of the landless peasants of Thessaly.|$|E
