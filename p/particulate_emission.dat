25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} <b>particulate</b> <b>emission,</b> so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|E

This meant that the SO3 conditioning equipment {{did not need to}} be operated as frequently to maintain the allowed level of <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> This was beneficial as SO3 is hazardous.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} in a high-pressure common-rail diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-diesel blends (the volume ratio of biodiesel is 20 %). Influences of post-injection parameters on gaseous and <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> are studied. The results show that post injection timing has greater influence on <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> of biodiesel engine in comparison with post injection quantity. With the delay of post injection timing, NOX emissions firstly reduce and then increase and again slightly reduce, while <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> initially increase and then decrease and again soar, indicating a trade-off relationship. With the increase of post injection quantity, NOX emissions hardly change except at the low engine load, while <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> increase in general. In order to improve the emission performance comprehensively, the injection parameters have to be recalibrated and split injection strategy has to be reformulated when the diesel engine is fueled with biodiesel blends...|$|R

40|$|<b>Particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> from {{diesel engines}} {{have been a}} key issue for diesel engine {{developers}} in recent decades. Their work has succeeded in reducing the exhaust particles from the combustion of fuel, {{which has led to}} increasing interest in the contribution of particulates from lubrication oil. When discussing oil-related <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions,</b> hydrocarbon particles are customarily referred to. This thesis uses a broader definition, in which oil-related <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> are modelled not only by the hydrocarbons, but also include the ash, carbons, and sulphate oil <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> The model developed in the project uses input data as oil consumption and oil ash content combined with tuning parameters, such as the oil ash transfer rate (ash emissions divided by oil consumption and oil ash content). Controlled engine tests have been performed to verify assumptions and fill knowledge gaps. The model can be applied to a variety of diesel engines, although the tuning factors might have to be reset. For example, introducing diesel particulate filters would dramatically reduce the oil ash emissions, since oil ash would accumulate in the filter. Oil consumption has {{played a central role in}} the present research. The modelling results indicate that special attention should be paid to oil consumption under running conditions with a low in-cylinder temperature, since the oil survival rate is high there. Under low-load and motoring conditions, hydrocarbons proved to be the main contributor to oil-related <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> At high engine load, oil ash emissions were the largest contributor to oil-related <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> QC 2010110...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantification}} of <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> from mineral handling is {{an important}} problem for the quantification of global emissions on industrial sites. Mineral <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading {{is an important}} process contributing to mineral <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> accurately under weak wind conditions. At low <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> the models overestimated, and at high <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> the models underestimated emission factors. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to evaluate the <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emission</b> factors for the mineral loading process. A new approach based on the mathematical form of a logistical function was developed and tested. It provided a realistic depiction of the <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> during the mineral loading process, accounting for fractions of fine mineral particles, dropping height, and wind velocity.

The ESP removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20 µm from the flue gas.

These can replace the ESP when particulate emissions are the only concern.|$|E
5000|$|Organic {{molecular}} tracers, {{also referred}} to as organic molecular markers, are compounds or compound classes of interest in the field of air quality because they can help identify <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> sources, as they are relatively unique to those sources. This approach is generally applied to particulate matter under 2.5μm in diameter because of the formation mechanisms and the health risks associated with this size regime. [...] With tracer compounds, the principles of mass balance are used to 'trace' emissions from the source to the receptor site where a sample is taken. Use of organic tracers has become more common as measurement quality has improved, costs have decreased, and compounds that were historically good tracers, such as lead, have decreased in ambient concentrations due to various factors including government regulation.|$|E

50|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} {{relatively high}} levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting largely of elemental carbon. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90 percent of the soluble organic fraction, so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). Historically, a DPF consists of a cordierite or silicon carbide substrate with a geometry that forces the exhaust flow through the substrate walls, leaving behind trapped soot particles. Contemporary DPFs can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} rare metals that provide superior performance (at a greater expense). As the amount of soot trapped on the DPF increases, so does the back pressure in the exhaust system. Periodic regenerations (high temperature excursions) are required to initiate combustion of the trapped soot and thereby reducing the exhaust back pressure. The amount of soot loaded on the DPF prior to regeneration may also be limited to prevent extreme exotherms from damaging the trap during regeneration. In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007. During the re-generation cycle, most systems require the engine to consume more fuel in a relatively short amount of time in order to generate the high temperatures necessary for the cycle to complete. This adversely affects the overall fuel economy of vehicles equipped with DPF systems, especially in vehicles that are driven mostly in city conditions where frequent acceleration requires a larger amount of fuel to be burned and therefore more soot to collect in the exhaust system.|$|E

40|$|A {{study to}} {{investigate}} the <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> from a boiler of a palm oil mill plant equipped with a multi-cyclones particulate arrestor was performed and reported in this paper. The <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> concentration was measured at the outlet of an 8000 kg steam/h capacity water-tube typed boiler of a palm oil mill plant processing 27000 kg/h of fresh fruit bunch (FFB). The particulate sample was collected iso-kinetically using the USEPA method 5 sampling train through a sampling port made at the duct of the exiting flue gas between the boiler and a multi-cyclones unit. The {{results showed that the}} <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> rates exiting the boiler varied from 8. 51 g/s to 126 g/s with an average of 44. 3 ± 31. 6 g/s. In terms of concentration, the average <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> concentration exiting the boiler was 7. 75 ± 4. 71 g/Nm 3 (corrected to 7 % oxygen concentration), ranging from 1. 50 to 17. 7 g/Nm 3 (@ 7 % O 2) of the flue gas during the measurement. Based on the 27000 kg/h FFB processed, 6000 kg/h fiber and shell (F&S) burned and the capacity of the boiler of 8000 kg steam/h, the calculated <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> factor was 5. 91 ± 4. 21 g particulate/kg FFB processed, 26. 6 ± 18. 9 g particulate/kg F&S burned and 19. 9 ± 14. 2 g particulate/kg boiler capacity, respectively. Based on the finding, in order to comply with the emission limits of 0. 4 g/Nm 3, the required collection efficiency of any given particulate pollution control system to consider for the mill will be between 73 and 98 %, which is not easily achievable with the existing multi-cyclones unit...|$|E
40|$|New {{regulations}} in the United States and Europe, {{designed to address}} climate change concerns by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are causing increased use of gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engines in light-duty vehicles (LDV). Separate new regulations that aim to reduce <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> to address air pollution concerns are taking effect concurrent with greenhouse gas limitations in both jurisdictions. GDI engines are proven to create more <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> than previously utilized port-injection technology. Increasing <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> rates combined with falling regulatory <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> limits requires new strategies to reduce these emissions from gasoline powered LDVs. Particulate filters have been successfully implemented to reduce <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> from diesel engine exhaust for over a decade. Diesel particulate filters have a demonstrated filtration efficiency of 95 % or greater and have reduced diesel <b>particulate</b> mass (PM) <b>emissions</b> by one to two orders of magnitude. GDI engines require {{no more than one}} order of magnitude reduction in <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> to meet new regulations. Existing particulate filter technology in use in diesel vehicles is capable of reducing GDI engine emissions to new regulatory levels; however, it is proposed that these reduction may be achievable through means other than gasoline particulate filters (GPF). A GPF will create an additional back-pressure in the engine exhaust system that will reduce engine power and efficiency. This backpressure will increase as PM is trapped in the filter and decrease as combustible PM removed. A buildup of incombustible ash present in engine-out PM will increase the baseline backpressure of the filter during the course of its service life. It is important to understand the impact of ash on the filter pressure drop performance before implementing GPF to meet new emissions regulations. This study builds on existing diesel particulate filter technology and demonstrates through experimental results the mechanisms by which ash increases GPF pressure drop. Ash deposits are also shown to increase the light-off temperature of three-way catalyst coatings in GPF. by Nicholas C. Custer. Thesis: S. M. in Mechanical Engineering, and S.
