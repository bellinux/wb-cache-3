Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology. One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and <b>poly(ethyleneimine)</b> (PEI). The neurotrophic factors used were epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against nestin, β-tubulin III, and GFAP, which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively. The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.|$|E

Results <b>Polyethyleneimine</b> compared favorably to traditional attachment factors such as collagen and polylysine. PC- 12 and HEK- 293 cells plated on dishes coated with <b>polyethyleneimine</b> showed a homogeneous distribution of cells in the plate, demonstrating strong cell adhesion that survived washing procedures.

Based on these results, benzyl viologen led to the greatest responses, and 0 · 8 -kDa branched PEI (BPEI) was the least toxic of the PEIs tested and, therefore, both were selected for the subsequent tests.

Several strategies have been exploited to prepare AuNCs of different “magic number” sizes, using different templates e. g. dendrimers, <b>polyethyleneimines,</b> peptides, and more recently, proteins. Notwithstanding, almost all bio-template-protected AuNCs reported so far exhibit fairly low fluorescence quantum yields (QYs), typically < 5 %, which {{is especially true for}} AuNCs prepared using the protein templates. In this paper, we report a facile, one-pot aqueous synthesis of highly fluorescent AuNCs using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase-A) as the bio-template.

Processes to precipitate metals in the presence of complexing agents such as insoluble starch xanthate (ISX), ferrous sulfate, cellulose xanthate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium borohydride have been developed. All of these processes use expensive chemical precipitants, which convert the metal to a sludge, requiring dewatering and discarding. We now have developed a process employing ion exchange resins to remove heavy metals from wastewaters in the presence of complexers or chelators (US. Patent No. 4, 303, 704). The process has the simplicity, convenience, and the low cost enjoyed by the water softening processes, and we expect it to receive wide acceptance in the plating and surface finishing fields. This development has been delayed because these specialty resins have only recently been available fpr industrial use. It seemed to reason that a resin with chelating groups would prefer heavy metals to sodium or a chelator.

Chapter 2 focuses on liposomal delivery vehicles containing hydrophobic nanoparticles in their bilayers, which encapsulate the nucleic acid based drugs and promote endosomal escape by nanoparticle induced fusion with the endosomal membranes. Specifically we use metal nanoparticles in specialized liposomes for the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA).

40|$|In {{order to}} develop filled polymer {{composites}} and blends from sustainable resources, the primary objective {{that needs to be}} considered {{is the nature of the}} interface between the natural filler and the polymer matrix. A fundamental understanding of filler-filler interactions and the filler-matrix interface is critical to the design and manufacture of biopolymer composite materials and the interfacial properties of such materials. The improvements achieved can lead to increase market share of such materials in more demanding applications. The early part of this thesis focuses on the efficacy of lignocellulosic fillers like wood-flour as a low-cost filler in Poly(lactic) acid (PLA) wood-flour biocomposites. A primary emphasis is on evaluating the effect of wood-flour on the mechanical, impact and thermal performance of the resulting biocomposites. The early part of this thesis also investigates the role that surface modification can play in improving interfacial interactions between PLA and wood-flour. The hydrophilic nature of lignocellulosic fillers introduces challenges in developing biopolymer composites with superior mechanical and thermal performance. Hence, a critical part of materials design for developing biopolymer composites is to deploy surface modification strategies to overcome the hydrophilic nature of lignocellulosic fibres. The implementation of surface modification through a variety of wet and dry techniques and a combination of both, do not always lead to improvements in interfacial adhesion. This lack of effect is primarily attributed to the heterogeneous structure and variation in the chemical composition of lignocellulosic fibres, which can vary from species to species for different varieties of biomass sources. In order to address the technical challenges, this thesis focuses more closely on the role of surface modification. Initially, surface modification of the filler or polymer matrix is investigated and compared. In the middle chapters, the role of pre-treatment through chemical (alkaline) or physical processes (plasma) is conducted in conjunction with chemical treatment in order to evaluate the influence on the practical adhesion at a macro level. And finally, the influence of pre-treatment and chemical modification is assessed on a micro level for their effect on the PLA composites themselves. The interfacial properties of PLA/wood-flour composites were evaluated using two strategies: the first approach evaluated chemical modification of wood-flour using methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI), whilst the second strategy focused on the physical modification of PLA using polyethylene acrylic acid (PEAA) as an impact modifier. MDI was found to improve the interfacial adhesion between PLA and wood-flour and this was confirmed by Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). The analysis indicated that MDI was present at the interface between PLA and wood-flour but also distributed to some degree within the PLA matrix. In comparison, PEAA was found to lower the tensile strength of the biocomposites but increased the impact performance. The enhancement in impact performance was due to the formation of a separate phase observed within the PLA matrix, which comprised spherical domains. The presence of these domains impeded crack propagation, resulting in higher impact strength. The heterogeneous nature of lignocellulosic materials and their varying chemical composition, contribute to their reduced surface functionality. In an effort to promote increased surface functionality, a pre-treatment process was used in conjunction with chemical modification. A macro-scale method was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of silane modification performed in conjunction with alkaline pre-treatment on the surface chemical and physical characteristics of a model wood substrate. Three silanes with different chemical end groups were used to modify the surface of wood. PLA film was bonded to the model wood surface using a melt press and the level of practical adhesion was assessed by peel adhesion testing. Surface characterisation studies proved that alkaline pre-treatment and subsequent chemical modification with an amino silane produced the highest peel fracture energy following peel adhesion. The macro scale, peel adhesion method for evaluating the effectiveness of different surface modification techniques was used to assess the suitability of plasma techniques for modifying the surfaces of a model wood substrate. Surface treatment using plasma based techniques has the potential to be a more benign approach to activate the surfaces of lignocellulosic substrates. Low-pressure plasma treatment was conducted on pinewood veneers using a custom built 13. 5 MHz Inductively Coupled Plasma Chamber. A dual plasma pre-treatment process that involved a combination of continuous wave and pulse mode was found to be more conducive to optimising surface active groups. The results of XPS analyses showed that plasma treatment based on a dual process was more effect than a single process plasma treatment due to the higher levels of oxygen relative to carbon (O/C) and O functional groups. The main peaks that proved the benefits of the dual plasma process was the higher atomic ratio of oxygen, which was attributed to a higher incidence of surface hydroxyl groups. Plasma treatment alone of the wood veneer produced a more homogeneous surface morphology, compared to unmodified wood veneer. The appearance of nano-like nodules were more even in height and furthermore, evenly distributed across the wood veneer surface. AFM was successfully used to define the surface morphology that was created following plasma treatment and chemical grafting using an amino silane and two <b>polyethyleneimines</b> with different molecular weight. AFM also showed that grafting with the amino silane did not alter the surface morphology. AFM phase imaging showed variations in PEI grafting onto plasma modified wood veneer. Peel adhesion studies showed that plasma pre-treatment combined with chemical modification (ex-situ) lead to significant enhancements in the fracture energies of wood-PLA laminates that were superior to those following low-pressure plasma treatment alone. The findings of the macro scale studies were used to prepare PLA based composites and evaluate the effect on the mechanical and thermal performance. PLA biocomposites were produced from wood-flour subjected to pre-treatment using alkaline treatment or low-pressure plasma and then chemically modified (ex-situ) using an amino silane and two <b>polyethyleneimines.</b> A micro extruder was used to compound PLA wood-flour formulations and mini injection moulder was used to prepare sample test bars. The results of mechanical testing showed that pre-treatment using a low-pressure plasma dual process (CW+P) combined with chemical modification (ex-situ) produced composites with enhancements in the flexural and impact properties of the resulting composites. Low-pressure plasma treatment of wood-flour alone did not enhance the mechanical and impact performance, compared to untreated wood-flour and wood-flour subjected to alkaline treatment. DMA testing also showed the benefits of using low-pressure plasma treatment combined with chemical treatment, due to enhanced interfacial properties of the resulting biocomposites. Low-pressure plasma treatment of lignocellulosic fibre/fillers is a useful approach and an alternative to more conventional chemical pre-treatment processes including alkaline treatment...|$|R
