40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{a series}} of investigations exploring the role of stiffness profile in propulsion using pitching flexible fins. Stiffness profile {{is defined as the}} variation in local bending stiffness along the chord <b>of</b> a <b>fin,</b> from leading to trailing edge. An unmanned robotic submarine was created, using simple pitching flexible fins for propulsion. Its design and performance prompted a review of literature covering many aspects <b>of</b> oscillating <b>fin</b> propulsion, paying special attention to the studies <b>of</b> <b>pitching</b> flexible <b>fins,</b> <b>of</b> the type used in the submarine. In the body <b>of</b> previous work, <b>fin</b> stiffness profile was a consequence of the external shape profile <b>of</b> a fin; <b>fins</b> had not thus far been designed with stiffness profile specifically in mind. A hypothesis was proposed: “Use <b>of</b> a biomimetic <b>fin</b> stiffness profile can improve the effectiveness of a flexible oscillating <b>fin,</b> over that <b>of</b> a standard NACA designated fin shape. ” Rectangular planform flexible <b>fins</b> <b>of</b> standard NACA 0012 design and 1 : 1 aspect ratio were tested alongside similar fins with a stiffness profile mimicking that of a pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). The fins were oscillated with a pitching-only sinusoidal motion over a range of frequencies and amplitudes, while torque, lateral force and static thrust were measured. Over the range of oscillation parameters tested, it was shown that the fin with a biomimetic stiffness profile offered a significant improvement in static thrust over a <b>fin</b> <b>of</b> similar dimensions with a standard NACA 0012 aerofoil shape, and produced thrust more consistently over each oscillation cycle. A comparison of different moulding materials showed that the improvement was due to the stiffness profile itself, and was not simply an effect of altering the overall stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>fin,</b> or changing its natural frequency. Within the range of stiffnesses and oscillation conditions tested, <b>fins</b> <b>of</b> the same stiffness profile were found to follow similar thrust-power curves, independently of their moulding material. Biomimetic fins were shown to produce between 10 % and 25 % more thrust per watt of mechanical input power. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The 500 -mm long tapered fins were each 1 Â· 6 mm at their tips and 4 Â· 4 mm thick at their base, and protruded 60 mm perpendicularly outwards from their 500 mm x 190 mm rectangular base. The optimal peak-to-peak <b>pitch,</b> S'opt <b>of</b> the <b>fins,</b> corresponding to the maximum steady-state rate of heat loss to the ambient air, was 14 mm Â± 1 mm.

For the horizontally-based finned systems, slight decreases in the rates of heat dissipation were observed for the tapered-fin arrays compared with those for the rectangular-fin arrays.

40|$|The {{development}} of a control system for the dive plane control of non-linear biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicles, equipped with pectoral-like fins, {{is the subject of}} this paper. Marine animals use pectoral fins for swimming smoothly. The fins are assumed to be oscillating with a combined pitch and heave motion and therefore produce unsteady control forces. The objective is to control the depth of the vehicle. The mean angle <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> motion <b>of</b> the <b>fin</b> is used as a control variable. A computational-fluid-dynamics-based parameterisation <b>of</b> the <b>fin</b> forces is used for control system design. A robust servo regulator for the control of the depth of the vehicle, based on the non-linear internal model principle, is derived. For the control law derivation, an exosystem of third order is introduced, and the non-linear time-varying biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicle model, including the fin forces, is represented as a non-linear autonomous system in an extended state space. The control system includes the internal model of a k-fold exosystem, where k is a positive integer chosen by the designer. It is shown that in the closed-loop system, all the harmonic components of order up to k of the tracking error are suppressed. Simulation results are presented which show that the servo regulator accomplishes accurate depth control despite uncertainties in the model parameters...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} is {{an important}} device in all the thermal systems. The heat exchanger is widely used equipment in different industries such as process, petroleum refining, chemicals and paper etc. Energy and material saving considerations as well as environmental challenges in the industry have stimulated the demand for high efficiency heat exchanger. To improve the efficiency of heat exchanger one must think of heat transfer enhancement in heat exchanger. Moreover heat transfer enhancement enables the size of heat exchanger to be considerably decreased. A high rate of heat transfer with minimum space requirement is necessity for compact heat exchanger. In present work, to improve the heat transfer characteristic of the double pipe heat exchanger, the helical fins were installed on the outer surface of the inner tube {{and the level of}} turbulence increased by the rotating the inner tube. The length of heat exchanger was 1 m and the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> helical <b>fins</b> kept constant equal to 17 mm. The convective heat transfer coefficients were obtained for the stationary as well as rotating inner tube for the counter flow mode using water as cold fluid in the tube side and glycerol as hot fluid in the shell side. The flow rate of cold fluid was kept constant and that of hot fluid was varied. The Nusselt number was calculated for the each speed of the rotation and compared with standard values obtained from Dittus-Boelter equation.

40|$|For centuries {{scientists}} have looked to nature for inspiration for novel and efficient solutions to engineering problems. Recently, research on {{fish and other}} marine mammals has shown their ability to efficiently extract energy from both steady and unsteady flows. Our research uses this previous work as motivation for experimentally examining the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils to extract energy in a two-dimensional flow. We focused on identifying the effects that foil motion parameters had on the hydrodynamic energy extraction efficiency and resolving the wake structure downstream of the foil. The primary foil motion parameters investigated were the non-dimensional flapping frequency of the foil, the non-dimensional excursion amplitude of the foil, and {{the profile of the}} foil path during a typical energy extraction cycle. The heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fin</b> was approximated by a NACA 0012 foil heaving and pitching sinusoidially 90 ° out of phase at a Reynolds number of 13, 800. Energy extraction efficiencies of up to [eta] = 0. 45 were found within a very small parametric region for small oscillation amplitudes while broad regions of appreciable efficiency were found at large oscillation amplitudes. The highest efficiency regions were all found to exhibit the same 2 P vortex shedding mode. Further, the similitude between experiments for varying oscillation amplitude was not consistent when parameterized by the Strouhal number. This study shows parameterizing the flapping frequency by the reduced frequency results in vortex modes and efficiency contours aligning between varying oscillation amplitudes. by Bradley James Simpson.
