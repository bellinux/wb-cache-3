A PoC controller should be able to terminate a PoC session based on an optimal timer. Moreover, the number of simultaneous session initiations by a PoC client is also a configurable parameter. We derived relations to provide access priority to special PoC sessions based on available transmit/receive units (TRU) and threshold level. Load sharing expressions are reported for a PoC controller using the Lagrange multiplier technique. A simple relation to control the PoC session timer is proposed.

40|$|Abstract: The Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocol}} of a Wireless ATM (WATM) {{system is}} a critical component as it lies between the traditional ATM layer and the RF-based physical layer whose characteristics are far from those of fibber- or copper-based conventional ATM media.

40|$|Abstract- The {{capability}} of multicasting {{is an important}} feature in data networking and is emerging in to a highly demanded service being offered by all major ISPs (Internet Service Providers). The benefits of multicast include reducing the overhead in transmission on the network and sender and reducing data delivery delay for all destinations. Multicast (<b>Point-to-multipoint)</b> refers a <b>communication</b> pattern in which a source node {{sends a message to}} a group of destination nodes. The major advantage of multicasting is to decrease the network load. On another hand, multicasting can be very useful in resource discovery. Quality of Services (QoS) is required for most of the multicast application and thus, the constraints for QoS provisioning should be also considered. In this paper we present the analysis and simulation of the performance of existing Dense mode and CBT mode multicast routing algorithms. Therefore, the performance comparison of existing multicast routing protocols over wired mesh networks are essential in order to analyze their behavior effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{cooperative}} communication {{has been proposed}} to improve link capacity, transmission reliability and network coverage in multiuser wireless communication networks. Different from conventional point-to-point and <b>point-to-multipoint</b> communications, cooperative <b>communication</b> allows multiple users or stations in a wireless network to coordinate their packet transmissions and share each other’s resources, thus achieving high performance gain and better service coverage. According to the IEEE 802. 11 standards, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) can support multiple transmission data rates, depending on the instantaneous channel condition between a source station and an Access Point (AP). In such a multi-rate WLAN, those low data-rate stations will occupy the shared communication channel {{for a longer period}} for transmitting a fixed-size packet to the AP, thus reducing the channel efficiency and overall system performance. This thesis addresses this challenging problem in multi-rate WLANs by proposing two cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, namely Busy Tone based Cooperative MAC (BTAC) protocol and Cooperative Access with Relay’s Data (CARD) protocol. Under BTAC, a low data-rate sending station tries to identify and use a close-by intermediate station as its relay to forward its data packets at higher data-rate to the AP through a two-hop path. In this way, BTAC can achieve cooperative diversity gain in multi-rate WLANs. Furthermore, the proposed CARD protocol enables a relay station to transmit its own data packets to the AP immediately after forwarding its neighbour’s packets, thus minimising the handshake procedure and overheads for sensing and reserving the common channel. In doing so, CARD can achieve both cooperative diversity gain and cooperative multiplexing gain. Both BTAC and CARD protocols are backward compatible with the existing IEEE 802. 11 standards. New cross-layer mathematical models have been developed in this thesis to study the performance of BTAC and CARD under different channel conditions and for saturated and unsaturated traffic loads. Detailed simulation platforms were developed and are discussed in this thesis. Extensive simulation results validate the mathematical models developed and show that BTAC and CARD protocols can significantly improve system throughput, service delay, and energy efficiency for WLANs operating under realistic communication scenarios. ...|$|R

30|$|As SU-MIMO is {{point-to-point}} communication, in general, it can {{be conceived}} that SU-MIMO aware CSMA/CA follows the same channel access mechanism as that of legacy CSMA/CA with exchange of slightly modified control packets only.

The authors apply the method to various ARQs, including ideal selective-repeat and go-back-N under point-to-point and <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>communication</b> environments.

Algorithms with lower computation overheads, notably PIM [4], iSLIP [5][6] and DRRM [7], are then proposed.

By {{taking advantage of}} both cooperation and broadcasting, we first present a two-phase cooperative MIMO broadcast scheme, which exploits distributed diversity in <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>communication</b> scenarios. Then, to enhance layered multimedia transmission with progressive recovery, the progressive rateless codes (PRC) is proposed to recover the layered data according to their importance at the expected received ratio of all output packets. Thus, receivers with different packet loss rate can achieve an adaptive recovery of the layered multimedia progressively. Furthermore, based on PRC, a distortion-based layered multimedia broadcast problem is formulated, which optimizes source bitrate of the layered multimedia and coding rates of PRC {{to improve the quality}} of experience (QoE) of the multimedia delivery over all receivers. The performance analysis including both analytical results and simulation experiments of Motion-JPEG 2000 broadcast to receivers verifies the superiority of the cooperative broadcast and efficiency of the QoE-driven optimization algorithm.|$|E
