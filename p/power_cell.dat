5|$|Calhoun regains {{consciousness}} at {{the bottom}} of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new <b>power</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's <b>power</b> <b>cell</b> is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors {{to see that they}} are in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise that they are in London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small <b>power</b> <b>cell</b> in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out because he is not her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E

500|$|Calhoun {{travels to}} the power {{generators}} on a lower level to find a fresh <b>power</b> <b>cell</b> while firefights rage between the Marines and the forces of Xen. After returning with a new <b>power</b> <b>cell,</b> Calhoun assists Rosenberg in evacuating the few surviving personnel through the teleporter. Calhoun is the last to enter the portal and as he does so, Marines breach the laboratory and fire on him, causing the teleporter to explode. As {{a result of the}} teleporter's destruction, Calhoun enters a [...] "harmonic reflux", causing him to be rapidly teleported to a variety of locations in Xen and Black Mesa. At one location, he witnesses Freeman's capture by Marines midway through Half-Life, before eventually stabilizing at the intended teleport location with Rosenberg at the outskirts of Black Mesa, where they then escape the facility in a company SUV.|$|E

Although the team initially believes it to be The Company's [...] "black book," [...] it is later revealed to contain information on an advanced renewable <b>power</b> <b>cell.</b> Over {{the course of the}} first half of the season, the team obtains cards to access Scylla and breaks into Company headquarters to steal it, Sara is discovered to be alive, Bellick dies when he sacrifices himself, and Self is revealed to be a double agent intent on selling Scylla to the highest bidder. Reluctantly, Lincoln decides to join The Company to get it back, while Michael suffers from a hypothalamic hamartoma. He is treated and operated on by The Company. Michael later learns that his mother, Christina is still alive and was an agent of The Company, who is revealed to acquire Scylla to sell to the highest bidder. Eventually, the series' main storyline of the past 4 seasons ends in Miami, where Scylla is recovered by Michael and the team, the General and The Company are taken down, and Sara kills Christina.|$|E

In order to remove the power losses of the unthinned coplanar <b>power</b> <b>cells,</b> additionally to the electrical bump interconnects thermal bumps near the gate fingers on the source pads and high thermal conductive aluminum nitride substrates have been used. The influence of the thermal bump interconnects to the electrical characteristics of the <b>power</b> <b>cells</b> at high frequencies was determined by on wafer measurements. In order to establish a substrate integrated housing technology for frequencies up to 70 GHz coplanar feed through transmission lines have been realized by use of thin film multilayer technology with 25 #mu#m thick polyimide dielectrics.
