25|$|An insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) is a three-terminal <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> device primarily {{used as an}} electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers. The IGBT is a semiconductor device with four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure without regenerative action.|$|E
2500|$|Switched or Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC) - These use <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> devices, usually {{thyristors}} or transistors such as MOSFETs or IGBTs, {{to switch}} pulses of current from a DC power supply through the primary winding. They provide pulsed (disruptive) excitation without the disadvantages of a spark gap: the loud noise, high temperatures, and poor efficiency. [...] The voltage, frequency, and excitation waveform can be finely controllable. SSTCs {{are used in}} most commercial, industrial, and research applications as well as higher quality entertainment coils.|$|E
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E

2500|$|The Shreeve {{mechanical}} repeater and {{the vacuum}} tube {{were the only}} amplifying devices, other than specialized power devices such as the magnetic amplifier and amplidyne, for 40 years.

Shreeve repeaters were used as adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s. [...] The replacement of bulky electron tubes with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the transistor radio developed in 1954.

40|$|Thermal FEM (Finite Element Method) {{simulations}} {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the thermal behavior of <b>power</b> <b>semiconductors</b> in application. Most <b>power</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are made of silicon. Silicon thermal material properties are significantly temperature dependent. In this paper, validity of a common non-linear silicon material model is verified by transient non-linear thermal FEM simulations of Smart Power Switches and measurements. For verification, over-temperature protection behavior of Smart Power Switches is employed. This protection turns off the switch at a pre-defined temperature which is used as a temperature reference in the investigation. Power dissipation generated during a thermal overload event of two Smart Power devices is measured and used as an input stimulus to transient thermal FEM simulations. The duration time of the event together with the temperature reference is confronted with simulation results and thus the validity of the silicon model is proved. In addition, the impact of non-linear thermal properties of silicon on the thermal impedance of <b>power</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is shown.
