This envelope is then either stamped and mailed at any mailbox, or dropped off (<b>postage</b> <b>free)</b> at a local ballot collection center.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{franking}} privilege predates {{the establishment}} of the republic itself, as the Continental Congress bestowed it on its members in 1775. The First United States Congress enacted a franking law in 1789 during its very first session. Congress members would spend much time [...] "inscribing their names on the upper right-hand corner of official letters and packages" [...] until the 1860s for the purpose of sending out <b>postage</b> <b>free</b> mail. Yet, on January 31, 1873, the Senate abolished [...] "the congressional franking privilege after rejecting a House-passed provision that would have provided special stamps for the free mailing of printed Senate and House documents." [...] Within two years, however, Congress began to make exceptions to this ban, including free mailing of the Congressional Record, seeds, and agricultural reports. Finally, in 1891, noting that its members were the only government officials required to pay postage, Congress restored full franking privileges. Since then, the franking of congressional mail has been subject to ongoing review and regulation.|$|E
40|$|With {{the final}} {{examinations}} {{no longer being}} the Presenting Complaint but rather, now falling under the more appropriate heading Past History, Dr. Ronnie Borg and I are happy {{to be back in}} the Editorial Board, again, as Secretary and Editor, respectively. Many new things are being put into effect to improve this publication and hoping that one day it achieves a standard comparable to other well established magazines abroad. We are introducing a cumulative index and a subject index which will aid readers trace specific articles of interest. They shall also provide details of material published so that future authors may have an insight to the topics yearning for attention that they may be subjects for discussion. A Guideline/or Authors is included in an attempt to standardise the presentation of material for publishing. We strongly advice all those who plan to write an article or two to read this section thoroughly before submitting any manuscripts. Material which does not conform to the criteria laid down may be refuted by the Board. Despite all efforts to ensure correctness of the printed articles, errors inevitably appear. We therefore hope to provide space for an Errata Corrigendum. Authors are requested to inform the Editor, in writing, of any misprints appearing in their articles so that these may be drawn, in successive issues, to the readers' attention. The Editorial Board requires more members to help in obtaining advertisements, distribution of the journal, posting of copies and proof-reading. All those who volunteer will be given appropriate remuneration for their time and fruitful efforts. Readers who would like to secure a copy of Medi-Scope each time it is published and to have it mailed (<b>postage</b> <b>free)</b> are to complete a subscription form available, at request, from the Editor. Having said all this I now leave you to our faithful contributors trusting you will find their articles of interest, intuitive and perhaps also of significant clinical value. N/...|$|E

50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{official}} portmanteau was used to carry the mail (two items: letters and newspapers) on New England stagecoaches that traveled the post roads. Before 1789 newspapers were mostly excluded from the mail and the official portmanteau. After the 1st United States Congress (1789-1791) the postmaster general allowed printers <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> to communicate reports and articles of newspapers with other publishers in other towns and cities to distribute Congressional information. This came about because of complaints to Thomas Jefferson. Congressmen then mailed issues of Congressional newspapers to their home districts. The congressional privilege was expedited using a special signature or marking called franking which allowed this <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for their newspapers and other mailings.|$|R

50|$|The Blairs, {{like many}} other {{nationalist}} Democrats, but unusually for politicians from the border states, had abandoned the Democratic Party {{in the wake of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act and had been among the founding leaders of the new Republican Party. After Blair switched political parties, President Buchanan removed Blair from his position of United States Solicitor in 1858. In 1860, Blair took an active part in the presidential campaign on behalf of Abraham Lincoln. After his election, Lincoln appointed Blair to his cabinet as Postmaster-General in 1861. Lincoln expected Blair, who advocated taking a firm stance with the southern states, to help balance more conciliatory members of his cabinet. While Postmaster-General, Blair instituted a uniform rate of <b>postage</b> and <b>free</b> delivery in cities. Blair also began the sale of money orders by post offices in order to reduce the mailing of currency, reducing post office robberies. He also called for the First International Postal Conference, which was held in Paris in 1863 and began the process that led to the Universal Postal Union.|$|R

2500|$|The Confederate States Congress was {{sometimes}} unruly. The journal clerk {{shot and killed}} the chief clerk, and Henry S.

Pollard had such fierce attacks on one another that newspapers would not publish the exchange for fears of their personal safety. Military glory redounded to those on the battlefield, but Congress and Congressmen were held in contempt, in some part due to members habit of berating one another in personal terms. Nevertheless, one historian of the Confederacy assessed the Congress as [...] "better than its critics made it." [...] The Confederacy lived out its existence during wartime, and virtually all of Congressional action addressed that fact. While it {{took an interest in}} military affairs, it never followed the U.S. Congress' example of harassing either the President, his cabinet, or military commanders. Despite Jefferson Davis' bitter Congressional critics, he dominated the Congress throughout most of the war until near the very end.

5000|$|The new United States saw a {{newspaper}} boom {{beginning with the}} Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over {{the establishment of a}} new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 Postal Service Act, and continuing into the 1800s. American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate. Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the West, fueled by high literacy and {{a newspaper}}-loving culture. By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita. Boosters of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community. The 1830s American, wrote Alexis de Tocqueville, was [...] "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers." [...] In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon. In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the Bureau d'Esprit.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly all {{weekly and}} daily papers were party organs {{until the early}} 20th century.

After 1900, William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer and other big city politician-publishers discovered they could make far more profit through advertising, at so many dollars per thousand readers. By becoming non-partisan they expanded their base to include the opposition party and the fast-growing number of consumers who read the ads but were less and less interested in politics. There was less and less political news after 1900, apparently because citizens became more apathetic, and shared their partisan loyalties with the new professional sports teams that attracted larger and larger audiences.|$|R
40|$|Background: Postal {{questionnaires}} {{remain an}} important method of collecting data in trials. However, a high non-response rate {{can lead to}} biases, which may undermine {{the validity of the}} study. Aims: To assess a simple method of trying to improve response rates in an occupational health trial evaluating an intervention to prevent hand dermatitis in nurses. Methods: The trial employed questionnaires at t = 0, t = 1 month and t = 12 months. The t = 1 month questionnaire was posted to study participants (student and intensive care nurses) together with a <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> reply envelope. After 2 weeks, an e-mail was sent to non-responders reinforcing the need for completed questionnaires to be returned. Two weeks later, non-responders were sent another hard copy of the questionnaire, along with an accompanying letter. Six weeks after posting the initial questionnaires, non-responders were sent an SMS text message or were telephoned to remind them to return the questionnaire. Results: The response rates for the 744 student nurses were 8 % (no reminder), 27 % (after first reminder), 22 % (after second reminder) and 27 % (after the third reminder), resulting in a response rate of 63 %. The response rates for the 959 intensive care nurses were 9 % (no reminder), 24 % (after first reminder), 24 % (after second reminder) and 31 % (after third reminder), resulting in a final response rate of 63 %. Conclusions: We found that a series of regular reminders including a third, personalized reminder by SMS text or telephone had a positive impact on non-responders...|$|R
40|$|In the 1991 case of Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., the Supreme Court held {{unanimously}} {{that only}} {{those aspects of}} works which exhibited a 2 ̆ 2 modicum of creativity 2 ̆ 2 could be protected by copyright, and hence that factual matter was not copyrightable. Feist confirmed and expanded on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s statements in the 1918 case of International News Service v. Associated Press that news was not copyrightable apart from its literary form. Yet for the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, the notion that copyright incorporated an originality requirement which excluded factual matter from protection was unknown to Anglo-American law. Courts routinely found infringement of fact-based works, such as maps, charts, road-books, directories, and calendars, {{on the basis of}} the copying of their factual content, and concluded that the industry of plaintiffs in gathering and presenting facts should be protected under copyright law. What caused the transformation in the doctrine of originality between the Civil War and World War I? This article argues that the rise of creativity-based originality in copyright law has strong ties to a previously little-examined episode in copyright history: the debate over legal protection for news in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Until the 1880 s, the American news industry remained in a pre-copyright era, and played no part in copyright discourse. Newspaper editors followed a widespread custom of freely copying text from other newspapers. That custom was acknowledged and encouraged by a massive government subsidy in the form of <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for newspaper copies that were being exchanged between editors. Newspaper owners never registered their papers before publication, and thus forsook copyright protection for them. In the middle decades of 1800 s, however, technological changes, foremost among them the introduction of the telegraph, radically changed the structure of the news industry. The telegraph provided newspapers with an opportunity to invest in more timely news; yet together with improvements in typesetting, printing, and transportation technology, it also created an appropriability problem. It shrank the lead-time advantage that newspapers traditionally had relied upon to realize the value of their investment in news, and also exposed them to competition from which they had previously been geographically isolated. At the same time, the new communications technologies led to the emergence of companies and large associations that dominated markets, often with the aid of anticompetitive practices. Prominent among these were the news industry organizations of the Associated Press and the Western Union. Within this context, the Associated Press, Western Union and others began in the 1880 s to press for legal protection of news reports, in both legislative and judicial arenas. Opposition to those efforts led to the first prominent articulations of the notion that facts are not created by authors, and are therefore not copyrightable subject matter. Paradoxically, that notion was then reinforced by proponents of legal protection for news, when they resolved to seek that protection outside of statutory copyright, in common law misappropriation, and made the tactical decision to argue that news was not copyrightable in order to avoid copyright preemption of their common law claims.

40|$|Elected {{politicians}} work {{as agents}} {{on behalf of}} the citizens of an economy. Once elected they are responsible for shaping the future socioeconomic path of a country. Therefore understanding the determinants of electoral outcomes and the incentives faced by political candidates during the election period is key in understanding the efficacy of elections in selecting the best possi- ble candidates. A functional electoral system should act as a quality filter in which low quality candidates are "weeded out" and the highest quality candidates are successful. In reality electoral systems may not select and retain the best possible candidates. The presence of incumbency advantage may lead to a dysfunc- tional system with deleterious effects for welfare. Incumbent candidates may use officeholder benefits to improve their electoral prospects. For exam- ple, incumbents typically have access to <b>free</b> <b>postage,</b> printing and greater fundraising capabilities than challengers and may use these officeholder ben- efits to gain an unfair electoral advantage. As a result, the incumbent could win the election even if the challenger is of higher quality or high quality chal- lengers may decide not to contest the election in the first place. Incumbents are also in a position to announce their policy choices before challengers. As such the incumbent may enjoy a first mover advantage which may enable the incumbent to implement their own personal policy agenda which may not represent the majority of voters. The first chapter of this dissertation empirically estimates the magnitude of the incumbency advantage in Irish elections using a regression disconti- nuity design (RDD). Ireland provides an interesting setting for the study of incumbency advantage as the rate of reelection of Irish politicians is one of the highest in the world. Moreover its electoral system of proportional repre- sentation with a single transferable vote (PR-STV) creates strong incentives for incumbent candidates to cultivate a loyal personal following. In very close elections, where there is a narrow margin of victory, it is likely that bare winners are comparable in their unobservable characteristics to bare losers. Regression discontinuity design identifies the causal effect of incum- bency by comparing the subsequent electoral outcomes of bare winners and losers. I find that incumbency causes an eighteen percentage point increase in the probability that a candidate is successful in a subsequent election. In chapter two I study open seat and incumbent-challenger elections in a model of spatial electoral competition between two policy motivated can- didates. The candidates differ with regard to non-policy related characteris- tics which are desired by voters. These may include characteristics such as charisma, charm and intelligence - collectively referred to as valence charac- teristics. I find that incumbent candidates benefit from being first movers and this allows them to generate favourable post-election policy outcomes. Policy divergence between candidates is typically greater in the incumbent challenger election compared to an open seat contest. I also show that ideo- logical shirking occurs once a candidate 2 ̆ 7 s valence exceeds a certain threshold as the candidate pursues her own ideology even if this is not representative of the majority of voters. In chapter three I examine the extent to which electoral selection based on candidate quality alone can account for the pattern of reelection rates in the U. S. Senate. In order to attain incumbency status a candidate has to first win an election. Therefore it is likely that incumbent candidates are of high quality due to political selection and get reelected with a high probability. As such high reelection rates are not definitive evidence of a poorly functioning electoral system. The counterfactual simulation in which candidate quality is the sole determinant of electoral success may provide a simple benchmark for the reelection rate in the absence of officeholder benefits. The simulation delivers a reelection rate which is almost identical to the observed rate prior to 1980, at around 78 percent. In the later sub- sample, quality-based selection generates a reelection rate which is seven percentage points lower than observed. The divergence in the reelection rates in the later sub-sample is consistent with the findings of vote-margin studies that indicate rising incumbency advantage due to officeholder benefits...|$|R
