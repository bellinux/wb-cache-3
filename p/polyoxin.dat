The {{gene cluster}} {{responsible}} for biosynthesis of polyoxins has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces cacaoi {{and tens of}} <b>polyoxin</b> analogs have been identified already. Results The <b>polyoxin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cacaoi was heterologously expressed in the sanN inactivated mutant of Streptomyces ansochromogenes as a nikkomycin producer. Besides hybrid antibiotics (polynik A and <b>polyoxin</b> N) and some known polyoxins, two novel <b>polyoxin</b> analogs were accumulated. One of them is <b>polyoxin</b> P that has 5 -aminohexuronic acid with N -glycosidically bound thymine as the nucleoside moiety and dehydroxyl-carbamoylpolyoxic acid as the peptidyl moiety. The other analog is <b>polyoxin</b> O that contains 5 -aminohexuronic acid bound thymine as the nucleoside moiety, but recruits polyoximic acid as the sole peptidyl moiety. Bioassay against phytopathogenic fungi showed that <b>polyoxin</b> P displayed comparatively strong inhibitory activity, whereas the inhibitory activity of <b>polyoxin</b> O was weak under the same testing conditions.

In this paper, we report results which demonstrate that changes in the growth conditions significantly affect the degree of sensitivity of Canidida albicans to the <b>polyoxins.</b> For example, a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0. 1 micrograms/ml was obtained in a defined medium compared with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1, 000 micrograms/ml with conventional media.

30|$|The {{findings}} of PolB {{as a unique}} UMP methylase elucidated the origin of nucleoside skeleton C 5 -modification in <b>polyoxin</b> biosynthesis. Based on this work, we proposed that four different groups of polyoxins could be synthesized starting from UMP and its derivatives (5 -methyl UMP, 5 -hydroxymethyl UMP and 5 -carboxyl UMP) via a potential pyrimidine salvage pathway. This hypothesis is supported by our previous report that when the biosynthetic gene cluster of <b>polyoxin</b> was heterologously expressed in S. lividians TK 24, only the <b>polyoxin</b> H components were detected (Zhao et al., 2010). Co-expression of the <b>polyoxin</b> gene cluster of with sav_ 4805 (encoding a thymine- 7 -hydroxylase homologous protein) from S. avermitilis (Omura et al., 2001) lead {{to the production of}} <b>polyoxin</b> A in S. lividians TK 24. This indicated that genes responsible for the reaction from 5 -methyl UMP to 5 -hydroxymethyl UMP and 5 -carboxyl UMP are not all adjacent to the <b>polyoxin</b> gene cluster. The S. cacaoi cells may also evolve or hijack a decarboxylase to convert 5 -carboxyl UMP to normal UMP and complete the UMP salvage pathway. Further investigation of the component diversity of polyoxins will require all related genes in the metabolic pathway for 5 -methyl UMP to be cloned.|$|E

The investigations presented in this dissertation were directed towards an understanding of the biosynthetic pathway to coronamic acid. Our results from the administration of specifically labeled precursors to Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinae (PDCC # 4182) suggest that: (1) the retention of the tritium label from (3 - 3 H) -L-alloisoleucine rules out the intermediacy of 3 -methylene-norvaline on the biosynthetic pathway to coronamic acid, (2) the incorporation of approximately half of the 15 N label from a mixture of (2 - 13 C, 15 N) -DL-isoleucine and (2 - 13 C, 15 N) -DL-alloisoleucine indicates that the cyclisation reaction leading to the formation of coronamic acid from L-alloisoleucine does not involve the loss of nitrogen and (3) the incorporation of (4 - 2 H 1, 5 - 2 H 1) -(±) -coronamic acid provides some experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis that coronamic acid and coronafacic acid are biosynthesised separately and coupled by the formation of an amide bond to give coronatine.

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} ‘Studies of NIS Mediated Cyclopropane Ring Opening Reactions in Carbohydrate Chemistry’ {{is divided}} into four chapters. Chapter 1 : Section 1 : Efficient Synthesis of Fused Perhydrofuro[2, 3 -b]pyrans (and furans) by Ring Opening of 1, 2 -Cyclopropanated Sugar Derivatives. In this section a general and efficient methodology for the synthesis of carbohydrate derived perhydrofuro[2, 3 -b]pyrans (and furans) from the corresponding 1, 2 -cyclopropane carboxylates has been discussed. A wide range of linear-fused perhydrofuro[2, 3 -b]pyran or furan ring systems are encountered {{in a number of}} biologically active natural products. A few approaches are available for the construction of this kind of fused motifs which involve harsh reaction conditions and lengthy reaction sequence. The methodology utilizes the potential ability of cyclopropanated sugars to undergo N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated electrophilic ring opening assisted by the pyran ring oxygen followed by intramolecular trapping of oxonium intermediate to generate the furan ring system. Cyclopropantion of tribenzyl glucal using methyl diazoacetate and catalytic amount of dirhodiumtetracetate furnished corresponding exo- 1, 2 -cyclopropane carboxylate exclusively. To generate a nucleophile, cyclopropane carboxylate ester was reduced to the corresponding alcohol which upon treatment with NIS in CH 3 CN underwent ring opening followed by intramolecular ring closure to give the corresponding perhydro[2, 3 -b]furopyran along with an oxidized product. After various modifications we found that using CH 2 Cl 2 as a solvent gave the expected perhydrofuropyran as the sole product in good yield (Scheme I). The stereochemistry of the product was established on the basis of 1 H- 1 H NOESY experiment. There are many natural products that contain the perhydrofuro[2, 3 -b]furyl glycal core such as clerodin, jodrelline B and caryoptin, which show insect anti-feedant properties. With this in mind, the methodology has been successfully extended to the cyclopropanated tetrahydrofuran derivatives resulting in the synthesis of furofuryl glycal moiety (Scheme II). Scheme II Chapter 1 : Section 2 : Synthesis of Carbohydrate Derived Fused Perhydrofuro/pyrano[2, 3 -b]-γ-butyrolactones. In this section a general and efficient methodology for the synthesis of carbohydrate derived perhydrofuro/pyrano[2, 3 -b]-γ-butyrolactones has been discussed. The fusion of the γ-butyrolactone onto a substituted tetrahydrofuran/pyran ring makes a distinctive class natural diterpenoids. Representative members of this family include the marine diterpenoids norrisilide and miniolutelide A. In this chapter we describe a neutral and general method for the construction of perhydrofuro/pyrano[2, 3 -b]-γ-butyrolactones by NIS mediated ring opening of carbohydrate derived 1, 2 -cyclopropane carboxylic acids (Scheme III). Scheme III The present strategy is complementary to the existing methods and it is useful since it incorporates an additional chiral center in the molecule under milder conditions, which can be used for further transformations. Chapter 2 : Ring Opening of Activated Cyclopropanes with NIS/NaN 3 : One-pot Synthesis of C- 1 Linked Pseudo Disaccharides. Ring opening reactions of activated cyclopropanes have been widely used in organic synthesis. But they are restricted to only selected nucleophiles such as alcohol/ water, as most of the ring opening reactions need acidic activation. This chapter deals with studies of reactivity of various activated cyclopropanes with NIS as a neutral activator and sodium azide as a source of nitrogen nucleophile (Scheme IV). Scheme IV We have clearly demonstrated not only the importance of the donor-acceptor feature in the cyclopropanes in the electrophilic ring opening reaction, but also the selectivity in its functionality. Scheme V This methodology has been successfully utilized in a one-pot synthesis of C- 1 linked pseudo-disaccharides from carbohydrate derived 1, 2 -cyclopropane carboxylates (Scheme V). Chapter 3 : Synthesis of Unnatural C- 2 Amino Acid Nucleosides Using NIS Mediated Ring Opening of 1, 2 -Cyclopropane Carboxylated Sugar Derivatives. In this chapter, we have efficiently demonstrated the utility of NIS mediated regioselective ring opening of carbohydrate derived donor-acceptor cyclopropanes for the synthesis of C- 2 amino acid nucleosides. This leads to a new class of analogs of peptidyl nucleosides (Scheme VI). Scheme VI One of the advantageous factors is the attachment of nucleobase as well as generation of amino acid precursor in the same reaction which avoids lengthy reaction sequence. We have also shown the synthetic utility of our methodology to pyrimidine based furanosyl C- 2 amino acid nucleosides which are of interest, since <b>polyoxins</b> having similar structural core exhibit antifungal activity (Scheme VII). Chapter 4 : Attempts Towards the Synthesis of Carbohydrate Derived Spiro-perhydrofuropyrans Using NIS Mediated Cyclopropane Ring Opening Reaction. In this chapter we present various attempts to synthesize spiro-perhydrofuropyran/furans by ring opening of spiro-cylopropane derivatives and attempts towards stereoselective synthesis of spiro-cyclopropane carboxylates. Spiroacetal can be synthesized from the corresponding exo-cyclopropyl methanol, which can be obtained from the corresponding exo- cyclopropane carboxylate. The cyclopropyl carboxylate can be obtained from an exo- vinyl ether. Cyclopropanation of carbohydrate derived exo-glycal failed to give any selectivity under a variety of reaction conditions (Scheme VIII). Carbohydrate derived C 1 -unsaturated ester on cyclopropanation reaction using standard conditions (Pd(OAc) 2 /CH 2 N 2) was found to be inert. The reaction under Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation conditions also gave similar results. Reduction of the ester part of the molecule to the corresponding alcohol was found to be helpful in the Simmon-Smith cyclopropanation reaction (CH 2 I 2, Et 2 Zn) to obtain the corresponding exo-cyclopropane, but disappointingly without any selectivity (Scheme IX). In order to get exo-cyclopropane carboxylate with high stereoselectivity, we decided to use one of the hydroxyl group present in the molecule, as a chiral auxiliary. All the established methods for the diazoester formation failed to attach diazo ester at C- 4 position (Scheme X). Scheme X (For structural formula pl see the pdf file...|$|R

Although the structural diversity and bioactivity preference of <b>polyoxin</b> are, to some extent, affected by such modifications, the biosynthetic logic for their occurence remains obscure. Here we report the identification of PolB in <b>polyoxin</b> pathway as an unusual UMP C- 5 methylase with thymidylate synthase activity which is responsible for the C- 5 methylation of the nucleoside skeleton. To probe its molecular mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of PolB alone and in complexes with 5 -Br UMP and 5 -Br dUMP at 2.15 Å, 1.76 Å and 2.28 Å resolutions, respectively. Loop 1 (residues 117 – 131), Loop 2 (residues 192 – 201) and the substrate recognition peptide (residues 94 – 102) of PolB exhibit considerable conformational flexibility and adopt distinct structures upon binding to different substrate analogs. Consistent with the structural findings, a PolB homolog that harbors an identical function from Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736 was identified.

Normally, the biosynthesis of nucleoside antibiotics follows a distinct logic via sequential modifications of the simple building blocks including nucleoside and nucleotide from primary metabolisms (Isono, 1988). <b>Polyoxin,</b> a group of structurally-related peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics, is produced by Sreptomyces cacaoi var. asoensis (S. cacaoi hereafter) and Streptomyces aureochromogenes (Chen et al., 2009). As the chemical structure of <b>polyoxin</b> mimics UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine, a building block for fungal chitin biosynthesis, it functions as a potent chitin synthetase inhibitor by targeting fungal cell wall biosynthesis (Endo and Misato, 1969; Endo et al., 1970). <b>Polyoxin</b> has therefore been widely used as an agricultural fungicide to control phytopathogenic fungi due to its distinctive action mode (Chen et al., 2009).|$|E

Oct-Lys-UPOC and Oct-Gln-UPOC were strong inhibitors (Kis = 1. 7 X 10 (- 6) M) of chitin synthetase from Candida albicans membrane preparations. In a permeabilized-cell assay, Oct-Gln-UPOC had a 10 -fold-lower inhibitory activity toward chitin synthetase than did the Oct-Lys-UPOC analog. Both compounds were resistant to hydrolysis by a cell extract of C. albicans H 317; however, Oct-Gln-UPOC was hydrolyzed with a half-life of 23 min by a permeabilized-cell preparation.

At concentrations up to 2 mM these two new polyoxins were ineffective in the inhibition of cell growth or reduction of cell viability, but they induced aberrant morphologies in C. albicans at a concentration of 0. 25 mM.

To dissect the function of PolB, we carried out a series of biochemical and crystallographic analysis which confirm PolB is an unusual flavin-dependent UMP/dUMP methylase (Fig.  1 C and 1 D). We solved the crystal structures of PolB as well as its complex structures with two substrate analogues 5 -Br UMP or 5 -Br dUMP. We found that the structure of PolB shares high similarity with its homologs ThyX proteins. However, the sequence identity is only 38 %. Two special Loops, Loop 1 (residues 117 – 131) and Loop 2 (residues 192 – 201) which are highly conserved in primary sequence with ThyXs but not structurally existed in them are identified in PolB structure. Additional mutagenesis studies further reveal that residues Tyr 124, Tyr 126 and Tyr 99 on Loop 1, Loop 2 and substrate recognition peptide (residues 94 – 102) are crucial for the catalytic activity and substrate selectivity of PolB.

Only nikkomycin Z and caspofungin were found to act synergistically. The nikkomycin Z-induced chitin decrease corresponded with a β-glucan increase, while with the caspofungin-induced β-glucan decrease, an increase in chitin was found. This could explain the synergistic activity of this combination of drugs. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|A {{temperature-sensitive mutant}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L- 2 - 42, is blocked at 37 C at {{a stage of}} the cell cycle prior to septum formation. When single cells of the mutant are allowed to bud at 37 C in a medium {{containing}} tritiated glucose, a large incorporation of radioactivity into chitin takes place. Thus, the synthesis of chitin, the major component of the primary septum, is initiated in a phase of the cell cycle which precedes septum closure. This early period of chitin synthesis is not required for emergence and growth of buds because, in the wild type, budding takes place normally {{in the presence of}} concentrations of <b>polyoxin</b> D that effectively and specifically prevent chitin formation. However, at a later time a majority of these cells lyse, presumably because of the inability to form a septum. <b>Polyoxin</b> D also prevents the appearance of enhanced fluorescence at the junction between mother cell and bud, as observed {{in the presence of a}} brightener. Therefore, the fluorescence is due to chitin and its presence at the base of very early buds indicates that chitin synthesis begins at or shortly after bud emergence. A scheme for chitin synthesis and primary septum formation which embodies these and other results is presented...|$|E
40|$|The normal {{sequence}} of cell separation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{begins with the}} formation of a primary septum, presumably consisting of chitin, on which secondary septa are later deposited. In the presence of the antibiotic <b>polyoxin</b> D, a potent inhibitor of chitin synthetase, pairs of abnormal cells of two different types were observed by phase-contrast microscopy: the “exploded pair,” consisting of two lysed cells from which the cytoplasm had been extruded at the cell junction, and the “refringent pair,” consisting of two highly refractile cells joined by a thin bridge. Thus, in both cases the septal region appears to be affected. Observations with the electron microscope showed that the primary chitin septum was not formed in either of these cell types, and as a consequence secondary septa of varying thicknesses were laid down in an abnormal pattern. With [3 H]glucose as carbon source the incorporation of tritium into the chitin of abnormal cells was inhibited about 90 %, whereas the labeling of mannan was normal and that of glucan somewhat reduced. The effective concentrations of <b>polyoxin</b> D (0. 1 to 1 mg/ml) were much greater than those required to inhibit chitin synthesis in vitro. Dimethylsulfoxide and amphotericin B, both known to increase cell permeability, enhanced the action of the antibiotic...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of in vitro chitin synthase activity in mucoraceous hosts of a mycoparasite: Chitin synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of chitin in fungal cell wall was extracted from young hyphae of Choanephora cucurbitarum and Phascolomyces articulosus, susceptible and resistant hosts, respectively, to the mycoparasite, Piptocephalis virginiana. Crude enzyme was identified and characterized by measuring the incorporation of the substrate [14 C]-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, into chitin. Most activity occurred in mixed membrane fraction. Inhibition of activity with <b>Polyoxin</b> D and activation with proteases, N-acetyl-glucosamine and magnesium and other ions was observed. Properties of the crude enzyme preparation such as cofactor requirement, Vmax, apparent Km value for UDP-GlcNAc, inhibition by <b>Polyoxin</b> D, response to pH and to temperature, and stability at 4 °C were determined. Enzyme activity from both fungi displayed basically the same features as the corresponding enzymes reported from other mucoraceous fungi. However, the two preparations from P. articulosus and C. cucurbitarum differed {{from each other in}} their expressed activity (i. e., the preparations from ~ articulosus exhibited higher latency and higher specific chitin synthase activity than the corresponding preparations from ~ cucurbitarum). Trypsin was effective in activation only over a narrow concentration range. Acid protease was the most effec. tive activator. En. dogenous protease estimation indicated higher protease activity in C. cucurbitarum than in P. articulosus. The suggestion is made that regulation of chitin synthase activities may be related to host resistance in the mycoparasitic system...|$|E

40|$|Occurence of polyoxin- or iprodion-resistant {{strains of}} Alternaria mali Roberts, the causal fungus of Alternaria blotch of apple, was {{investigated}} by the minimum inhibitory concentration method at two orchard (Orchards A and B) in Tokusa, Ato-cho, Yamaguchi Prefecture, located {{at one of the}} warmer districts among the apple-growing areas in Japan, from 1984 to 1988. In Orchard A the, the frequency of polyoxin-resistant strains was 60. 3 % in 1984, and decreased gradually to 46. 9 % in 1986. It quickly decreased to 27. 0 % in 1987 and to 8. 9 % in 1988. This last value reached to a level at which the reapplication of <b>polyoxin</b> in Orchard A was available. In Orchard B, on the other hand, the frequency was 51. 5 % in 1984, and decreased slowly to 37. 5 % in 1988. This last value proved that the reapplication of <b>polyoxin</b> in Orchard B should be forbidden. Decrease in the frequncy at both orchards was considerably slow compared with that reported at apple-growing orchards in northern Japan. The overwintered causal fugus on apple plants was detected by isolating from every portions of fruiting branches in April of 1987 and 1988 ． The frequency of the fungus was highest on the barks of nodes, and also high on barks of internodes and on scaly leaves. Polyoxin-resistant strains as well as susceptible strains at Tokusa may abundantly overwinter under the relatively warmer condition than that in northern Japan. This may cause the slow decrease in the frequency of polyoxin-resistant strains at Tokusa. Frequency of iprodion-resistant strains in both orchards kept a low level of value from 1984 to 1988. Therefore, the iprodion-resistant strains of A. mali at Tokusa were suggested to havenot been affected to increase their frequency by the present controlling system in this district in which iprodion has been applicated one time a year...|$|E

40|$|These {{studies have}} {{characterized}} the peptide transport systems of Candida albicans, {{with a view}} to the rational design of peptide antifungal agents exploiting the 'smugglin' concept. In initial studies, a series of <b>polyoxin</b> complexes (peptide-nucleoside antibiotics) and individual components, were isolated from a batch of agricultural fungicide (<b>Polyoxin</b> Z). Isolated fractions were toxic to a particulate chitin synthetase preparation from Candida albicans. Different strains of Candida albicans exhibited varied sensitivities to a series of peptide analogues. From a sensitive strain, B 2630, spontaneous mutants were selected for resistance to each analogue; certain mutants showed cross-resistance to other analogues and associated defects in peptide transport. A bacilysin-resistant mutant was cross-resistant to the other analogues and to m- fluorophenylalanylalanylalanine a but retained sensitivity to m- fluorophenylalanylalanylalanine. This mutant showed defective dipeptide transport but normal oligopeptide transport, and was unable to utilize Ala-Ala as a sole nitrogen source. Thus, Candida albicans has distinguishable mechanisms for dipeptide and oligopeptide transport which can be exploited for uptake of peptide-drug adducts. Peptide transport was shown to be stimulated by the presence of peptides (peptone) in the growth medium. On transferring cells from minimal to peptone medium, this stimulatory effect was shown to be rapid, independent of protein synthesis and to override ammonia regulation of peptide transport. The reduction of transport activity on transferring cells from peptone to minimal medium was also rapid. It was speculated that regulation of peptide transport is achieved by a rapid, reversible activation of preformed transport components, or a mechanism of exocytotic insertion and endocytic retrieval of preformed transporters. The effect of protein-modification reagents on transport activity was also examined. Dipeptide transport was specifically inhibited by N-ethyl- 5 -phenylisoxazolium- 3 '-sulphonate (Woodwards Reagent K), offerring potential for the specific labelling of the component(s) of this system. Peptide transport was shown not to be sensitive to osmotic shock though a series of uncharacterized polypeptides was released by the shock treatment...|$|E
40|$|A canCHSlA gene {{encoding}} the chitin synthase of Candida albicans was cloned. DNA sequencing {{and comparison}} with another canCHS 7 gene described elsewhere {{indicated that the}} canCHSlA gene encoded a polypeptide with 775 amino acid residues, a protein with one less amino acid than that encoded by the canCHSl gene. A six-base alteration was observed between the two genes, suggesting that the canCHSlA gene is a variant gene of the canCHS 7. The pH prof ile/activity relationship of canChsl A in permeabilized cells was identical to that of canChsl. The canChslA enzyme was competitively inhibited by <b>polyoxin</b> D (52 pM) and nikkomycin 2 (12 pM).

40|$|Nikkomycin Z {{inhibits}} chitin synthase {{in vitro}} {{but does not}} exhibit antifungal activity against many pathogens. Assays of chitin synthase isozymes and growth assays with isozyme mutants were used to demonstrate that nikkomycin Z is a selective inhibitor of chitin synthase 3. The resistance of chitin synthase 2 to nikkomycin Z in vitro is likely responsible for the poor activity of this antibiotic against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Chitin synthesis and degradation are considered excellent targets for pharmaceutical and agricultural pathogen manage-ment (12). Several compounds that affect chitin synthesis have been identified. Nikkomycins and polyoxins are antifungal antibiotics that are competitive inhibitors of chitin synthase (Chs) enzymes (8, 13). <b>Polyoxin</b> D is used as an agricultural antifungal agent to treat rice sheath blight and pear black spot (16, 17). Unfortunately, compounds that affect in vitro chitin synthase activity are not necessarily effective antifungal agents (19). While permeability and intracellular stability of thes...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} peptide drugs {{are known to}} be active against Candida albicans; however, {{little is known about the}} {{transport}} of such agents into the target organism. To provide further information concerning transport of this type, we studied the uptake of two classes of small linear peptides: polyoxins which act intact within the cell and the m-fluorophenylalanyl (m-F-Phe) peptides which require peptidase cleavage to release m-F-Phe. Competition studies with a specific dipeptide detector (alanyl-alpha-thiophenylglycine) enabled us to determine Ki values of 2. 6 microM for nikkomycin Z and 350 microM for <b>polyoxin</b> D. Rates of uptake of the peptidyl-nucleosides are approximately 30 times lower than those of the m-F-Phe peptides (apparent maximal velocities: nikkomycin Z, 62 pmol min- 1 mg (dry weight) of cells- 1; M-F-Phe alanine 1. 3 nmol min- 1 mg (dry weight) of cells- 1). For both the m-F-Phe peptides and the peptidyl-nucleosides, the affinity of the drug for the transport system is an important determinant of its whole-cell activity...|$|E

Inhibition of normal chitin synthesis in the spherule by exposure to several concentrations of <b>polyoxin</b> D (PD) led to multiple morphological effects. Exposure of the mycelial phase to significantly higher levels of the compound had no morphological effect, as determined by autoradiography and light and electron microscopy. However, when equal masses of both morphological phases were treated with PD and pulsed with labeled N-acetylglucosamine, there was a greater relative (percent) reduction of incorporation of label in PD-treated mycelia compared with that of spherules. Nevertheless, the treated and untreated mycelia incorporated severalfold more counts than did corresponding spherules. The results suggest that chitin is important in maintaining the structural integrity of the spherule phase, but the role of chitin in the mycelial phase is less clear...|$|E
