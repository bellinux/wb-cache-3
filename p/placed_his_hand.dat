5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over his heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to}} the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} [...] "Photograph", {{backed by}} [...] "Down and Out", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. Starr made a promotional film for [...] "Photograph", {{in which he}} mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon. To circumvent the BBC's ban on lip-synching, Starr <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over his mouth {{for part of the}} song, thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming. The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms [...] "the Ringo starfish", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album.|$|E

Fenrir is first mentioned in prose in chapter 25, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about the god Týr. High says that {{one example of}} Týr's bravery {{is that when the}} Æsir were luring Fenrir (referred to here as Fenrisúlfr) to place the fetter Gleipnir on the wolf, Týr <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> within the wolf's mouth as a pledge. This was done at Fenrir's own request because he did not trust that the Æsir would let him go. As a result, when the Æsir refused to release him, he bit off Týr's hand at a location [...] "now called the wolf-joint" [...] (the wrist), causing Týr to be one-handed and [...] "not considered to be a promoter of settlements between people." ...|$|E

Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness.

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said that}} the episode was [...] "still satisfying, even when it's {{not one of the}} show's funnier episodes", but [...] "it's a bit of a shame this episode wasn't a home run, because having Dwight and Michael hit the clubs is a funny idea." [...] Fickett went on to praise the episode's awkward moment between Toby and Pam, when Toby <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on Pam's leg, and Toby's {{subsequent}} escape by hopping the fence. Fickett stated that, for Toby's growing love of Pam, and growing jealousy of Jim, [...] "this is pretty great pay off". Claire Zulkey, a writer for the Los Angeles Times, was not as pleased with the episode. Zulkey wrote [...] "that when it's at its zaniest, The Office is at its worst", and the episode was [...] "just too silly to be funny". Zulkey did say that [...] "it was hilarious to see him [...] let his hand more-than-linger on her knee and then abruptly flee the premises by jumping over the fence and running home."

500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E

He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Instead, there was silence.

York replied, [...] "I know of no person in this realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him." [...] This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.|$|E
2500|$|Many miracles {{came to be}} {{associated}} with Dnyaneshwar's life, one of which was the revival of his disciple Sachchidanand's corpse. During Dnyaneshwar's visit to Paithan, to obtain a certificate of purification, he was confronted with a man who violently lashed at an old buffalo. When Dnyaneshwar expressed concern for the animal he was ridiculed by Brahmins for being more concerned about a beast than the teachings of the Vedas. Dnyaneshwar retorted that the Vedas themselves held all life to be sacred and a manifestation of the brahman. The outraged priests pointed out that his logic implied that beasts should be able to learn the Vedas as well. An undeterred Dnyaneshwar then <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on the buffalo's forehead and it started reciting a Vedic song. According to Fred Dallmayr, the story signifies that [...] "divine is not a property of the learned elite; rather, it is a spread out gift, a largesse, over all creation".|$|E

2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen.

2500|$|The Gemara cited two textual proofs for the {{instruction}} of [...] that one waved the first fruits ( [...] , bikkurim). Rabbi Judah interpreted the words [...] "you shall set it down" [...] in [...] {{to refer to the}} waving. The Gemara explained that these words could not refer literally to setting the basket down because [...] already accounted for setting the basket down. Alternatively, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob deduced the requirement to wave the first fruits from the word [...] "hand" [...] occurring in both [...] {{and in the case of}} the peace-offering in [...] which says, [...] "His own hands shall bring the offering unto the Lord." [...] The Gemara concluded that just as [...] explicitly directs the priest to take the basket and wave it, so in [...] the priest was to take the offering and wave it, even though [...] refers only to the donor. And just as [...] explicitly directs the donor to wave the offering, so in [...] the donor was to wave the basket. The Gemara explained that it was possible for both the priest and the donor to perform the waving because the priest <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> under the hand of the donor and they waved the basket together.|$|E

2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
