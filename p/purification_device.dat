50|$|As {{desalinization}} and purification {{of water}} is critical for obtaining deionized water for laboratory research, large-scale chemical synthesis in industry and consumer applications, the use of porous materials for this application has received particular interest. Capacitive deionization operates in a fashion with similarities to a supercapacitor. As an ion-containing water (electrolyte) is flown between two porous electrodes with an applied potential across the system, the corresponding ions assemble into a double layer in the pores of the two terminals, decreasing the ion content in the liquid exiting the <b>purification</b> <b>device.</b> Due {{to the ability of}} carbide-derived carbons to closely match the size of ions in the electrolyte, side-by-side comparisons of desalinization devices based on CDCs and activated carbon showed a significant efficiency increase in the 1.2-1.4 V range compared to activated carbon.|$|E

5000|$|He later {{created a}} smaller {{domestic}} version {{and a larger}} mobile version of the air <b>purification</b> <b>device</b> to show its versatility. This device further reduced the ash emissions of the furnace and power plant smokestack emissions. Moreover, it was not limited by design and configuration, meaning that its efficiency remained excellent regardless of industrial or residential applications. This was not true of typical air pollution control technologies, such as electrostatic precipitators, bag houses, and wet scrubbers. The larger the device that utilized these approaches, the more cumbersome and inefficient it became. The core of Stokes' technology was a unique utilization of {{what he described as}} [...] "the three Ts": Temperature, Time and Turbulence. In his patent applications (U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan), he provided only data sufficient to obtain patent approval. Other critical processes involving variations of physics were not revealed, but nevertheless manifest in demonstrations to municipal, state and federal officials and engineering firms such as A.T. Kearney. The ability of the APC-100 to convert particulate matter and toxic gases resulting from the burning of rubber tires and other combustibles to steam was a constant source of intrigue to those who witnessed its operation.|$|E

Annie sneaks away and fights the villain Arsonol, defeating him but really attempting to get herself killed. Max arrives and goes with her to visit her family's graves where she reveals a gravestone in her own name, declaring her old life dead. Max reveals his plan to stop Plutonian, which Armadale and Alana agree will work and will gain Max his redemption. Before he can enact it however, the Vespan, an alien race, telepathically announces to the world that they have captured the Plutonian and he is no longer a threat. [...] In the wake of Plutonian's defeat, the world celebrates. Max chases after and captures Joe Bonn, a pickpocket, but he is confronted by the Paradigm, a group of surviving superheroes, who want to arrest him. [...] After a brief fight, the Paradigm offers Max a membership to help rebuild the world. Max chooses to refuse unless they can repair Coalville first. They agree to create a machine to purify the local water for drinking. Annie arrives, but is accused of being a poser by Paradigm member Qubit and Max tells her that they cannot be partners, causing her to run away. After meeting up with Armadale, Annie incapacitates him and steals the powerful gun he had previously used against Retribution. Meanwhile, Hayes reveals his plan to distract the poor and hungry from his life of wealth and luxury by creating incidents such as the Diamond gang and now he intends to use Max. Max and the Paradigm successfully create the water <b>purification</b> <b>device,</b> but Annie returns and shoots Qubit, killing him. Max tells Annie that he is taking her in for murder.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{development}} of robust but economical hollow fiber ultrafiltration systems {{that could be}} operated with or without electric power to treat polluted surface water. A diverse experimental study was carried out to synthesize novel hollow fiber membranes based on polyphenylsulfone (PPSu) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) fibers for surface water treatment. A manual hollow fiber spinning machine incorporated with an inexpensive spinneret was designed to fabricate hollow fibers from dope compositions of 20 wt% PVDF in DMAc and 20 wt% PPSu in NMP by phase inversion technique. Isothermal ternary phase diagrams of PVDF or PPSu/solvent/non-solvent systems were established using three different solvents such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with water being the non-solvent. The indigenous fibers had an approximate outer diameter of 1. 5 mm and the wall thickness of 0. 25 mm and were housed in inexpensive PVC and UPVC tubes using epoxy resin and nylon end connectors. PVDF hollow fibers (HF) exhibited 94. 8 % turbidity rejection, whereas PPSu fibers exhibited 91 % rejection with 5 log E-Coliform reduction from surface water at a low hydraulic pressure of 1 bar with high flux values of 125 Lm- 2 h- 1 and 73 Lm- 2 h- 1, respectively at a substantial water recovery of 80 %.
