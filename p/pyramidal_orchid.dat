5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid,</b> bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E

5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid</b> (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E

50|$|A {{wide range}} of orchids {{flourish}} including fly orchid, bee orchid, green-winged orchid, fragrant orchid and the greater butterfly <b>orchid.</b> <b>Pyramidal</b> <b>orchids</b> grow in abundance.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} diverse {{habitats}} with mature trees, grassland, scrub and ponds. Flowers include bee and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchids.</b> An orchard has been planted with traditional fruit trees.|$|R
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid</b> grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid</b> are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} end has the river, unimproved grassland, veteran hedges, scrub and woodland. The southern area is more managed, with mown grass {{as well as}} large trees and an area of marshland. Wildlife includes kingfishers, otters, mistletoe and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The site {{is rich in}} wild flowers. The {{limestone}} grassland supports early purple orchid, fragrant <b>orchid</b> and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchids,</b> {{along with}} autumn gentian, vervain, yellow-wort and clustered bellflower. Wild columbine may {{also be seen as}} well as wild liquorice, adder's-tongue, stinking hellebore and the small teasel.|$|R
50|$|The thin chalk soils to {{the east}} of the site support a typical downland plant {{community}} with <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchids</b> being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy skippers, marbled white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown.|$|R
25|$|The {{sand dunes}} are {{initially}} stabilised by marram grass and sea couch grass, enabling colonisation by sea poa grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass, which {{also help to}} bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird’s-foot trefoil and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid</b> are other specialists of this arid habitat.|$|E
25|$|Common {{species of}} tree include oak, ash, sycamore, alder, blackthorn, hawthorn, beech and birch. Less common (but plentiful) are wild cherry and Scots pine (also called red deal). Elm is now far less common, {{due to the}} devastating effects of Dutch elm disease. Gorse (or furze) is very common. A {{priority}} habitat in Wexford is the grey dune, on which many native wild flora grow, including bee orchid and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>orchid.</b> Despite the designation of much of this habitat as a Special Area of Conservation, it remains threatened by destruction for agricultural intensification. There is very little natural forest in the county. Most natural trees and vegetation grow on hedgerows.|$|E
