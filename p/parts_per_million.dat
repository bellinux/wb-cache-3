5|$|Leggetts Creek has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter.

5|$|In 2006, the {{concentration}} of sulfates at several points on Kettle Creek was measured. Upstream of Slide Hollow, it was seven milligrams per liter and in Slide Hollow, it was 910 milligrams per liter.

Above Twomile Run on Kettle Creek, the sulfate concentration was 16 milligrams per liter and at the mouth it was 11 milligrams per liter. Upstream of the acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from under 10 to 17 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>million.</b> In areas affected by acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from 37 to 1375 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>million.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>million</b> of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>million.</b> Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size.

Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium.
