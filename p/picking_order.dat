50|$|Legend has it {{that the}} {{introduction}} of the Spätlese category took place in the Rheingau winery Schloss Johannisberg in 1775, and happened by mere circumstance. Since 1718, permission to start harvest at Johannisberg was announced in writing from the Prince-Bishop of Fulda by means of a so-called autumn courier - Herbstkurier. In 1775, for some reason, the courier sent out by the abbey at Fulda was delayed for 14 days. According to some, the abbey’s messenger was robbed on the way to bring the official harvest <b>picking</b> <b>order.</b> By the time the order finally arrived noble rot had set in, but the harvest was carried out anyway, although no high hopes were staked on the wine from the rotten grapes. But rather than a failed product, the wine turned out to be surprisingly good. Schloss Johannisberg began actively seeking to produce late harvest - Spätlese - wines affected by noble rot. The delayed courier therefore became to be referred to as the Spätlesereiter.|$|E

Combining several single customer orders into one (more substantial) <b>picking</b> <b>order</b> can increase the efficiency of warehouse operations. The Order Batching Problem considered in this paper deals with the question of how different customer orders should be grouped into picking orders, such that the total length of all tours through the warehouse is minimized, which are necessary to collect all requested articles. For the solution of this problem, the authors introduce a Grouping Genetic Algorithm. This genetic algorithm is combined with a local search procedure which results in a highly competitive hybrid algorithm. In a series of extensive numerical experiments, the algorithm is benchmarked against a genetic algorithm with a standard item-oriented encoding scheme.

Three matched groups of habitual chewers were recruited: inhibit-areca, inhibit-non-areca, and control. This study consisted of a Go/No-Go task for inhibition training, followed by a taste test for observing chewing behavior. The Go/No-Go task constituted three phases (pretest, training and posttest).

40|$|Background: The {{e-commerce}} {{growth has}} raised {{awareness about the}} need for more efficient <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> system. That <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> is effective is relevant because it is the most costly and labour-intensive activity in most stocks. E-handelsföretaget currently has problems of getting efficient logistics in the storage area, which is closely related to the efficiency of the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process. As the company uses manual <b>order</b> <b>picking,</b> the costs of the warehouse gets high because of a high human effort. From an economic point of view, it is therefore important for E-handelsföretaget to improve the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process. Published studies of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> systems using manual <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> mainly focuses on random storage. Analytical models to optimize the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process with other approaches for article placement than random storage is not addressed, the study will therefore examine alternative methods for article placement.   Purpose: The purpose of the study is to identify how E-handelsföretaget´s <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process is performed today and to develop a simulation model for the efficiency of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> processes. The simulation model will be applied on E-handelsföretaget in order to improve their <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process.   Method: This study has applied action research, when designing the simulation model the company collaborated in the process. The conduction has been done with interaction between the theoretical framework and the limits of the company. The theoretical framework has been partly built up with articles from One Search, Business Source Premier and Google schoolar. Theoretical litterature from the library at Linnéaus University Library was also used. Empirical data were collected through observation and semi-structured interviews with respondents from different parts of the company.   Conclusion: Eight variables were identified to affect the efficiency in the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process. In a company with manual <b>order</b> <b>picking,</b> higher efficiency in the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process is achieved by reducing walking distances in the picking route. Warehouse layout should be designed according to U-shape, with an even number of aisles and a central location of the pick area. Stock aisles should be parallel and contain shelf compartments. Picking from warehouse performed manually justify a picker-to-part system for <b>order</b> <b>picking,</b> picking should be done directly from the main warehouse. Zoning can be excluded in a small business like E-handelsföretaget. The storage assignment recommended is popularity based article placement. Routing plan using S-shaped method is preferred. The optimal batch size has been simulated specifically for E-handelsföretaget, 24 ordrar per batch is the most appropriate size. The selection of ordrar recommends to be done using Seed method. Simplification of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> and packing can be used as support functions to improve efficiency in <b>order</b> <b>picking.</b> Packaging is recommended done separately from <b>order</b> <b>picking.</b> A simplification of the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> through a merge of retrieval and sorting are recommended...|$|R
40|$|<b>Order</b> <b>picking</b> {{deals with}} the {{retrieval}} of articles from their storage locations {{in order to satisfy}} customer requests. A major issue in manual <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> systems concerns of the transformation and consolidation of customer <b>orders</b> into <b>picking</b> <b>orders</b> (order batching). In practice, customer orders have to be completed by certain due dates in order to avoid delay in the shipment to customers or in production. The composition of the <b>picking</b> <b>orders,</b> their processing times and the sequence according to which they are released {{have a significant impact on}} whether and to which extent given due dates are violated. This paper presents how metaheuristics can be used in order to minimize the total tardiness for a given set of customer orders. The first heuristic is based on Iterated Local Search, the second one is inspired by the Attribute-Based Hill Climber, a heuristic based on a simple tabu search principle. In a series of extensive numerical experiments, the performance of these metaheuristics is analyzed for different classes of instances.

40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) customers. Order batching consists of combining these – indivisible – customer orders into picking orders. With respect to order batching, two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) batching all customer orders are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) batching customer orders become available dynamically over time. This report considers an on-line order batching problem in which the total completion time of all customer orders arriving within a certain time period has to be minimized. The author shows how heuristic approaches for the off-line order batching can be modified {{in order to deal}} with the on-line situation. A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal batching algorithm is used. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a series of extensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate batching method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of customer orders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a new order {{fulfillment}} strategy for LG Electronics Nordic AB. This order fulfillment strategy is called order delivery strategy (ODS) which aims to strike an appropriate balance between order batching and logistics customer service. Whether or not a balance can be achieved on both dimensions at the same time is questionable. However, the author has balanced these dimensions with the help of his own form of analysis which provided specific delivery days for LG’s existing customers. With this main objective in focus, another aim was to investigate what consequences ODS implementation can have on the company’s supply chain performance. To conduct this study the author examined two forms of data. The first research data consisted of interviews with employees at LG. The second data was collected from LG in the form of order data. The author analyzed both forms of data which helped facilitate the concept behind ODS. The results implicated that an ODS implementation improves order <b>picking,</b> <b>order</b> management and logistics customer service at LG. More specifically, the company’s current order fulfillment strategy was analyzed where ODS provided less frequent deliveries to their existing customers. In addition, the findings suggest that LG should focus on medium class customers in Sweden as this does result into the most transportation cost savings and less frequent deliveries. The principal conclusion is that the company should keep their current order fulfillment strategy. However, they should complement this strategy by implementing ODS since it does improve supply chain performance leading to more prosperous results. It is also recommended that LG should follow up their current order fulfillment strategy and ODS every six months. Validerat; 20110720 (anonymous...|$|E

This is where articles temporary are stored before they either are carried on to the next step of the production or to be delivered to the customers of the company. The largest part of the stock keeping often devoted to the order <b>picking.</b> <b>Order</b> picking includes the activities that are occurring when an article is being picked from its stored position and is being transported to the next step of the flow of the materials. The most time- consuming part of the order picking process are often the time to pinpoint and to get the hold of an article. This implies quite likely that an enhancement of the productivity could be realized, inter alia, through cut the transport distances. SKF Mekan AB is an industrial corporation whose primary occupation is to manufacture bearing housings. Currently, the business has a flawed inventory for stock keeping. A great many of the articles stored in the inventory, entitled 104 C, are placed in regard to their measures, without any thought in regard of how frequently the articles are picked. In addition, the article placement that is used today is outdated, which has resulted in that a lot of articles are lacking a specific placement in the inventory. The purpose of storing articles in the inventory 104 C is to cope with fluctuations in the next step of the manufacturing, which is the processing factory.

40|$|The Master Thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at ICA Sverige AB’s warehouse unit in Västerås. The unit {{is a central}} warehouse unit, distribution unit and distribution point. It delivers among others pantry and non-food products. The main part of ICA’s goods is distributed in mobile cages called RC (Rolling Cage) which result in a daily demand of approximately 7000 RC. Hence, the flow of RC to and within the warehouse {{is an important part}} of ICA’s operations. For each <b>picking</b> <b>order</b> a warehouse employee collects four empty RCs from a RC area. Today there are two RC areas. Both placed close to the loading areas for outgoing goods. RC areas are used for storing of empty RC. The purpose of the Master Thesis is to evaluate the most optimal solution of combinations (quantity and location) of RC areas based on minimizing distances and costs. According to the optimization process the problem was charted and simplified. By formulating an optimization model the warehouse employees’ anticipated driving distances are calculated based on given assumptions of combinations of RC areas. The optimization model provides the information needed in order to compare the driving distances and the incurred related costs for different combinations of RC areas. The optimization model was implemented in the programming language Python. The optimization model has been tested for combinations of two, three, four and dynamic RC areas. The conclusions that have been made are based upon minimizing the driving distances, lessen the congestions and to pursue the usage of appropriate areas. The result shows that today’s placement of RC areas is a good solution for a combination of two RC areas. The most beneficial combination of three RC areas gives cost savings of approximately 750 000 SEK/year. A combination of four RC areas results in cost increase and is therefore not preferred. Dynamic RC areas gives cost savings of approximately 112 000 SEK/year for the optimal combination of two fixed RC areas and one dynamic area, and approximately 210 000 SEK/year for a combination of two fixed areas and two dynamic RC areas. Dynamic RC areas require thorough planning. Based on the result, ICA is recommended to evaluate implementing three RC areas in the warehouse unit. To enable three RC areas ICA need to evaluate the overall layout of the warehouse areas and available space. A tool for planning the internal deliveries of empty RC has been created from the result of the optimization model. The tool has the purpose to level the flow of RC to the warehouse unit which could ultimately lead to reduced transports and buffer areas as well as to better control and demand on external deliveries. The tool has been implemented in Microsoft Excel. Title: Optimization of the Store Location and Numbers of Areas for Empty Rolling Cage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} capital structure in the MENA coun- tries. The main interest is to investigate both financial firms specially banks and non-financial firms. This study test the main theories of capital structure, namely: trade off theory and pecking order theory. The countries included in this thesis are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (Include both Abo-Dhabi and Dubai stock indexes), Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine and Jor- dan. The characteristics it covers as suggested by previous literature are tangibility, profitability, risk, debt tax shield, growth, dividends,size, cash flow and liquidity. It will also investigate {{the effect of the}} industry, credit rating and ownership structure on the capital structure This study also investigates the determinants of capital structure in Islamic and conventional banks. This {{is one of the first}} attempts to empirically examine the determinants of capital structure in Islamic and conventional banks in general and in MENA countries in particular. This study fills the gap in this important area of research and can provide a base for future research on capital structure in Islamic banks. This thesis use different models to test the capital structure and these are Panel data models (OLS, Fixed, and Random); Tobit and Dynamical model (Arellano-Bover Blundell-Bond), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Generalised Regression Neural Networks (GRNN). The results suggest that the three methods used in this study lead to similar re- sults with a few exceptions in some countries. This thesis finds that the relation between leverage and the determinants of capital structure is different when using the market or the book leverage. It also finds that the determinants of capital struc- ture between the MENA countries are different. For example, profitability attribute relation with leverage follow the trade-off theory in some countries and follow the <b>picking</b> <b>order</b> theory in other countries. Also, liquidity is significant in all the countries in the sample and have a negative relation to leverage. In addition, tangibility is found to have a mixed results with some countries following the trade-off theory and other countries which follow the trade-off theory but overall it is a key determinant of capital structure. Additionally, the findings show that although that the majority of firms in the MENA countries don’t pay dividends the relation between the long term debt and leverage is negative in all the countries in the sample. The growth opportunities have a negative relation in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Palestine, Qatar and Tunisia but positive in rest of the countries. The cash flow attribute have a negative relation with leverage in all the countries in the sample except Saudi Arabia and Qatar when using the short and long term debt. Furthermore, the ownership variable is expected to have a negative relation when the ultimate owner is an institution. The results show that overall when there is an ultimate owner the leverage will have a negative relation. Suggesting that ultimate owners will force managers to keep a low debt in firms capital structure. This PhD also attempt to investigate the capital structure in banks within the MENA countries. A special focus is on the differences between the Islamic banks and conventional banks capital structure. First, the findings show that the banks follow the same determinants of capital structure as non-financial firms and that regulations are not the main determinant of capital structure in banks. Then, This study show that there is a difference in capital structure of Islamic banks in com- parison with conventional banks. The findings for the dividends variable show that Islamic banks do not follow the pecking order theory but conventional banks don’t. The results of the size variable show that when Islamic banks are large they use less debt in their capital structure. Growth variable show mixed results depending on the use of book or market leverage. Ownership structure show that when there is an ultimate owner leverage increase which is the reverse of the relation in the non-financial firms. The age variable is negative in relation to the book leverage and positive with the market leverage. Also, credit rating relation is different between the two banks, as it is positive with the conventional banks and negative with Islamic banks. Therefore, this study conclude that the main capital structure theories are applicable to MENA countries. Also indicate that Islamic banks have a different capital structure to conventional banks.

Furthermore, a new method is given to determine a layout for the <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> area. The objective is to minimize the average distance traveled per route by the order pickers...|$|R
40|$|Systematics and Trends of <b>Order</b> <b>picking</b> Technics. On the {{way from}} the place of its {{production}} to the place of its consumption every product travels through various types of material flow processes. Specially during the change from "storing" to "transporting" and reverse the functions "order picking" respectively "distributing" are appearing, which both belong to the most complex operations in material flow systems. Because of the multiform general demands made on systems for <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> or distribution, which are increased by the special demands of the certain products, standard solutions for the majority of applications are not available. On the contrary nearly every <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> system specially the an automated one, represents a unique not transferable special solution. In this offered paper a systematic of the differend stages of automation of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> systems will be evolved. The different stages will be explained in the view of science and illustrated with realized exampl es from industry and research institutes. The focal points will be set up in areas as there are for example "order <b>picking</b> without <b>order</b> forms", high-performance-storage-systems, <b>order</b> picking-automats, <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> robots etc. At the end the main aspects and trends of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> will be comprised to deduce a picture of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|The proper {{functioning}} of warehouse processes is fundamental for operational improvement and overall logistic supply chain improvement. <b>Order</b> <b>picking</b> {{is considered one}} of the most important from the group. Throughout <b>picking</b> <b>orders</b> in warehouses, the presence of human work is highly reflected, with the main goal to reduce the process time as much as possible, that is, to the very minimum. There are several different <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> methods, and nowadays, the most common ones are being developed and are significantly dependent on the type of goods, the warehouse equipment, etc., and those that stand out are scanning and picking by voice. This paper will provide information regarding the dairy industry in the Republic of Croatia with the analysis of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> process in the observed company. Overall research highlighted the problem and resulted in proposals of solutions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Order</b> <b>picking</b> is a {{warehouse}} function {{dealing with the}} retrieval of articles from their storage location {{in order to satisfy}} a given demand specified by customer orders. Of all warehouse operations, <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> is considered to include the most cost-intensive ones. Even though there have been different attempts to automate the <b>picking</b> process, manual <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> systems are still prevalent in practice. This article will focus on order batching, one of the main planning issues in <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> systems. <b>Order</b> Batching has been proven to be pivotal for the efficiency of <b>order</b> <b>picking</b> operations. With respect to the availability of information about the customer orders, order batching can be distinguished into static batching and dynamic batching. Improved order batching reduces the total picking time required to collect the requested articles. According to experience from practice, this can result in significant savings of labor cost and into a reduction of the customer order's delivery lead time. The aim of this contribution is to provide comprehensive insights into order batching by giving a detailed state-of-the-art overview of the different solution approaches which have been suggested in the literature. Corresponding to the available publications, the emphasis will be on static order batching. In addition to this, the paper will also review the existing literature for variants and extensions of static order batching (e. g. due dates, alternative objective functions). Furthermore, solution approaches for dynamic order batching problems (like time window batching) will be presented. <b>Order</b> <b>picking</b> system, <b>Order</b> batching, Travel time minimization...|$|R
