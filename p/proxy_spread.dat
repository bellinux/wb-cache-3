This paper establishes a link between returns on CDSs and corresponding equity prices that allows CDS proxy series to be generated that retain important idiosyncratic risk, which is lost in more typical mapping methods. In so doing, the multifactor model developed shows a consistent pricing of credit risk in both the CDS market and the equity market.

We performed a battery of regression analysis with semiannual unbalanced panel data for 101 securities over eight semesters (first semester of 2006 to {{the second half of}} 2009), totaling 382 observations. Seven <b>proxies</b> (bid/ask <b>spread,</b> %zeroreturns, age, amount outstanding, face value, number of bonds, and %time) were used to test the impact of liquidity risk in the yield spreads. Ten other variables (Slope Factor, Credit Risk Factor, risk-free rate, rating, duration, four accounting variables, and equity volatility) were used as yield spread determinants. The null hypothesis that there is no liquidity premium for bonds in the Brazilian secondary market was rejected for only three <b>proxies</b> (bid/ask <b>spread,</b> face value, and number of bonds). The premiums observed were quite small (1. 9 basis points for each 100 -basis-point increase in the bid/ask spread, 0. 5 basis point to 1 % face value increase, and 0. 17 basis point for each issue of at least 1000 bonds). In both cases we observed a loss of efficiency of liquidity proxies following correction for autocorrelations and potential endogeneity, either through the inclusion of fixed effects, first differences analysis, or simultaneous equation analysis. These results point to the fact that liquidity risks may not be of great importance to the expectations of the Brazilian corporate bond secondary market...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{measures of}} distress risk {{ignore the fact}} that firm defaults are correlated and that some defaults are more likely to occur in bad times. The paper uses risk premium computed from corporate credit spreads to measure a firm's exposure to systematic variation in default risk.

In contrast to prior findings in the literature, the authors find that stocks that have higher credit risk premia, that is stocks with higher systematic default risk exposures, have higher expected equity returns. Consistent with structural models of default, they show that the premium to a high-minus-low systematic default risk hedge portfolio is largely explained by the market factor. The authors confirm the robustness of these results by using an alternative systematic default risk factor for firms that do not have bonds outstanding.

We address the problem of studying the joint distributions and evolutions of S&P 500 return and credit spreads. Graphical and non parametric statistical analysis (i. e. : Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho) show that such bivariate distributions are asymmetric with some negative relationship between S&P 500 return and credit spreads. In-deed, credit spreads widen when S&P 500 return decreases or drops under some given level. We investigate then this stylized fact using copula functions to characterize observed dependence structures between S&P 500 return and credit spreads. We focus at least on one parameter copulas and at most on one parameter Archimedean copulas, namely Gumbel, FGM, Frank and Clayton copula functions.

The results are consistent with separate research on money's worth ratios, and indicate the need to develop appropriate financial instruments, allowing providers to hedge their risks while extracting higher returns, and also to ensure competition and transparency in annuities markets, in order to ensure good outcomes for annuitants.

Highly educated neighbours accelerate women’s contraceptive use overall, but not their artificial method use. Highly religious neighbours slow women’s artificial method use, but not their contraceptive use overall.

An important advantage of JADE is that it implements this idea over a well-known object-oriented language, Java, providing a simple and friendly API. The succeeding simple design selections were influenced by the agent abstraction. An agent is autonomous and proactive because agent cannot deliver call-backs or its own object reference to other agents in order to diminish any chance of other objects appointing control of its services. An agent must have its own thread of execution, using it to control its life cycle and decide autonomously when to perform which actions. An agent needing to interact must {{send a message to}} an identified destination (or set of destinations). There is no time-based dependency between the receiver and senders. A receiver might not be accessible when the sender gives the message. Getting the object reference of receiver agents is not necessary but just name identities that the message conveyance system is able to direct into accurate transport addresses. It is even promising that a precise receiver uniqueness be unknown to the sender, which in its place may define a receiver set using a planned grouping (e.g. all the agents that deliver the ‘Book-Selling’ service) or intermediated by a <b>proxy</b> agent (e.g. <b>spread</b> this message to all agents in the area ‘selling.book.it’ [14].|$|R
40|$|The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has {{validated}} {{and made}} publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 square degrees of five-band (u g r i z) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367, 360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 degrees of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach {{a depth of}} r ~ 22. 2 (95 % completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2 % rms and 100 milli-arcsec rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through {{a new version of}} the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good <b>proxy</b> for point <b>spread</b> function (PSF) magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 A to 9200 A at a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars, and has substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines, and included in the Second Data Release. The data are publically available as of 2004 March 15 via the web sites [URL] and [URL]. Comment: 24 pages, submitted to AJ.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the impact of counterparty-risk in CDS (Credit Default Swap) pricing. The {{exponential}} growth of the Credit Derivatives Market in the last decade demands an upsurge in the fair valuation of various credit derivatives such as the Credit Default Swap (CDS), the Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO). Financial institutions suffered great losses from Credit Derivatives in the sub-prime mortgage market during the credit crunch period. Counterparty risk in CDS contracts has been intensively studied with a focus on losses for protection buyers due to joint defaults of counterparty and reference entity. Using a contagion framework introduced by Jarrow and Yu (2001) [48], we calculate the swap premium rate based on the change of measure technique, and further extend both the two-firm and three-firm model (with defaultable protection buyer) with continuous premium payment. The results show more explanatory power than the discrete case. We improve the continuous contagion model by relaxing the constant intensity rate assumption and found close results without loss of generality. Empirically this thesis studies the behaviour of the historical credit spread of 55 sample corporates/ financial institutions, a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model is applied to calibrate <b>spread</b> parameters. A <b>proxy</b> for counterparty <b>spread</b> is introduced as the difference between the spread over benchmark rate and spread over swap rate for 5 year maturity CDS. We then investigate counterparty risk during the crisis and study the shape of term structure for the counterparty spread, where Rebonato’s framework is deployed to model the dynamics of the term structure using a regime-switching framework.

40|$|International audienceThe {{view that}} Aurignacian {{technologies}} and their associated symbolic manifestations represent the archaeological <b>proxy</b> for the <b>spread</b> of Anatomically Modern Humans into Europe, {{is supported by}} few diagnostic human remains, including those from the Aurignacian site of Les Rois in south-western France. Here we reassess the taxonomic attribution of the human remains, their cultural affiliation, and provide five new radiocarbon dates for the site. Patterns of tooth growth along with the morphological and morphometric analysis of the human remains indicate that a juvenile mandible showing cutmarks presents some Neandertal features, whereas another mandible is attributed to Anatomically Modern Humans. Reappraisal of the archaeological sequence demonstrates that human remains derive from two layers dated to 28 – 30 kyr BP attributed to the Aurignacian, the only cultural tradition detected at the site. Three possible explanations may account for this unexpected evidence. The first {{one is that the}} Aurignacian was exclusively produced by AMH and that the child mandible from unit A 2 represents evidence for consumption or, more likely, symbolic use of a Neandertal child by Aurignacian AMH. The second possible explanation is that Aurignacian technologies were produced at Les Rois by human groups bearing both AMH and Neandertal features. Human remains from Les Rois would be in this case the first evidence of a biological contact between the two human groups. The third possibility is that all human remains from Les Rois represent an AMH population with conserved plesiomorphic characters suggesting a larger variation in modern humans from the Upper Palaeolithic...|$|R
