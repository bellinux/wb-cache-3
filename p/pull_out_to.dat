5|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{consolidate}} the newly captured positions. The 41st Division, on the right flank, had reached its portion of the Blue Line and captured Flers but the 47th Division lagged behind. The New Zealanders remained exposed to enfilade fire along their left flank and German artillery fire also hampered attempts to shore up their positions. The 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade began {{an attack on the}} final objective, Red Line, at 10:50am and secured a portion of the Grove Alley trenches by midday despite heavy casualties. However, the 47th Division had still not been able to secure its first objective while the 41st Division had to withdraw from Flers village. This left the New Zealanders in a salient exposed to heavy machine gun fire on both flanks. At 2:00pm Germans were spotted advancing from the northeast. Captain Lindsay Inglis, the senior surviving officer in this area of Grove Alley, gave orders to strengthen the corresponding section of the line. When a platoon began moving to effect the order, this was misinterpreted as a withdrawal and the remaining elements of the battalion began to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Flers village. Inglis was able to check the withdrawal, but with only 120 men, he opted to dig in where they were rather than try to reoccupy Grove Alley.|$|E

25|$|The 1st/401st GIR, {{fighting}} {{its first}} action, lagged behind the paratroop units {{and got into}} a day-long battle at Basse-Addeville. At 1600 it was ordered to reverse to the west, pass through {{the gap between the}} 501st and 506th, and take the town. The 506th also sent patrols forward and both advances were unopposed. Individuals of III./1058, in heavy combat for two days, had been withdrawing without orders during the day, putting the defense in danger of collapse. As a result, Otl. von der Heydte ordered II./FJR6 to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the west, cross the river, and move towards Carentan along the railroad embankment, demolishing the railroad bridge as they did. Although mop-up attacks captured the 6th's Fallschirmjäger's regimental train of 40 carts, most of the defenders escaped, blowing up the second of the four causeway bridges and a portion of the railroad embankment in the process.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{came back}} after its first loss in 29 games to set beat the Los Angeles Dons in a blowout as Graham set an AAFC single-game {{touchdown}} record. Graham threw seven touchdowns, including four to Lavelli and two to Speedie, beating the old record of five. Lavelli's 209 receiving yards {{were also a}} league record, and his four scores tied a professional football record set by Don Hutson. The Browns had 423 passing yards in the game. The game started with an 80-yard drive by the Browns that ended with one of Graham's touchdown passes to Lavelli. The Dons then tied {{the game with a}} touchdown of their own after an 11-play drive. From there, however, the Browns pulled away with six unanswered touchdowns, including three to Lavelli in the second quarter alone. The Dons scored once in the fourth quarter on a rush by Taliaferro, but Cleveland added two more touchdowns in the period to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a 61–14 victory. While the blowout was a welcome reprieve after the loss to San Francisco, the Browns lost halfback Edgar Jones to a broken collarbone. Jones, who had been productive early in the season, was forced to sit {{out the rest of the}} regular season, returning for the playoffs. A week after the game, when the Browns had a bye, the Yankees beat the 49ers, propelling the Browns back into first place in the AAFC standings. The win gave the Yankees a 5–1 record and a tie for first place with Cleveland ahead of the 49ers, who were 6–2.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to change strategy is sometimes claimed {{as a major}} mistake by OKL. It is argued that persisting with attacks on RAF airfields might have won air superiority for the Luftwaffe. Others argue that the Luftwaffe made little impression on Fighter Command {{in the last week}} of August and first week of September and that the shift in strategy was not decisive. It has also been argued that it was doubtful the Luftwaffe could have won air superiority before the [...] "weather window" [...] began to deteriorate in October. It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the Kriegsmarine would have made the projected German invasion, Unternehmen Seelöwe (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.|$|E

The jolly-boat might carry a dozen men at need, though they would be crowded and much exposed to fire; and he, therefore, caused eight to get into her, and to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the launch. Mr. Leach went with this party, for the double purpose of directing its movements, and of being separated from his commander, in order {{that one of those}} who were of so much importance to the packet, might at least stand a chance of being saved. This separation also was effected without alarming the Arabs, though Captain Truck observed that the sheik watched the proceeding narrowly.|$|E
60|$|Pomfrey was a gentleman, and as {{such was}} amazed, dismayed, and cruelly embarrassed. If she was a simple bather from some {{vicinity}} hitherto unknown and unsuspected by him, it was clearly his business to shut up his glass {{and go back to}} his garden patch--although the propinquity of himself and the lighthouse must have been as plainly visible to her as she was to him. On the other hand, if she was the survivor of some wreck and in distress--or, as he even fancied from her reckless manner, bereft of her senses, his duty to rescue her was equally clear. In his dilemma he determined upon a compromise and ran to his boat. He would <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, pass between the rocks and the curving sand-spit, and examine the sands and sea more closely for signs of wreckage, or some overlooked waiting boat near the shore. He would be within hail if she needed him, or she could escape to her boat if she had one.|$|E
60|$|Marble {{and myself}} {{observed}} that the canoe, in which the messengers left us, did not <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, but that it entered a small stream, or creek, that communicated {{with the head of}} the bay. As there was no duty on board, we asked the captain's permission to explore this spot; and, at the same time, to make a more thorough examination of our haven, generally. The request being granted, we got into the yawl, with four men, all of us armed, and set out on our little expedition. Smudge, a withered, grey-headed old Indian, with muscles however that resembled whip-cord, was alone on deck, when this movement took place. He watched our proceedings narrowly, and, when he saw us descend into the boat, he very coolly slipped down the ship's side, and took his place in the stern-sheets, with as much quiet dignity as if he had been captain. Marble was a good deal of a ship's martinet in such matters, and he did not more than half like the familiarity and impudence of the procedure.|$|E

60|$|Giselle Viola, {{with her}} head resting {{against the wall of}} the house, her eyes half closed, and her little feet, in white {{stockings}} and black slippers, crossed over each other, seemed to surrender herself, tranquil and fatal, to the gathering dusk. The charm of her body, the promising mysteriousness of her indolence, went out into the night of the Placid Gulf like a fresh and intoxicating fragrance spreading out in the shadows, impregnating the air. The incorruptible Nostromo breathed her ambient seduction in the tumultuous heaving of his breast. Before leaving the harbour he had thrown off the store clothing of Captain Fidanza, for greater ease in the long <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the islands. He stood before her in the red sash and check shirt as he used to appear on the Company's wharf--a Mediterranean sailor come ashore to try his luck in Costaguana. The dusk of purple and red enveloped him, too--close, soft, profound, as no more than fifty yards from that spot it had gathered evening after evening about the self-destructive passion of Don Martin Decoud's utter scepticism, flaming up to death in solitude.|$|E
60|$|What {{is true for}} {{one point}} in the sun's disc, is true for every point in it. Accordingly, the {{signaller}} sees an image of the sun, and not a mere speck of light, in the lens; and the part of the landscape which that image appears to overlay, is precisely that part of it over which the flash from his mirror extends; or, in other words, it is that from any point of which a distant spectator may see some part or other of the sun's disc reflected in the mirror. There is no difficulty in signalling when the sun is far behind the back, if the eye-tubes are made to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a total length of five inches, otherwise the shadow of the head interferes. For want of space, the drawing represents the tubes as only partly drawn out. The instrument is perfectly easy to manage, and letters can be signalled by flashes. Its power is perfectly marvellous. On a day so hazy that colours on the largest scale--such as green fields and white houses--are barely distinguishable at seven miles' distance, a looking-glass no larger than the finger-nail transmits its signals clearly visible to the naked eye.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} for Decoud but {{to remain on the}} island. He {{received}} from Nostromo's hands whatever food the foresight of Captain Mitchell had put on board the lighter and deposited it temporarily in the little dinghy which on their arrival they had hauled up out of sight amongst the bushes. It was to be left with him. The island was to be a hiding-place, not a prison; he could <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a passing ship. The O.S.N. Company's mail boats passed close to the islands when going into Sulaco from the north. But the Minerva, carrying off the ex-president, had taken the news up north of the disturbances in Sulaco. It was possible that the next steamer down would get instructions to miss the port altogether since the town, as far as the Minerva's officers knew, was for the time being {{in the hands of the}} rabble. This would mean that there would be no steamer for a month, as far as the mail service went; but Decoud had to take his chance of that. The island was his only shelter from the proscription hanging over his head. The Capataz was, of course, going back. The unloaded lighter leaked much less, and he thought that she would keep afloat as far as the harbour.|$|E

That sent me well ahead o' the Flint, an' so I got here before him. Havin' ways of eavesdroppin' that other people don't know on, I peeped into the cave here, and saw and heard how matters stood. Then I thought o' harkin' back on my tracks an' stoppin' the Flint wi' a bullet but I reflected `what good'll that do? The shot would wake up the outlaws an' putt them on the scent all the same.' Then I tried to listen what their talk was about, so as I might be up to their dodges; but I hadn't bin listenin' long when in tramps the Flint an' sounds the alarm. Of course I might have sent him an p'r'aps one o' the others to their long home from where I stood; but I've always had an objection to shoot a man behind his back. It has such a sneakin' sort o' feel about it! An' then, the others--I couldn't see how many there was--would have swarmed out on me, an' I'd have had to make tracks for the scrub, an' larn nothin' more. So I fixed to keep quiet an' hear and see all that I could--p'r'aps find out where they fixed to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to.</b> But I heard nothin' more worth tellin'. They only made some hurried, an' by no means kindly, observations about poor Buck an' Leather an' went off over the hills.

6000|$|... "I {{found my}} {{existence}} so charming, and led a life so [...] agreeable to my humour, that I resolved here to end my days. [...] My {{only source of}} disquiet was whether I should be allowed [...] to carry my project out. In {{the midst of the}} presentiments [...] that disturbed me, I would fain have had them make a [...] perpetual prison of my refuge, to confine me in it for all [...] the rest of my life. I longed for them to cut off all chance [...] and all hope of leaving it; to forbid me holding any [...] communication with the mainland, so that, knowing nothing [...] {{of what was going on}} in the world, I might have forgotten [...] the world's existence, and people might have forgotten mine [...] too. They only suffered me to pass two months in the island, [...] but I could have passed two years, two centuries, and all [...] eternity, without a moment's weariness, though I had not, [...] with my companion, any other society than that of the [...] steward, his wife, and their servants. They were in truth [...] honest souls and nothing more, but that was just what I [...] wanted.... Carried thither in a violent hurry, alone and [...] without a thing, I afterwards sent for my housekeeper, my [...] books, and my scanty possessions, of which I had the delight [...] of unpacking nothing, leaving my boxes and chests just as [...] they had come, and dwelling in the house where I counted on [...] ending my days, exactly as if it were an inn whence I must [...] needs set forth on the morrow. All things went so well, just [...] as they were, that to think of ordering them better were to [...] spoil them. One of my greatest joys was to leave my books [...] safely fastened up in their boxes, and to be without even a [...] case for writing. When any luckless letter forced me to take [...] up a pen for an answer, I grumblingly borrowed the steward's [...] inkstand, and hurried to give it back to him with all the [...] haste I could, in the vain hope that I should never have [...] need of the loan any more. Instead of meddling with those [...] weary quires and reams and piles of old books, I filled my [...] chamber with flowers and grasses, for I was then in my first [...] fervour for botany. Having given up employment that would be [...] a task to me, I needed one that would be an amusement, nor [...] cause me more pains than a sluggard might choose to take. I [...] undertook to make the Flora petrinsularis, and to describe [...] every single plant on the island, in detail enough to occupy [...] me for the rest of my days. In consequence of this fine [...] scheme, every morning after breakfast, which we all took in [...] company, I used to go with a magnifying glass in my hand and [...] my Systema Naturæ under my arm, to visit some district of [...] the island. I had divided it for that purpose into small [...] squares, meaning to go through them one after another in [...] each season of the year. At the end of two or three hours I [...] used to return laden with an ample harvest, a provision for [...] amusing myself after dinner indoors, in case of rain. I [...] spent the rest of the morning in going with the steward, his [...] wife, and Theresa, to see the labourers and the harvesting, [...] and I generally set to work along with them; many a time [...] when people from Berne came to see me, they found me perched [...] on a high tree, with a bag fastened round my waist; I kept [...] filling it with fruit and then let it down to the ground [...] with a rope. The exercise I had taken in the morning and the [...] good humour that always comes from exercise, made the repose [...] of dinner vastly pleasant to me. But if dinner was kept up [...] too long, and fine weather invited me forth, I could not [...] wait, but was speedily off to throw myself all alone into a [...] boat, which, when the water was smooth enough, I used to [...] <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the middle of the lake. There, stretched at full [...] length in the boat's bottom, with my eyes turned up to the [...] sky, I let myself float slowly hither and thither as the [...] water listed, sometimes for hours together, plunged in a [...] thousand confused delicious musings, which, though they had [...] no fixed nor constant object, were not the less on that [...] account a hundred times dearer to me than all that I had [...] found sweetest in what they call the pleasures of life. [...] Often warned by the going down of the sun that it was time [...] to return, I found myself so far from the island that I was [...] forced to row with all my might to get in before it was [...] pitch dark. At other times, instead of losing myself in the [...] midst of the waters, I had a fancy to coast along the green [...] shores of the island, where the clear waters and cool [...] shadows tempted me to bathe. But one of my most frequent [...] expeditions was from the larger island to the less; there I [...] disembarked and spent my afternoon, sometimes in mimic [...] rambles among wild elders, persicaries, willows, and shrubs [...] of every species, sometimes settling myself on the top of a [...] sandy knoll, covered with turf, wild thyme, flowers, even [...] sainfoin and trefoil that had most likely been sown there in [...] old days, making excellent quarters for rabbits. They might [...] multiply in peace without either fearing anything or harming [...] anything. I spoke of this to the steward. He at once had [...] male and female rabbits brought from Neuchâtel, and we went [...] in high state, his wife, one of his sisters, Theresa, and I, [...] to settle them in the little islet. The foundation of our [...] colony was a feast-day. The pilot of the Argonauts was not [...] prouder than I, as I bore my company and the rabbits in [...] triumph from our island to the smaller one....|$|E
