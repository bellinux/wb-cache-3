50|$|The {{cases of}} dengue fever have {{increased}} dramatically since the 1970s {{and it continues}} to become more prevalent. The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have <b>permanent</b> <b>immunity</b> to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.

5000|$|Himmelwright was an {{environmentalist}} before his time whose belief in sustainable building practices is strongly stated in his preface to A Model Fire-Proof Farm House. He wrote:"A new epoch in home building is at hand. The wasteful, shortsighted and ephemeral {{methods of the}} past have become intolerable, and on account of our depleted timber supply, will soon be impossible.The conservation of the world's natural resources is attracting universal attention, and will undoubtedly receive {{a large portion of}} the best thought and consideration of the present generation. The conservation of individual resources and energy will follow as a natural consequence, and that is the keynote of this volume."The reckless destruction of our forests by the early settlers, supplemented by the wasteful practices of the large lumber companies, and finally, the enormous destruction by forest fires, have brought about greatly changed conditions. Our timber supply has been depleted to such an extent that according to statistics prepared by the United States Government, we take from our forests each year, not counting loss and waste, three and one half times their yearly growth; in other words, we use forty cubic feet per acre for each twelve cubic feet grown. We use two hundred and sixty cubic feet per capita, while Germany uses thirty-seven and France thirty-five. The large per capita consumption in the United States is attributable partly to our great fire losses, but principally to the ephemeral and flimsy character of our buildings. If the present rate of demand and supply is not changed, our timber resources will be entirely exhausted in a few years. Such a result would have far reaching consequences, and would be a national calamity. This can be averted, (1) by substituting incombustible and more durable materials for wood, and (2) by employing proper safeguards and appliances, thus preventing a large part of the annual fire loss."Twenty to fifty years ago when timber was abundant and the best only was selected for building purposes, much more durable houses were built than at present. Large sized and heavy pieces were used for the framing and the beams. These were frequently hewn by hand, so as to utilize the heart which is the best and most durable part of the timber."The cost of lumber is now from two to five times as great as formerly, and the quality is generally much inferior. Wood or [...] "frame" [...] buildings, as now constructed, are serviceable only for periods of from twenty to fifty years. After this comparatively short term, they become unsafe for human habitation and can be utilized only for a few years more for storage, after which, if not demolished, they decay, become dangerous, and finally fall to pieces. By frequent painting, prompt repairs, renewals of roofs, sills, etc., the period of serviceability may sometimes be extended twenty to thirty years longer , but this presumes a practical knowledge of building construction, the exercise of intelligent watchfulness and judgment, and a willingness to expend money for repairs before such repairs are actually necessary— a combination seldom found in present day owners."The home builders of the past generally took cognizance of their own immediate necessities and requirements only, and planned and built their homes accordingly. Such a course was the direct result of the fact that the serviceability of the buildings was limited to a period of one or two generations. In the design of a building which is to endure for an indefinite period, other features and a broader policy must influence the design. Instead of planning for his own family or his immediate successors, the designer of an enduring home must plan it so as to fulfill the requirements of an average family. Planned in this way, such a building will always be suitable for a majority of its future occupants and will have the maximum value."Himmelwright concluded the introduction, adding these comments linking family values to engineering and sustainable building practices:"A home built of durable and incombustible materials...conserves the resources and energies of the original owner and all his descendants. Its deterioration is inappreciable for from ten to twenty generations, during which time it retains its full original value, plus the added value due to the subsequent development and improvement of the section in which it is located. Consequently, it is a valuable inheritance to each succeeding generation. Furthermore, such a home is cumulative in its tendency and effect, in so far as its contents are concerned. Being durable, and fire-proof, it becomes a permanent receptacle for all the objects of intrinsic and sentimental value, accumulated by the original owner and his descendants; each generation adding its quota to the family treasures, until the home becomes a veritable storehouse of ever increasing value, not only financially, but educationally, and artistically. True, there may be periodical divisions and distributions of some of the contents, but this involves no sacrifice of actual value, and articles removed in this way often find their way back to such a home after the lapse of time. But by far the most important feature of a home of this character is the security and <b>permanent</b> <b>immunity</b> it affords against destruction by fire."An enduring and fire-proof home, therefore, conserves the energy and resources of the successive owners, assures permanent safety, comfort and satisfaction, and unlike a frame building, it retains indefinitely its full value as an asset and inheritance." ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{biological}} mechanisms underlying episodic outbreaks {{of infectious diseases}} is one of mathematical epidemiology’s major goals.

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a re-emerging infection whose intermittent bouts of large multiannual epidemics interspersed between periods of smaller-amplitude cycles remain an enigma. It {{has been suggested that}} recent increases in pertussis incidence and shifts in the age-distribution of cases may be due to diminished natural immune boosting. Here we show that a model that incorporates this mechanism can account for a unique set of pre-vaccine-era data from Copenhagen. Under this model, immune boosting induces transient bursts of large amplitude outbreaks.

Present emphasis is on the major or principal outer membrane proteins of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, based on evidence for neutralizing antibodies directed against surface-exposed variable domains of each of these proteins.

40|$|Immunology is a {{complicated}} subject, and a detailed discussion of it {{is beyond the scope}} of this text. However, an understanding of the basic function of the immune system is useful in order to understand both how vaccines work and the basis of recommendations for their use. The description that follows is simplified. Many excellent immunology textbooks are available to provide additional detail. Immunity is the ability of the human body to tolerate the presence of material indigenous to the body (“self”), and to eliminate foreign (“nonself”) material. This discriminatory ability provides protection from infectious disease, since most microbes are identified as foreign by the immune system. Immunity to a microbe is usually indicated by the presence of antibody to that organism. Immunity is gener ally specific to a single organism or group of closely related organisms. There are two basic mechanisms for acquiring immunity, active and passive. Active immunity is protection that is produced by the person’s own immune system. This type of <b>immunity</b> is usually <b>permanent.</b> Passive <b>immunity</b> is protection by products produced by an animal or human and transferred to another human, usually by injection. Passive immunity often provides effective protection, but this protection wanes (disappears) with time, usually within a few weeks or months. The immune system is a complex system of interacting cells whose primary purpose is to identify foreign (“nonself”) substances referred to as antigens. Antigens can be either live (such as viruses and bacteria) or inactivated. The immune system develops a defense against the antigen. This defense is known as the immune response and usually involves the production of protein molecules by B lymphocytes, called antibodies (or immunoglobulins), and of specific cells (also known as cell-mediated immunity) whose purpose is to facilitate the elimination of foreign substances...|$|R

In At Home with the Diplomats, Iver B. Neumann offers unprecedented access to the inner workings of a foreign ministry. Neumann worked for several years at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he had an up-close view of how diplomats conduct their business and how they perceive their own practices. In this book he shows us how diplomacy is conducted on a day-to-day basis. Approaching contemporary diplomacy from an anthropological perspective, Neumann examines the various aspects of diplomatic work and practice, including <b>immunity,</b> <b>permanent</b> representation, diplomatic sociability, accreditation, and issues of gender equality. Neumann shows that the diplomat working abroad and the diplomat at home are engaged in two different modes of knowledge production. Diplomats in the field focus primarily on gathering and processing information. In contrast, the diplomat based in his or her home capital is caught up in the seemingly endless production of texts: reports, speeches, position papers, and the like. Neumann leaves the reader with a keen sense of the practices of diplomacy: relations with foreign ministries, mediating between other people's positions while integrating personal and professional into a cohesive whole, adherence to compulsory routines and agendas, and, above all, the generation of knowledge. Yet even as they come to master such quotidian tasks, diplomats are regularly called upon to do exceptional things, such as negotiating peace...|$|R
