5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as <b>Pluto</b> (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and <b>Pluto</b> started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to <b>Pluto</b> as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to <b>Pluto</b> (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or <b>Pluto</b> would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as <b>Pluto</b> would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if <b>Pluto</b> were to remain a planet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pluto</b> {{has five}} known moons: Charon (the largest, with a {{diameter}} {{just over half}} that of <b>Pluto),</b> Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. <b>Pluto</b> and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.|$|E
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. <b>Pluto</b> is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that <b>Pluto</b> makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time <b>Pluto</b> is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind <b>Pluto.</b> By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of <b>Pluto.</b> <b>Pluto</b> and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between <b>Pluto</b> and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pluto's</b> {{surface color}} has changed between 1994 and 2003: the {{northern}} polar region has brightened {{and the southern}} hemisphere has darkened. <b>Pluto's</b> overall redness has also increased substantially between 2000 and 2002. These rapid changes are probably related to seasonal condensation and sublimation of portions of <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere, amplified by <b>Pluto's</b> extreme axial tilt and high orbital eccentricity.|$|R
40|$|Combining stellar {{occultation}} observations probing <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere from 1988 to 2013 {{and models}} of energy balance between <b>Pluto's</b> surface and atmosphere, {{we conclude that}} <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere does not collapse {{at any point in}} its 248 -year orbit. The occultation results show an increasing atmospheric pressure with time in the current epoch, a trend present only in models with a high thermal inertia and a permanent N 2 ice cap at <b>Pluto's</b> north rotational pole.

5|$|Additionally, the {{definition}} kept <b>Pluto</b> as a planet. Pluto's planetary status {{was and is}} fondly thought of by many, especially in the United States since <b>Pluto</b> was found by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, {{and the general public}} could have been alienated from professional astronomers; there was considerable uproar when the media last suggested, in 1999, that <b>Pluto</b> might be demoted, which was a misunderstanding of a proposal to catalog all trans-Neptunian objects uniformly.|$|E
5|$|Clyde Tombaugh's {{discovery}} of <b>Pluto</b> in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and <b>Pluto</b> was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, <b>Pluto</b> was conclusively {{determined to be}} too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune's mass. After 1992, the {{discovery of}} numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than <b>Pluto</b> led to a debate over whether <b>Pluto</b> should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although {{a number of the}} larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified <b>Pluto</b> and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 onward, many {{bodies were}} {{discovered}} orbiting {{in the same}} volume as <b>Pluto,</b> showing that <b>Pluto</b> {{is part of a}} population of objects called the Kuiper belt. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether <b>Pluto</b> should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting <b>Pluto</b> from planetary models of the Solar System. The Hayden Planetarium reopened—in February 2000, after renovation—with a model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere creates a temperature inversion, {{with the average}} temperature of its atmosphere tens of degrees warmer than its surface, though observations by New Horizons have revealed <b>Pluto's</b> upper atmosphere to be far colder than expected (70 K, as opposed to about 100 K). <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere is divided into roughly 20 regularly spaced haze layers up to 150 km high, {{thought to be the}} result of pressure waves created by airflow across <b>Pluto's</b> mountains.|$|R

5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of <b>Pluto's</b> moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate <b>Pluto's</b> mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected. <b>Pluto's</b> mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller even than the Earth's Moon, although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|R
5|$|In Strozzi's {{version of}} the story, an amorous {{shepherd}} Pachino invokes the aid of <b>Pluto,</b> ruler of the underworld, to cure his unrequited obsession with Proserpine. <b>Pluto</b> obliges by turning Pachino into a mountain, though promising his soul a place in Elysium. After being struck by a love-dart fired by Cupid, <b>Pluto</b> falls for Proserpine and claims her as his queen. Initially she resists him, but when Ciane her protector is turned by <b>Pluto</b> into a spring of water, she is overcome. Submissively, she vows obedience; the strength of her beauty is such that <b>Pluto</b> softens, and pledges that in future he will treat lovers less harshly.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as <b>Pluto,</b> now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. <b>Pluto</b> came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to <b>Pluto</b> as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include <b>Pluto</b> in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} {{to explore the}} Kuiper belt, New Horizons, was launched, which flew by <b>Pluto</b> on July 14, 2015. Beyond the <b>Pluto</b> flyby, the mission's goal was to locate and investigate other, farther objects in the Kuiper belt.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{questions}} the mission attempts to answer are: What is <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere made of {{and how does it}} behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How do solar wind particles interact with <b>Pluto's</b> atmosphere? ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Pluto</b> (minor-planet designation: 134340 <b>Pluto)</b> is a dwarf {{planet in}} the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to <b>Pluto</b> in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or <b>Pluto</b> would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as <b>Pluto</b> would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to <b>Pluto)</b> to appear to be slightly larger than <b>Pluto,</b> and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of <b>Pluto</b> near perihelion. However, while <b>Pluto</b> can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} {{of several other}} trans-Neptunian objects approaching the size of <b>Pluto,</b> such as Quaoar and Sedna, continued to erode arguments that <b>Pluto</b> was exceptional {{from the rest of}} the trans-Neptunian population. On July 29, 2005, Mike Brown and his team announced the {{discovery of}} a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be more massive than <b>Pluto,</b> named Eris.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of these large KBOs in orbits similar to Pluto's led many to conclude that, aside from its relative size, <b>Pluto</b> {{was not particularly}} different from {{other members of the}} Kuiper belt. Not only are these objects similar to <b>Pluto</b> in size, but many also have satellites, and are of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on <b>Pluto</b> and on the largest KBOs). Thus, just as Ceres was considered a planet before the {{discovery of}} its fellow asteroids, some began to suggest that <b>Pluto</b> might also be reclassified.|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet <b>Pluto</b> (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. <b>Pluto</b> has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. <b>Pluto</b> has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that <b>Pluto</b> orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pluto's</b> {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, <b>Pluto's</b> orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of <b>Pluto's</b> orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|R

5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for <b>Pluto</b> to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects {{approaching}} its size {{had been found in}} the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. <b>Pluto</b> was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to <b>Pluto</b> were discovered in the region, it was argued that <b>Pluto</b> should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than <b>Pluto</b> and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying <b>Pluto</b> as a minor planet.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} {{of the early}} 21st century, astronomers had no real need for a formal {{definition}} for planets. With the discovery of <b>Pluto</b> in 1930, astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets. <b>Pluto</b> {{was thought to be}} larger than Mercury.|$|E
