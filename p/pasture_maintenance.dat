5000|$|Parrots as a whole, {{being of}} the family Psittacidae, {{are some of the}} most {{threatened}} birds in the world. This family has the most endangered species of all bird families, especially in the neotropics, the natural home of the hyacinth macaw, where 46 of 145 species are at a serious risk of global extinction. This species qualifies as endangered on the IUCN Red List because the population has suffered rapid reductions with the remaining threats of illegal trapping for the cage bird trade and habitat loss [...] A few serious threats to the survival of the species in the Pantanal include human activities, mainly those resulting in habitat loss, the burning of land for <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and illegal trapping [...] The exceptionally noisy, fearless, curious, sedentary, and predictable nature of this species, along with its specialization to only one or two species of palm in each part of its range, makes them especially vulnerable to capture, shooting, and habitat destruction. Eggs are also regularly preyed on by corvids, opossums, and coatis. Adults have no known natural predators. The young are parasitized by larvae of flies of the genus Philornis.|$|E
50|$|The Andes is of {{particular}} interest because of its known importance as a biodiversity hot spot, as a provider of water to a grand human population, and its vulnerability to climate change and deforestation. The Andean forest stand as the second most fragmented natural habitat In Colombia. Recent causes of deforestation in this region has shifted to illicit crops and cattle grazing. From 2007-2010, 340,842 Ha of forest were lost, while 633 Ha of illicit crops and 225,279 Ha of pastures were added. The Deforestation rate of 0.67% found in the Colombian Andes is higher than the average deforestation rate reported for South American forests 0.38%. However, low lands in this region experience deforestation at higher rates than mountain lands because the population is mainly concentrated in mountain top areas. From 1990 to 2005 montane forests went from 7,335,125 ha to 6,405,591 ha (0.63%), and for lowland forest change from 3,671,768 ha to 3,123,369 ha (0.75%). Throughout the decades, deforestation in the Colombian Andean zone has only accelerated (Vina). By 1998, 69% of the Andean forest and 30% of the lowland Andean forests were cleared. In 2000 the remaining natural cover in Los Andes was 39%, that means that over 60% of its natural coverage has been lost and today this region continues to through natural resource extraction including exploitation, settlement and deforestation. Deforestation was mostly accounted to cropping 32% and cattle ranching activities for its remaining. In the montane forest deforestation was affected by land tenure of small parcels, road, water presence, and temperature. In the lowlands deforestation was associated with population, crops (licit and illicit), protected areas and temperature. The introduction of the oil industry in the 1990s and its promise of high wages has generated deforestation and migration of local farmers who abandoned their <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance</b> to enter the extraction industry.|$|E

40|$|International audienceForest {{ecosystems}} of Brazilian Amazonia are {{cleared to}} allow livestock production. Deforestation contributes significantly {{to climate change}} and losses of biodiversity. Degradation by scrubs reduces pasture productivity after a few years, thus leading farmers to deforest new areas. For this reason, sustaining cultivated pastures is of major importance for cattle farms. Intensive pasture management techniques have been proposed to the farmers, with little success so far. Our hypothesis is that these techniques are not implemented by farmers due to weak work organisation. Here, we assessed the diversity of forage system work of dairy farms in a municipality on the Transamazon Highway. We analysed factors explaining the adoption of intensive pasture management techniques. We monitored seven dairy farms, with a specific work assessment approach to build synthetic qualification variables and an interview of 29 dairy farmers to characterise the diversity of forage system work. Our results show four tasks related to their technical content: <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance,</b> renovation, land maintenance and exceptional work. The total duration of work is variable, from 17 to 278 days per year, depending on the technical management choices. Some farmers are autonomous in carrying out the work, but in several cases, wage workers may contribute significantly, from 33 to 100 %. We identified five types of forage system work. They oppose very simplified technical management carried out in autonomy by the family workforce to intensive techniques based on {{a high level of}} delegation to permanent wage workers. The results show that forage system work is related to the technical management choices and distribution of work between farmers and permanent wage workers. Forage system work also depends on the amount of work dedicated to the dairy herd, the role of milk in the farm, and the weight of other farming and non-farming activities. Finally, intensive pasture management techniques are linked to a high quantity of work with <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance,</b> hired permanent workers and specialised dairy farms...|$|E
40|$|Various land-use {{transitions}} {{in the tropics}} contribute to atmospheric carbon emissions, including forest conversion for small-scale farming, cattle ranching, and production of commodities such as soya and palm oil. These {{transitions in}}volve fire as an effective and inexpensive means for clearing. We applied the DECAF (DEforestation CArbon Fluxes) model to Mato Grosso, Brazil to estimate fire emissions from various land-use transitions during 2001 - 2005. Fires associated with deforestation contributed 67 Tg C/yr (17 and 50 Tg C/yr from conversion to cropland and pasture, respectively), while conversion of savannas and existing cattle pasture to cropland contributed 17 Tg C/yr and <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance</b> fires 6 Tg C/yr. Large clearings (> 100 ha/yr) contributed 67 % of emissions but comprised only 10 % of deforestation events. From a policy perspective, results imply that intensification of agricultural production on already-cleared land and policies to discourage large clearings would reduce the major sources of emissions from fires in this region.

40|$|Agriculture {{is under}} {{environmental}} pressure since its modernization, mainly after the Second World War, which generated {{the use of}} large quantities of chemical products as pesticides and fertilizers. However, during the three last décades, {{the preservation of the}} quality of the environment progressively became a priority of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and different measures were successively implemented, some of them being compulsory and other ones not, or not yet. This paper focuses on the implementation of agricultural Policy measures at the regional level of Wallonia, the Southern part of Belgium, a founder state of the European Union. Three aspects are presented and analyzed: (1) the greening of the CAP, through the so-called "green payment" and its conséquences (permanent <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance,</b> crop diversification, and the establishment of ecological focus areas); (2) the development of organic farming; and (3) the increasing number of specific quality labels.

Subterranean clover with cocksfoot provided high legume content pasture giving higher stock production than other pasture mixtures from August to October. This complemented the high yields and stock production provided by lucerne from mid September to January in 2004 / 05.

Coupled with previous measurements of secondary aerosol growth in the Amazon and source apportionment studies, the regional budgets suggest that ~ 5 % of the total mass of the regionally generated NMOC end up as secondary organic aerosol within the Amazonian boundary layer within 1 ? 3 days.

40|$|Earlier work {{showed that}} Amazonian biomass burning {{produces}} both lofted and initially unlofted emissions in large amounts. A mobile, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) measured the unlofted emissions of 17 trace gases from residual smoldering combustion (RSC) of logs {{as part of}} the Tropical Forest and Fire Emissions Experiment (TROFFEE) during the 2004 Amazonian dry season. The RSC emissions were highly variable and the few earlier RSC measurements lay near the high end of combustion efficiency observed in this study. Fuel consumption by RSC was ∼ 5 % of total for a planned deforestation fire. Much regional RSC probably occurs in the residual woody debris burned during <b>pasture</b> <b>maintenance</b> fires.

The <b>maintenance</b> of transhumance depends partly on the preservation of related traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We (a) identified and characterized social groups that hold transhumance-related TEK, (b) analyzed trends in transhumance-related TEK across generations and social groups, (c) examined {{the factors that influence}} variation in levels of TEK, and (d) analyzed elements of transhumance-related TEK as examples of adaptive strategies to cope with global change. We used transhumance on the Conquense Drove Road, a major active transhumant network in Spain, as a case study. Through an indepth literature review, participant observation, semistructured interviews, and a focus group discussion, we developed a survey to examine transhumance-related knowledge, practices, and beliefs. We collected survey data from 150 informants. Although a rich body of TEK persisted among transhumant shepherds, we found a marked loss of TEK among transhumants born after 1975, who scored one-fifth lower on survey items than other generations. The maintenance of transhumance on foot is the most important factor influencing TEK preservation.

The main {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of different recovery managements on soil chemical properties and grass yield of a degraded pasture in Rondônia. For this purpose, an experiment was installed in October 2001, consisting of five treatments: C = control; HA = harrowing + NPK + micronutrients; HE = Herbicide + NK + micronutrients; R = No-tillage rice + NPK + micronutrients; and S = No-tillage soybean + PK + micronutrients. The following N, P and K sources were used: ammonium sulfate for N, calcined phosphate for P and potassium chloride for K. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. The shoot dry matter yield of the grass was analyzed as of the 35 th month of experimentation, in a dry and a rainy period. Phosphorus fertilization resulted in significant increases in Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and increasing trend of P in the topsoil in the initial months of the experiment in treatments HA and S and increases in Ca 2 + and P (trend) in the treatment R. The cumulative production of Brachiaria brizantha, from Sep/ 2004 to Mar/ 2005, was 30, 025, 28, 267 and 27, 735 kg ha- 1 shoot dry matter in the treatments HA, R and S, respectively.

However, only sparse information exists for sheep, regarding the effects of maternal feeding during pregnancy under New Zealand grazing conditions on offspring growth and reproductive performance. In this thesis, two paradigms were examined; (i) Dam size (heavy vs light; selected based on extreme live weights from a commercial flock) and dam nutrition for a prolonged period in pregnancy (ad libitum vs maintenance; P 21 - 140), and (ii) Dam nutrition during early P 21 - 50 (ad libitum vs maintenance vs sub maintenance) and mid-to-late pregnancy P 50 - 139 (ad libitum vs maintenance) which are to the range of nutritional treatments used by New Zealand farmers. Ad libitum was used to provide unrestricted access to <b>pasture</b> forage, <b>maintenance</b> was to ensure total live weight gain equivalent to the expected conceptus mass and sub maintenance was to achieve a loss in total ewe live weight 0. 1 kg/day. The growth and reproductive performance of the offspring during both the pre-natal and post-natal periods were examined. The results from this thesis indicated that it was possible to alter ovarian cell development of the female offspring during fetal and adult life by varying dam size at the time of conception. In male offspring, only minor effects of dam size on fetal testicular cell development were observed. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy altered female offspring fetal ovarian cell development but there was no effect on reproductive performance as an adult. In fetal male offspring, maternal nutrition did not alter testicular cell development, however, minor effects were observed on adult reproductive performance. Overall, there was little effect of both paradigms on male and female offspring lifetime performance. Combined, the results suggest that farmers using similar grazing conditions to the present studies do not need to take into account nutrition of the dam when selecting male or female replacements. Future studies may consider more extreme underfeeding, but this may not be relevant on sheep farming in New Zealand. Further studies are required to further investigate the possible effects of maternal size on lifetime performance of the offspring...|$|R

40|$|Birds {{are one of}} {{the best}} studied animal groups in the world but are also amongst the most endangered. The wealth of {{ecological}} information has shown habitat protection to be vital to bird biodiversity, but habitat loss and degradation continue to defeat conservationists. Community-based biodiversity conservation efforts have been recently recognized as an important option for safeguarding ecosystems while reducing land use conflicts arising from the material, cultural and spiritual needs of local inhabitants. Community involvement is particularly critical for conservation in anthropogenic habitats. Few studies have linked the ecological impacts of community land use practices with the auto-ecological requirements of dependent bird species. In this study I examine the conservation possibilities for the endangered Sierra Madre sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi) by considering three basic elements: the ecological requirements of the bird, the effects of traditional land use practices in shaping the habitat, and the economic and social conditions that influence current and future land use decisions. I draw on ecological field studies, on traditional ecological knowledge systems, and studies of the political ecological context that influences local practices. The studies were carried out from 2000 - 2003 and employed a combination of ethnographic, participative and spatial-ecological approaches to address human-land interactions and their impacts on the sparrow habitat. Social data were obtained through nine workshops which included site visits, transect walks, participatory mapping, oral histories and semi-structured interviews. Ecological data were obtained from landscape ecology analysis, vegetation post-disturbance assessments and detailed bird's nest-site selection analysis. Results indicate that local people, principally herders, hold a rich knowledge of fire use to achieve diverse purposes, including <b>pasture</b> renewal, grassland <b>maintenance</b> and grass species selection, and prevention of dangerous fires. In order to accomplish their goals, herders have established rotational fire and grazing regimes that consider timing, frequency, location and extent of these disturbance-based practices. This rotational system was found to benefit the Sierra Madre sparrow by maintaining the grassland at the scales needed by the sparrow for nesting. Multiscale habitat recommendations for the species' conservation were derived from this socio-ecological interaction and dynamics. Unfortunately, external conservation perspectives and interests and internal land tenure conflicts have altered this rotational regime and local perspectives on resource management that threaten the resilience of this social-ecological system. Consequently, traditional ecological knowledge on grassland management can be on risk of disappearing and, with it, important native grasses and grasslands are being made vulnerable. The survival of the Sierra Madre sparrow in particular and of associated biodiversity in general, is in peril if these conflicts are not solved in a relatively short time. A community-based fire co-management program is recommended to promote integrative bird conservation-local development scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows to investigate the metabolisable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance and the efficiency with which ME is used for body weight (BW) gain. In the first experiment, 53 non-lactating, pregnant Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross dairy cows were fed one of three allowances [low: 7. 5 kg,medium: 10. 1 kg, or high: 12. 4 kg of dry matter (DM) /day] of freshly cut autumn pasture for 38 ± 2 days (mean ± SD) in individual stalls to allow the measurement of estimated DM and ME intake daily. Animals were blocked by age (6 ± 2 years), day of gestation (208 ± 17 days), and BW (526 ± 55 kg). Cows on the low, medium, and high allowance treatments consumed 7. 5, 9. 4, and 10. 6 kg of DM/day, and BW gain, including the conceptus, was 0. 2, 0. 6, and 0. 9 kg/day. The ME content of pasture was estimated by wet chemistry from in vitro true digestibility and by near infrared spectroscopy. Total ME requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and limited activity were 1. 07 MJ ME/kg of measured metabolic BW/day. This is more than 45 % higher than current recommendations. Differences {{may be due to}} an underestimation of ME requirements for maintenance or pregnancy, an overestimation of diet metabolisability, or a combination of these. Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for the greater ME requirements measured in the present study, but the results are important for on-farm decisions regarding feed allocation for nonlactating, pregnant dairy cows. In experiment 2, the amount of ME required for BW gain from pasture and commonly used supplementary feeds was investigated to estimate the efficiency with which ME is used for BW gain (kg). Control cows were offered autumn <b>pasture</b> to estimated <b>maintenance</b> requirements (- 0. 55 MJ ME/kg BW 0. 75), with an additional 20 MJ ME/d allocated for pregnancy and activity. All other cows received the same allowance of autumn pasture (Past) and an additional allowance (2. 5 or 5. 0 kg DM/day) of Past, spring pasture silage (Psil), maize silage (Msil), maize grain (Mgr), or palm kernel expeller (PKE). Regression analyses on BW allowed the determination of ME intake on BW gain for each feed; the kg was estimated from this, assuming each kg of BW contained 25 MJ of net energy. The kg of Past and Msil were 0. 34 and 0. 47, consistent with published literature and the kg of Psil (0. 50) was in line with published values for spring pasture. The greatest kg (0. 61) was for PKE, possibly due to its high fibre and fat content, and the fact that acetate and medium to long chained fatty acids are not substantially used for conceptus metabolism. The kg for Mgr was low (0. 38), possibly because the end products of digestion of starch (i. e. propionate and the hepatic-derived glucose) are used preferentially for conceptus metabolism and less for BW gain, or because the composition of BW gain differed relative to the other treatments. Results confirm differences between feeds in kg when pasture is the base diet, and provide important information for feed budgeting and ration formulation in grazing systems...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems for <b>pasture</b> establishment and <b>maintenance</b> are the extremely low concentrations of available phosphorus in soils. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influences on productive and physiologic attributes during Marandu palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) establishment, following changes in phosphorus availability in the soil through the applications of phosphate and silicate. To achieve this, a fractionated factorial 5 ² design was used, with 13 combinations for silicon and phosphorus, respectively, in mg dm- 3 : 150 and 10; 150 and 170; 150 and 330; 225 and 90; 225 and 250; 300 and 10; 300 and 170; 300 and 330; 375 and 90; 375 and 250; 450 and 10; 450 and 170 and 450 and 330, distributed according to randomized blocks, with four replications. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using samples of a Typic Haplustox (760 g kg- 1 sand, 40 g kg- 1 silt and 200 g kg- 1 clay). Wollastonite was used as the source of silicate and the sources of phosphorus were Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2, KH 2 PO 4 and NaH 2 PO 4. Marandu palisadegrass was grown during the summer and two harvests were made during the growing season. Significant interaction between phosphorus and silicate rates was found for the number of tillers and expanded green leaves, total leaf area, dry mass production of leaf laminae and culms with sheaths, and dry mass production of plant tops. Maximum responses of the analyzed variables were reached in the combination of the intermediate rates of phosphorus (170 and 250 mg dm- 3) with high rates of silicon (375 and 450 mg dm- 3). Um dos maiores problemas no estabelecimento e na manutenção de pastagens está nas concentrações extremamente baixas de fósforo disponível nos solos. Objetivou-se avaliar os atributos produtivos e fisiológicos durante o estabelecimento do capim-Marandu (Brachiaria brizantha), em seguida à alteração na disponibilidade de fósforo, por meio das aplicações de silicato e fosfato. Utilizou-se um esquema fatorial 5 ² fracionado, com as 13 combinações assim definidas, para silício e fósforo, respectivamente, em mg dm- 3 : 150 e 10; 150 e 170; 150 e 330; 225 e 90; 225 e 250; 300 e 10; 300 e 170; 300 e 330; 375 e 90; 375 e 250; 450 e 10; 450 e 170 e 450 e 330, as quais foram distribuídas segundo delineamento estatístico de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. O experimento foi instalado em casa de vegetação, utilizando um Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo Distrófico. A fonte de silício utilizada foi a wollastonita e as fontes de fósforo foram Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2, KH 2 PO 4 e NaH 2 PO 4. O capim-Marandu foi cultivado durante o verão e foram realizados dois cortes no capim. A interação foi significativa entre as doses de fósforo e de silício para o número de perfilhos e de folhas verdes expandidas, a área foliar total, a produção de massa seca das l��minas foliares e colmos mais bainhas e a produção de massa seca da parte aérea total. As máximas respostas das variáveis estudadas foram alcançadas na combinação das doses medianas de fósforo (170 e 250 mg dm- 3) com doses altas de silício (375 e 450 mg dm- 3) ...|$|R
