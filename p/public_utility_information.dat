In view of this issue, this paper combines the middleware and Web Service technology {{to come up with an}} integrated management platform to integrate heterogeneous data and query <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> bills within one system. After introducing the transformation method between XML schema and relational data models, it uses an XML Schema model as an integrated system framework, transforms the heterogeneous data into a unified XML format. The transformed data will present a unified view in virtual database and provide a consistent view to the application layer, making the upper applications easily access the service. This integration method can shield difference in data structures, make the heterogeneous data sources become transparent to realize the dynamic integration of heterogeneous data in a web environment. This system implements online query, billing, online payment and other functions to achieve the unification of individual <b>utilities</b> <b>information,</b> standardization and shared services...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee. Both the {{calculation}} and allocation of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee for certain areas are analysed. The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution. The results in the other two examples are similar, since both take into account the principle of contribution and counter - contribution, as demonstrated by the structural fractions of the distributed <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee among taxpayers. ...|$|R
