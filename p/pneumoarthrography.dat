50|$|Shoulder {{arthrography}} {{can be used}} {{to study}} tears of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum and biceps. The type of contrast injected into the joint depends on the subsequent imaging that is planned. For <b>pneumoarthrography,</b> gas is used, for CT or radiographs, a water-soluble radiopaque contrast, and for MRI, gadolinium. Double-contrast arthrography can be used for more anatomically complex cases, though its use is relatively infrequent. The needle is radiographically guided into the glenohumeral joint space, after which the patient is evaluated by fluoroscopy, CT or MRI. The gadolinium in the contrast fluid yields a bright signal on T1 weighted images allowing for better evaluation of the joint capsule, the articular surface of the bones and, in particular, the labral cartilage. MR arthrography is most often used in evaluation of the hip and acetabular labrum, of the shoulder rotator cuff and glenoid labrum, and less often in the wrist. Arthrograms can be diagnostic and therapeutic. Therapeutic arthrograms often distend the joint with cortisone and lidocaine, with a common site being the shoulder. Diagnostic arthrograms can be direct, as described above with penetration of the joint, or indirect, by a venous injection of contrast material and delayed imaging with CT or MRI.|$|E
