The objective of this paper covers the investigation of consumer’s attitude towards electric vehicles and their opinion on potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> {{and its impact on}} market penetration scenarios in different countries. The aforementioned issues were investigated via a European wide online consumer survey. It was designed to identify the awareness of potential consumers of electric cars as well as to discover their attitude towards this new technology. In addition to the picture of potential demand-related obstacles, the consumers were asked to evaluate the suitability of various <b>promotion</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the findings were included in an agent based vehicle market model which specifies consumer demand and market supply of electromobility scenarios. The results show that the consumer attitude towards electromobility is rather positive and electric vehicles are generally perceived as environment-friendly and secure. But the high acquisition costs and the uncertainty about the operating costs deter consumers from purchasing an electric car. First results of the inclusion of potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> such as financial incentives in a scenario based market model show a significant increase of the electric vehicle uptake in Germany. Potential customers have high expectations regarding the comfort and range of an electric vehicle. One of the most important barriers and obstacles for a broad market uptake are the currently high purchase prices for this new technology. Therefore, it seems quite necessary to make electric vehicles from a customer’s standpoint more attractive. From the customer’s perspective a dense network of charging stations and financial measures such as tax and energy cost reductions are vital prerequisites in order to convince them to buy an electric vehicle. Finally, it has been proven within a scenario based market model for Germany that the use of different <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> by the national government can enhance the market share of electric vehicles substantially until 2030...|$|R

However, the waste management (i. e., anaerobic digestion) can produce the biogas associated with its composition mostly consisting of methane (CH 4), which is now considered as a renewable energy with emphasis on electricity generation and other energy uses. The objective of this paper was to present an overview analysis of biogas-to-bioenergy in Taiwan, which included five elements: current status of biogas sources and their energy utilizations, potential of biogas (methane) generation from livestock manure management, governmental regulations and policies for promoting biogas, benefits of GHGs (i. e., methane) emission reduction, and research and development status of utilizing livestock manure for biofuel production. In the study, using the livestock population data surveyed by the Council of Agriculture (Taiwan) and the emission factors recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the potential of methane generation from livestock manure management in Taiwan during the period of 1995 - 2007 has been estimated to range from 36 to 56 Â GgÂ year- 1, indicating that the biogas (methane) from swine and dairy cattle is abundant.

40|$|Background: People {{working in}} social care {{constitute}} the largest occupational group in Sweden {{and they have}} the highest prevalence of sickness absence. Since sickness absence results in great human and societal costs, there is incentive to develop initiatives to promote health for this group. Previous research about both what measures are effective and how soon effects occur are limited and more knowledge about this is needed. Aim: The overall aim of the thesis was to gain more knowledge about associations between workplace health promotion and employee health, sickness absence, and sickness presence in municipal social care organizations. Method: Four studies were conducted concerning social care organizations and their employees in 60 Swedish municipalities, based on data from registers as well as from surveys to employees, top managers, and policy makers, respectively. A randomized sample of 60 of the 290 municipalities in Sweden and a randomized sample of 15, 871 people employed at least half time throughout 2006 within the social care sector in these 60 municipalities was used. A questionnaire was sent to the employees selected (9270) and 58 % replied (study I-IV). Another questionnaire was sent to top managers who represented the employer in the same 60 municipalities (n= 60) (study II). A third questionnaire was sent to policymakers in the 60 municipalities (study III). Register data was obtained on sickness absence (> 14 days) in 2006 for the 9270 employees and on long-term sickness absence (> 90 days) in 2007 – 2012 for all social service workers in the 60 municipalities. Both cross-sectional (study I–II and IV) and prospective (study III) study designs were used, using individual level data (study IV) and organizational level data (study I-III). Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modelling analyses were performed. Results: Organizations that had more favorable employee ratings of individual- and organizational-directed (psychosocial work conditions) workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> had better health and lower sickness absence levels among their employees (study I). Organizational- and individual-directed workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> and employee satisfaction with workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> were associated with better employee health (study II).

Mall walking programs may overcome these barriers. The {{purpose of this}} study was to summarize the evidence on the health-related value of mall walking and mall walking programs. MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of the literature to determine the features, environments, and benefits of mall walking programs using the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). The inclusion criteria were articles that involved adults aged 45 years or older who walked in indoor or outdoor shopping malls. Exclusion criteria were articles that used malls as laboratory settings or focused on the mechanics of walking. We included published research studies, dissertations, theses, conference abstracts, syntheses, nonresearch articles, theoretical papers, editorials, reports, policy briefs, standards and guidelines, and nonresearch conference abstracts and proposals. Websites and articles written in a language other than English were excluded. ResultsWe located 254 articles on mall walking; 32 articles met our inclusion criteria. We found that malls provided safe, accessible, and affordable exercise environments for middle-aged and older adults. Programmatic features such as program leaders, blood pressure checks, and warm-up exercises facilitated participation. Individual benefits of mall walking programs included improvements in physical, social, and emotional well-being. Limited transportation to the mall was a barrier to participation.

To understand the success it is necessary to know that it results from [...] besides suitable background conditions [...] a comprehensive promotion approach which was launched {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s and has been given a further boost, since the coming into office of the Social Democratic-Green government in autumn 1998, through a series of promotion measures. Since 1991, with the coming into force of the first German feed-in law, the Act on Supplying Electricity from Renewables (Stromeinspeisegesetz, StrEG), fixed remuneration has been paid to electricity based on renewable energy sources (RES), leading to the market breakthrough in wind energy. Its successor, the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) in April 2000, improved the regulations of the StrEG in many respects and made market entry possible for other renewables such as solar photovoltaics and biomass energy. The positive RES develop-ment in Germany can be explained by, besides this key <b>promotion</b> <b>measure</b> which served as a subsidy for the operational costs, several promotion programmes, which supported RES through investment subsidies (in the form of grants or soft loans), tax exemptions (within the scope of the Environmental Tax Reform) or in a more indirect way, through the decision to phase out nuclear energy, by means of information dissemination (i. e., the RES export initiative of the federal gov-ernment) and corporate financing schemes in the case of wind energy. 1...|$|E

Hälso- och sjukvården ska vägleda individen till att främja en hälsosam livsstil, dock ställer det krav på att individen själv utför förändringsarbetet. Det finns idag ett brett utbud av hälsoapplikationer med olika hälsofrämjande inriktningar som används som verktyg för att stödja/vägleda individen till en förbättrad hälsa. Idag finns inga riktlinjer för hälso-och sjukvårdspersonal gällande rekommendationer till patienter avseende adekvata hälsoapplikationer. Syfte: Syftet var att undersöka om personer med hjälp av en mobilapplikation avsedd för en specifik hälsofrämjande åtgärd, tex. viktnedgång, erhåller ett annat resultat jämfört med personer som genomgår samma livsstilsåtgärd men som ej har mobilapplikationen som stöd. Ett yttligare syfte var att undersöka mobilapplikationernas huvudsakliga funktion. Metod: För att besvara litteraturöversiktens syfte genomfördes databassökningar där studier av RCT design inkluderades, totalt inkluderades 18 studier. Samtliga studier kvalitetsgranskades med hjälp av ett vedertaget granskningsprotokoll. Resultat: Mobilapplikationernas effekt på livsstilsförändringar varierade, en del studier påvisade förbättrade kliniska resultat medan andra studier inte påvisade någon effekt, detta oavsett vilken livsstilsförändring som undersöktes. Majoriteten av studierna behandlade livsstilsförändringar avseende fysisk aktivitet, kosthållning samt diabetes. Mobilapplikationernas huvudsakliga funktion var självmonitorering, {{feedback}} och målsättning samt information/kunskap. Slutsats: Mobilapplikationers effektivitet tycks bero på personens individuella förutsättningar och kontext vilket kan vara avgörande för resultatet. Mobilapplikationer som verktyg i en livsstilsförändring har potential att i framtiden kunna vara effektiva, dock krävs mer forskning.  Background: Unhealthy living habits such {{as physical}} inactivity and unhealthy eating habits {{lead to an}} increased risk of disease, which can pose a major burden for individuals, health care and society. Healthcare providers should assist the individual to promote a healthy lifestyle, but it requires that the individual himself performs this change. Today there ́s a wide range of health promotion applications used as tools to support/guide the individual to an improved health. At present there are no gudielines for healthcare professionals regarding recommendations to the patient regarding adequate health-applications. Objective: The purpose was to investigate whether persons using a mobile application intended for a specific health <b>promotion</b> <b>measure,</b> eg. weight loss, would have different results compared to people undergoing the same lifestyle change but who do not have the mobile application as support. A further purpose was to investigate the main function of mobile applications. Method: Database searches were conducted, studies of RCT design were included, in total, 18 studies were included. All studies were evaluated regarding the studies quality using a approved audit protocol. Results: The effects of the mobile applications on lifestyle changes varied, some studies showed improved clinical outcomes, while other studies did not show any effect, regardless of the lifestyle change investigated. The majority of the studies involved lifestyle changes concerning physical activity, diet and diabetes. The main features of the apps were self- monitoring, feedback and goalsetting, as well as information / knowledge domain. Conclusion: The effectiveness of mobile applications seams to depend on the individuals conditions and context, which may be crucial to the outcome. Applications as tools in a lifestyle change have the potential to be effective in the future, but further reaserch is required. ...|$|E
50|$|Once chronic {{trade deficits}} {{came to an}} end in the mid-1960s, the need for export {{promotion}} policies diminished. Virtually all export tax incentives were eliminated {{over the course of the}} 1970s. Even JETRO, whose initial function is to assist smaller firms with overseas marketing, saw its role shift toward import promotion and other activities. In the 1980s, Japan continued to use industrial policy to promote the growth of new, more sophisticated industries, but direct export <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> were no longer part of the policy package.|$|R
50|$|After the {{founding}} of the People's Republic of China, the strong promotion of Mandarin in the Wu-speaking region yet again influenced the development of Wu Chinese. Wu was gradually excluded from most modern media and schools. Public organizations were required to use Mandarin. With the influx of a migrant non-Wu-speaking population, the near total conversion of public media and organizations to the exclusive use of Mandarin as well as radical Mandarin <b>promotion</b> <b>measures,</b> the modernization and standardization of or literacy in Wu languages became improbable and left them more prone to Mandarinization. The <b>promotion</b> <b>measures,</b> which at present mostly consist of signs like the one pictured, are primarily aimed at limiting the usage of local dialects in conducting public or administrative affairs, although it, like the smoking ban, is commonly violated and it is not so uncommon to hear people speaking local dialects in a government office or a bank. The usage of local dialects in all other spheres is officially tolerated. Standardization of dialects, however, may be perceived as a precursor to possible regionalism, so this, too, would most likely be deterred. On the other hand, few speakers consider their dialect important enough to be written or standardized. To most speakers, dialects are in essence a wholly oral phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Objective The study {{analyzes}} {{the possibility of}} incorporating health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> into the work processes of Family Health Program teams at a primary health care clinic in Brazil. Design and Sample We used the participatory research concept developed in 1968 by Freire. The study sample comprised the end-users {{of the health care}} system, together with 3 multidisciplinary teams. A total of 77 health care users and 55 health professionals participated in the study. Measures Culture circles composed of health care professionals, and users from different areas investigated generative topics, encoded/decoded topics, and engaged in critical probing for clarification. Topics affecting quality of life and health were heuristically evaluated. Results Although most topics were related to changing the focus of health care facilities, some were related to subsidizing community-based interventions, improving environmental strategies, individual skills, and public policies. Incorporating the novel health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> and creating an expanded full-treatment clinic are important steps toward that goal. Conclusions Topics that can stimulate dialogue among the members of the culture circles include creating an environment of closer cultural contact, with repercussions for work processes, family health models, and general health models, as well as the inclusion of social aspects in the decision-making processes related to health issues that affect the living conditions of the population...|$|R
