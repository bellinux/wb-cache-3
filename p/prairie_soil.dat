40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} {{of water resources}} in the Midwestern U. S. is largely a result of conventional agricultural practices. In contrast, <b>soils</b> of <b>prairie</b> ecosystems do not accumulate NO[subscript] 3 because of rapid NO[subscript] 3 assimilation by plants and microbes. Microbial NO[subscript] 3 assimilation requires a readily available C source; however, there is little known regarding available C in soils. The ability of <b>prairie</b> <b>soils</b> to recycle NO[subscript] 3 makes the prairie ecosystem a useful model in N cycle studies designed to develop agricultural systems that minimize N loss;I performed field and laboratory studies on paired <b>prairie</b> and cultivated <b>soils</b> to determine how cultivation has affected levels of soluble C, sugars, and amino-N in soils and to determine whether these soluble constituents {{play a role in the}} soil N cycle;Prairie soils and greater concentrations of soluble sugars and soluble amino-N and had higher ratios of NH[subscript] 4 :NO[subscript] 3, soluble C:inorganic N, and soluble sugar:NO[subscript] 3 than their cultivated counterparts. Soluble sugars and soluble amino-N fluctuated seasonally in <b>prairie</b> <b>soils.</b> Amino-N reached a minimum in spring when microbial biomass and mineral N were increasing in both <b>prairie</b> and cultivated <b>soils.</b> Freeze-thaw events are hypothesized to be a cause of the increased N mineralization;Soluble sugars increased in soils upon addition of plant residues and remained at elevated levels until N became limiting. Cellulose additions to soil increased levels of soluble sugars only when N was not limiting. Thus demonstrating a dependence of elevated soluble sugars on soil microbial activity;Laboratory studies demonstrated that in the presence of glucose, NO[subscript] 3 was more readily assimilated in cultivated <b>soils</b> than in <b>prairie</b> <b>soils.</b> Free amino acids released upon addition of glucose to soil may be inhibiting NO[subscript] 3 assimilation in <b>prairie</b> <b>soils.</b> Field studies of the fate of applied [superscript] 15 NO[subscript] 3 demonstrated more rapid assimilation of NO[subscript] 3 in <b>prairie</b> <b>soils</b> than in cultivated soils and evidence of active dissimilatory NO[subscript] 3 reduction in prairie soils;These data demonstrate the contrasting C and N dynamics of <b>prairie</b> and cultivated <b>soils.</b> Soluble sugars and amino-N may be useful indices of available C and N in soil.

There were a few fine stores and offices on Main Street; Portage Avenue was laid out, and handsome buildings were rising here and there; but, for the most part, the frame houses had a dilapidated, squalid look.

60|$|He was, as it happened, not {{the only}} person who noticed this, for other people who had at {{different}} times suffered severely in pocket from the vagaries of the climate had arrived at much the same opinion that afternoon, with more or less uneasiness according to their temperament. The wheat was everywhere standing tall and green, and the season had been on the whole so propitious that from bitter experience they almost expected a change. As the small cultivator has discovered, the simile of a beneficent nature is a singularly misleading one, for the stern truth was proclaimed in ages long ago that man must toil with painful effort for the bread he eats, and must subdue the earth before he can render it fruitful. In the new West he has made himself many big machines, including the great gang-plows that rip their multiple furrows through the <b>prairie</b> <b>soil,</b> but he still lies defenseless against the fickle elements.|$|E

They were not pleasant reading, and the man's face clouded as he penciled notes on some of them, but there was no weakness or futile protest in it. Defeat was plain between the lines of all he read, but he was going on stubbornly until the struggle was ended, as others of his kind had done, there at the western limit of the furrows of the plow and in the great province farther east which is one of the world's granaries. They went under and were forgotten, but they showed the way, and while their guerdon was usually six feet of <b>prairie</b> <b>soil,</b> the wheatfields, mills, and railroads came, for it is written plainly on the new Northwest that no man may live and labor for himself alone, and there are many who realizing it instinctively ask very little and freely give their best for the land that but indifferently shelters them.|$|E

40|$|Although some soil {{microorganisms}} cause plant diseases, most soil inhabitants are beneficial to crop {{production and the}} environment through processes like the fixing and cycling of nitrogen, biological pest control, formation and maintenance of soil structure (tilth), and degradation of agrochemicals and pollutants. This paper discusses the distribution of these organisms in <b>prairie</b> <b>soils</b> {{and how they are}} affected by soil and crop management practices. The discussion includes soil fauna and microorganisms, and singles out three groups of microorganisms that are particularly important in crop production: arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, dark septate root inhabiting fungi, and rhizobia. The development of healthy diverse faunal and microbial communities in soil can be fostered by using soil management practices or systems like conservation tillage, crop rotation, proper nutrient management and application of organic manures when available.

40|$|Juniperus virginiana, an {{important}} woody plant invader in the U. S. Central Plains, has increased considerably in density and cover in large areas previously dominated by tallgrass prairie. Change in the phenology and nitrogen use {{efficiency of the}} dominant plant communities as J. virginiana replaces native prairies may lead to increased plant productivity and biomass accumulation, but may also alter the microclimate and litter quality that affect soil microbial communities responsible for key soil processes. I have focused my investigations on changes in key soil processes {{that could lead to}} differences in soil N availability, as well as changes in ecosystem C and N pools and fluxes as J. virginiana expands into native grasslands. Juniperus virginiana forest soils exhibit greater cumulative annual net N mineralization (11. 52 ± 0. 38 µg N g¯ 1 soil y¯ 1) compared to <b>prairie</b> <b>soils</b> (7. 90 ± 0. 26 µg N g¯ 1 soil y¯ 1) (F = 60. 67, P = 0. 016), yet slightly reduced potential soil C flux.
