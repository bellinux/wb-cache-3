40|$|Dalmatian {{pyrethrum}} (Tanacetum cinerariifolium /Trevir. / Sch. Bip.) is {{a perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} Asteraceae family. It is endemic to the East coast of the Adriatic Sea and its natural habitat extends from Italy to northern Albania and up in the mountainous regions of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Pyrethrum flowers yield an important insecticide, the <b>pyrethrin.</b> <b>Pyrethrin</b> is mainly concentrated in oil glands {{on the surface of}} the seed inside the tightly packed flower head, but they can also be found in the other plant parts, however in much lower concentrations. The <b>pyrethrin</b> exist as a combination of six insecticide active ingredients: <b>pyrethrin</b> I, cinerin I, jasmolin I, <b>pyrethrin</b> II, cinerin II and jasmolin II, with <b>pyrethrin</b> I and <b>pyrethrin</b> II present in higher concentrations. <b>Pyrethrin</b> is non-toxic to mammals and other worm-blooded animals, it is unstable in light, oxygen, water and at elevated temperatures and therefore highly biodegradable. Due to the fact it is environmentally safe it is leading insecticide in organic farming systems. The most scientific work concerning Dalmatian pyrethrum was focused on its morphological and biochemical traits that are relevant in breeding. Breeding programmes are primarily focused on increasing the yield of <b>pyrethrin</b> per unit area. Relative to dry flower weight, flower heads contain the majority of the <b>pyrethrin.</b> Croatian wild populations contain approximately 0. 60 to 0. 79 %, while clones in breeding programmes of Australia and Kenya contain up to 3. 0 % of <b>pyrethrin...</b>|$|R

500|$|Other {{insecticides}} {{are available}} for mosquito control, {{as well as physical}} measures, such as draining the wetland breeding grounds and the provision of better sanitation. Pyrethrum (from the flowering plant Chrysanthemum [...] cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. <b>Pyrethrins</b> attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting. The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 BCE. <b>Pyrethrins</b> are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.|$|E
50|$|Some {{differences}} in the chemistry between <b>pyrethrins</b> and synthetic pyrethroids have the result that synthetic pyrethroids have relatively longer environmental persistence than do <b>pyrethrins.</b> <b>Pyrethrins</b> have shorter environmental persistence than synthetic pyrethroids because their chemical structure is more susceptible {{to the presence of}} UV light and changes in pH.|$|E
50|$|Although {{one might}} assume from the {{pyrethrum}} suffix that this plant may contain <b>pyrethrins,</b> it does not. The {{second part of}} the binomial name stems from the Ancient Greek name for the plant, πύρεθρον, whereas the <b>pyrethrins</b> are named after Pyrethrum, used more recently for several plants of the genus Chrysanthemum, some of which do contain <b>pyrethrins.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Processing {{the flowers}} to {{cultivate}} the <b>pyrethrin</b> {{is often a}} lengthy process, and one that varies from area to area. For instance, in Japan, the flowers are hung upside down to dry which increases <b>pyrethrin</b> concentration slightly. [...] To process <b>pyrethrin,</b> the flowers must be crushed. The {{degree to which the}} flower is crushed has an effect on both the longevity of the <b>pyrethrin</b> usage and the quality. The finer powder produced is better suited for use as an insecticide than the more coarsely crushed flowers. However, the more coarsely crushed flowers have a longer shelf life and deteriorate less.|$|R
40|$|Pyrethrum [Tanacetum cinerariifolium (Trevir.) Sch. Bip. ] is a {{well-known}} plant widely used {{for the production of}} natural <b>pyrethrin</b> insecticides. One of the main breeding goals is to increase <b>pyrethrin</b> content. Comparative analysis of three breeding methods for the improvement of <b>pyrethrin</b> content by mass selection, family selection and polycross was carried out based on an unselected heterogeneous population. Twenty-three elite plants were identified in the base population, and one round of mass selection raised the average <b>pyrethrin</b> content from 1. 37 % to 1. 69 % in the progeny population. Polycross was conducted using 23 clones derived from the above same 23 elite plants derived from the base population, and the average <b>pyrethrin</b> content of that population improved even more to 1. 87 %. As a third method 12 out of 23 families were selected and hybridized within each family. This method did not improve <b>pyrethrin</b> content. Both mass selection and polycross increased the frequency of desirable individuals in the improved populations, and the variation coefficient of <b>pyrethrin</b> content was reduced from 29 % in the base population to 18 % and 16 % after mass selection and polycross, respectively. These results show that polycross is more effective than mass selection for the rapid improvement of pyrethrum populations, and that family selection is not suitable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrop {{responses}} {{in a changing}} climate reflect the interplay among rising temperature, changing rainfall patterns and increasing atmospheric Carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations. Exposure of plants to elevated atmospheric CO 2 not only induces the changes in primary metabolism, but also leads to complex alterations in secondary metabolism. Elevated CO 2 could delay the onset of water deficit and counterbalance negative effects of water deficit on plant growth by increasing water use efficiency. Pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium) is commercially grown for extraction of <b>pyrethrin</b> in the achenes of the flower heads. <b>Pyrethrin</b> is classified as terpenoid and widely used as a natural insecticide. The response of pyrethrum, a perennial crop producing important secondary metabolites, to climate change is not known. In this experiment, plants were subjected to two water treatments (well-watered and water deficit) at two atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (ambient CO 2 : 390 ppm and elevated CO 2 : 700 ppm). Watering treatments were applied throughout the flowering period, until physiological maturity of flowers. Selected growth, yield, phenological and physiological traits were measured to understand the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 and water deficit on flower development and <b>pyrethrin</b> accumulation. The results of this experiment showed that exposure to elevated atmospheric CO 2 throughout the flowering period, significantly increased flower yield and <b>pyrethrin</b> yield per plant (Figure. 1) at physiological maturity due {{to the production of}} more flowers. Elevated CO 2 treatments significantly increased the rate of flower development resulting in shorter flowering period and lower <b>pyrethrin</b> yield per flower compared to ambient CO 2 treatments. Exposure to water deficit during the post-anthesis period significantly reduced flower yield and total <b>pyrethrin</b> yield compared to well-watered treatments. The interaction of water deficit with elevated atmospheric CO 2 increased the rate of flower development resulting in shorter flowering period and lower <b>pyrethrin</b> yield. Adequate soil moisture for flower development increased the rate and duration of <b>pyrethrin</b> accumulation resulting in higher <b>pyrethrin</b> yield per flower...|$|R
