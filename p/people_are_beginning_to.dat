25|$|Multimillion-dollar {{investments}} {{beginning in}} the 1990s by the World Bank have reclaimed desert and turned the Ica Valley in Peru, one of the driest places on earth, into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, {{one of the fastest}} rates of aquifer depletion in the world. The wells of small farmers and local <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> run dry and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat. As a cash crop, asparagus has provided jobs for local people, but most of the money goes to the buyers, mainly the British. A 2010 report concluded that the industry is not sustainable and accuses investors, including the World Bank, of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries. Diverting water from the headwaters of the Ica River to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of Huancavelica, where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin was {{attacked}} in the British media for not {{fighting in the}} First World War. He defended himself, revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, {{but he was not}} summoned by either country. Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops, and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. Harper's Weekly reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was [...] "a part of the common language of almost every country", and that the Tramp image was [...] "universally familiar". In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action, and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp. The same year, a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that Chaplin was [...] "an American obsession". The actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote that [...] "a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius".|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

2500|$|The {{predominant}} {{religion in}} Benghazi is Islam. Practically {{all of the}} city's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, {{with the exception of}} some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with Islamic principles. The conservative Islamic nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city – [...] practically all teenagers and young adults live at home until they get married. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional Maliki school of religious law, however much less so than in decades past. In recent years, more <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> practice Salafism with the spread of literalist inclined Islamic television channels. It is not uncommon therefore to see woman wearing black niqabs and men with full beards in Benghazi because of the existence of such schools, although not exclusively for that purpose. The Senussi order from which the royal dynasty sprang has traditionally enjoyed strong support in Benghazi and the Cyrenaica.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And we understand. [...] And the American <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> understand. [...] This crusade, this war on terrorism {{is going to take a}} while. [...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unemployment {{for those}} under 25 has been {{reported}} to be 50%. Spain's current generation is considered the most educated that the country has ever had, yet it faces the greatest rate of unemployment in Europe. Roughly 68% of young people are willing to leave the country to search for a job, and those with college degrees are willing to settle for working at so-called minijobs for a paycheck. The State Secretary for Unemployment states that higher education is a way for the current generation to battle this issue; however, government cuts are occurring that slash university staff salaries and increase the number of students per class. For those paying their own way through college, the tough economy has made it nearly impossible to find a job and study simultaneously. [...] Hopes for the future are dwindling as Spain's unemployment rate is almost as high as it was for the United States during the Great Depression. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> fear the transformation of this generation into one referred to as a [...] "Lost Generation" [...] that is constantly looking for work and whose futures are closed off from [...] "good careers". The stress of unemployment has also affected personal relationships, with many young adults separating from partners. Youth unemployment is about double overall unemployment.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of grinding stones {{has been interpreted}} <b>to</b> mean that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the changes brought {{by the end of}} the Ice Age and the extinction of many of the large mammals.
