5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil and coffee remain the <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May 1836, the {{settlement}} was elevated {{to the royal}} status of villa, and Rafael Mangual was named its first mayor.

25|$|The Romanians' {{ancestors}} {{came into}} {{close contact with}} sedentary Slavic-speaking communities in the 10th century at the latest. They adopted Old Church Slavonic liturgy in the First Bulgarian Empire, and preserved it along with their Orthodox Christian faith even after their northward migration across the Danube began. They were first employed as border guards along the southeastern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary and later settled in other sparsely inhabited regions as well. Although sheep-breeding remained their <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> for centuries, their permanent settlements are also documented from the 1330s.|$|E

25|$|Their <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is the {{cultivation}} of coffee, rice and bananas; women are ones primarily responsible for rice harvest, in accordance with local tradition. Those living along the coast often rely on fishing as a principal source of income. Many Antesaka have migrated since the colonial period to seek employment {{in other parts of}} the island. Beginning in 1946, the French colonial government organized transportation for Antesaka and Antandroy laborers to work sites {{in other parts of the}} island to work on plantations or mines. Annually, an estimated 40% of all Antesaka migrants resettled permanently outside their traditional territory in the early 1960s; these migrants typically sent cash back to their family members at home.|$|E
25|$|Sheep farming {{introduced}} in the late 19th century has been a <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the Pampa (to the North). Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still there is little investment in new abbatoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew and Rio Gallegos), and often there are phytosanitary restrictions to the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.|$|E
500|$|A {{substantial}} part of Deir al-Balah's inhabitants died in 1862 because of stagnant drinking water originating from the town's swamps. The swamps were seasonal, forming each winter {{as a result of}} flooding which failed to breach the sandstone ridge. A year later, on 29 May 1863, French explorer Victor Guérin wrote that Deir al-Balah was a small, partly ruined village with a population of 350. Date farming was the <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> that the inhabitants engaged in. In 1878, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine noted Deir al-Balah had grown to become a large village of mud houses [...] "with wells and a small tower". At the time, it served as a see of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|Just over 54% of {{the working}} {{population}} is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry. Agriculture is not a <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> {{due to the lack}} of arable land. Most land is used for livestock and forestry. The agriculture that is practiced is traditional and in small plots. Around 3,400 hectares are farmed during the rainy season, principally in Landa, Encino Solo, Palo Verde, La Reforma, La Lagunita, Otates, Tres Lagunas, Acatitlán de Zaragoza, Tilaco, and Valle de Guadalupe. Most crops consist of corn, beans, sorghum, peas and chickpeas and coffee. Fruit trees include orange, peach, papaya, lime, avocado, grapefruit, lemon, sapote, plum, apple and mango. There is also sugar cane and coffee grown.|$|E
2500|$|While the Antandroy {{share many}} common {{cultural}} features with {{other ethnic groups}} in Madagascar, such as respect for the ancestors, a common language and complex funeral rites, certain practices set them apart. They are particularly known for their distinctive dances, cotton woven clothing, elaborately decorated tombs, and unique use of plank architecture {{in the construction of}} their houses. [...] Also unlike most Malagasy ethnic groups they rely more heavily on tubers, yams, millet and other crops that are less dependent on water for cultivation than the rice so prevalent elsewhere on the island. The herding of zebu remains the <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of the Antandroy, and their tombs are commonly decorated with numerous zebu skulls as an indication of wealth.|$|E

2500|$|With Carvajal as governor, Monterrey was {{established}} {{as the center}} (now {{in the state of}} Nuevo León). [...] Within a few years, some people reported to authorities in Mexico City that Jewish rites were being performed in the Northern Province and efforts to convert heathen indigenous peoples were lax. The <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of Carvajal and his associates seems to have been capturing Indians and selling them into slavery. [...] Carvajal's [...] Lieutenant Governor, Gaspar Castaño de Sosa, led a large [...] expedition to New Mexico in 1591 in an effort to establish a colony. [...] Castaño was arrested for this unauthorized expedition and sentenced to exile in the Philippines. The sentence was later reversed, but he had already been killed [...] in the Molucca Islands when the Chinese slaves on his ship mutinied.|$|E
2500|$|Raising {{and selling}} herds of zebu is the <b>principal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of the Bara. In recent decades they have {{increasingly}} adopted agricultural practices, including {{the cultivation of}} rice, cassava, millet and maize. The rice planting season was traditionally timed around {{the arrival of a}} local migrating quail (coturnix communis), known locally as kibodolo. The Bara and Sakalava were Madagascar's principal international slave traders through {{the early part of the}} 19th century. [...] Historically the majority of slave raids were conducted in the dry winter months. [...] Beginning in the 1870s, in response to increased cattle demand in South Africa following a series of blights and disease that had decimated local herds, the Bara began exporting their cattle internationally through southern coastal ports including Toliara, Saint Augustin, Belo and Soalara. The development of economic activity independent of the regulation of the Kingdom of Imerina, as well as the arms they received in exchange for cattle, enabled the Bara to strengthen their autonomy and resist Merina authority in the later 19th century, even to the extent of launching cattle and slave raids into the heart of Imerina - an activity that increased particularly after 1882. The Ankandrarezina Bara also cultivated tapia, a mulberry upon which the indigenous silkworm fed; the silk they produced was both woven locally for cloth [...] and exported in raw form to Imerina.|$|E
