50|$|The pillar was {{established}} by king Sri Kesari Warmadewa, the first king of the Balinese Warmadewa dynasty and bears a long inscription where the king describes his military campaign in the island. It {{is located in the}} Belanjong (Blanjong) Temple, where it is housed under a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and is often decorated and partially covered with devotional cloth.|$|E
50|$|The local parish church, {{from which}} the {{settlement}} gets its name, is dedicated to Saint Andrew and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1229. The core of the current church is Gothic and dates to around 1400. It is built on a small hill {{in the middle of}} the settlement and it served as a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> against Ottoman raids.|$|E
50|$|The Palisade is a {{geologic}} formation of Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. It is {{so named because}} it has a sheer cliff face and vertical markings, reminiscent of palisade walls used as a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> around forts. While driving westward along Canada Highway 16 (the Yellowhead Highway), one can see the Palisade in the west as the highway first crosses the Athabasca River approximately 19 km (12 mi) east of Jasper townsite.|$|E
50|$|Bookbinding: In this two-year program, {{students}} learn fundamental hand-bookbinding techniques while producing {{a variety of}} binding structures in cloth, paper, leather, and vellum. Hands-on book repair and conservation techniques are taught, along with tool use and modification, edition binding techniques, and <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures.</b> The second year is focused primarily on fine leather bindings and more advanced finishing and conservation procedures. Graduates enter the field as bookbinders in custom binderies and university or institutional conservation labs or as self-employed bookbinders and book artists.|$|R
50|$|According to The Medieval Girdle Book Project: Containers and <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> {{for books}} have been in use since long before the Middle Ages; the clay pots housing the Dead Sea Scrolls come to mind as do the leather {{cylinders}} used to store scrolls and clay tablets in the library at Alexandria and others, and the cumbdachs used by Irish monks to carry their precious manuscripts and prayer books from place to place, possibly even to Iceland, which they reached as early as 700 AD.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the medium}} itself {{needs to be}} preserved, for example if a {{document}} is a crayon sketch by a famous artist on paper, a complex process of preservation may be used. Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media. Polyester sleeves, acid-free folders, and pH buffered document boxes are common supportive <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> whose selection must match the media’s chemical and physical properties.

50|$|Today, {{the term}} lantern {{is used to}} {{describe}} many types of portable lighting, but lanterns originated as a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> for a light source - usually a candle - {{to make it easier}} to carry and hang up, and more practical outdoors or in drafty interiors such as passages and staircases where unguarded candles were more likely to be blown out by gusts of air - not just from wind but even opening a door.|$|E

50|$|A fanout kit {{is a set}} {{of empty}} jackets {{designed}} to protect fragile tight-buffered strands of fiber from a cable. This allows the individual fibers to be terminated without splicing, and without needing a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> such as a splicebox. This is normally an option with fiber distribution cable, or sometimes loose-buffer or ribbon cable, because these types of cable contain multiple strands that are designed for a permanent termination.The ribbon fanout pigtails include: Ribbon cable, Fanout kit, Fanout tubing and Connectors.|$|E
50|$|Outside plant {{applications}} {{may require}} connectors be located underground, or on outdoor walls or utility poles. In such settings, <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> are often used, {{and fall into}} two broad categories: hermetic (sealed) and free-breathing. Hermetic cases prevent entry of moisture and air but, lacking ventilation, can become hot if exposed to sunlight or other sources of heat. Free-breathing enclosures, on the other hand, allow ventilation, but can also admit moisture, insects and airborne contaminants. Selection of the correct housing depends on the cable and connector type, the location, and environmental factors. Careful assembly is required to ensure good protection against the elements.|$|R
25|$|The {{extensive}} {{range of}} P. gallicus includes {{a variety of}} climates and habitats, although ideally it prefers to nest in warm and dry areas. In Italy, nests are typically built in open areas hanging from branches with the cells opened towards the ground. In the colder conditions north of the Alps, metal scraps such as pipes serve as <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> to P. gallicus nests. These wasps are the most widely distributed Polistes in Spain. P. gallicus also inhabits parts of Paris, although the farther north, the more rare this species becomes. Its conservation status in general has not been evaluated yet, although in its inhabited regions, it is common.|$|R
50|$|In {{many older}} K&T installations, the supply and return wires were routed {{separately}} from each other, {{rather than being}} located parallel to and near each other. This direct routing method {{has the advantage of}} reduced cost by allowing use of the shortest possible lengths of wire, but the major disadvantage is that a detailed building wiring diagram is needed for other electricians to understand multiple interwoven circuits, especially if the wiring is not fully visible throughout its length. By contrast, modern electrical codes now require that all residential wiring connections be made only inside <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures,</b> such as junction boxes, and that all connections must remain accessible for inspection, troubleshooting, repair, or modification.|$|R

The NAL states that [...] "The agent {{observed that the}} station's antenna tower, which had radio frequency potential at the base, was not enclosed inside a fence or other <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Additionally, the station's public inspection file consisted {{of only a few}} letters from the public." ...|$|E
50|$|Field hedges {{instead of}} fences or barbed wire to protect fields from damage from nearby grazing cattle are {{widespread}} {{across the whole}} of the Monschau Land. They are typically made from red beech. At regular intervals individual stems are allowed to stand, that grow into large trees. As well as their <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> function they act as windbreaks. By reducing the wind speed, soil erosion is minimised and the fields protected from drying out. The hedges also provide habitats for rodents and resting sites for migrating birds. The wood of the pleached trees is still widely used today for firewood.|$|E
50|$|Sea bathing is {{swimming}} in the sea or in sea water and a sea bath is a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> for sea bathing. Unlike bathing in a swimming pool, which is generally done for pleasure or exercise purposes, sea bathing was once thought to have curative or therapeutic value. It arose from the medieval practice of visiting spas for the beneficial effects of the waters. The practice of sea bathing {{dates back to the}} 17th century but became popular in the late 18th century. The development of the first swimsuits dates from the period as does the development of the bathing machine.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, many {{livestock}} herders {{living near}} Yala National Park, Sri Lanka have reported livestock losses due to predation by leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya). Despite herders’ attempts to safeguard their cattle, livestock depredation remains an issue, sometimes causing herders to kill leopards in retaliation. In {{an effort to}} mitigate the human-leopard conflict, <b>protective</b> cattle <b>enclosures</b> made from steel pipes and mesh wire were introduced to prevent leopard attacks on cattle. This study aims to assess the severity of leopard predation on livestock, understand the methods used in retaliatory killings, examine the effectiveness of existing livestock protection methods, and evaluate the success of steel <b>protective</b> cattle <b>enclosures</b> on limiting livestock predation. The results indicate high predation rates on juvenile livestock, and indicate that poison {{is the leading cause}} of leopard fatalities. Furthermore, the majority of existing livestock protection methods did not significantly decrease predation rates, but <b>protective</b> cattle <b>enclosures</b> were very effective at reducing predation rates. However, high production costs make these enclosures an unsustainable solution. Subsequently, alternative policies like a government- funded compensation scheme for herders who endure livestock losses should be considered to minimize human-leopard conflict...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{internal}} {{structure of a}} state {{is determined by the}} state boundaries. To speak of state borders with regard to a uniting Europe is no easy task, since the import of the expression is changing within the framework of this integration. The outer borders of the EU lie along natural boundaries, and therefore may be clearly defined, while serving as <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> for achievements which present inhabitants reached over many decades. In recent decades this produced a predominantly isolating tendency, and its liberalization in relation to penetrability may be mainly interpreted {{as a result of the}} expansion process. It seems appropriate to emphasise this notion, since after enlargement in 2004, today's Schengen border will partly become an internal one, and in parallel will be gradually pushed eastwards, creating a wall or barrier in regions where it was traditionally desirable to maintain penetrability...|$|R
30|$|Significant {{risk for}} damage to {{some types of}} {{sensitive}} materials, due to exposure to an acidic atmosphere, was observed in the icons and textile room and book store room in the Tismana monastery. Materials at risk {{were found to be}} especially lead and sensitive glass, with some risk also for iron objects and varnish (Laropal A 81, resin mastic, dammar). Some risk for photo-oxidation of paper and sensitive pigments was found. Sensitive objects could be moved out of rooms with high acid emissions, probably mostly from wood materials. It would be especially important to avoid high humidity situations with RH above ~ 60 %, which accelerate corrosion. It would be beneficial to keep rooms cool. Rooms could be ventilated when the outdoor air is good (clean, dry and cool). Paper and objects with sensitive pigments could be moved into showcases or <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures,</b> or moved away from exposure to outdoor air and light.|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} image, a daguerreotypist would polish {{a sheet of}} {{silver-plated}} copper to a mirror finish, treat it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive, expose it in a camera {{for as long as}} was judged to be necessary, which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting; make the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor; remove its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment, rinse and dry it, then seal the easily marred result behind glass in a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{open frame}} monitor {{provides}} the LCD monitor and enough supporting structure to hold associated electronics and to minimally support the LCD. Provision {{will be made}} for attaching the unit to some external structure for support and protection. Open frame LCDs are intended to be built into some other piece of equipment. An arcade video game {{would be a good}} example with the display mounted inside the cabinet. There is usually an open frame display inside all end-use displays with the end-use display simply providing an attractive <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Some rack mount LCD manufacturers will purchase desk-top displays, take them apart, and discard the outer plastic parts, keeping the inner open-frame LCD for inclusion into their product.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bachelor}} {{writing the}} letters uses various elements of American culture as examples {{to examine the}} larger cultural trends; for example, he uses the American navy's systems of promotion and preference, {{as an example of}} the larger American government's creation of a meritocratic allocation of authority. At times, too, the book doesn't fully confront all of the social issues confronting early America, instead representing them as idealized: for example, James D. Wallace describes the book as treating the domestic sphere as a [...] " [...] "sheltered space," [...] a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> not only for domestic values and religious ideas, but for gentlemanly honor, literary creation, and the very republican principles on which America was founded" [...] (a concept known as Republican motherhood in scholarship).|$|E
5000|$|One {{major issue}} to {{consider}} for field emitters {{is the effect}} of contamination. In order to achieve electron emission at low voltages, field emitter array tips are built on a micrometer-level scale sizes. Their performance depends on the precise construction of these small structures. They are also dependent on being constructed with a material possessing a low work-function. These factors can render the device extremely sensitive to contamination, especially from hydrocarbons and other large, easily polymerized molecules. Techniques for avoiding, eliminating, or operating in the presence of contaminations in ground testing and ionospheric (e.g. spacecraft outgassing) environments are critical. Research at the University of Michigan and elsewhere has focused on this outgassing issue. <b>Protective</b> <b>enclosures,</b> electron cleaning, robust coatings, and other design features are being developed as potential solutions. [...] FEAs used for space applications still require the demonstration of long term stability, repeatability, and reliability of operation at gate potentials appropriate to the space applications.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{in-depth}} study of applying {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) to real-world habitat monitoring. A set of system design requirements were developed that cover the hardware design of the nodes, the sensor network software, <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures,</b> and system architecture {{to meet the requirements}} of biologists. In the summer of 2002, 43 nodes were deployed on a small island off the coast of Maine streaming useful live data onto the web. Although researchers anticipate some challenges arising in real-world deployments of WSNs, many problems can only be discovered through experience. We present a set of experiences from a four month long deployment on a remote island. We analyze the environmental and node health data to evaluate system performance. The close integration of WSNs with their environment provides environmental data at densities previously impossible. We show that the sensor data is also useful for predicting system operation and network failures. Based on over one million 2 Polastre et. al. data readings, we analyze the node and network design and develop network reliability profiles and failure models...|$|R

5000|$|Along the Way at {{four points}} {{there are also}} {{information}} boards relating to the Robert the Bruce Trail. Robert, later to become Robert I King of Scotland, was the 7th Lord of Annandale from 1304 till 1312. When the Norman family of Brus was granted land in Annandale by King David I it was at Annan that they settled at first. They built their Motte-and-bailey castle here shortly after 1124. Although the structural evidence of the castle has long since been removed the large mound (motte) on which the fort was built and the lower <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> (bailey) with its defensive man-made cliff face is still there {{to be seen and}} the Way passes very close by. There is also a stone known as the Bruce Stone in Annan town hall which dates from around 1300 and has inscribed on it [...] "Robert de Brus Count of Carrick and Lord of Annandale". The information boards near the castle are rich in information about the Brus dynasty and their connection with Annan.|$|E
5000|$|The AKS-74U {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting system with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: [...] "П" [...] corresponding to a 350 m [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting and [...] "4-5" [...] (used for firing at distances between 400 - 500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> that is riveted to the receiver's spring-loaded top cover. This top cover hinges from the barrel trunnion, pivoting forward when opened, which also works to unlock the gas tube cover. Both the gas tube and handguard are also of a new type and are shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent [...] "bullet rise" [...] within approximately -5 to +42 cm relative {{to the line of}} sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.|$|E
50|$|On 14 December 1838, {{after the}} Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River, 50 km {{away from their}} target UmGungundlovu via the risky Italeni access route, an advance {{scouting}} party including Pretorius brought news of large Zulu forces arriving nearby. While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers far away from their base and Italeni. Instead Pretorius built a fortified Wagon Laager on terrain of his own choosing, {{in the hope that}} general Ndlela would attack it as at Veglaer.As the site for the overnight wagon camp, Pretorius chose a defensible area next to a hippo pool in the Ncome River that provided excellent rear protection. The open area to the front provided no cover for an attacking force, and a deep dry river bed protected one of the wagon laager flanks. As usual, the ox wagons were drawn into a <b>protective</b> <b>enclosure</b> or laager. Movable wooden barriers that could be opened quickly were fastened between each wagon to prevent intruders, and two smoothbore artillery pieces were positioned. Andries Pretorius brought a 6lb naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie. The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies. Both were used to fire grapeshot.|$|E
50|$|The {{pituitary}} gland is a pea-sized gland that {{sits in a}} <b>protective</b> bony <b>enclosure</b> called the sella turcica (Turkish chair/saddle). It is composed of three lobes: the anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobes. In many animals, these lobes are distinct. However, in humans, the intermediate lobe is but a few cell layers thick and indistinct; as a result, it is often considered {{as part of the}} anterior pituitary. In all animals, the fleshy, glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition of the posterior pituitary.|$|R
30|$|The {{indicated}} {{risk for}} acidic damage to metallic materials and sensitive (medieval) glass, and moderate risk for varnishes, in {{rooms in the}} Tismana monastery, due to exposure to acetic and formic acids, is expected in relatively closed rooms with low ventilation and significant emission especially from wood. The acidic atmospheres could initiate and accelerate surface corrosion on for example glass paintings and metallic objects. One could consider if such objects should be moved from the rooms. It would be beneficial to keep the rooms cool, and ventilate the rooms under good (dry, cool) outdoor conditions without producing dramatic climatic fluctuations. As organic acid attack increases significantly at higher air humidity (>[*]~  60 %), this would be especially important to avoid [37, 39 – 41]. To most organic objects the acidic atmospheres would be of little risk [6, 14]. A moderate photo-oxidation risk was indicated for paper and sensitive pigments. Such materials would be present in objects in the icons and textile and the bookstore rooms. For preservation {{in the long term}} additional protection of such objects against exposure to light and outdoor air would be beneficial, by similar methods as suggested for the National military museum, for example by using showcase or <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures.</b>|$|R
30|$|Air quality {{measurements}} and risk assessment for cultural heritage materials were {{performed in the}} National military museum and the Tismana monastery in Gorj County in Romania, by applying Memori® methodology, dosimetry and passive pollution parameter sampling. Some risk was indicated for photo-oxidising damage to some types of sensitive materials in the National military museum in Bucharest. The highest risk for observable damage, which would need active conservation within 3  years, {{was found in a}} contemporary history exhibition room in the main museum building. The photo-oxidising damage risk in the room was evaluated to be similar to a typical European historic house. A moderate risk for observable damage, which would need active conservation within 30  years, was found in a warehouse, a storeroom and inside enclosures used in the museum, comparable to typical European purpose built museum locations. The materials most at risk were found to be sensitive pigments and paper. Some risk for damage to copper, lead, and sensitive glass was indicated. The risk could be reduced by measures to protect the objects against exposure to outdoor city air ventilated into the building, and against possible excessive light exposure and high and fluctuating temperature and humidity. The present use of <b>protective</b> <b>enclosures</b> has these functions.|$|R
