50|$|In late May 2008, {{a mobile}} crane and <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> were on site {{preparing}} for construction. It {{was reported that}} law firm Davies Arnold Cooper was to take up 80000 sq ft of office space, and subsequently that the restaurant {{which was to be}} at the top of the tower was let. The tower was well under construction, with steel rebar cages already inserted into the ground, which formed part of the piles that would hold the weight of the tower. In November 2008 another <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> came into use on the site, as well as steel plates for the piles.|$|E
50|$|A pier {{adjacent}} to the fallen pier needed to be stabilised, and this was done by driving a timber pier to support it. During {{the course of this}} work, the barge carrying the contractor's <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> broke away at night when it was anchored unmanned. Again in flood tide conditions to travelled upstream. The Resident Engineer commandeered a power launch and tried to board the barge and take control, but his propellers were fouled by trailing ropes and he was unable to do so. The barge then drifted downstream on the subsequent ebb tide, and the crane jib struck the bridge, causing the collapse of the crane jib.|$|E

50|$|Eight {{accidents}} {{occurred during}} the construction of Line 1. In total, 2 {{people were killed and}} 21 injured during the construction of the line. The first accident occurred in May 2008 when 1 person was killed and another injured, when a <b>pile</b> <b>rig</b> collapsed at a construction site in Andheri (West). In 2009, 4 people were injured, when a steel reinforcement cage and temporary scaffolding of a concrete pillar caved in it Andheri (East). In April 2012, a crane at a construction site in Ghatkopar, veered off a truck and crashed on a portion of the nearby Sarvodaya Hospital. No one was injured as the affected portion of the hospital building was empty at the time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{standard}} {{site investigation}} (SI) {{undertaken in the}} Netherlands for a small plot intended for a house, in the centre of The Hague, would consist of two cone penetration tests (for foundations) and two auger boreholes (for contaminated ground). Small sites may not be suited to all foundation solutions owing to varying manoeuvrability and size of <b>piling</b> <b>rigs.</b> In a vacant lot of 5 m by 10 m only a hollow steel tube-piling rig could access the site. The contractor chose this rig in preference to the design-recommended driven concrete piles, which required a much larger rig. The insertion of the steel tubes caused severe vibrations and subsidence of neighbouring structures {{to such a degree}} that the municipal inspector halted the work. University of Technology, Delft.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{hydraulic}} pile driving hammers to overcome energy losses during freefall enables {{a greater proportion}} of the impact energy to be transferred to the pile in comparison to diesel hammers. This percentage, termed the energy transfer ratio, is not routinely measured in practice however, and {{there is an element of}} uncertainty regarding appropriate energy transfer ratios to assume in driveability analyses. In light of such uncertainties, the energy transfer ratios of four- and five-tonne hydraulic hammers were assessed during installation of driven cast-in-situ piles at several sites in the United Kingdom. The <b>piling</b> <b>rigs</b> were fitted with instrumentation which enabled measurement of the hammer velocity (and hence kinetic energy) at impact for each blow during installation, with the corresponding magnitude of energy transferred to the closed-ended steel installation tube ascertained using a Pile Driving Analyser. The results of the study showed that energy transfer ratios were strongly dependent on the hammer drop height, with transfer ratios of 95 % advocated by the pile hammer manufacturer only achievable when a drop height in excess of about 600 mm was used. As such, lower energy transfer ratios may need to be considered in driveability predictions for these pile types (i. e. steel or DCIS piles) if lower drop heights are used during driving. Further research is required to substantiate limited data suggesting that soil type may also be influential...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for piling works by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 work elements of piling works were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand. The synthetic equations were derived with multiple regressions analysis method using statistic software package. These work elements consisted of pile driving work, moving <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> left or right on supporting rails, moving supporting rails left or right, moving <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> and supporting rails back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile. The researchers found that these productivity values were reliable compared to general practice, and could be applied in construction planning and scheduling in Phuket province or other area with similar geological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Drilled {{displacement}} piles {{have been}} used {{around the world for}} decades as foundation elements for structures and embankments. Typically the pile toes are designed to penetrate into stiff or dense soil formations to achieve sufficient base resistance. Recent research at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia has discovered that the in situ stress conditions in stiff to hard clays is directly related to pile installation rates, which in turn are a function of the <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> capacity and ground conditions. With adequate and constant pile penetration rates in situ stress conditions in the stiff to hard clay are increased by about 40 %, resulting in significantly higher pile capacities. If pile penetration rates are too slow the in situ stress conditions are reduced considerably by remoulding and shearing of the clay. The paper presents the results of full-scale test piles at a stiff to hard clay site installed using different full-scale piling equipment...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} {{emissions}} {{to the environment}} imposed by different human activities has been increasing {{at an alarming rate}} over the past decades. Measurement and control of air pollutant emissions into the atmosphere can lead towards reducing the emission level considerably. Construction industry is a major contributor to the environmental emissions due to the extensive use of construction equipment, which is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and harmful substances such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. Pile foundation is extensively used in high-rise buildings construction and it involves operation of heavy construction equipment. This study developed a process-based model to quantify environmental emissions of equipment usage in a typical pile foundation construction using the US EPA methodology. The emissions of excavation works govern the total emissions at site because of the high usage hours of excavators. In general the emission rates of <b>piling</b> <b>rig</b> and concrete pumping truck were found to be the highest although excavator emission rates are higher for carbon monoxide and particulate matter. It is seen that careful selection of machines and equipment can reduce the emissions up to 10 %. These findings of the study could be effectively used for minimizing the environmental emissions by careful selection of suitable equipment and technology...|$|E
50|$|Draglines {{fall into}} two broad categories: those {{that are based on}} standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site. Most crawler cranes, with an added winch drum on the front, can act as a dragline. These units (like other cranes) are {{designed}} to be dismantled and transported over the road on flatbed trailers. Draglines used in civil engineering are almost always of this smaller, crane type. These are used for road, port construction, pond and canal dredging, and as <b>pile</b> driving <b>rigs.</b> These types are built by crane manufacturers such as Link-Belt and Hyster.|$|R
50|$|Specialty {{equipment}} which installs piles using {{hydraulic rams}} to press piles into the ground. This system is preferred where vibration is a concern. There are press attachments that can adapt to conventional <b>pile</b> driving <b>rigs</b> to press 2 pairs of sheet piles at a time. Additional types of press equipment sit {{on top of}} existing sheet piles and grip onto previously driven piles. This system allows for greater press-in and extraction force to be used since more reaction force is developed. The reaction based machines operate at only 69 dB at 23 ft allowing for installation and extraction of piles in very close proximity to noise and vibration sensitive areas where traditional methods may threaten the stability of existing structures.|$|R
50|$|Ductile iron piles {{have been}} {{successfully}} used {{on a range of}} projects throughout the world. Designs in accordance with the EuroCode (EC) have proved to be competitive with drilled micropiles and various other types of end bearing piles. TRM piles have been designed in both friction and end bearing applications. The TRM pile system provided both financial, as well as operational benefits to completed projects. For example, mobilizing an excavator versus a <b>pile</b> driving <b>rig</b> provided substantial logistical and driving advantages. When soil conditions differ adding pile length proves to be an easy task. We believe that the TRM system will not only have great advantages on tight sites with deep depths to the end bearing stratum we believe as well that the TRM system will be used very efficiently on projects where loads can be shed in friction at shallower depths. Both end bearing and friction TRM piles will prove to be cost-effective, adaptable to varied site grading conditions and the simplicity of mobilization. The virtually vibration free driving process allows the installation of piles immediately adjacent to existing structures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a combined experimental and advanced computational study to understand the dynamic response of a pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheet pile of 9 m length that is installed into the ground near Venice, Italy. The peak embedment force of 10 kN is applied at the top as a sinusoidal compression force having a maximum frequency of circa 760 Hz. Physical measurements from accelerometers are reported for the lateral deformation response of a single sheet pile and of a unit restrained by an installed waterfront barrier. A finite-element modeling methodology for the two test configurations is developed by using the Strand 7 code, so that advanced computational results can be compared against the field application measurements. Closed-form equations for the fundamental frequency are developed, with one accounting {{for the presence of}} rotary inertia and shear deformation. Dynamic responses at different embedment lengths (1 - 7 m) are examined, and a very good correlation is found between theory and practice. Numerically, the performance of the FRP sheet pile is compared with the response of a fictitious sheet pile of steel and with two new FRP geometries that increase stiffness to minimize flexure about the minor axis of bending. By increasing the mass by 10 %, the maximum lateral displacement can be the same as the steel unit and 1 / 20 of the tested FRP unit. Findings of the research demonstrate that the FRP unit can be installed by using the same <b>pile</b> driving <b>rig</b> and procedure for steel sheet piling...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of displacement pile capacity in sand is {{hampered by the}} extreme changes in stress which occur {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pile during installation (Randolph 2003). High quality instrumented tests on steel model piles, such as those reported by Lehane (1992) and Chow (1997), have helped identify other factors that have a bearing on preformed displacement pile behaviour in sand. These factors include the extent of soil displacement during installation and loading, the reduction in shaft friction due to increasing load cycles during installation (referred to as friction fatigue), increases in radial stresses due to dilation at the pile-soil interface, differences in shaft resistance with loading direction (i. e. compressive and tensile loading) and increases in shaft capacity with time, i. e. pile ageing. The majority of these phenomena have now been incorporated in four new cone penetration test (CPT) -based design methods which give superior estimates of preformed displacement pile capacity in sand in comparison to traditional methods. The knowledge gained from the high-quality studies of displacement pile behaviour is now being applied to other pile types such as partial displacement piles (e. g. open-ended piles) and replacement piles (e. g. bored and screw piles). One category of pile which has received sparse attention is the driven cast-in-situ (DCIS) pile which is typically classified as a large displacement pile, despite sharing certain aspects of its construction with replacement pile types. Furthermore, there are relatively few case histories of load tests on DCIS piles in the literature to verify the assumption that they behave as full displacement piles. The behaviour of DCIS piles during installation, curing and maintained load testing was therefore investigated by constructing a total of seven instrumented DCIS piles in layered soils and sand at sites in the United Kingdom. The resistance of the steel installation tube during driving was derived using instrumentation fitted to the DCIS <b>piling</b> <b>rigs.</b> The variation in temperature and strain after casting was monitored continuously in three of the test piles to examine the development of residual loads during curing. After developing sufficient concrete strength, the test piles were subjected to maintained compression load tests to failure (i. e. a displacement in excess of 10 % of the pile diameter), with the shaft and base resistance during loading derived from strain measured within the test piles using vibrating wire strain gauges. The installation resistance derived by the rig instrumentation shows good agreement with the base resistance profile derived by the University of Western Australia UWA- 05 method using the Dutch averaging technique. Residual loads developed during curing of the DCIS piles installed in layered soils due to consolidation settlement of soft soil layers as pore pressures induced by the driving process dissipated. On the other hand, residual loads for DCIS piles in uniform sand were negligible. The instrumented DCIS piles in sand exhibited a clear reduction in normalised local shear stresses and radial effective stresses at failure with distance from the pile base, i. e. friction fatigue, which is a well-known characteristic of preformed displacement piles and its existence for DCIS piles implies that radial stresses during driven installation of the steel tube are not erased upon concreting and tube withdrawal. The normalised base resistance at failure showed excellent agreement with the UWA- 05 design method for driven closed-ended displacement piles, with the onset of degradation in base stiffness occurring at large base displacements. Design correlations have subsequently been developed {{based on the results of}} the instrumented DCIS pile tests. The main implication of the experimental data for DCIS pile design in sand is that the shaft, base and total capacities of a DCIS pile are similar to a preformed closed-ended displacement pile of equivalent dimensions. In keeping with this finding, an examination of the predictive performance of seven CPT-based displacement pile design methods using a database of 26 DCIS pile load tests with adjacent CPT qc profiles demonstrated that the recent methods provide improved estimates of DCIS shaft, base and total capacity in comparison to traditional simplified methods. However, a statistical study of DCIS pile load-displacement behaviour in sand using a database of 105 pile load tests showed that the total resistance of a DCIS pile tends to mobilise at a slower rate in comparison to preformed driven displacement piles, implying that DCIS piles may exhibit greater levels of displacement for a given applied load...|$|R
