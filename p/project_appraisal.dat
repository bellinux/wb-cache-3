And when wider impacts are part of appraisal, their quantification should follow consistent procedures. Policy-oriented research should focus on these procedures, not on producing general results, as the latter are thought to be irrelevant to policy, to the extent they exist. ...|$|R

Novel results revealed the specific role of mothers' math-gender stereotypes in relation to daughters, but not sons: Mothers' math-gender stereotypes predicted girls' math self-perception which, in turn, predicted girls' appraisal of both mothers' and fathers' evaluations of their ability. Importantly, children's appraisal of parents' evaluations was related more strongly with their own self-perception of ability than to parents' actual evaluations, thus supporting the <b>projected</b> <b>appraisal</b> versus the reflected appraisal model of the development of self-perception...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1960 s, economists have been {{developing}} methodologies to measure environmental impacts. Among the approaches {{most widely used}} are the travel cost method (TCM) and the contingent valuation method (CVM). Generally, these methods provide a reasonable approximation {{of the value of}} a non-marketed environmental good or service; their drawbacks are that they are time-consuming and expensive. The pressures of time and budget are common during <b>project</b> <b>appraisals.</b> Traditional cost-benefit analyses (CBA) are now supplemented by environmental impact assessments (EIA) with results that are often difficult to reconcile. While the CBA is expressed in monetary value, the EIA is usually in physical terms. To compare the two, the EIA must be converted to a monetary value; but time and money for a full-scale valuation are rarely available. The use of 'benefit transfer' (BT) is often advocated (ADB, 1996). This involves taking the results from one or more primary economic studies with estimated values for similar impacts, and modifying and transferring them to the project being evaluated. In cases where a high degree of precision is not critical, BT may provide useful information for decision-making. Frequently, it will be the only way of providing such information. The inclusion of environmental impacts in <b>project</b> <b>appraisals</b> has increased greatly in the last 10 years. Interest in benefit transfer has grown correspondingly and literature on the subject is now substantial (e. g., Desvouges, et al. 1992; Navrud, 1996). But efforts to test the approach in developing countries are relatively few. Since most original valuation studies have been done in developing countries, efforts to validate the transfer of values between developed and developing countries, and between developing countries, are especially needed.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{complexities}} involving <b>project</b> <b>appraisals</b> and foreign exchanges in the U. S. It is convenient to suppose that the government simultaneously optimizes with respect to all variables within its control, {{and it is the}} implication of this supposition that has been explored in much of the recent literature on project evaluation. But as a model of government behavior it is not persuasive. Moreover, the analysis of government behavior becomes critical in situations where prices and wages are not perfectly flexible. A full-Optimum allocation of resources is, under quite general circumstances, characterized by overall production efficiency for the economy. If trade possibilities exist these are included as production options. Distorting taxes are then a device by which the government can hope to increase social welfare. It is then possible to show that under fairly general circumstances a second-best optimum is characterized again by overall production efficiency...|$|R
