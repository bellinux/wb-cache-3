50|$|This is a {{model of}} a {{two-seater}} roadster style car, possibly based on the look and style of a Mercer Raceabout from the early 20th century. The model first appeared in late 1976 and was designed by Steve Malins with input from George Morris. The first versions were finished in red and white with black upholstery (still available), newer versions have recently appeared in green/brass or burgundy/brass finishes. A silver 4-seater limousine based on the Roadster is also a popular model appearing in the 1980s. The boiler cover forms the 'bonnet' of the car with the sight-glass for checking the water level being the 'radiator grille'. Early versions sported the traditional overflow plug, which was replaced by the sight glass in 1978 to conform with the new Euro Toy Regulations. The earliest Roadsters were meths fired, appearing in late 1976. From about 1977 all models used a steel <b>pan</b> <b>type</b> solid fuel burner, although the older steel pan meths burners still fitted. The oscillating-cylinder engine is mounted externally on the left-hand side of the model and incorporates a simple forward and reverse lever like that used on the SE2a and MEC1 stationary engines. The unit drives a small solid flywheel mounted externally on the right-hand side via a shaft. Again a distinguishing feature of early models is the 'split-drive' with final drive on the left hand side as opposed to later (and current) models were the drive is all on the right. This shaft drives the rear axle by a power band. This arrangement allows a slightly higher road speed than the SW1 wagon but much slower than the TE1 traction engine (which was ridiculously too fast). This chassis and layout is used on other mobiles in the Mamod ranges such as the LB1 London bus, FE1 fire engine, SA1L limousine as well as the DV1/2 vans. The early wheels are in the style of wooden carriage wheels (as found on cars of the period - these were known as artillery wheels), with solid rubber tyres. Later models used a redesigned wheel which was based upon the design used for the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Details such as running boards, spare wheel and carriage lamps are also fitted.|$|E

40|$|M. Sc. Mpumalanga, “the {{place where}} the sun rises”, sets the scene {{for one of the}} rarest wetland types in South Africa. They are formed on one of the last {{remnants}} of the ancient African land surface, contain peat and together with a variety of other <b>pan</b> <b>types</b> make up the Mpumalanga Lakes District. Of these approximately 320 pans, only ± 2. 3 % are reed pans. These endorheic wetlands are unique from other <b>pan</b> <b>types</b> and peatlands in South Africa and support an abundant biodiversity. They perform vital functions such as water storage, filtering out impurities and carbon fixation, which prevents an excess release of CO 2 into the atmosphere. There is very little known about these endorheic wetlands and thus they are constantly being threatened by various activities such as agriculture, livestock and mining. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatial and temporal variation of macroinvertebrate community structures of reed pans and the environmental factors, such as water quality, responsible for the maintenance of these structures; to determine the best method for sampling aquatic invertebrates in reed pans; as well as to determine the relationship between aquatic invertebrates and the water, sediment and habitat quality of a reed pan. Together with this the amphibian diversity as well as the occurrence of other biotic components was determined. Four reed pans were assessed during four different seasons over a one year period to account for the different hydrological extremes. Sub-surface water samples were analyzed for their suspended solid content, nutrient levels, metals and chlorophyll-a concentrations as well as in situ water quality parameters. Sediment samples were analyzed for metal concentrations, organic carbon and water content, as well as sediment size distribution.

40|$|A bias of T cell {{immunity}} towards type 2 (Th 2) {{is thought}} to be critical for normal pregnancy. Pathological pregnancies, such as pre-eclampsia, are characterised by cell-mediated (Th 1) immune dominance. The Th 1 /Th 2 paradigm, however, is too simplistic. Normal pregnancy is associated with a systemic inflammatory response which increases throughout gestation. This inflammatory response is exaggerated in pre-eclampsia, a syndrome of the third trimester. T helper (Th) cells are considered the primary mediators of these altered immune responses, and other T cells, i. e. T cytotoxic (Tc) cells, and lymphocytes of the innate immune system, i. e. natural killer (NK) and NKT cells, have been largely disregarded. In this study, we have used novel <b>pan</b> <b>type</b> 1 (IL- 18 receptor) and <b>pan</b> <b>type</b> 2 (ST 2 L) lymphocyte function markers in four-colour flow cytometry to broadly characterise peripheral blood lymphocyte populations from non-pregnant, normal pregnant and pre-eclamptic women. There were no changes in the Th 1 /Th 2 or Tc 1 /Tc 2 cell ratios between the three groups; however, the NK 1 /NK 2 and NKT 1 /NKT 2 cell ratios were significantly decreased in normal pregnancy compared with non-pregnant (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 01, respectively) and pre-eclamptic women (p < 0. 05). These results confirm that immunoregulation occurs in pregnancy, but suggest a dominant role of the innate rather than the adaptive immune system...|$|E

The results showed considerable differences between methods. The lowest values were obtained with the measurement by evaporation station type A, slightly higher values were calculated by simple Thornthwait equation and the highest by FAO Penman-Monteith equation. Analysis of the influential factors showed that on the research plot the most influential factor is solar radiation, followed by relative humidity.

40|$|Introduction: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotizing {{vasculitis}} of smallto-medium-sized vessels, rarely {{associated with}} hematologic neoplasms. Case report: We report a 44 -year-old {{man with a}} history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) who presented with rapidly progressing sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Two weeks after onset the patient developed severe acute acral and retinal ischemia. MR-angiography and nerve biopsy revealed a systemic necrotizing vasculitis (<b>PAN</b> <b>type).</b> At this time, bone marrow biopsy identified a smoldering multiple myeloma. Immediate immunosuppressive and anti-neoplastic treatment (steroids, immunoglobulins, bortezomib combined with cyclophosphamide followed by lenalidomide maintenance) resulted in a favorable clinical outcome. After 4 years, the patient is in good clinical condition with sustained partial remission from myeloma and without evidence of relapse of PAN. Conclusion: This is a remarkable case of a histologically confirmed peripheral neuropathy due to polyarteritis nodosa associated with progression of MGUS to multiple myeloma. Immediate diagnosis and combined immunosuppressive and anti-neoplastic treatment may improve the outcome of this potentially life-threatening clinical condition...|$|E
40|$|ZigBee {{is a low}} power, low data {{wireless}} protocol that is {{used for}} low rate short range (<b>PAN</b> <b>type)</b> networks due to simplicity and ease of use. Different attempts have been proposed to secure the ZigBee networks by proposing a stack modification. Our approach, however, does not require any changes to the protocol stack or to the ZigBee device, and therefore has potential for further application. This approach, as summarized in this paper, is by detecting malicious activities in ZigBee network and denying access. To test the approach we have built a testbed and have experimented with the most likely scenarios of attack for ZigBee sensor networks. It was discovered that the Network Discovery process is the key in all attack scenarios. The idea of adding an intrusion detection system eliminates the threats that are presented by the stack pitfalls and requires no particular change to the existing stack or network. It was observed that the system has successfully secured this process without interrupting or adding traffic to the ZigBee network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Hydro {{electric}} barrel turbines can be {{used for}} extraction of clean energy from water flowing at velocity more than 1 m/sec.

40|$|The {{effects of}} grazing on plant biomass, plant quality, species evenness, species {{diversity}} and species composition were determined among management types (communal, commercial and game) and among habitat types (open savanna, rocky and pan) in a semiarid savanna in South Africa.

40|$|Measurements of CH 2 O from a {{tunable diode}} laser {{absorption}} spectrometer (TDLAS) were acquired onboard the NASA DC- 8 {{during the summer}} 2004 INTEX-NA (Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment - North America) campaign to test our understanding of convection and production mechanisms in the upper troposphere (UT, 6 - 12 -km) over continental North America and the North Atlantic Ocean. Point-by-point comparisons with box model calculations, when MHP (CH 3 OOH) measurements were available for model constraint, resulted in a median CH 2 O measurement/model ratio of 0. 91 in the UT. Multiple tracers were used {{to arrive at a}} set of UT CH 2 O background and perturbed air mass periods, and 46 % of the TDLAS measurements fell within the latter category. At least 66 % to 73 % of these elevated UT observations were caused by enhanced production from CH 2 O precursors rather than direct transport of CH 2 O from the boundary layer. This distinction is important, since the effects from the former can last for over a week or more compared to one day or less in the case of convective transport of CH 2 O itself. In general, production of CH 2 O from CH 4 was found to be the dominant source term, even in perturbed air masses. This was followed by production from MHP, methanol, <b>PAN</b> <b>type</b> compounds, and ketones, in descending order of their contribution. In the presence of elevated NO from lightning and potentially from the stratosphere, there was a definite trend in the CH 2 O discrepancy, which for the highest NO mixing ratios produced a median CH 2 O measurement/model ratio of 3. 9 in the 10 - 12 -km range. Discrepancies in CH 2 O and HO 2 in the UT with NO were highly correlated and this provided further information as to the possible mechanism(s) responsible. These discrepancies with NO are consistent with additional production sources of both gases involving CH 3 O 2 + NO reactions, most likely caused by unmeasured hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|The nonisothermal {{behavior}} of amorphous alpha,alpha-trehalose {{has been studied}} {{in order to identify}} the factors influencing the recrystallization process. Particular emphasis has been placed on examining the effect of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) <b>pan</b> <b>type</b> and initial water content on the thermal response. Samples of freeze-dried trehalose with water levels up to 6 % w/w were sealed in pinholed and hermetically sealed pans and analyzed using DSC at a scanning rate of 10 degreesC/min in conjunction with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with the dihydrate studied in pinholed pans for comparison. The dihydrate was found to exhibit two endotherms at ca. 100 degreesC and 122 degreesC, followed by a further endotherm at 211 degreesC that was attributed to melting of the anhydrate. Isolation of the material following the first endotherm indicated that the material generated at this temperature was the T-gamma form. Amorphous material heated in pinholed pans exhibited an exotherm at ca. 100 - 150 degreesC (the value depending on water content) when the initial water levels were 4. 1 % or below. This response was accompanied by dehydration and was attributed to the formation of the crystalline anhydrate. Higher water content samples, however, showed an exotherm followed immediately by an endotherm, with the water loss taking place in two distinct stages. XRD studies indicated that these samples initially crystallized into the T-gamma form, followed by subsequent dehydration to the anhydrate. Samples analyzed in hermetically sealed pans showed a single exotherm between 100 and 150 degreesC followed by a broad endotherm between 150 and 200 degreesC, with higher water content samples having lower values for both events. XRD indicated that the exotherm and endotherm corresponded to the formation and fusion of the T-gamma form, respectively. The study has therefore shown that the recrystallization {{behavior of}} amorphous trehalose is dependent on both the initial water content and the environment in which recrystallization takes place...|$|E
40|$|Accurate thermal {{characterisation}} of {{composite structures}} can help structural designers in predicting thermal paths in a spacecraft structure and assessing {{the effect of}} modifying materials on the structure’s overall thermal performance. Existing spacecraft thermal analysis software lack the ability to model anisotropic thermal properties of composite materials. This in turn leads to inaccurate prediction of their thermal behaviour. The thesis describes the applied modelling methods and assumptions {{that are used to}} simulate the thermal characteristics of the MASCOT Landing Module’s (LM) composite structure. MASCOT is a 10 kg shoebox-sized lander platform developed by DLR in cooperation with CNES and JAXA for the Hayabusa 2 sample return mission from the asteroid 1999 JU 3. The MASCOT LM structure’s framework walls are made from a Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer/Foam sandwich. The M 55 J fibres used for the unidirectional sandwich face sheets are of Polyacrylonitrile (<b>PAN)</b> <b>type</b> and have high stiffness and strength properties, but poor thermal conductivity. Also, the glued connections between the framework walls are realised with PAN fibre patches. This is one reason, which necessitated a thermal sub-system consisting of heat pipes and a radiator. Both contribute with a total mass of 450 g, almost the same as the structural mass (550 g). Also, the structural design is itself influenced by the needs of the thermal subsystem. The modelling is carried out using Patran whereby methods to develop a thermal finite element model from the existing structural model are assessed and steady state analyses are carried out. To decrease the computational effort for radiation simulation, a novel method of developing radiation shell elements which are overlaid on the solid elements in the structure is described. Subsequently, the results from the finite element simulations are compared to actual temperature measurements, which were performed in a thermal vacuum chamber. The model is correlated with the test results and the method adopted is validated. The next phase of the thesis work involves the use of the developed thermal model to assess solutions for integrating the thermal functions within the LM structure. As a first step, the heat pipes are removed. The impact of the removal of the heat pipes on the LM is assessed and various design solutions are proposed for the MASCOT LM. From the simulations, it is concluded that it is indeed possible to remove the heat pipes from the LM and that a structure-integrated thermal subsystem can be achieved by introducing conductive interfaces in the structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{improved}} {{method of}} double-contrast arthrography for the knee joint, which can give extensive {{information on the}} intra-articular components, was undertaken in 131 knee joints with classical rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial proliferation was classified by its localisation into 6 types: nonproliferated (NP); localised, subdivided into suprapatellar pouch (SPP), proper articular (PA), and posterior (POST); panarticular (PAN); and burned out type (BO). These types are intimately related to the radiological stage and pathological changes of the articular cartilage and menisci. By following the dynamic changes of synovial proliferation by arthrography the clinical course of the rheumatoid knee joint may be predicted. While in the NP and SPP types destruction of the joint is minimal, it is relatively rapid and severe in the PA and <b>PAN</b> <b>types.</b> Thus the proliferation in the joint proper has a stronger influence on joint destruction than does the suprapatellar pouch. From these results synovectomy to resect proliferated synovial tissues of the joint proper completely, and to resect those of the suprapatellar pouch only superficially in the early stage, was undertaken in 21 rheumatoid arthritic joints, giving excellent results in 80. 9 %.
