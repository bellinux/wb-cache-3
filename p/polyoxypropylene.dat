50|$|At low {{temperatures}} and concentrations (below the critical micelle temperature and critical micelle concentration) individual block copolymers (unimers) {{are present in}} solution. Above these values, aggregation of individual unimers occurs in a process called micellization. This aggregation {{is driven by the}} dehydration of the hydrophobic <b>polyoxypropylene</b> block that becomes progressively less soluble as the polymer concentration or temperature increases. The aggregation of several unimers occurs to minimize the interactions of the PPO blocks with the solvent. Thus, the core of the aggregates is made from the insoluble blocks (<b>polyoxypropylene)</b> while the soluble portion (polyoxyethylene) forms the shell of the micelles.|$|E

The resulting POP-grafted PP copolymers are confirmed by the FTIR analysis, and used as compatibilizers for polyamide 6 (PA 6) and polypropylene blends, These compatibilizers, POP-functionalized PPs (PP-g-MA-co-POPs), have different amphiphilic properties depending {{on the content of}} MA in the starting PP-g-MA and the molar ratio of MA/amine. The compatibilization effect is examined in terms of morphologies, thermal and mechanical properties. The morphologies, affected by the molecular weight of POP diamine in PP-g-MA-co-POP copolymer, show a decreasing size of the dispersed PA 6 particles as the molecular weight of POP diamine increasing from 230 to 400 to 2000. Using these PP-g-MA-co-POP copolymers, the compatibilized blends show improvements in mechanical properties, including Izod impact strength and tensile toughness, over a conventional compatibilizer. The POP and amide functionalities in the compatibilizers can facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonding with PA 6 and, therefore, the compatibilizing effect. During the compounding process, the compatibilizers further react with PA 6 in situ to afford the mixture of PP-g-MA-co-POP-PA 6, PP-g-MA-co-POP-co-PA 6 and PP-g-MA-co-PA 6 copolymers, which further improves the compatibilizing effect.

40|$|The phase {{transition}} properties of poloxamers, in dilute aqueous solution (1 % w/v), detected by high-sensitivity {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (HSDSC) and differential scanning densitometry (DSD) at a scan rate of 30 K h - 1 are reported. Poloxamers are ABA block copolymers of poly(oxyethylene) (A) and <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> (B). The molecular weights of the poloxamers examined range from 2400 to 14 000. The solutions are transparent over the temperature range of the observed {{phase transition}}. By HSDSC, the temperatures (T m) at which the differential excess heat capacity (C p,m) is a maximum range from 297 to 313 K and show good agreement with T m values obtained by DSD. The observed T m values decrease with increasing <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> content. The calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal) of the phase transitions, which range from 133 to 337 kJ mol - 1, increases with increasing <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> content. The partial specific volume changes (Δῡ) of the phase transitions range from 5. 6 × 10 - 3 to 6. 2 × 10 - 2 cm 3 g - 1. The experimentally determined partial specific volumes (ῡ) for the poloxamers in dilute aqueous solution, at temperatures below the phase transition, agree reasonably well with those calculated for β and γ lattice structure forms (orthorhombic perpendicular or monoclinic lattice, respectively). At temperatures above the T m, experimental ῡvalues agree more closely with those calculated for the theoretical α form of hexagonally packed chains based on alkanols, characteristic of the more expanded form. The DSD data are {{discussed in terms of}} partial molal volume (V̄ 2 0) and expansibility (Ē 2 0) at inifinte dilution in water. Both parameters show a dependence on temperature. This suggests that the poloxamers undergo a gradual change in molecular size as a function of temperature, possibly accompanied by a rapid conformational change around the observed T m. Cooperatively values (ΔH vH/ΔH cal) of the phase transitions from HSDSC data are between 1. 2 and 2. 8; this together with the asymmetry of the transitions is indicative of an aggregation process. The relationships between ΔV̄ 2 0 and ΔH cal per average monomer unit vs <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> (POP) /poly(oxyethylene) (POE) ratio indicate that the observed phase transition is associated with the POP portion of the polymer, as both parameters approach zero as the POP/POE ratio approaches 0 : 1. The observed phase transitions are reversible and are unaffected by scan rate (10, 30 and 60 K h - 1) using both techniques and hence show no kinetic limitations.

Sodium salts of <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> -trimellitic amidoacid copolymers (POP-amidoacid), prepared from the reaction of POP-diamines and trimellitic anhydride, were found to self-assemble into orderly molecular bundles. The POP-amidoacid has a symmetrical structure consisting of a hydrophobic POP middle block (2000 g/mole) and four symmetrical carboxyl end groups. By dissolving in water and evaporating on a polyether sulfone film, the POP-amidoacid molecules self-assembled into a unique array with average dimensions of 7 - 13 nm in width, 2 - 5 nm in height, and 20 - 50 nm in length, observed by atomic force microscope. Varied morphologies were also observed when varying the pH, solvents, evaporating rate, concentration, and substrate surface. Unlike the common surfactants of single head-to-tail structure and the naturally occurring phospholipids of one-head and two-tails, the synthesized POP-derivative is a symmetrical structure of four hydrophilic heads and one long hydrophobic block. Through the complementary noncovalent bonding forces, the molecules tend to align into molecular bundles or loops as the primary structure. The formation of different morphologies {{is controlled by the}} intermolecular forces including hydrogen bonding, aromatic π-π stacking, ionic charge, and hydrophobic interaction, in a concerted manner. 2. 	Changes in molecular self-assemblies from <b>poly(oxypropylene)</b> -trimellitic amidoacids or imidoacids have been investigated by using dynamic mode atomic force microscopy (DFM). Imidoacids were prepared from a ring-closure of amidoacids at high temperature. Through DFM continuous scanning, different self-assembled morphologies from amidoacid and imidoacid were observed. Besides the multiplicity of carboxyl functionalities, the backbone variety (oxypropylene vs. oxyethylene) and molecular weight (2000 g/mol vs. 400 g/mol) are important factors affecting the self-assemblies on polyether sulfone surface. These copolymers were found to be amphiphiles demonstrating an ability of lowering interfacial tension at the toluene/water interface.

POP-amidoacid以及POP-imidoacid分子的自我排列的變化性已藉原子力顯微鏡可明顯觀察而得。POP- 2000 / 2 COOH (POP-imidoacid) 分子是由POP- 2000 / 4 COOH (POP-amidoacid) 分子在高溫下經過閉環的反應而得到的產物。透過原子力顯微鏡不斷掃描，可進一步了解到POP-amidoacid與POP-imidoacid不同分子的排列型態。並探討影響分子的排列因素，其中包括相同結構之官能基變化，不同主鏈鍛分子，以及不同分子量。最後探討形成不同分子排列型態以及具有降低在水/甲苯的界面張力現象，其原因主要是結構上的作用所致。Abstract 		 [...] . 	i 摘要		 [...] . 	iii Acknowledgement		 [...] . 	v Chapter 1 		Introduction……………………………………………………… [...] . 	 1 Chapter 2 		Literature Review………………………………………………. …………	 4 		 2. 1 The Amphiphilic Cpolymers…………………………………… [...] . 	 4 		 2. 2 The Molecular Self-assembly……………………………… [...] 	 5 		 2. 3 The Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly……… [...] . 	 8 		 2. 3. 1 The Substrate Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly [...] . 	 9 		 2. 3. 2 The Concentration Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly [...] . 	 10 		 2. 3. 3 The Ionic Interaction Force Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly…	 12 		 2. 3. 4 The Molecular Weight Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly. 	 14 		 2. 3. 5 Backbone Variety Factor Affecting Molecular Self-assembly……. 	 15 		 2. 3. 6 Temperature Effect Affecting Molecular Self-assembly………… [...] 	 16 		 2. 4 Application for the Molecular Self-Assembly………………………… [...] . 	 18 Chapter 3 		Working Principle	 21 		 3. 1 Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging System	 21 Chapter 4 		Experimental Section………………………………………………………	 25 		 4. 1 Materials…………………………………………………………………	 25 		 4. 2 Experimental Procedures……………………………………………… [...] . 	 26 		 4. 3 Analytical Instruments and Measurement………………………………. 	 28 Chapter 5 		Results and Discussion…………………………………………… [...] ………	 30 		 5. 1 Synthesis of the POP- 2000 /TMA copolymer……………………………	 30 		 5. 2 LCST of the POP- 2000 /TMA Copolymers…………………………… [...] . 	 31 		 5. 3 Self-assembly via a Stretched Molecular Shape to Form Molecular Bundles………………………………………………………………………	 33 		 5. 4 Self-assembly via a Curved POP Loop to Form Large Particles……… [...] 	 36 		 5. 5 A Proposed Mechanism for the Self-assembly………………………… [...] 	 37 		 5. 6 Multiplicity of carboxyl functionalities to Molecular Self-assembling Morphological Change………………………………………………………	 38 Chapter 6 		Conclusion………………………………………………………………… [...] 	 42 References		………………………………………………………………………………. 	 4...|$|E

Macromers with multiple reactive chlorides could be structurally tailored by varying {{the ratios of}} amine/cyanuric chloride, types of the starting POA-amines and temperature (lower than 30 degrees C). At an elevated temperature (> 140 degrees C), the macromers could be self-cured or cured with additional amine to form polymer films. The films exhibited high thermal stability, solvent-adsorption, and low surface electronic resistivity.

40|$|Abstract. Photodegradation of 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (1, 2, 4 -TCB) was {{examined}} in {{one kind of}} Gemini surfactant solution (ethylene dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide) and two kinds of conventional surfactant solutions (sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyoxyethylene <b>polyoxypropylene</b> ether). Compared with conventional surfactants, Gemini surfactants make up of two identical or different amphiphilic moieties connected by a spacer group. Under UV irradiation at 254 nm, 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene was decomposed in the three micellar solutions, but the photodegradation rate of 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene in the Gemini surfactant solution was 3. 54 % and 11. 81 % higher than those in other two conventional surfactant solutions respectively. Thus, the photochemical reactions of chlorobenzenes can be enhanced in Gemini surfactant solutions...|$|E
