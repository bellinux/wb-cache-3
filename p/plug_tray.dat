40|$|A {{robot system}} that {{automatically}} separates {{a clump of}} ex vitro micropropagated sugarcane into individual shoots without using a machine vision system was developed and tested. The shoots were planted in a 50 -cell <b>plug</b> <b>tray</b> before division. They grew thickly and their roots became entangled {{with each other in}} a cell, forming a root ball, therefore the separation was a delicate task. To separate the thickly grown shoots, two types of end-effecters were developed. The first one was a continuous shoots picking mechanism (CSPM). This end-effecter was designed to bring the thickly grown shoots into a line and hold them without damaging them. The second one was a single shoot separator (SSS). This end-effecter was designed to pull off the shoots from the clump one by one. These two end-effecters were installed on two types of robots. As a result, 77. 1 % of shoots were properly separated into individual shoots by this system and 66. 7 % of the shoots rooted after division.

40|$|Tomato {{seedlings}} {{grown in}} high-density <b>plug</b> <b>trays</b> are often weak, with excessively elongated stems that are easily damaged, {{and do not}} survive well when transplanted into the field. To alleviate this problem, we found that overhead irrigation with 5 degrees C water at 1 - 2 d intervals produced strong seedlings with shorter and stronger stems, increased root and shoot dry weights (DW), and elevated levels of chlorophyll. Irrigation with water at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, or 15 degrees C showed that 5 degrees C yielded stems with the greatest strength (575 g mm(- 1)) measured with a texture analyser. No significant difference in seedling height was observed with irrigation scheduled at 08. 00 h, 13. 00 h, or 16. 00 h. Stem and growth indices based on the ratios of stem diameter:plant height, and shoot DW:plant height, respectively, indicated that irrigation with 5 degrees C water increased the stem index to 162 % and the growth index to 152 %, respectively, compared to control (27 degrees C-watered) seedlings. Seedlings were elongated by gibberellin (GA(3)) treatment and shortened by treatment with the inhibitor of GA 3, paclobutrazol. Paclobutrazol acted synergistically with 5 degrees C water irrigation to reduce stem elongation. Silver thiosulphate (STS), an inhibitor of ethylene action, did not inhibit the stem shortening caused by irrigation with 5 degrees C water when the STS was applied immediately following irrigation. These results suggest the possible involvement of GA(3) in stem shortening caused by irrigation with 5 degrees C water. We conclude that irrigation with 5 degrees C water acts as a positive stimulus to promote the growth of seedlings with stronger stems, elevated levels of chlorophyll in their leaves, and higher DWs of all tissues...|$|R

30|$|Analyzing the {{physical}} properties, all substrates showed suitable {{values of the}} bulk density (BD) (<[*] 0.4  g cm− 3). BD decreased with the incorporation of date-palm wastes giving sufficiently low values {{so as not to}} present a problem in transportation or handling. The amount of BD in date-palm wastes peat (S 5) was minima (0.116  g cm 3); therefore, root media aeration in this treatment should be better than others. When root media aeration is sufficient, supplying of water and nutrient elements for plants is better (Ghehsareh 2013). Generally, BD and total pore space (TPS) are inversely correlated parameters which could improve plant root growth (Ceglie et al. 2015). This result was in accordance with the values of TPS obtained for different substrates. Higher proportion of date-palm wastes in growing media resulted in significantly greater values of TPS. TPS values of S 1 and S 2 were slightly under the ‘ideal’ substrate threshold for the commercial peat substrate but were ideal for other substitutions with date-palm wastes. The replacement of peat moss by 50 % of date-palm fronds wastes (S 3) provided the best air volume (AV) value (29.83 %) which promotes plant growth. High aeration is important in <b>plug</b> <b>trays</b> with small container [low height (5 – 7  cm)], where the poor drainage after watering is a limiting factor in nursery production (Carmona et al. 2012). Significant differences can be observed in all treatments AV values but were within the acceptable range (20 – 30 %). Generally, organic wastes have suitable bulk density, porosity and water holding capacity (Borji et al. 2010; Ghehsareh 2013). Whilst, in this study, mixtures with a higher proportion of date-palm wastes showed the lowest amount of total available water (54.83 %). The highest amounts were observed with the control treatment (S 1) (TAW; 60.33 %). The findings of Samiei et al. (2005) support our results when investigating the effectiveness of peat moss and date-palm wastes as substrates for Aglaonema (Aglaonema Commutatum) growing.|$|R

The priming of seed is a process in which the seeds are placed in an osmotic solution for a determined period of time, dried down to original moisture content, then germinated. The objectives of this study were twofold. The first was to compare various salt solutions at defined osmotic potentials as effective priming treatment for improving germination and emergence of pansy seed at high temperatures. the second objectives was to compare respiration rates during germination for primed and nonprimed seeds. Pansy seeds (Viola x wittrockiana 'Majestic Giant Blue Shade' and 'Crystal Bowl Sky Blue') were primed with several salts and PEG 15, 000 at - 1. 0 and - 2. 0 MPa, for 3, 6, or 9 days at 23 C. Total percent germination (G) of nonprimed seeds decreased significantly for both cultivars as germination temperature increased from 25 C to 35 C. The particular priming solution and the duration of the treatment were significant factors in increasing percent germination and in reducing T 50. Priming with salts (CaCl 2 for Crystal Bowl' and K 2 HPO 4 or MgCl 2 for 'Majestic Giant') at either osmotic potential was significantly more effective than priming with PEG 15, 000 at relatively high temperature. Seeds primed in aerated PEG 8000 at - 1. 0 MPa for 7 days at 15 C compared to inorganic salt solutions (CaCl 2, MgCl 2, or K 2 HPO 4) did not have higher emergence than nonprimed seeds when sown directly in <b>plug</b> <b>trays</b> and germinated in growth chambers. Pansy seed ('Crystal Bowl') primed with CaCl 2 at - 1. 0 MPa for 3 days at 23 C appeared to be effective for increasing seedling emergence and for reducing the time of emergence in summer greenhouse studies. For Majestic Giant', priming treatments had little effect in improving total emergence, but did reduce T 50. Seed respiration was detected after priming. Priming treatments with CaCl 2 for 'Crystal Bowl' resulted in an increase in respiration rate during germination over nonprimed seeds. Priming Majestic Giant with either MgCl 2 or K 2 HPO 4 did not result in an increase in respiration rate over nonprimed controls...|$|R
40|$|La producción de plantines de Lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum L.) se realiza mediante semillas sembradas en bandejas multiceldas, con control de temperatura y humedad. En la Argentina la producción no suele ser eficiente, y se obtienen plantines desuniformes y de reducido desarrollo. Otra forma de producción es el sistema flotante, empleado en la producción de plantines de tabaco y especies hortícolas. Consiste en la utilización de bandejas de poliestireno, las cuales flotan sobre una pileta desde la siembra al transplante. En este trabajo se evaluó el sistema flotante como alternativa al sistema convencional para la producción de plantines de Lisianthus. Se realizaron ensayos en tres fechas y las {{variables}} evaluadas fueron porcentaje de germinación y plantines para transplante, peso fresco y seco de la parte aérea y radicular, número de pares de hojas y longitud del primer par de hojas verdaderas. Los porcentajes de germinación y plantines para transplante no se diferenciaron entre los sistemas, pero en las restantes variables los plantines del sistema flotante superaron a los del convencional. Se concluye que el sistema flotante es una alternativa mejor que el sistema convencional, y que los plantines de Lisianthus obtenidos son de mayor tamaño, calidad y homogeneidad en menor tiempo. The {{production of}} Lisianthus seedlings (Eustoma grandiflorum L.) {{is carried out}} on <b>plug</b> <b>trays</b> under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Seedling production in Argentina is not efficient, and the seedlings obtained are not uniform and have reduced development. Another seedling production method is the floating system, which {{is used in the}} production of tobacco and horticultural seedlings. This method consists in the utilization of polystyrene trays floating on water tanks from sowing to transplant. This work evaluated the floating system for Lisianthus seedling production {{as an alternative to the}} conventional way. Experiments were carried out on three different dates, and the variables measured were: percentage of germination and seedlings at transplant, fresh and dry weights of aerial and radicular parts, number of nodes with expanded leafs and length of first pair of true leafs during the seedling cultivation period. The percentages of germination and seedlings at transplant were not significantly different between treatments, but in the other parameters evaluated, floating system seedlings were superior in comparison to those obtained with the conventional system. The results allow us concluding that the floating system could then be used as a better alternative for Lisianthus seedlings production, obtaining bigger and higher quality plantlets in a shorter period of time with lesser lost and higher homogeneity...|$|R

The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of cell sizes used for strawberry <b>plug</b> production in <b>trays</b> compared to bare root transplants, regarding initial plant size, harvest timing, and total strawberry fruit yield. Plug transplants were produced from runner tips rooted in trays with cell sizes of 26. 5, 50, 100 and 150 cm 3 filled with Plantmax HA organic substrate. Bare root transplants (control) were produced in a closed soilless system using sand as substrate. A randomized block design was used, with four replicates with 16 plants per plot. Bare root transplants and plug transplants from 100 -cm 3 cells had larger crown and higher leaf and root dry mass. Early fruit yield was higher in plants propagated from plugs than in those propagated from bare root transplants. Spring and total fruit yield did not differ among treatments, with an average yield of 435 and 874 g per plant, respectively. Earlier strawberry fruit yield was obtained by using plug transplants, even from trays with small cells of 26. 5 or 50 cm 3. 200...|$|R

40|$|When first {{received}} by a refinery, the crude oil usually contains some water, mineral salts, and sediments. The salt appears in different forms, most often times it is dissolved {{in the formation}} water {{that comes with the}} crude i. e. in brine form, but it could also be present as solid crystals, water-insoluble particles of corrosion products or scale and metal-organic compounds such as prophyrins and naphthenates. The amount of salt in the crude can vary typically between 5 to 200 PTB depending on the crude source, API, viscosity and other properties of the crude. For the following reasons, it is of utmost importance {{to reduce the amount of}} salt in the crude before processing the crude in the Crude Distillation Unit and consequently downstream processing units of a refinery. 1. Salt causes corrosion in the equipment. 2. Salt fouls inside the equipment. The fouling problem not only negatively impacts the heat transfer rates in the exchangers and furnace tubes but also affects the hydraulics of the system by increasing the pressure drops and hence requiring more pumping power to the system. Salt also <b>plugs</b> the fractionator <b>trays</b> and causes reduced mass transfer i. e. reduced separation efficiency and therefore need for increased re-boiler/condenser duties. 3. The salt in the crude usually has a source of metallic compounds, which could cause poisoning of catalyst in hydrotreating and other refinery units. Until a few years ago, salt concentrations as high as 10 PTB (1 PTB = 1 lb salt per 1000 bbl crude) was acceptable for desalted crude; However, most of the refineries have adopted more stringent measures for salt content and recent specs only allow 1 PTB in the desalted crude. This would require many existing refineries to improve their desalting units to achieve the tighter salt spec. This study will focus on optimizing the salt removal efficiency of a desalting unit which currently has an existing single-stage desalter. By adding a second stage desalter, the required salt spec in the desalted crude will be met. Also, focus will be on improving the heat integration of the desalting process, and optimization of the desalting temperature to achieve the best operating conditions in the plant after revamp. 1 yea...|$|R
