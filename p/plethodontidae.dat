5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} <b>Plethodontidae</b> are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the <b>Plethodontidae</b> have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid {{in water and}} hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (<b>Plethodontidae),</b> direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{diversity}} within <b>Plethodontidae</b> {{in regards to}} mating. The mating process consists of courting behavior, the tail straddling walk, sperm deposition {{in the form of}} a spermatophore, and insemination. However, the seepage salamander differs in its courtship behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family <b>Plethodontidae</b> found in Canada and the United States. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate shrubland, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, arable land, and urban areas. It is more water-oriented than the related northern redback salamander, and can often be found in and around water such as rain puddles, streams, swamps, and damp stream beds, whereas the northern redback tends {{to be found in}} damp ground, but usually not near open water.|$|E
500|$|The {{suborder}} Salamandroidea {{contains the}} advanced salamanders. They {{differ from the}} cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation. In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the spermatophore, and the female {{picks it up and}} inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid. The largest family in this group is <b>Plethodontidae,</b> the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species. The family Salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name [...] "newt" [...] is given to members of its subfamily Pleurodelinae.|$|E
500|$|The order Caudata (from the Latin cauda meaning [...] "tail") {{consists}} of the salamandersâ€”elongated, low-slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form. This is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no {{more closely related to}} lizards than they are to mammals. Salamanders lack claws, have scale-free skins, either smooth or covered with tubercles, and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned. They range in size from the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), which has been reported to grow to a length of , to the diminutive Thorius pennatulus from Mexico which seldom exceeds [...] in length. Salamanders have a mostly Laurasian distribution, being present in much of the Holarctic region of the northern hemisphere. The family <b>Plethodontidae</b> is also found in Central America and South America north of the Amazon basin; South America was apparently invaded from Central America by about the start of the Miocene, 23 million years ago. Urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders. Members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults. Most salamanders are under [...] long. They may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat. When on land, they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation, emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms, insects and other invertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Desmognathus and the family <b>Plethodontidae.</b> Like all other plethodontids, the seepage salamander is lungless and respires through its skin and the lining of its mouth. [...] They also have a naso-labial groove and a relatively immoveable lower jaw which allows them to force their way under objects. As with all species in Desmognathus, they have a pale line running diagonally from the eye to the angle of the jaw. This line may be hard to see in older, darker adults. Their hind legs are larger and stouter than the forelegs. Their body is short and stout and they are good jumpers, often used as an escape.|$|E
2500|$|The seepage {{salamander}} (Desmognathus aeneus) is a small, terrestrial {{species of}} salamander {{in the family}} <b>Plethodontidae.</b> It is endemic to the United States. They are found in small areas of Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. It gets {{its name from the}} seepages around which it lives. It is very similar in its appearance and life history to the pygmy salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species differ greatly from the other Desmognathus species. They are the smallest salamanders in the genus, measuring only [...] in length. They are also the only two terrestrial, direct-developing Desmognathus species. However, the two species are not often seen to coexist, differing in distribution by elevation; although there are exceptions. The seepage salamander is currently listed as Near Threatened, with its numbers declining in most of states in which it is found. It is threatened by habitat loss, with logging having a major effect.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>Plethodontidae</b> (lungless salamanders), {{many members}} respire through their {{skin and the}} lining in their mouths. Lunglessness in this family may have evolved due to an {{adaptation}} for life in streams, {{and members of the}} <b>Plethodontidae</b> family probably did evolve other methods for respiration other than lungs (i.e. gills) due to enhanced survival of larval salamanders in fast-moving stream environments of southern Appalachia. Lungs in general help aquatic animals maintain position in the water column, but the larvae of <b>Plethodontidae</b> members are benthic creatures, therefore the adaptation of lunglessness would be beneficial to them since buoyancy would endanger their survival.
