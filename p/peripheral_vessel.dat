40|$|Evaluation of {{peripheral}} retinal vascular {{changes in}} anterior uveitis using ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography. A prospective, observational {{study of a}} case series of patients diagnosed with anterior uveitis. Clinical observation at an academic medical center. Patient or Study Population: A total of 65 eyes of 33 patients corresponded with the research criteria of anterior uveitis {{in the opinion of}} specialists of Peking University First Hospital. Patients were diagnosed primarily through clinical examinations and conventional fluorescein angiography. Subsequently, ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiograms were obtained for each patient. The main outcome was the detection of peripheral retinal changes by ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography, and how these changes influenced the evaluation and management of the disease. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> leakage was detected in 27 eyes (42 %) with anterior uveitis, of which 15 eyes displayed active inflammation and 12 eyes displayed inactive inflammation. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> leakage was found in seven of eight eyes with cystoid macular edema. Cystoid macular edema was detected in 7 of 27 eyes (26 %) with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> leakage, whereas 1 of 38 eyes (3 %) did not display <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> leakage (p< 0. 01). 44. 4 % of the patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> leakage had a specific etiology.

Neonatal sympathectomy of SHRSP with anti-nerve growth factor and guanethidine was also {{carried out to}} study the effect of sympathectomy {{on the distribution of}} these nerves. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide nerve density was higher in the veins and superior mesenteric artery of SHRSP than of WKY and lower in the cerebral arteries of SHRSP than of WKY, but no difference was found in the muscular mesenteric arteries.

Diagnosis of IHs is usually clinical, however, to determine the actual dimensions of the lesion or the anatomic changes that occur during its evolution and treatment, a color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) examination can be performed.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of selected atherothrombotic risk factors and several clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis, as well as the utilization rates of selected vascular interventions in Greece. Methods During December 2009, 3, 007 adults (aged 47 ± 16 years, 48. 3 % men and 51. 7 % women) recruited in a random-digit dialed telephone survey (response rate: 16 %). The sample size was selected following a multistage and stratified by gender, age group, and Greek region procedure in order to be more representative. Data regarding medical history and socio-demographic characteristics of the participants were collected. Results Overall, 6. 5 %, 17. 7 % and 14. 0 % of participants reported that they had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, respectively. In the overall sample, 2. 5 % of participants reported that they had been diagnosed with angina, 2. 0 % with myocardial infarction, 1. 6 % with stroke and 2. 5 % with peripheral artery disease. Overall, 1. 5 % of participants reported that they had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, 1. 4 % coronary artery bypass grafting, 0. 6 % angioplasty of a <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel,</b> and 0. 7 % surgery of a <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel.</b> Conclusion Despite the limitations may occur due to the sampling procedure, the findings of the present study indicate that atherothrombosis affects a large portion of the population in Greece and it is expected to impose a significant economic burden. The data of the current study could contribute in obtaining an accurate estimation of the economic burden of atherothrombosis in Greece because people who are aware of their condition/disease are those who use health care resources. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveRecently, {{suspicion}} {{had been}} expressed that survival might be impaired after antegrade transapical {{as opposed to}} retrograde transfemoral valve implantation in high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. We analyzed survival in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation with special emphasis on the access site for implantation. MethodsBetween June 2007 and February 2009, 203 high-risk patients (EuroSCORE, 22 % ± 14 %; mean age, 81 ± 7 years) underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation via a transapical (n = 50) or transfemoral (n =  153) access. The transapical implantation technique was chosen only in patients who had no access through diseased femoral arteries. ResultsThirty-day survival was 88. 8 % after transfemoral versus 91. 7 % after transapical implantation (P = . 918). The transapical group had a significantly higher preoperative brain natriuretic peptide value and a significantly higher incidence of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel,</b> cerebrovascular, and coronary heart disease. Death within 30 days was valve related in 25 % (transapical) and 31 % (transfemoral), cardiac in 25 % and 13 %, and noncardiac in 50 % and 56 %, respectively (no significant difference). Complications specific to the access site (<b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> injury or apex complications) occurred in both groups, whereas neurologic events did not occur in the transapical group (P =. 041). ConclusionsOur patient and access site selection process, with the transfemoral technique considered the access site of first choice, results in comparable survival and morbidity for either transfemoral or transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Both techniques are associated with certain access site–specific complications that require highly qualified management.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Description of Greek {{patients}} with scleroderma {{with reference to}} (a) major organ disease, (b) autoantibodies, (c) survival rate, and (d) HLA associations.  METHODS—The clinical files of 254  patients were analysed retrospectively and a standardised clinical chart was completed with age at disease onset, sex, date of first and last visit, clinical and serological findings, organs affected, reasons for death, and HLA class II alleles. HLA class II alleles (DRB 1, DQA 1, DQB 1, DPB 1) were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligopeptide probes. DNA was extracted from 98  patients and 130  Greek controls.  RESULTS— 124 patients (49 %) had limited systemic sclerosis (lSSc), 114  (45 %) had diffuse systemic sclerosis (dSSc), and 16  (6 %) had overlap syndromes. Patients with dSSc, compared with lSSc, were characterised by a higher prevalence of lung disease (p= 0. 0011), oesophageal, heart, and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> disease (p= 0. 027, p= 0. 0025, and p= 0. 012, respectively). Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) occurred exclusively in lSSc (34 %), whereas antibodies to topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) were associated with dSSc (p< 0. 0001). Anti-topo I were associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, oesophageal and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vessel</b> disease (p= 0. 028, p= 0. 012, and p= 0. 01, respectively). The HLA-DRB 1 * 1104 allele {{was associated with the}} disease (p< 0. 0001) and anti-topo I (p< 0. 001), whereas it was not associated with ACA serum reactivity (p< 0. 001).

The estimated survival probability for this cohort of patients with SSc, four years after the first visit, is 94. 8 %.  CONCLUSION—SSc among Greek subjects has the same pattern of organ disease as in other white populations. However, the prevalence of kidney disease is low. The HLA class II DRB 1 * 1104 allele is associated with the disease, with anti-topo I, and not associated with ACA serum reactivity. ...|$|E
