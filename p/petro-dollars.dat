40|$|The {{order of}} {{financial}} market reform in Indonesia, which largely preceded real sector liberalization, was unusual as the external capital account was opened prior to domestic financial market reform. It is posited {{that changes in}} financial market policies in Indonesia were strongly influenced by changing circumstances in Indonesia’s access to external finance and to changing conditions in international financial markets. For example, the oil boom and <b>petro-dollar</b> recycling phenomenon reduced Indonesia’s fiscal and financial constraints and, consequently, domestic financial markets became highly regulated and credit and savings flows subject to state controls. The end of the oil bonanza meant tighter fiscal constraints and necessitated tax and financial reforms aimed at boosting savings and increasing the efficiency of domestic financial markets.

30|$|This allows to {{consider}} {{the risk of a}} random element X∈E as a relative property: there is a joint modeling of the vector (X,Y)∈X^ 2, defined on a common probability space (Ω, A, μ), so that the risk of X:Ω↦E can be considered in relation to the random element Y:Ω↦E, regarded as a benchmark. In the context of insurance and financial mathematics, Y can stand for the value of an alternative portfolio, of a hedge, of a market indicator, or the wealth of an insurer. For example, an insurer, facing the prospect of losing a claim amount X, may wish to evaluate its perceived risk with respect to its reserve capital Y: the ”risk” X does not have the same potential consequences whether Y is small or large compared to X. In the same vein of reasoning, because of the fluctuating and (usually) inflating nature of fiat money in the post- 1973, <b>petro-dollar</b> based, current monetary system, one may be interested in evaluating the value of a financial asset X w.r.t. the price of a commodity Y considered as a standard, like gold or oil, whose supply is limited in essence.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{underlying}} causes of the debt crisis that only surfaced with Mexico’s unilateral moratorium on her foreign obligations in 1982. The paper investigates the evolutionary trend of LDC debt and the consequences for lenders, borrowers and the international financial system. The motivation of the research is to develop sound analytical understanding of the mechanics of debt accumulation as groundwork for further study of macroeconomics of debt and debt relief. The paper observes that the third world’s debt crisis resulted from an exponential increase in external indebtedness disproportionate to the debt service capacities of developing countries. The collapse of commodity prices, high interest rates and appreciation of the US $ further tightened their internal fiscal positions and balance of payments, forcing them to re-finance maturing debt from fresh loans. The paper also observes that western bankers ignored signals of an imminent debt crisis and worsened the debt portfolio of third world countries by refinancing maturing loans with shorter maturities. These countries remained {{on the brink of}} default until convergence of multiple maturities and inadequate availability of new finance caused a capital reversal. The paper argues that although developing countries had used some of the loans to finance unproductive investments [including militarization] the lenders also brought the crisis upon themselves as a result of ‘obsession’ lending aimed at offloading surplus <b>petro-dollars</b> deposited in western banks by oil exporting countries. Although lending was justified by apprehension to fearful consequences for world trade and political stability [if the purchasing power of the third world evaporated as a result of discontinuation of lending] the paper emphasizes the role of ‘uncritical herd instincts’ of lenders in the debt crisis. The paper concludes that the failure of the loans represent miscalculations on both sides of a transaction and distortions in the lending process itself, hence the debt crisis deserved mutual cooperation of the lenders and the borrowers. However, the closure of all financial markets to defaulting economies prevaricated cooperative resolution and, in fact, precipitated the crisis. The paper emphasizes that developing country economies are fatally dysfunctional with long standing ills that are only concealed by capital inflows; hence unilateral action of lenders in halting the supply of finance while demanding repayments opens a liquidity gap resulting in consistent economic contraction. international economics, debt, third world, debt crisis. lending, borrowing, foreign debt, external debt...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} major determinants of private investment, along {{with the effects of}} such investments on other macroeconomic factors, in developing countries, using Iran as a case study. In this regard we identify a number of macroeconomic variables which {{played a major role in}} enhancing private investment in developing countries, and Iran in particular, between 1970 and 1993. An empirical investment model, a simultaneous investment model by industry and a macroeconomic model are applied to study the investment behaviour in this country. Lack of economic data, differences in economic structure, and different economic concepts between developed and developing countries, were the major issues that made this study more complicated. The adopted empirical investment model is based on the Blejer and Khan (1984) and the Greene and Villanueva (1990) approach, which are related to investment behaviour in developing countries. The model enables us to show the effects of public current and capital expenditure, funded by oil export revenue, on private investment and other macroeconomic factors. The simultaneous investment function for major economic activities, indicates that domestic investment was affected by output, capital stock, bank financing, oil exports and public investment rather than the official (fixed) or real exchange rate in the parallel market and/or interest rate. The Harvie and Kearney (1995) macroeconomic model is amended to study the crowding out, or crowding in, effects of public current and capital expenditure on private investment in developing countries, focusing upon Iran as a case study. This model also examines the effects of the interest rate, real exchange rate and world income on the behaviour of major macroeconomic variables in the product, money and asset markets, and especially private investment. The estimation results indicate that private investment was negatively affected by an increase in the interest rate, but positively by the major components of aggregate demand such as private consumption and public current and capital expenditure. These results also suggest that both public current and capital expenditure crowd in private investment. The simulation results suggest a number of alternative government policies for achieving economic development goals and enhancing private investment. The policies presented are: 1. A two tier interest rate policy should be administered by the government, a lower interest rate for investment purposes, accompanied with a higher interest rate for savings, term deposits and bank credits. 2. Allocation of a higher proportion of oil export revenues for public investment only in infrastructure fields and/or financing private investment. 3. Pursuing a unified floating exchange rate policy. The experience of billions of <b>petro-dollars</b> investment in various public enterprises in the 1970 s, and nationalisation of hundreds of large scale private industries after the revolution, centralised the economy, aimed at pursuing the strategic goal of economic development. Eventually, however, the government also realised that the contribution of private investment was a prerequisite for sustainable economic development. This experience implied the need for a number of microeconomic reforms. Liberalisation of the economy including^ that of trade, privatisation of nationalised industries, reform of public enterprises, floating the exchange rate and the attraction of foreign direct investment are a concise summary of these essential microeconomic reforms...|$|E

(Law) North-West University, Mafikeng campus, 2011 This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} the Niger Delta question which {{represents one of the}} most intractable sources of socio-political destabilization in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The study is on the intricate dynamics amongst the Nigerian state, the transnational oi l corporations, the oil - producing communities and the insurgent militia conflict. It investigates and explicates the "paradox of plenty" and the "resource curse", the "absentee government" and "state capture" and the debilitating effects of petroleum politics in Nigeria. The economic exploitation of the Niger Delta region's vast crude oil reserves by transnational oi l corporations and government authorities is juxtaposed with the spectre of environmental degradation, human rights violations, and the recurrent rule of impunity. The protracted problems of the Niger Delta region thus, provide us with a pertinent analytical and contextual framework {{for the study of the}} dynamics and issues of transparency in other African <b>petro-dollar</b> states. It is argued in this study that the Niger Delta crisis is a conflict of values and fight for resources arising from decades of unacceptable standards of oil exploration and the absentee character of the Nigerian State.

40|$|National oil {{companies}} (NOCs) control over 80 percent of world oil reserves and over 50 percent of gas reserves and hold {{exclusive rights to}} exploration and development {{of oil and gas}} reserves within their home countries. Because of host government involvement and supervision, NOCs may also act as instruments of state, implementing government foreign and domestic policies such as wealth re-distribution through the provision of subsidised oil products, job creation, and economic development. Such activities can lead to restricted availability of funds for finding and developing reserves for future production and to inefficiencies in current production and distribution. This thesis assesses the geopolitical factors that influence the conduct, strategies and priorities of NOCs and how these may impact on the continuing security of energy supplies to countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It will focus on ten NOCs supplying oil to world markets and two which supply gas to the European market. The study will also review the activities and. scope for influence as state instruments of Sovereign Wealth Funds which have been established by states with NOCs, in particular, those which have earned substantial <b>petro-dollar</b> surpluses, during the period of high oil and gas prices of 2006 - 2008. In an age of global interdependence between nations, specific objectives of this thesis are to consider the implications of anticipated growth in world demand for oil and gas supplies over the next 20 years, whether world production capacity is likely to grow to meet increases in world demand, the potential impact on world oil and gas supplies of the policies and practices of NOCs, in particular, the desire of host governments to require NOCs to follow non- commercial objectives, and the responses from OECD countries to threats to their energy security from potential restrictions on supplies.

40|$|Islamic banking is {{a growing}} {{worldwide}} phenomenon involving a variety of institutions and instruments. Previously, Islamic banks? transactions made up {{a small part of}} the total banking industry. Recently, Islamic banks have significantly expanded their network, and have been able to mobilize a large amount of funds and upgrade many economic ventures. Given the unique behavior of Islamic banks and their involvement in both social and economic activities, there has always been a question about their long run financial sustainability, particularly in adverse market conditions. Thus, a reliable and unbiased estimation of Islamic banks?efficiency and productivity performance is essential for the evaluation of Islamic banking operations within and outside its traditional borders of Muslim economies. Due to the short history of Islamic banking in Europe, and consequently the lack of sufficient data, empirical researches on the financial performance of Islamic banking have concentrated primarily in Muslim-majority countries and focused on the theoretical issues and descriptive statistics rather than rigorous statistical and econometric estimation. The main purpose of our analysis is to bridge this gap in the global and cross-country literature and to contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the performance of Islamic banking. Therefore, the orientation of this thesis is chiefly quantitative in nature. The aim of this thesis is primarily to shed some light on the emergence and the continual global growth of Islamic banking all over the world. It also tries to assess, for the first time, the relative performance of Islamic commercial and investment banks operating in Europe against counterparties-conventional banks in Europe and also against Islamic banks from Muslim-majority countries. Our methodology in this academic work clearly differs from the literature researches. This thesis is, basically, divided into two main parts. In first part, we specifically discuss the basic features and principles of the Islamic banking and finance. We then reviewed several in-depth market analysis results concerning Islamic banking and finance that were performed by well-known specialized financial institutions. In the second part, we primarily utilize different empirical approaches to examine the performance of our sample banks which shows a great variety, ranging from large active banks to new and small banks. More specifically, we use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to calculate the commercial banks? efficiency scores and investment banks (cost) -X-efficiency levels; the DEA-based Malmq- uist Productivity Index (MPI) to estimate the banks productivity indices; the common financial ratios to measure the banks financial performance; the T-Test to determine the differences of investment bank's performance pre- and post- the financial crisis that hit the world?s economy in 2007; the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) -regression to determine the impact of internal and external factors on bank's efficiency and also to check the robustness of the overall results obtained from DEA scores; Spearman's rho correlation to investigate the association of the DEA-efficiency scores with the traditional accounting ratios; and eventually the efficiency?profitability matrix in order to determine the characterization of the banks' performance and the factors that influence efficiency. Our analysis is carried out, primarily, over the period from 2005 to 2008. This indeed helps to account for the impact of the recent financial crisis on the efficiency and productivity performance of the selected banks. The preliminary review of the market surveys-based analysis shows that the Islamic finance and banking is one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial world. Islamic financial products and services are increasingly being regarded as a viable investment opportunity, making them very attractive for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Leading Islamic banks from Muslim countries are expanding their network. Several European banks have directly involved in providing Islamic financial products in order to satisfy the special needs for Muslim customers and the non-Muslims who seek ethical financial and investment solutions. Eventually, European governments have also started to amend their legal, tax, and regulatory systems to allow the establishment of Islamic banks. Most importantly, from an empirical point of view, our presented results suggest that the Islamic commercial banks in Europe are found to be relatively technically inefficient. They have also, on average, poor financial performance and under-performing practices. Moreover, Islamic banks in Europe actually suffer from significant productivity losses over the sample years driven, to a large extent, by the regress in banks? technology innovations. By and large, the bank?s inefficiency stems from both the sub-optimal size of operations and the lack of management knowledge and skills. Findings suggest that the optimal size for Islamic banks to achieve better levels of performance is neither large nor small rather medium. Therefore, increasing banks size through mergers and acquisition will substantially enhance their technical efficiency and productivity progress. The period prior to the current financial crisis was marked by the most stable economic environment for generations. Our results illustrate that Islamic banks lag relatively, before the emergence of the crisis, behind their conventional peers in terms of estimated efficiency scores and productivity changes. Strikingly, conventional banks gradually lose their superiority over Islamic banks in subsequent years, but remain, on average, a head of Islamic banks. Islamic banks are, indeed, less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis as compared with counterparties-conventional banks. They exhibit only slight inefficiency and productivity regress during this severe crisis and therefore, produce a consistent and remarkable positive trend in technical efficiency, productivity performance, and financial profitability. This might be because of the beliefs in the power of <b>petro-dollars</b> in the Gulf region, the fact that the Islamic banks are relatively small and young at present, and could also be due to the religious financial constraints. Such factors might have played an important role in preventing Islamic banks from being severely affected by the crisis. Overall, results suggest that the small and new Islamic banks in Europe can be as efficient and productive as large and old Islamic and conventional banks. They also have long run sustainability, substantial room for improvements, and a great potential in the banking industry to sustain their competitive edge not only in Muslim countries but also in the European financial system. The estimated findings pertaining to the performance of Islamic investment banks in Europe suggest that these banks experience low (cost) -x-efficiency and poor allocative-efficiency compared with counterparties-conventional banks. Bank?s inefficiency is caused largely by the under-utilization of inputs, the bank's diseconomies of scale, and also appears to be due to the regulations not controlled by management due to fluctuations and instability in factor prices. Islamic investment banks additionally show a clear paradox between their high calculated efficiency scores and low achieved profitability ratios. They are also less risky, more solvent, and operate with lower use of debt. Nevertheless, Islamic investment banks suffer a gradual deterioration in liquidity position. The banks' supply of Murabaha (cost-plus loans) financing appears to be most dominant and has increased significantly in importance. Overall, findings seem to reveal that the banks that are technically more efficient are larger in size (total assets), financially more profitable, have greater loans intensity, acquire lower levels of debt, invests more in appropriate human skills, have a lower market share (total deposits), and operate in countries with higher GDP-per capita. Such results reflect the strong and high association between the DEA-efficiency measures and the standard accounting measures, suggesting that the DEA approach can be adopted separately or concurrently along with financial ratios to make comparisons of Islamic banks performance more robust. Das Islamische Bankwesen ist ein weltweit wachsendes Phänomen mit einer Vielzahl von Institutionen und Instrumenten. In der Vergangenheit bildeten die Islamischen Bankgeschäfte einen kleinen Teil der gesamten Bankindustrie. In letzter Zeit haben Islamische Banken ihr Netzwerk jedoch erheblich erweitert und konnten eine Vielzahl an Geldmitteln mobilisieren und viele wirtschaftliche Vorhaben verbessern. Angesichts des außergewöhnlichen Verhaltens der islamischen Banken und ihrer Beteiligung an sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten wurde ihre langfristige Wirtschaftlichkeit häufig in Frage gestellt, insbesondere bei ungünstigen Marktbedingungen. Somit ist eine zuverlässige und neutrale Einschätzung der Effizienz und Produktivitätsentwicklung der islamischen Banken für die Bewertung ihrer Operationen innerhalb und außerhalb traditioneller Grenzen islamischer Volkswirtschaften erforderlich. Aufgrund der noch jungen Geschichte des islamischen Bankwesens in Europa und dem einhergehenden Mangel an Daten haben sich empirische Forschungen über die finanzielle Leistungsfähigkeit des islamischen Bankwesens in erster Linie auf Länder mit muslimischer Mehrheit und theoretische Fragen sowie deskriptive Statistiken anstelle von ökonometrischen Methoden konzentriert. Das Hauptziel unserer Analyse ist es diese Lücke in der globalen und länderübergreifenden Literatur zu überbrücken und zu der laufenden Debatte über die Leistungsfähigkeit islamischer Banken beizutragen. Folglich ist die Ausrichtung dieser Dissertation in erster Linie quantitiver Natur. Das Ziel dieser Dissertation ist es etwas Licht in die Entstehung und in das kontinuierliche globale Wachstum des islamischen Bankwesens zu bringen. Die Dissertation versucht außerdem, zum ersten Mal überhaupt, die relative Leistungsfähigkeit der in Europa tätigen islamischen Geschäfts- und Investmentbanken im Vergleich zu konventionellen Banken und zu islamischen Banken in Ländern mit muslimischer Mehrheit zu beurteilen. Die Methodik dieser wissenschaftlichen Arbeit unterscheidet sich deutlich von der Literaturrecherche. Im Grunde ist diese Dissertation in zwei Hauptteile gegliedert. Im ersten Teil werden die grundlegenden Merkmale und Grundsätze des islamischen Bank- und Finanzwesens besprochen. Daraufhin werden mehrere tiefgründige Ergebnisse von Marktanalysen, welche von nahmhaften spezialisierten Finanzinstituten durchgeführt worden sind und das islamische Bank-und Finanzwesen betreffen, überprüft. Im zweiten Teil verwenden wir in erster Linie verschiedene empirische Ansätze, um die Leistung der von uns gewählten Banken zu untersuchen. Diese sind sehr vielfältig und reichen von Großbanken bis hin zu kleinen neuen Banken. Genauer gesagt verwenden wir die Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) -Methode, um die Effizienz-Ergebnisse der Geschäftsbanken und die (Kosten) -X- Effizienzlevel der Investmentbanken zu berechnen; den auf DEA-basierenden Malmquist Produktivitätsindex (MPI) um die Produktivitätsindizes der Banken zu schätzen; die gängigen Finanzkennzahlen um die finanzielle Leistungsfähigkeit der Banken zu messen; den T-Test, um die Unterschiede der Leistungsfähigkeit der Investmentbanken vor und nach der Finanzkrise, welche die Weltwirtschaft im Jahr 2007 getroffen hat, zu bestimmen; die Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) ?Regression, um die Auswirkungen von internen und externen Faktoren auf die Effizienz von Banken zu bestimmen, aber auch um die Robustheit der generellen Ergebnisse der DEA-Ergebnisse zu testen; Spearmans Rangkorrelationskoeffizient um die Verbindung der DEA-Effizienz-Ergebnisse mit den traditionellen Bilanzkennzahlen zu untersuchen; und schließlich die Effizienz-Rentabilitätsmatrix, um die Performance von Banken sowie die Faktoren, welche die Effizienz beeinflussen, zu charakterisieren. Die Analyse wurde hauptsächlich über den Zeitraum von 2005 bis 2008 durchgeführt. Hierdurch können die Auswirkungen der jüngsten Finanzkrise auf die Effizienz und Produktivität der ausgewählten Banken bestimmt werden. Die einleitenden Untersuchungen der auf Marktumfragen basierenden Analyse zeigen, dass das islamische Finanzwesen einer der am schnellsten wachsenden Sektoren der Finanzbranche ist. Die islamischen Finanzprodukte und Dienstleistungen werden zunehmend als eine rentable Investitionsmöglichkeit angesehen, was sie sehr attraktiv für Muslime und Nichtmuslime gleichermaßen macht. Führende islamische Banken aus muslimischen Ländern erweitern ihr Netzwerk. Mehrere europäische Banken sind direkt an der Bereitstellung islamischer Finanzprodukte beteiligt, um die speziellen Bedürfnisse der muslimischen Kunden zu befriedigen sowie die von nicht-Muslimen, die ethische Finanz- und Anlagelösungen suchen. Schließlich haben auch die europäischen Regierungen damit begonnen, ihre rechtlichen, steuerlichen und regulatorischen Systeme zu ändern, um die Einrichtung von islamischen Banken zu ermöglichen. Am wichtigsten, aus empirischen Gesichtspunkten, ist das vorgestellte Ergebnis, dass islamische Geschäftsbanken in Europa technisch relativ ineffizient sind. Sie haben außerdem, im Durchschnitt, schlechte finanzielle Leistungen und leistungsschwache Aktivitäten. Des Weiteren leiden islamische Banken in Europa über die betrachteten Jahre an einem signifikanten Produktivitätsverlust, der zu einem großen Teil von einem Rückschritt bei den technischen Innovationen der Banken getrieben wird. Im Großen und Ganzen beruht die Ineffizienz der Banken auf einer suboptimalen Geschäftsgröße sowie einem Mangel an Managementwissen und ?fertigkeiten. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass die optimale Größe islamischer Banken, um bessere Leistungsniveaus zu erzielen, weder zu groß noch zu klein ist. Deshalb führt eine Erhöhung der Bankengröße durch Fusionen und Akquisitionen zu einem wesentlichen Anstieg der technischen Effizienz sowie des Produktivitätsfortschrittes. Die Zeit vor der heutigen Finanzkrise war durch das stabilste wirtschaftliche Umfeld seit Generationen gekennzeichnet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen auf, dass die islamischen Banken, vor Ausbruch der Krise, im Hinblick auf die geschätzten Effizienz-Ergebnisse und Produktivitätsveränderungen relativ zu ihren konventionellen Peers zurückgeblieben sind. Auffallend ist, dass die konventionellen Banken in den Folgejahren allmählich ihre Überlegenheit gegenüber islamischen Banken verlieren, im Durchschnitt jedoch vor islamischen Banken bleiben. Die islamischen Banken sind, im Vergleich mit konventionellen Banken, in der Tat weniger anfällig für die Auswirkungen der Krise. Diese weisen während dieser schweren Krise nur geringe Ineffizienzen und Produktivitätsrückgange auf und erbringen daher einen konstanten und bemerkenswert positiven Trend hinsichtlich technischer Effizienz, Produktivitätsentwicklung und finanzieller Rentabilität. Dies könnte der Fall sein, da der Glaube an die Macht des Petrodollar der Golfregion sehr hoch ist, sowie die Tatsache, dass die islamischen Banken derzeit relativ klein und jung sind. Ein weiterer Grund könnten die religiös begründeten finanziellen Zwänge sein. Solche Faktoren könnten eine wichtige Rolle dabei gespielt haben, dass islamische Banken kaum von der Krise getroffen wurden. Im Großen und Ganzen weisen die Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die kleinen und neuen islamischen Banken in Europa genauso effizient und produktiv wie große und alte islamische sowie konventionelle Banken sein können. Sie weisen außerdem langfristige Nachhaltigkeit, erheblichen Spielraum für Verbesserungen sowie ein großes Potenzial in der Finanzindustrie auf, ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit nicht nur in muslimischen Ländern, sondern auch im europäischen Finanzsystem aufrechtzuerhalten. Die geschätzten Ergebnisse bezüglich der Leistung islamischer Investmentbanken in Europa weisen darauf hin, dass diese Banken über geringe (Kosten) -X-Effizienz und eine schlechte allok-ative Effizienz im Vergleich zu konventionellen Banken verfügen. Die Ineffizienz der Banken wird weitgehend durch die Unterauslastung der Inputs verursacht, durch die Größennachteile der Bank und, wie es scheint, auch aufgrund der vom Management nicht kontrollierten Regulierungsvorschriften, die angesichts von Fluktuationen und der Instabilität von Faktorpreisen existieren. Die islamischen Investmentbanken offenbaren zusätzlich einen deutlichen Widerspruch zwischen ihren hohen Effizienz-Ergebnissen und ihren niedrigen Rentabilitätskennzahlen. Sie sind außerdem weniger riskant, zahlungsfähiger und arbeiten mit geringerem Einsatz von Fremdkapital. Dennoch erleiden islamische Investmentbanken eine allmähliche Verschlechterung ihrer Liquiditätssituation. Das Bankenangebot der Murabaha-Finanzierung (Kostenaufschlag-Darlehen) scheint sehr beherrschend zu sein und hat deutlich an Bedeutung gewonnen. Insgesamt scheinen die Ergebnisse zu zeigen, dass Banken, die technisch effizienter sind, zum einen größer sind (Gesamtvermögen), profitabler sind, eine höhere Kreditintensität aufweisen, über eine geringere Fremdkapitalaufnahme verfügen, mehr in zweckmäßige Mitarbeiterfähigkeiten investieren, einen niedrigeren Marktanteil besitzen (Gesamteinlagen), sowie in Ländern mit höherem Pro-Kopf-Einkommen tätig sind. Diese Ergebnisse reflektieren die starke Verbindung zwischen den DEA-Effizienz Maßen und den üblichen Maßen des Rechnungswesens. Dies weist darauf hin, dass der DEA-Ansatz getrennt oder auch zusammen mit Finanzkennzahlen übernommen werden kann, um die Vergleiche der Performance islamischer Banken robuster zu machen...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD. (Law) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} the Niger Delta question which {{represents one of the}} most intractable sources of socio-political destabilization in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The study is on the intricate dynamics amongst the Nigerian state, the transnational oi l corporations, the oil producing communities and the insurgent militia conflict. It investigates and explicates the "paradox of plenty" and the "resource curse", the "absentee government" and "state capture" and the debilitating effects of petroleum politics in Nigeria. The economic exploitation of the Niger Delta region's vast crude oil reserves by transnational oil corporations and government authorities is juxtaposed with the spectre of environmental degradation, human rights violations, and the recurrent rule of impunity. The protracted problems of the Niger Delta region thus, provide us with a pertinent analytical and contextual framework {{for the study of the}} dynamics and issues of transparency in other African <b>petro-dollar</b> states. It is argued in this study that the Niger Delta crisis is a conflict of values and fight for resources arising from decades of unacceptable standards of oil exploration and the absentee character of the Nigerian State. By its very nature, the study called for a qualitative approach, supplemented by unstructured interviews using aide memoirs with selected officials, on the basis of their innate knowledge of the subject matter. The legal comparative research method, with a historic component also played an integral role in this study. Some key findings and conclusions: 1. The study found that the Niger Delta crisis graduated from mere political agitations for state creation and provision of social amenities to extreme acts of hostage-taking and a twist of violence as a result of treating a major problem affecting the development of the Niger Delta people with levity for too long a period. 2. The study found that the on-going crisis in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a conflict of values and fight for resources amongst the oil-bearing people of the Niger Delta, transnational oil corporations and the Nigerian Government. 3. The study established some causal nexus between oil and poverty; oil and corruption; and, oil and human rights abuses. 4. That, the Niger Delta crude oil conflict is essentially a manifestation of state capture and inertia on the part of the Nigerian Government. 5. The study found that the Niger Delta economies are "criminalized" and are often characterized by conditions of anarchy and impunity. And this disorder is embedded in the dynamics of resource extraction, the nature and role of "shadow" state actors, as well as the interplay and patterns of relationships between organized criminal syndicates and the transnational oil corporations in the host communities. The study recommends, inter alia: I. That steps be taken by government to re-define its philosophy of national economic development from a state-driven to citizens-driven philosophy. To this end, Nigeria must seek to develop by developing its citizens, the aggregate of whose satisfactory living conditions should form the criteria for measuring national development. II. That effort must be made to steer the nation towards proper fiscal federalism. The present "food is ready" economy whereby federating units are enslaved to national "cake sharing" instead of value generation, discourages entrepreneurship and sustainable development. It promotes undue dependency on petroleum products, inequity and ethnic distrust. Ill. That Nigeria needs productive resource control, not just development in the sense of house and bridge building. What is needed is a noticeable leap in the standard of living in the Niger Delta. Thus, people and not federal accounts must be the object of improvement. IV. It is recommended that government should ensure robust, independent and co-ordinated oversight of the oil industry including its impact on human rights. V. Transnational oil corporations should undertake full corporate social responsibility and comprehensive assessment of the social and human rights impacts of all oil and gas projects, ensuring that adequate information is provided to affected individuals and communities and that the process is transparent. VI. It is strongly recommended that an Oil Pollution Liability Trust Fund should be established by the Federal Government in concert with oil companies. The fund will be made up of a percentage of tax levied on oil companies and a percentage of earnings of the Federal Government from oil. The fund should be used in ameliorating the conditions of the impacted environment and people. It is hoped that these findings and recommendations will go a long way in the quest for significant environmental and social improvements in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Doctora...|$|R
