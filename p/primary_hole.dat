40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether indocyanine green (ICG) staining {{of the internal}} limiting membrane (ILM) improves surgical outcome. METHODS: A total of 34 patients were identified who underwent macular hole surgery with ILM peeling augmented with ICG. These were matched retrospectively with 34 patients who underwent macular hole surgery {{without the use of}} ICG. Closure rates from primary and secondary procedures were compared, as were changes in Snellen and Logmar visual acuity. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups with reference to demographic features of age, sex, staging of the macular holes, and the proportion subsequently undergoing cataract surgery. The mean follow-up period was 7. 7 months in the ICG group and 6. 3 months in the non-ICG group. Closure rates from primary surgery were 91. 2 % in the ICG group and 73. 5 % in the non-ICG group (P = 0. 056), whereas overall closure rates following further surgery were similar in both groups (94. 1 and 91. 2 %, respectively). Logmar visual improvement above baseline was achieved in 53 % of the non-ICG group compared to 82 % of the ICG group (P = 0. 01). Where <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> closure occurred, there was no statistically significant difference in visual outcome between the two groups. CONCLUSION: ICG-assisted ILM peel in macular hole surgery is associated with a higher closure rate following a single surgical procedure. This difference was found to approach statistical significance (P = 0. 056). Overall visual improvement was greater in the ICG group (P = 0. 01); however, this reflected the higher closure rates. Visual outcomes between the two groups were comparable where <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> closure occurred...|$|E

The present paper aims to study dilution <b>holes</b> including <b>primary</b> dilution <b>holes</b> and secondary dilution holes on the performance of a triple swirler combustor.

The cooling effectiveness decreases behind <b>primary</b> <b>holes</b> because of local combustion. Comparison with the effect of deflection angle, the cooling performance of 60 deg deflection angle is best. The coolant is better attached to the wall downstream when the deflection angle is same as the rotating mainstream. In addition, the effect of deflection angle is not so significant on the coolant flow rate, but a large {{negative impact on the}} pressure loss. Although the cooling effectiveness of 60 deg deflection angle is highest, the total pressure recovery coefficient is lower.

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{mitigating}} {{the adverse effects}} of jet vorticity and liftoff at high blowing ratios for turbine film cooling flows has been developed and studied at NASA Glenn Research Center. This "anti-vortex" film cooling concept proposes the addition of two branched holes from each <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> {{in order to produce}} a vorticity counter to the detrimental kidney vortices from the main jet. These vortices typically entrain hot freestream gas and are associated with jet separation from the turbine blade surface. The anti-vortex design is unique in that it requires only easily machinable round holes, unlike shaped film cooling holes and other advanced concepts. The anti-vortex film cooling hole concept has been modeled computationally for a single row of 30 deg angled holes on a flat surface using the 3 D Navier-Stokes solver Glenn-HT. A modification of the anti-vortex concept whereby the branched holes exit adjacent to the main hole has been studied computationally for blowing ratios of 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at density ratios of 1. 0 and 2. 0.

40|$|Tidal stellar {{disruptions}} {{have traditionally}} been discussed as a probe of the single, massive black holes (MBHs) that are dormant in the nuclei of galaxies. In Chen et al. (2009), we used numerical scattering experiments to show that three-body interactions between bound stars in a stellar cusp and a non-evolving "hard" MBH binary will also produce a burst of tidal disruptions, caused {{by a combination of}} the secular "Kozai effect" and by close resonant encounters with the secondary hole. Here we derive basic analytical scalings of the stellar disruption rates with the system parameters, assess the relative importance of the Kozai and resonant encounter mechanisms as a function of time, discuss the impact of general relativistic (GR) and extended stellar cusp effects, and develop a hybrid model to self-consistently follow the shrinking of an MBH binary in a stellar background, including slingshot ejections and tidal disruptions.

Numerous number of film cooling holes designs and arrangements have been introduced. The main motivation of these designs and arrangements are to reduce the liftoff effect cause by the counter rotating vortices (CRVP) produce by cylindrical cooling hole. One of the efforts is the introduction of newly found anti-vortex film cooling design. The present study focuses on anti-vortex holes arrangement consists of a main hole and pair of smaller holes. All three holes share a common inlet with the outlet of the smaller holes varies base on it relative position towards the main hole.

Our numerical scattering experiments reveal that: 1) a significant fraction of stars initially bound to the <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> are scattered into its tidal disruption loss cone by gravitational interactions with the secondary hole, an enhancement effect that is more pronounced for very unequal-mass binaries; 2) about 25 % (40 %) of all strongly interacting stars are tidally disrupted by a MBH binary of mass ratio q= 1 / 81 (q= 1 / 243) and eccentricity 0. 1; and 3) two mechanisms dominate the fueling of the tidal disruption loss cone, a Kozai non-resonant interaction that causes the secular evolution of the stellar angular momentum in the field of the binary, and the effect of close encounters with the secondary hole that change the stellar orbital parameters in a chaotic way.

40|$|The {{supermassive black}} holes {{originally}} in the nuclei of two merging galaxies will form a binary in the remnant core. The early {{evolution of the}} massive binary is driven by dynamical friction before the binary becomes "hard" and eventually reaches coalescence through gravitational wave emission. We consider the dynamical friction evolution of massive binaries consisting of a secondary hole orbiting inside a stellar cusp dominated by a more massive central black hole. In our treatment we include the frictional force from stars moving faster than the inspiralling object which is neglected in the standard Chandrasekhar's treatment. We show that the binary eccentricity increases if the stellar cusp density profile rises less steeply than ρ∝ r^- 2. In cusps shallower than ρ∝ r^- 1 the frictional timescale can become very long due to the deficit of stars moving slower than the massive body. Although including the fast stars increases the decay rate, low mass-ratio binaries (q≲ 10 ^- 3) in sufficiently massive galaxies have decay timescales longer than one Hubble time. During such minor mergers the secondary hole stalls on an eccentric orbit {{at a distance of}} order one tenth the influence radius of the <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> (i. e., ≈ 10 - 100 pc for massive ellipticals).

40|$|For gas turbines, {{the demand}} for high-performance, more {{efficient}} and longer-life turbine blades is increasing. This is especially so, now {{that there is a}} need for high-power and low-weight aircraft gas turbines. Thus, the search for improved design methodologies for the optimisation of combustor exit temperature profiles enjoys high priority. Traditional experimental methods are found to be too time-consuming and costly, and they do not always achieve near-optimal designs. In addition to the above deficiencies, methods based on semi-empirical correlations are found to be lacking in performing three-dimensional analyses and these methods cannot be used for parametric design optimisation. Computational fluid dynamics has established itself as a viable alternative to reduce the amount of experimentation needed, resulting in a reduction in the time scales and costs of the design process. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics provides more insight into the flow process, which is not available through experimentation only. However, the fact remains that, because of the trial-and-error nature of adjusting the parameters of the traditional optimisation techniques used in this field, the designs reached cannot be called “optimum”. The trial-and-error process depends a great deal on the skill and experience of the designer. Also, the above technologies inhibit the improvement of the gas turbine power output by limiting the highest exit temperature possible, putting more pressure on turbine blade cooling technologies. This limitation to technology can be overcome by implementing a search algorithm capable of finding optimal design parameters. Such an algorithm will perform an optimum search prior to computational fluid dynamics analysis and rig testing. In this thesis, an efficient methodology is proposed for the design optimisation of a gas turbine combustor exit temperature profile. The methodology involves the combination of computational fluid dynamics with a gradient-based mathematical optimiser, using successive objective and constraint function approximations (Dynamic-Q) to obtain the optimum design. The methodology is tested on three cases, namely: (a) The first case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with two design variables related to the dilution holes, which is a common procedure. The combustor exit temperature profile was optimised, and the pattern factor improved, but pressure drop was very high. (b) The second case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with four design variables, one equality constraint and one inequality constraint based on pressure loss. The combustor exit temperature profile was also optimised within the constraints of pressure. Both the combustor exit temperature profile and pattern factor were improved. (c) The third case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with five design variables. The swirler angle and <b>primary</b> <b>hole</b> parameters were included in order to allow for the effect of the central toroidal recirculation zone on the combustor exit temperature profile. Pressure loss was also constrained to a certain maximum. The three cases show that a relatively recent mathematical optimiser (Dynamic-Q), combined with computational fluid dynamics, can be considered a strong alternative to the design optimisation of a gas turbine combustor exit temperature profile. This is due to the fact that the proposed methodology provides designs that can be called near-optimal, when compared with that yielded by traditional methods and computational fluid dynamics alone.

40|$|Instability and {{dewetting}} {{engendered by}} the van der Waals force in soft thin (< 100 nm) linear viscoelastic solid (e. g., elastomeric gel) films on uniform and patterned surfaces are explored. Linear stability analysis shows that, although the elasticity {{of the film}} controls the onset of instability and the corresponding critical wavelength, the dominant length-scale remains invariant with the elastic modulus of the film. The unstable modes {{are found to be}} long-wave, for which a nonlinear long-wave analysis and simulations are performed to uncover the dynamics and morphology of dewetting. The stored elastic energy slows down the temporal growth of instability significantly. The simulations also show that a thermodynamically stable film with zero-frequency elasticity can be made unstable in the presence of physico-chemical defects on the substrate and can follow an entirely different pathway with far fewer holes as compared to the viscous films. Further, the elastic restoring force can retard the growth of a depression adjacent to the hole-rim and thus suppress the formation of satellite <b>holes</b> bordering the <b>primary</b> <b>holes.</b> These findings are in contrast to the dewetting of viscoelastic liquid films where nonzero frequency elasticity accelerates the film rupture and promotes the secondary instabilities. Thus, the zero-frequency elasticity can {{play a major role in}} imposing a better-defined long-range order to the dewetted structures by arresting the secondary instabilities.

The quadrupole-moment contributions to the equations of motion allow us to constrain the `no-hair' parameter to be 1. 0 ± 0. 3 where 0. 3 is the one sigma error. This supports the `black hole no-hair theorem' within the achievable precision. It should be possible to test the present estimate in 2015 when the next outburst is due. The timing of the 2015 outburst is a strong function of the spin: if the spin is 0. 36 of the maximal value allowed in general relativity, the outburst begins in early November 2015, while the same event starts in the end of January 2016 if the spin is 0. 2 Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

By applying voltage between the anode electrode and cathode electrode on the aluminum surface, a layer of flat oxide surface is produced and proceeds with the dissolution of some oxide area (surface defects) within the electrolyte, and with the dissolution tendency of the oxide layer of <b>primary</b> hollow points, <b>holes</b> are created on the surface.|$|R
40|$|OJ 287 is a {{quasi-periodic}} quasar with roughly 12 year optical cycles. It displays prominent outbursts {{that are}} predictable in a {{binary black hole}} model. The model predicted a major optical outburst in 2015 December. We found that the outburst did occur within the expected time range, peaking on 2015 December 5 at magnitude 12. 9 in the optical R-band. Based on Swift/XRT satellite measurements and optical polarization data, we find that it included a major thermal component. Its timing provides an accurate estimate for the spin of the <b>primary</b> black <b>hole,</b> x= 0. 313 ± 0. 01. The present outburst also confirms the established general relativistic properties of the system such as the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation at the 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} three most recent {{precursor}} flares {{in the light}} curve of the blazar OJ 287 while invoking {{the presence of a}} precessing binary black hole in the system to explain the nature of these flares. Precursor flare timings from the historical light curves are compared with theoretical predictions from our model that incorporate effects of an accretion disk and post-Newtonian description for the binary black hole orbit. We find that the precursor flares coincide with the secondary black hole descending toward the accretion disk of the <b>primary</b> black <b>hole</b> from the observed side, with a mean z-component of approximately z_{c} = 4000 AU. We use this model of precursor flares to predict that precursor flare of similar nature should happen around 2020. 96 before the next major outburst in 2022...|$|R
