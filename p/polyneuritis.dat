40|$|T H E Guillain-Barre {{syndrome}} is a clinical entity {{which is not}} often diagnosed although its occurrence is not uncommon. The chief {{reason for this is}} the failure of all attempts to isolate an etiologic agent and also the multiplicity of synonyms by which this form of neuritis is known. In-fectious <b>polyneuritis,</b> Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute <b>polyneuritis</b> with facial diplegia, Landry's ascending paralysis, are but a few. To date there have been 25 names attached to this clinical picture. It is our intention not to further confuse the issue but rather to present two cases fulfilling the criteria of the Guillain-Barre syndrome, which were not of an infectious nature, and to discuss some of the factors which might account for the characteristic spinal fluid findings. This disease is not a new one. Osier, 1 in 1892, described the first case under the name of "acute febrile <b>polyneuritis</b> " and noted its similarity to Landry's ascending paralysis.

40|$|Since 1930 {{poisoning}} with ortho-cresyl-phosphate {{has been}} recognized {{as a cause of}} peripheral poly-neuritis (Smith, Elvove, and Frazier, 1930). Ortho-cresyl-phosphate (O. C. P.) is widely used as a plasticiser and in the production of heat-stable lubricating oils. Many cases of industrial poisoning with O. C. P. have been reported since then but as a result of strict precautionary measures it has now become a rarity. However, the occasional contamina-tion of food with O. C. P. is not uncommon. Poisoning with O. C. P. was first reported in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who under-went treatment with phospho-creosote (Hunter, 1956), and physicians became well versed in the clinical picture of poisoning with O. C. P. after the outbreak of <b>polyneuritis,</b> described as 'Jamaica ginger paralysis ' which occurred in the U. S. A. in 1930 (Burley, 1932). A similar picture appeared in Holland in women who used Apiol (containing O. C. P.) as an abortifacient (Guttmann, 1932). In 1937, there was an outbreak of sudden peripheral <b>polyneuritis</b> in Durban, produced by the use of Bestol superfine cooking oil. This was subsequently traced to the original oil which had been sent from England in large drums previously used for storing lubricating oil containing O. C. P. (Sampson, 1942). Humpe (1942) reported five cases of peripheral <b>polyneuritis</b> caused by the accidental consumption of fat contaminated with O. C. P.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{strain of}} Staphylococcus aurew was {{isolated}} from the duodenum of a case of idiopathic steatorrhoea with <b>polyneuritis</b> and evidence of thiamine deficiency. This organism in washed cell suspension in glucose and thiamine at 37 ' was found to remove 75 yo of the thiamine present within 14 hr. This process was much retarded by reduction of the temperature to 4 ' {{and in the absence}} of glucose. The thiamine which was removed was not destroyed, and death of the organisms resulted in liberation of the thiamine from the organisms into the suspending fluid. The process may be due to an active transference across cell membranes and concentration of thiamine inside the organism. It is suggested that in the presence of an abnormal intestinal flora such a mechanism may play a part in producing clinical thiamine deficiency states. Thiamine (vitamin B,, aneurin) is known to be an essential growth factor for certain micro-organisms including staphylococci (Knight, 1937 a, b). It is also essential to man and its deficiency produces a <b>polyneuritis.</b> There is some evidence to suggest that certain cases of <b>polyneuritis</b> in man are the result o...|$|E
