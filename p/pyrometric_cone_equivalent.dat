In the present work the physicochemical characteristics of clinker, obtained using trade marked alternative fuel for clinker kiln, were evaluated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Blaine specific surface, <b>pyrometric</b> <b>cone</b> <b>equivalent</b> (PCE), differential thermal analysis-thermal gravimetry simultaneous (DTA-TG), differential calorimetry, porosimetry and mechanical strength were used as the main evaluation techniques of the characteristic of clinker and their behaviors in the early hydration.

40|$|Most of the {{industries}} in Nigeria depend {{heavily on the}} use of refractory materials. For instance the iron and steel industries, cement, glass, refineries, bakeries and ceramic industries. However, almost all the refractory materials used by these industries are imported. Consequently, it leads to the draining of Nigeria’s foreign reserve and this in turn negatively affects the economy of the Country. Therefore, there is the need to increase the local production of the refractory materials in order to reduce their importation and thereby boost the economy Nigeria. Hence this researched work was carried out to investigate and see if the Birnin Gwari and Maraban Rido clays in Kaduna state, Nigeria can serve as refractory materials. The clay samples were obtained from the mining sites and processed to produce fireclay brick test specimens which were fired between 250 oC and 1400 oC. The fired bricks were then tested for refractory properties such as: the linear shrinkage, bulk density, apparent porosity, cold crushing strength, thermal shock resistance and refractoriness (<b>Pyrometric</b> <b>Cone</b> <b>Equivalent)</b> using ASTM standards. The obtained results were as follows: The Linear shrinkage was 10...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFerrochrome slag {{is a waste}} {{material}} obtained from the manufacturing of high carbon ferrochromium alloy. This slag {{is formed as a}} liquid at 1700 °C and its main components are SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and MgO. Additionally it consists of chrome, ferrous/ferric oxides and CaO. Present work outlines a novel approach in formulating castables with this industrial waste. Samples with decreasing cement content 15 – 05 wt. % were formulated in combination of both slag and calcined bauxite as matrix components. Effects of varying 0 – 10 wt. % microsilica as a micro-fine additive in these castables were investigated in this work. Pore filling properties of microsilica improved apparent porosity and bulk density. Phase analysis through X-ray diffraction techniques demonstrates successful formation of spinel and mullite crystalline phases. Mechanical behavior was evaluated through cold crushing strength and residual cold crushing strength after five consecutive water quenching cycles. Scanning electron microscopy measurements were carried out in order to better understand the packing density and reaction mechanisms of fired castables. Slag containing castables portrays good thermal properties such as thermal shock resistance, permanent linear change and <b>pyrometric</b> <b>cone</b> <b>equivalent...</b>|$|E

As a control group, each glaze base will be fired without added chemical colorants. These glazes are then fired to <b>pyrometric</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>cone</b> 10 (2340 ˚F). <b>Pyrometric</b> <b>cones,</b> which measure heat (a function of temperature over time), are standard use in studio ceramics. Each glaze will be fired in three different kiln atmospheres: reduction, oxidation, and reduction with the addition of sodium carbonate, or soda ash (Na 2 CO 3). A natural gas fueled kiln will be in each case, with alterations made to fuel:air ratios to create reduction or oxidation atmospheres. A natural gas kiln will also be used in the firing implementing the soda ash, which will be introduced into the kiln at 2300 ˚F. The expected results include a variation of color and surface in the different kiln atmospheres. The reduction with soda ash atmosphere is expected to show the greatest variation in texture due to the addition of this vaporized chemical, which will unevenly coat the ceramic tiles in places and melt the glaze, adding areas of glossy surface and color variation. While the oxidation environment will show differences in color variation in comparison to the reduction atmosphere, especially within the glazes containing the addition of copper carbonate CuCO 3. Test results from each group will be displayed for visual and tactile inspection...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that in rod photoreceptors the photoproducts {{generated by a}} bleach cause desensitisation during dark adaptation. We examine whether this notion holds for cones. A model of cone dark adaptation is developed based on the equivalent background concept. The underlying theory of the model relies {{on a series of}} assumptions that link psychophysically determined detection thresholds to cone phototransduction. Correction of thresholds for the reduced quantum-catching ability of the cones (due to the depletion of photopigment caused by a bleaching light) is an important aspect of the model. Foveal detection thresholds were measured for a small test flash presented on a large steady background field or presented alone after adapting to the background field. Test and background fields were monochromatic, with wavelengths closely matched to promote detection by the luminance mechanism. The model provided a good description of the data collected under these conditions. Parameters of the model were similar for all wavelengths and each observer, as were the derived equivalent background relationships. Analysis of previously published data for Stiles’ π 5 mechanism gave analogous results. The model is made up of two components. The early (fast) component is likely to be due to the direct action of the <b>cone</b> <b>equivalent</b> of inactivated Rh* on the G-protein cascade and/or the reverse reaction of the <b>cone</b> <b>equivalent</b> of inactivated Rh* to Rh*.

40|$|SummaryRetinal rod and cone {{pigments}} {{consist of}} an apoprotein, opsin, covalently {{linked to a}} chromophore, 11 -cis retinal. Here we demonstrate that {{the formation of the}} covalent bond between opsin and 11 -cis retinal is reversible in darkness in amphibian red cones, but essentially irreversible in red rods. This dissociation, apparently a general property of cone pigments, results in a surprisingly large amount of free opsin—about 10 % of total opsin—in dark-adapted red cones. We attribute this significant level of free opsin to the low concentration of intracellular free 11 -cis retinal, estimated to be only a tiny fraction (∼ 0. 1 %) of the pigment content in red cones. With its constitutive transducin-stimulating activity, the free cone opsin produces an ∼ 2 -fold desensitization in red <b>cones,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to that produced by a steady light causing 500 photoisomerizations s− 1. Cone pigment dissociation therefore contributes to the sensitivity difference between rods and cones...|$|R
