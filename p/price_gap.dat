Local cooperatives or state supply and marketing bureaus sold most agricultural producer goods, including chemical fertilizers and insecticides, to households at set prices. The state also offered preferential prices for agricultural inputs to grain farmers to encourage grain production. Households were permitted to purchase agricultural machinery and vehicles to transport goods to market. In {{order to ensure that}} rural units could cover the costs of the increasing quantities of industrial inputs required for higher yields, the government periodically reduced the prices of the industrial goods sold to farmers, while raising the procurement prices for agricultural products.

25|$|To {{close the}} <b>price</b> <b>gap</b> between the Taurus and the Ford Contour, {{as well as}} to {{increase}} sales, an entry-level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, as essentially a slightly de-contented GL.

The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top-tier model.

40|$|The article {{develops}} {{a method for}} decomposing changes in agricultural <b>price</b> <b>gaps,</b> defined as {{the difference between a}} commodity's domestic producer and border prices. We use OECD's procedure for decomposing changes in the market price support part of producer support estimates as the starting point for our decomposition method, and our method provides a basis for critiquing OECD's decomposition approach. The transmission of changes in border prices (world prices and the exchange rate) to domestic prices is a key element in the decomposition. The method is demonstrated using Russian agricultural <b>price</b> <b>gaps.</b> The results support the argument that for Russian agriculture during the transition period, the main cause of changes in <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> has been incomplete transmission of changes in the exchange rate to domestic prices, and where the weak transmission results mainly not from policy intervention, but rather from deficient market conditions, in particular poor market infrastructure. The policy implication is that underdeveloped infrastructure has strongly limited the benefits to the Russian economy from agricultural trade liberalization.

Companies in China can be listed as A-share trading in Shanghai (SH) and H-share trading in Hong Kong (HK). However, {{the large and}} persistent <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> between A-and H-share prices have been observed, raising concerns on market segmentation within China and its implications on the efficiency of price discovery. In the thesis, the factors are studied, {{which can be used}} in understanding the dissimilarity between the two markets. The topics are considered to include the use of statistical tests to perform factor analysis, and dynamic time-warping algorithm to conduct a technical analysis about the pattern of both markets. Topic 1, the some analyses cover the main economic and company-specific factors that influence the AH Premium Index, including the fundamental, technical, and market microstructure factors. Data is collected from 50 companies listing in both markets from April 2011 to June 2014, which are grouped into three clusters by the k-means clustering technique. An appropriate factor model is built for each cluster, and statistical tools are applied to test the model. The results demonstrate that different factors can be contributed to explain the <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> in different clusters. It is noted that large <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> are mostly related to the shares of small market capitalization. Since the small supply of A-share and information asymmetry are disadvantages for international investors, the trading strategy in relation to small cap stocks are more likely to succeed. On the contrary,the small <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> account for the large market capitalization. The <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> have been narrowing in recent years, which may pave the way to convergence after issuing the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Relative price convergence, but not absolute price convergence, is likely to occur Obizhaeva and Wang(2013). Topic 2 is based on the cluster results of topic 1. In line with the results of variance test,the price differences between A-and H-share markets are significantly obvious. In other words,the price differentials in the high and low premium clusters are larger than that in the non-premium cluster. The thesis applies dynamic time-warping algorithm to fit the patterns of two stocks for the same company, using the nine examples to explain this economical phenomenon. The results present that the market factors obviously have impact on the premium cluster, and the non-premium group is influenced by some fundamental factors. Department of Applied MathematicsM.

40|$|Very Preliminary: Do not quote/circulate We use data on {{retail prices}} and {{wholesale}} costs for detailed products at the barcode level from 325 stores {{of a large}} grocery chain to measure {{the effect of the}} US-Canadian border on market segmentation. Theoretically, we use a model of pricing and location on the circle to document possible patterns of cross-border prices. Empirically, we find clear evidence of international market segmentation. Cross-border <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> are significantly higher than within country <b>price</b> <b>gaps.</b> Using the precise geographic location of each store, we find that UPC level prices and wholesale costs are discontinuous at the border.

40|$|The common wisdom argues that, in general, large trades cause large price changes, while small trades cause {{small price}} changes. However, for {{extremely}} large price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the liquidity (especially <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> on the limit order book) {{is a more}} influencing factor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price impacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price variations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the trade size, the bid-ask spread, the <b>price</b> <b>gaps</b> and the outstanding volumes at the bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of prices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these microscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled trades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled trades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have quantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up to 44 % of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high liquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a large price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a more influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. Our results shed new lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts. ...|$|R
