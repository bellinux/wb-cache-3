5|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were more inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall. Truman's approval rating fell to 23 percent in mid-1951, which was lower than Richard Nixon's low of 25 percent during the Watergate Scandal in 1974, and Lyndon Johnson's of 28 <b>percent</b> <b>at</b> the height of the Vietnam War in 1968. , it remains the lowest Gallup Poll approval rating recorded by any serving president.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 <b>percent.</b> <b>At</b> this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E

5|$|On 22 December the {{regiment}} left Lemnos; they disembarked at Alexandria four days later. On 27 December they arrived back at Zeitoun camp. There they were reunited with their horses, and reinforcements arrived to bring {{the regiment}} back up to full establishment, plus another ten <b>percent.</b> <b>At</b> {{the same time the}} Machine-Gun Section was doubled from two to four guns. On 23 January 1916 the regiment were deployed in defence of the Suez Canal, reaching Serapeum on 29 January and Ferry Post Rail Head on 5 March where they took over from two infantry brigades. Later that month the brigade was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division, alongside three Australian light horse brigades and a British Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) brigade.|$|E
5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features {{was a relatively}} new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six <b>percent</b> <b>at</b> high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E

40|$|Powder {{processed}} NiAl + Ta alloys containing 1, 2, and 4. 5 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> tantalum and NiAl + Nb alloys containing 1 and 2 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> niobium {{were developed}} for improved creep properties. In addition, a cast alloy with 5 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> tantalum was also studied. Hot extrusion parameters for processing alloys with 1 and 2 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> of tantalum or niobium were designed. The NiAl + 4. 5 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Ta alloy could be vacuum hot pressed successfully, {{even though it}} could not be extruded. All the phases in the multiphase alloys were identified and the phase transformations studied. The Ni 2 AlTa in NiAl + 4. 5 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Ta alloy transforms into a liquid phase above 1700 K. Solutionizing and annealing below this temperature gives rise to a uniform distribution of fine second phase precipitates. Compressive creep properties were evaluated at 1300 K using constant load and constant velocity tests. In the higher strain rate region single phase NiAl + 1 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Ta and NiAl + 1 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Nb alloys exhibit a stress exponent of 5 characteristic of climb controlled dislocation creep. In slower strain rate regime diffusional creep becomes important. The two phase alloys containing 2 to 5 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Ta and 2 <b>at</b> <b>percent</b> Nb show considerable improvement over binary NiAl and single phase alloys. Loose dislocation networks and tangles stabilized by the precipitates were found in the as crept microstructure. The cast alloy which has larger grains and a distribution of fine precipitates shows the maximum improvement over binary NiAl...|$|R
