50|$|Example {{of disease}} management: The onset of certain diseases, such as white mold, {{can be reduced}} by <b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>rows</b> wide enough to allow {{adequate}} air movement which can reduce humidity and decrease drying time after precipitation events. If plant material is allowed to dry quickly it {{will not have the}} 9 to 48 hours of continuous moisture on the leaf surface required for the white mold infection to occur.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{practices}} {{are also important}} {{for the management of}} Raspberry Leaf Spot. Sanitation, which includes the removal of all plant debris and infected canes in the fall, reduces places for the pathogen to overwinter. Pruning the raspberry plants and <b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>rows</b> will allow for airflow to dry leaves, creating an uninviting environment for fungi. Furthermore, air flow circulation is important for reducing sporulation and successful infection. Lastly, avoid wounding the plants, as this may provide the fungus with an opportunity to infect.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the first}} few months after planting, the {{rhizomes}} from adjacent plants intermingle and soon the space between the plants will be covered with shoots and leaves. Since the foliage covers the ground completely, weeds are suppressed and weeding is no longer necessary. Therefore, weeding is only essential in {{the first few}} months after planting. After soil is covered weeding should be abandoned to avoid damage to flower buds. Weeding should be shallow since the rhizomes and roots are close to the soil surface. Spacing of about 1x1m between plants at planting should be sufficient. <b>Planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>rows</b> is not essential. Closer spacing between the plants results in even quicker ground coverage, which reduces the period of weed control. Trials have shown, that plantation with lower inner-plant spacing (28 cm) show higher inflorescence production than wider spacing (72 cm). A compromise between planting density for maximizing flower production, weed control and ease of fruit collection may be essential. The plant should be grown under shade to prevent severe plant losses during the dry season. In addition growing under shade results in higher fruit yield. Prior shade at planting time is essential if planting is done in the dry season. Enhanced fruit yield can as well be achieved by irrigation during the antecedent dry season.|$|E

30|$|In Kenya, Gerhart ([1975]) {{examined}} {{adoption of}} hybrid maize between late 1964 and 1973 in western Kenya and noticed a rapid diffusion {{of the technology}} in the region despite constraints. Risk and uncertainty were identified as the greatest constraints to adoption of hybrid maize. Factors found to encourage adoption decision were farmer education, access to credit, and access to extension services. Farmers who adopted hybrid maize were found more likely to adopt other yield-enhancing practices such as use of inorganic and organic fertilizers, and modern management practices such as <b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>rows,</b> weeding more than once, thinning and using insecticides. Gerhart applied multivariate probit on cross-sectional data and supplemented it with qualitative techniques. The approach was theoretically sound because technology adoption decisions are inter-dependent and the decision to adopt one technology could enhance or deter adoption of other related technologies. However, the use of cross-sectional data ignores the dynamic aspects of household adoption behaviour which could make the work less suitable for policy. Moreover, the study examined only one region of the country.|$|E
40|$|Thinning trees by {{form and}} defects (tree-class thinnings) and {{practical}} or free thinning (according {{to the surrounding}} trees) were unsuitable for comparing thinning methods by the subjectivity of the involved tree classification methods. A thinning criterion based on 'top height' and 'stem number' proved objective. By assuming different ratios between crown diameter and height at a certain developmental stage of the trees, reduction in stem number could be obtained, related to the mean 'top height', which was height, measured and averaged on the 100 highest trees, uniformly distributed over 1 ha. Assuming different ratios gave different stem number reductions. Thus the results of different objective thinning grades could be compared. Initial stem number {{was determined by the}} ratio crown diameter: height and by the relation between spacing and amount of thinning. In spacing experiments the influence of spacing on stem form and the tree defects already yielded conclusions about stem number (not too low; higher on worse soil), mixed plantations and the way of planting (<b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>rows</b> was recommended). Conclusions on amount of thinning were not yet possible. The method was simple in practice, even for other tree species...|$|E
40|$|Maize and {{climbing}} beans as associated crops {{prevail in the}} highlands of L. A. in traditional systems with low populations and manual <b>planting</b> (<b>in</b> <b>rows</b> and pocket drilling). Two trials were establislied to compare the systems, testing bean densities from 4 - 12 plants/m(2) and 3 - 12 plants/m(2), with the same maize population and simultaneous planting. Five bean genotypes with different aggressiveness for climbing were tested with one maize genotype (Suwan- 1). Row planting was superior in both trials for both crop yields, but the difference was siginificant with a bean density of 8 plants/m(2). This density was considered optimum when the yields of both crops were taken into account. Both the planting system and bean var. had an important effect on the lodging of maize. There was less lodging for pocket drilling than in rows and at a greater bean density due to the better anchoring of the roots. The effect of bean var. on maize yields was {{closely related to the}} lodging of the stem caused by bean aggressiveness: max effect with the most aggressive beans (type IV b) and min effect with the weaker climbing beans (type III b). Therefore, maize genotypes for association should have strong stems to resist lodging. (AS...|$|E

40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted to assess the effects of row-spacing on diseases, weed control, herbicide persistence and <b>plant</b> development <b>in</b> peanut. Tebuconazole, when averaged across cultivars and row spacing, effectively controlled white mold (57 %) and rust (58 %). Azoxystrobin also controlled white mold (58 %) and controlling rust (44 %). Both fungicides reduced leaf spot severity in the conventional and twin rows when compared to untreated plots. Twin rows showed a 10 % yield increase compared to the conventional planting. Both diclosulam and imazapic, when applied to twin rows at the full and reduced rate, provided better yellow nutsedge control than when applied to the conventional row. Twin rows yielded higher than the conventional rows when averaged across herbicides in one year. All full rate herbicide treatments enhanced yield over the untreated check. Diclosulam and imazapic treated soil sampled 60 DAP adversely affected all four crops. The advantage of <b>planting</b> peanuts <b>in</b> twin <b>rows</b> to reduce diclosulam and imazapic residual concentrations was not apparent. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> twin <b>rows</b> at {{three of the four}} locations in 1999 and 2000 yielded higher than peanuts <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> conventional <b>rows.</b> Yields were comparable to twin-row spacings that had higher plant densities. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> conventional <b>rows,</b> <b>in</b> most cases, had higher yields than narrow-rows. Measurements for plant diameter, pod distribution, and main stem length were higher with Tamrun 96 at most row spacings and planting densities compared to the respective Georgia Green planting densities and row spacings. Both cultivars when <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> twin or narrow rows at all planting densities did not enhance maturity when sampled late season. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 when <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> conventional <b>rows</b> had the most pods/plant compared to the narrow and twin row spacing.

40|$|A {{study on}} forage {{integration}} on farming system was studied at Bayongbong of Garut District, West Java from April 1996 to April 1997. The {{objective of this}} study was to increase the availability of food and forage which are cultivated on the same land using alley cropping system. Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) Were planted on thesame area using randomized block design (RBD) with 5 treatments and 3 replications. Elephant grass and gliricidia were planted as live fence. The experimental plot which were cultivated with food crops, giving the following treatment: A. Elephant grass were <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> <b>row</b> with spacing of 0. 5 m. B. Both elephant grass and gliricidia were <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> <b>row</b> with spacing of 0. 5 In. C.

Experimental plot were planted with food crops as a control. Based on planting pattern com were planted on the experimental plot followed by cabbage. Cutting interval for elephant grass was 42 days while gliricidia was 60 days. Fresh and dry weight of elephant grass, gliricidia, corn and cabbage production were recorded. The results showed that there was no significant different on corn and cabbage production between treatment, while elephant grass production was significantly different (P < 0. 05) among the treatments. The highest additional production of corn (1. 8 kg/m 2), and cabbage waste (2. 5 kg/ 2 m) were found in the treatment. The highest elephant grass production was found in treatment A (5. 1 kg/m 2) followed by treatment D (4. 9 kg/m 2) and treatment B (4. 1 kg/m 2). The highest gliricidia forage production was found in the treatment B (0. 6 kg/m 2).
