This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it <b>perpendicular</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> direction of the surface ply.|$|E

Large numbers of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) trees are declining in the Central Romania. Depending on the deterioration of the foliage and of the branches, five grades of infestation levels of oak trees were determined.

The mode I toughness was lower than most other wood species, but considering its low density, the toughness of balsa is higher then previously expected. The mode I toughness increased as a function of crack growth due to a fiber bridging process zone at the crack tip. The mode II toughness was higher than mode I toughness, but was much less affected by fiber bridging. The mixed-mode failure envelope had an unusual shape, which could be explained by an influence of fiber bridging. Overall, the toughness of balsa is adequate for sandwich composite core materials and likely better than some alternative core materials...|$|R

The joint was composed of steel gusset and nails, 40 mm in length and 2.8 mm in diameter (Zn 40). The specimens were loaded parallel (PA) and <b>perpendicular</b> (PE) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> Shearing loads applied were 50 and 100 kgf, and the load levels were 11 % and 22 % (PA) and 7 % and 14 % (PE) of the maximum strength obtained from static testing. The creep test specimens were loaded for 1500 h. A few general conclusions could be drawn from this study: The mechanosorptive deflection (σms) is defined as σms = σt — (σc + σsh) — σo, where σt, is total deflection, σc is pure creep, σsh is shrinkage-swelling behavior, and σo is the initial deflection. Changes in relative humidity may cause more severe creep deflection than constant humidity, especially during the drying process. The mechanosorptive deflection is greater at the lower load level than that at the higher load level. The mechanosorptive effects seem to be somewhat more resistant in the parallel direction than in the perpendicular direction.|$|R

For both experimental and numerical results (Fig.  5), approximately 91 % of the maximum cupping deformation occurred in the first 10  days of the experiment. The slopes of the simulated curves {{in the first days}} are influenced by the properties of the surface layer. Blanchet et al.

The average coefficients of variation (CV) for physical and mechanical properties of clear wood are between 15 and 25 % [19], whereas the average measured CV values for OSB are approximately 30 %.

Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it.
