5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and {{helps keep the}} skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of}} the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons. Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer wagons, based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast}} of the Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|Glam {{metal can}} be traced back to music acts like Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and Van Halen. It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It was popular {{throughout}} the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E

The Centre, which is wheelchair-accessible throughout, was opened in 1994. It was founded by Mike Fitt OBE, who was then The Royal Parks' Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London's Royal Parks. A registered charity, the Holly Lodge Centre received the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the substantive issues in the case, there was also more general historical and theoretical issues involved. During Justice McHugh's final years on the court, he and Justice Kirby expressed differing views on constitutional interpretation, and <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role {{of international law and}} principles of human rights in that process. In this case, the two judges continued that debate.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had at its {{disposal}} fifty {{divisions in}} France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions {{were in the process}} of formation in Germany. Combat losses throughout the war, <b>particularly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front, meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.|$|E
