Nowadays the multibeam sonar, and therefore the 3 -D <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> schools, has yielded better knowledge of school morphology. Using the data collected simultaneously by both sonar and echosounding in a lake, we have identified boat-induced behavioural changes in small pelagic fish schools. Using high resolution sonar data, we showed that the fish schools detected under the boat have a significantly larger volume than those alongside the boat. This finding is explained according to behavioural response due to the theoretical characteristics of the boat diagram sound pressure, {{and the existence of}} a strong thermocline. Then we compared two descriptors, the height of the fish school and the backscatter energy. We found significant differences, which reveal vertical fish school compression occurring simultaneously with the horizontal and sidelong escape behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Cijalu River {{is located}} in Western Cilacap Regency of Central Java Province. The river runs through forestry, housing and farming areas. This {{condition}} leads to a prediction that the river has been altered on its physico-chemical characteristics causing the river to be inhabited {{by a variety of}} fish species. This study aimed to collect data about fish species inhabiting Cijalu River and its distribution. A survey method has been done with clustered random sampling technique. The river was divided into three different areas, i. e. upper-, middle- and downstreams. Species diversitywas measured as the number of species, while distribution was measured as the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> species in each site. Nineteen fish species of 10 families were identified from Cijalu River. The 10 families were Anabantidae, Bagridae, Balitoridae, Channidae, Cichlidae, Cyprinidae, Loricariidae, Osphronemidae, Poecilidae and Sisoridae. Cyprinidae was the family having the highest number of species (6 species), followed by Bagridae (3 species), Channidae (2 species) and Osphronemidae (2 species). The remaining respective families were represented by one species. A complex pattern of fish distribution was observed during the study. Glyptothorax platypogon and Channa gacua were only found at the upper-streams, while Anabas testudineus was obtained in downstreams. The other remaining species could be observed either from the middle-to downstreams, or even from upper- to downstreams. Different pattern of species distribution could be caused by physico-chemical characteristics variation from upper to lower parts of the river, especiallywater velocity and substrate types...|$|E

40|$|Angkor Wat's "Churning of the Sea of Milk" {{bas-relief}} masterpiece {{is unique}} among "Churning" depictions for its naturalistic <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> and other aquatic animals. Their behavior clearly indicates {{that they have}} been poisoned, as related in the myth of the Churning. The poisoned fish are being cut in two by the sword of Suryavarman II as Vishnu. Also notable is the inclusion of the mythical beast known as gajasimha. The little known Angkor Wat bas-relief called the "Fete nautique des Dvaravati", also a masterpiece, realisticany portrays people making music, playing chess, fishing, hunting, and engaged in other aeti vities, {{in the midst of a}} forested wetland filled with birds, fish, crocodiles and other animals. The scene also portmys two royal pleasure boats, one with Garuda on its prow and the other with a gajasimha. Gajasimha is an Indian and Khmer makara associated in Khmer iconography with the Hindu god Vishnu. Suryavarman II was one of the few Khmer kings to be identified with Vishnu. Garuda and gajasimha were employed repeatedly to symbolize this relationship. This symbolism is employed in several significant innovations in Khmer iconography. These include replacement of the naga Ananta or Sesha by a gajasimha in representations of Vishnu Anantasayin; the distinctive "Garuda-gajasimha" balustrades, and use of the head of gajasimha or its elephantine trunk as the apical finials (dong chivea. Iliya, or chota) on Cambodian, Laotian, and Thai Buddhist temples. Fish figure importantly in numerous Bayon bas-reliefs. Many of these depict ordinary people engaged in activities such as cooking, gambling, cockfighting, and fishing. Others apparently depict events or incidents in the life of Jayavarman VII including his military victories, building activities, and apotheosis as Jayahuddha or Buddha-King, as well as his tolerant attitude towards other religions. There are also indications that he had an abiding interest in natural history...|$|R
2500|$|Fly {{fishing for}} trout {{is a very}} popular sport, which can be done using any of the various methods and any of the general types of flies. Many of the {{techniques}} and <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> fly <b>fishing</b> were first developed in fishing for trout. There is a misconception that all fly fishing for trout is done {{on the surface of}} the water with [...] "dry flies." [...] In most places, especially heavily fished trout areas, success usually comes from fly fishing using flies called [...] "nymphs" [...] that are designed to drift close to the riverbed, also called [...] "nymphing". A trout feeds below the water's surface nearly 90 percent of the time. Trout usually only come to the surface when there is a large bug hatch (when aquatic insects grow wings and leave the water to mate and lay eggs). There are exceptions to this rule, however, particularly during the summer months and on smaller mountain streams, when trout often feed on terrestrial insects such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master‚Äôs thesis is to conduct a {{valuation}} of the common stockholder equity in Marine Harvest on December 31, 2016. The valuation {{will be based on}} a fundamental valuation, supplemented by a method of comparables. In the fundamental valuation we have identified the underlying economic conditions of Marine Harvest, in order to forecast the pro forma financial statement. The discounted cash flows are then used to provide an estimated value. In the method of comparables we have used the method of multiples to provide a supplementary valuation. To provide the reader with the insight required for the thesis, we start with a <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> farming industry and Marine Harvest. The first part of the fundamental valuation is a strategic analysis of Marine Harvest. Using the PESTEL analysis and Porter's five forces, we reveal opportunities and threats to the fish farming industry. We use the SVIMA framework to conduct an analysis of the resources of Marine Harvest. The results of the strategic analysis are used to identify the sources of the historical strategic advantage of 13. 3 %. In Chapters 9 and 10, we forecast the pro forma financial statement based on the normalized financial statements from the accounting analysis. Our calculations give Marine Harvest a future strategic advantage of 6. 9 %. We then prepared value estimates using the equity method, the capital employed method and the net operating requirement method. After a convergence of the value estimates and an analysis of uncertainty, we concluded with an estimated value of 130, 053 NOK per share. Our final estimate using the method of comparables was NOK 154. 26 per share. By weighting the fundamental value estimate by 70 % and the comparative value estimate by 30 %, we concluded with a final value estimate of 137. 32 NOK per share and thus a sell recommendation...|$|R

However, there is a heterogeneous group of rare familial disorders, characterized by severe high density lipoprotein deficiency, in which the predicted increased risk is not clearly apparent. One such disorder has been called fish eye disease to reflect the massive corneal opacification seen in these patients. In this report, we describe the biochemical and genetic <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> two German <b>fish</b> eye disease homozygotes and their family members. Vertical transmission of {{a decrease in the}} specific activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 43) indicated that this enzyme was a candidate gene for harboring the defect responsible for this disorder. Direct sequencing of DNA segments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that encode the exons of the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene led to the identification of a homozygous mutation resulting in the substitution of threonine at codon 123 for an isoleucine residue in both individuals. Family analysis in an extended pedigree was used to establish a causal relationship between this mutation and the biochemical phenotype for fish eye disease. The homozygous presence of this mutation in two phenotypically homozygous members of an unrelated Dutch family with fish eye disease further supports this finding...|$|R
