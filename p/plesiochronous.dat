5000|$|In general, <b>plesiochronous</b> systems behave {{similarly}} to synchronous systems, except they must employ some means {{in order to}} cope with [...] "sync slips", which will happen at intervals due to the <b>plesiochronous</b> nature of the system. The most common example of a <b>plesiochronous</b> system design is the <b>plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy networking standard.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>plesiochronous</b> {{system is}} one where {{different}} parts of the system are almost, but not quite, perfectly synchronised. According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are <b>plesiochronous</b> if their significant instants occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal frequency but may have a slight frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase. The mismatch between the two systems' clocks is known as the <b>plesiochronous</b> difference.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>plesiochronous</b> {{comes from}} the Greek πλησίον plesion, [...] "near" [...] and χρόνος chrónos, [...] "time".|$|E
50|$|The <b>plesiochronous</b> digital {{hierarchy}} (PDH) is a technology used in telecommunications networks to transport {{large quantities of}} data over digital transport equipment such as fibre optic and microwave radio systems. The term <b>plesiochronous</b> is derived from Greek plēsios, meaning near, and chronos, time, and refers {{to the fact that}} PDH networks run in a state where different parts of the network are nearly, but not quite perfectly, synchronized.|$|E
50|$|Some {{systems may}} be only {{approximately}} synchronized, or <b>plesiochronous.</b> Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only {{the order of the}} event is important.|$|E
50|$|The {{asynchronous}} {{serial communication}} protocol is asynchronous on the byte level, but <b>plesiochronous</b> on the bit level. The receiver detects {{the start of a}} byte by detecting a transition that may occur at a random time after the preceding byte. The indefinite wait and lack of external synchronizaton signals makes byte detection asynchronous. Then the receiver samples at predefined intervals to determine the values of the bits in the byte; this is <b>plesiochronous</b> since it depends on the transmitter to transmit at roughly the same rate the receiver expects, without coordination of the rate while the bits are being transmitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{margins are}} {{set by the}} ITU-T {{recommendations}} for each hierarchical level. The signals thus formed are almost synchronous, except for differences within the permitted margins of tolerance, {{and for this reason}} they are called <b>plesiochronous.</b>|$|E
50|$|Connectivity {{between the}} picocell heads and the BSC {{typically}} consists of in-building wiring. Although originally deployed systems (1990s) used <b>plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy (PDH) links such as E1/T1 links, more recent systems use Ethernet cabling. Aircraft use satellite links.|$|E

50|$|Coriant {{originates}} {{from the}} Transmission Technology department of Siemens based in Munich, Germany, (Übertragungstechnik - ÜT {{as it was}} called in the 1990s). In those days the technology evolved from <b>Plesiochronous</b> Digital Hierarchy (PDH) to Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) in the STM-4 / STM-16 (2.5 Gbit/s) level.|$|E
50|$|Ethernet over PDH over SONET/SDH (EoPoS) {{is one of}} many {{techniques}} that provided Ethernet connectivity over non-Ethernet networks. EoPoS is a standardized method for transporting native Ethernet frames over the existing telecommunications optical infrastructure use both the established <b>Plesiochronous</b> Digital Hierarchy (PDH) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) transport technologies.|$|E
5000|$|In {{previous}} sections we {{have looked}} at an example in which a 140 Mbit/s signal was mapped into a VC-4, but the multiplexing map lets the STM-1 signal transport other types of <b>Plesiochronous</b> signals and even combinations of signals. All the possibilities are shown in the table below: ...|$|E
5000|$|ITU-T Recommendation G.7043 [...] "Virtual {{concatenation}} of <b>plesiochronous</b> {{digital hierarchy}} (PDH) signals" [...] enhances the frame structures of PDH signals of 1544, 2048 and 44 736 kbit/s, {{as defined in}} ITU-T Recommendation G.704, and the octet structured 34 368 kbit/s, as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.832 to support virtual concatenation.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the design of ATM, 155 Mbit/s Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) with 135 Mbit/s payload was {{considered}} a fast optical network link, and many <b>plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy (PDH) links in the digital network were considerably slower, ranging from 1.544 to 45 Mbit/s in the USA, and 2 to 34 Mbit/s in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Based on the E1 signal, the ITU {{defined a}} {{hierarchy}} of <b>plesiochronous</b> signals that enables signals to be transported at rates of up to 140 Mbit/s. This section describes the characteristics of this hierarchy and the mechanism for dealing with fluctuations in respect to the nominal values of these rates, which are produced {{as a consequence of}} the tolerances of the system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plesiochronous</b> digital {{hierarchy}} (PDH) was {{developed as a}} standard for multiplexing higher order frames. PDH created larger numbers of channels by multiplexing the standard Europeans 30 channel TDM frames. This solution worked for a while; however PDH suffered from several inherent drawbacks which ultimately resulted {{in the development of}} the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH). The requirements which drove the development of SDH were these: ...|$|E
50|$|As is {{the case}} with level 1 of the <b>plesiochronous</b> digital {{hierarchy}} (2 Mbit/s), the higher levels of multiplexing are carried out bit by bit (unlike the multiplexing of 64 kbit/s channels in a 2 Mbit/s signal, which is byte by byte), thus making it impossible to identify the lower level frames inside a higher level frame. Recovering the tributary frames requires the signal to be fully demultiplexed.|$|E
50|$|Digital Signal 0 (DS0) {{is a basic}} digital {{signaling}} rate of 64 kilobits per second (kbit/s), corresponding to the capacity of one analog voice-frequency-equivalent channel. The DS0 rate, and its equivalents E0 and T0, {{form the basis for}} the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in North America, Europe, Japan, {{and the rest of the}} world, for both the early <b>plesiochronous</b> systems such as T-carrier and for modern synchronous systems such as SDH/SONET.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{formulation}} of the equations for the electromagnetic wave, the field of telecommunication could be founded. In 19th century telegraphy, electrical circuits, some spanning continents and oceans, could transmit codes - simple dots, dashes and spaces. From this, a series of technical issues have emerged; see [...] But {{it is safe to}} say that our signalling systems can be only approximately synchronized, a <b>plesiochronous</b> condition, from which jitter need be eliminated.|$|E
50|$|A widely adopted {{specification}} {{to emerge}} from the ATM Forum was the Circuit Emulation Service specification (CES). This specification defined a method of creating a service out of mapping TDM DS0 and DS1/E1 <b>Plesiochronous</b> Digital Hierarchy (PDH) signals into Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells. It also supported J2 and DS-3 signals. The service was built around the ATM Adaption Layer 1 specification from the ITU. The 1.0 version was approved about 1995 and the 2.0 version was approved in January 1997.|$|E
50|$|As far as {{synchronization}} is concerned, the multiplexing of <b>plesiochronous</b> signals is {{not completely}} trouble free, {{especially when it comes}} to demultiplexing the circuits. In a PCM multiplexer of 30 + 2 channels, a sample of the output signal clock(1/32) is sent to the coders, so that the input channels are synchronized with the output frame. However, higher level multiplexers receive frames from lower level multiplexers with clocks whose value fluctuates around a nominal frequency valuewithin certain margins of tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had Carrier Group Alarms {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} pilot signal was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent <b>plesiochronous</b> and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet alarm indication signal (EthAIS).|$|E
50|$|Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are {{standardized}} protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams synchronously over {{optical fiber}} using lasers or highly coherent light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data {{can also be}} transferred via an electrical interface. The method was developed to replace the <b>plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without synchronization problems. SONET generic criteria are detailed in Telcordia Technologies Generic Requirements document GR-253-CORE. Generic criteria applicable to SONET and other transmission systems (e.g., asynchronous fiber optic systems or digital radio systems) are found in Telcordia GR-499-CORE.|$|E
50|$|An Ethernet {{interface}} is {{much cheaper}} than a {{synchronous digital hierarchy}} (SONET/SDH) or <b>plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy (PDH) interface of the same bandwidth. Another distinct advantage of an Ethernet-based access network {{is that it can}} be easily connected to the customer network, due to the prevalent use of Ethernet in corporate and, more recently, residential networks.A typical service provider's network is a collection of switches and routers connected through optical fiber. The topology could be a ring, hub-and-spoke (star), or full or partial mesh. The network will also have a hierarchy: core, distribution (aggregation), and access. The core in most cases is an existing IP/MPLS backbone but may migrate to newer forms of Ethernet transport in the form of 10Gbit/s, 40Gbit/s, or 100Gbit/s speeds or even possibly 400Gbit/s to Terabit Ethernet network in the future.|$|E
50|$|SDH {{differs from}} <b>Plesiochronous</b> Digital Hierarchy (PDH) {{in that the}} exact rates {{that are used to}} {{transport}} the data on SONET/SDH are tightly synchronized across the entire network, using atomic clocks. This synchronization system allows entire inter-country networks to operate synchronously, greatly reducing the amount of buffering required between elements in the network.Both SONET and SDH can be used to encapsulate earlier digital transmission standards, such as the PDH standard, or they can be used to directly support either Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or so-called packet over SONET/SDH (POS) networking. Therefore, it is inaccurate to think of SDH or SONET as communications protocols in and of themselves; they are generic, all-purpose transport containers for moving both voice and data. The basic format of a SONET/SDH signal allows it to carry many different services in its virtual container (VC), because it is bandwidth-flexible.|$|E
5000|$|The other {{technical}} issues to resolve was {{what type of}} optical transmission equipment to use. A few years before a new standard for optical transmission systems called Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) had been developed and ratified as a global standard {{as a replacement for}} existing <b>Plesiochronous</b> Digital Hierarchy (PDH) equipment. As the Telecom Electric Project started manufacturers had started releasing SDH products onto the market and Russ Taylor, the SDH specialist in the TE team, after researching the UK SDH suppliers, recommended the project implement an all SDH network. This was a bold step at the time, but his research showed that with the right combination of suppliers, it was not only feasible, but would lead to a more efficient network with lower operating costs than the previous PDH products widely used and much more effective than starting with PDH and migrating to SDH over time.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{considerations}} represent typical problems characterizing {{terrestrial radio}} links using microwaves {{for the so-called}} backbone networks: hop lengths of few tens of kilometers (typically 10 to 60 km) were largely used until 1990s. Frequency bands below 10 GHz and, above all, the information to be transmitted was a stream containing a fixed capacity block. The target was to supply the requested availability for the whole block (<b>Plesiochronous</b> digital hierarchy, PDH, or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, SDH). Fading and/or multipath affecting the link for short time period during the day had to be counteracted by the diversity architecture. During 1990s microwave radio links begun widely {{to be used for}} urban links in cellular network. Requirements regarding link distances changed to shorter hops (less than 10 km, typically 3 to 5 km) and frequency increased to bands between 11 and 43 GHz and more recently up to 86 GHz (E-band). Furthermore, link planning deals more with intense rainfall and less with multipath, so diversity schemes became less used. Another big change that occurred during the last decade was evolution towards packet radio transmission. Therefore, new countermeasures, such as adaptive modulation, have been adopted.|$|E
