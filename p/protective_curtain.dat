40|$|Protective curtain" was the {{physical}} experiment onboard the International Space Station (ISS) aimed on radiation {{measurement of the}} dose - reducing effect of the additional shielding made of hygienic water-soaked wipes and towels placed {{on the wall in}} the crew cabin of the Service module Zvezda. The measurements were performed with 12 detector packages composed of thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) and plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) placed at the <b>Protective</b> <b>curtain,</b> so that they created pairs of shielded and unshielded detectors. We simulated the experiment by the general purpose 3 D Monte Carlo Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS), as 10 cm-thick water-filled panels housed in a model of the Zvezda module. External radiation environment was modeled using the AP 8 MIN and ISO- 15390 standard models for the trapped proton (TP) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra, respectively. The absorbed doses were calculated for all detector packages used in the experiment. Comparison of calculated results with experimental data (TLDs) showed good agreement for the total (TP+GCR) absorbed doses. Further, we analyzed the systematic uncertainty introduced by differences in the detector thicknesses used in the simulations from the ones used in the measurements. The reducing effect of the <b>Protective</b> <b>curtain</b> was studied by comparing the calculated absorbed doses in shielded and unshielded detectors separately for the TPs and GCRs. In case of TPs, the reducing effect was larger than 60 % and 40 % for pairs of detectors located at aluminum wall and at crew cabin window, respectively. In case of GCRs, small shielding effect was observed for detectors located behind the window but for those located behind the aluminum wall, the effect was even opposite: the absorbed doses in the unshielded detectors were about 10 % lower than in the shielded ones. This result was confirmed by the depth-dose analysis using rectangular source emitting broad parallel incident particles impinging on the simple geometry composed of aluminum/glass box and water box of variable thickness simulating the spacecraft wall/window and <b>Protective</b> <b>curtain,</b> respectively. The additional dose in the shielded detectors is related to the secondary fragments known as the "wall effect". However, since GCR contributes by about 30 % and 15 % only to the total dose in water in shielded and unshielded detectors, respectively, the total shielding effect is high and the <b>Protective</b> <b>curtain</b> is very efficient when it is applied on a spacecraft at low-Earth orbits...|$|E
40|$|Plasminogen {{activators}} and inhibitors may {{be important}} early in primate implantation but evidence for this is sparse in non-human primates. We define the expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) and type 2 (PAI- 2), the receptor for uPA (uPAR) and fibrin/fibrinogen in monkey implantation sites. In situ hybridization and immuno-histochemical localization of rhesus monkey implantation sites (day 15 - 16 postovulation) indicate: (1) uPA mRNA is localized to placental trophoblast, epithelial plaque and endometrial stroma. (2) tPA mRNA is mainly expressed in glandular cells of endometrium. (3) PAI- 1 expression is linked to a specific population of trophoblasts that confront maternal cells, adding support to our view {{that it has a}} regulatory role in trophoblast invasion. (4) Localization of tPA antigen confirms that uterine glands are the major source of tPA and that it is also closely associated with fibrin(ogen) suggesting its possible function during implantation is fibrinolysis. (5) Unlike uPA mRNA, however, the distribution of uPA protein and its cell surface receptor uPAR suggests that it mediates trophoblast invasion and plays a significant role in angiogenesis. (6) PAI- 2, the inhibitor associated with pregnancy in humans, was found in unidentified cells located specifically along the maternofetal junction. This localization adjacent to areas of cell death at the maternofetal junction implies that it may have a role as a <b>protective</b> <b>curtain</b> with anti-apoptotic function. In conclusion our results suggest that gene expression of PAs and PAIs in early implantation sites are tissue-specific, location-sensitive and function-related.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of radiation <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> in reducing the occupational radiation exposure of medical personnel. Methods. We studied medical staff members who had assisted in 80 consecutive therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Use of radiation <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> mounted to the X-ray tube was determined randomly for each procedure, and radiation doses were measured with electronic pocket dosimeters placed outside the protective apron. Results. When <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> were not used, the mean radiation doses to endoscopists, first assistants, second assistants, and nurses were 340. 9, 27. 5, 45. 3, and 33. 1 [*]µSv, respectively; doses decreased to 42. 6, 4. 2, 13. 1, and 10. 6 [*]µSv, respectively, when <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> were used (P< 0. 01). When the patient had to be restrained during ERCP (n= 8), the radiation dose to second assistants without <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> increased by a factor of 9. 95 (P< 0. 01) relative to cases in which restraint was not required. Conclusions. During ERCP, not only endoscopists, but also assistants and nurses were exposed to high doses of radiation. Radiation exposure to staff members during ERCP was reduced with the use of <b>protective</b> <b>curtains...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{and functions of}} semitransparent eye <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> are analyzed. Based upon this analysis, functional requirements are developed, and design requirements are specified for optimum curtains {{to be used with}} open arc welding and arc cutting processes. Such curtains also protect against other high intensity broad-spectral-band sources such as compact arc lamps. The requirements for filtering out hazardous UV radiation and blue light must be balanced against the need for transparency in the visible spectrum and the need for reduced glare. Infrared attenuation is shown to be of very little importance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of the work described in this paper was the development of passive and active protective clothing {{for the protection of}} the human skin against accidental laser irradiation and of active <b>protective</b> <b>curtains.</b> Here, the passive systems consist of functional multi-layer textiles, providing a high level of passive laser resistance. In addition, the active functional multi-layer textiles incorporate sensors that detect laser exposure and are, by means of a safety control, able to deactivate the laser beam automatically. Due to the lack of regulations for testing and qualifying textiles to be used as laser PPE, test methods were defined and validated. Additionally, corresponding testing set-ups were developed. Finally, the gap with respect to standardization was bridged by the definition of a test procedure and the requirements with respect to laser PPE. The developments were demonstrated by a set of tailored functional passive and active laser-protective clothing prototypes (gloves, jackets, aprons, trousers) and active curtains as well as by a prototype testing rig, providing the possibility to perform the specified low-power and high-power textile test procedure...|$|R
40|$|Blast and {{impact-resistant}} curtains {{are increasingly}} utilized for various applications in critical infrastructures to retrofit or enhance energy absorption and fragments capturing capabilities. Investigation {{of the impact}} resistance and failure mechanisms of the <b>protective</b> <b>curtains</b> are therefore critical. Understanding the energy absorption and failure mechanisms of fabrics impacted by potential debris of medium to low striking speeds could thus lead to improvements in designing spall linings system as well as bullet-proof combat uniforms against fragmentations. This paper aims at investigating the deformation and damage mechanisms of woven fabrics subjected to low velocity impact. Gas-gun experiments are conducted to investigate the ballistic resistance of the fabrics. A mesoscale modelling approach is developed and validated with the experiment to simulate the ballistic events for various projectile striking velocities ranging between 50 - 150 m/s. Parametric studies and comparisons are then carried out to examine the primary energy components: strain, kinetic, and friction energy, and their associated distribution within the fabric. The decoupling of the energy absorbed by the fabric provides an insight into {{the interaction of the}} yarns, as well as the significance of the energy components during the different stages of the impact event. The studies suggest the importance of the inter-yarn friction in a low speed impact scenario...|$|R
50|$|Although {{a canopy}} which {{provided}} clear vision {{to the rear}} necessary for dogfighting like the F-86 was designed, production MiG-17Fs got a cheaper rear-view periscope which would still appear on Soviet fighters {{as late as the}} MiG-23. By 1953, pilots got safer ejection seats with <b>protective</b> face <b>curtain</b> and leg restraints like the Martin-Baker seats in the west. The MiG-15 had suffered for its lack of a radar gunsight, but in 1951, Soviet engineers obtained a captured F-86 Sabre from Korea and they copied the optical gunsight and SRD-3 gun ranging radar to produce the ASP-4N gunsight and SRC-3 radar. The combination would prove deadly over the skies of Vietnam against aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom whose pilots lamented that guns and radar gunsights had been omitted as obsolescent.|$|R
40|$|The Biomedical Optical Company of America's Eagle 475 lens absorbs 100 {{percent of}} all photowavelengths {{considered}} hazardous to eye tissue, including ultraviolet and blue light, which are considered contributors to cataract and age-related macular degeneration. The lens absorbs hazardous wavelengths, but allows {{a higher percentage of}} visually useful areas of the spectrum to pass through. Polarization blocks out irritating glint and glare and heightens visual acuity. The Eagle 475 sunglasses are {{the latest in a series}} of spinoffs that originated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where two scientists developed a <b>protective,</b> welding <b>curtain</b> that filtered out harmful irradiance. The result was a commercial curtain that absorbs filters and scatters light, providing protection for personnel in welding areas.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the legionnaire wore a red kepi with blue band and piping, dark blue tunic with red collar, red cuff patches, and red trousers. The most {{distinctive}} features were the green epaulettes (replacing the red of the line) worn with red woollen fringes; plus the embroidered Foreign Legion badge {{of a red}} flaming grenade, worn on the kepi front instead of a regimental number. In the field a light khaki cover was worn over the kepi, sometimes with a <b>protective</b> neck <b>curtain</b> attached. The standard medium-blue double breasted greatcoat (capote) of the French infantry was worn, usually buttoned back to free the legs for marching. From the 1830s the legionnaires had worn a broad blue woollen sash around the waist, like other European units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d'Afrique), while indigenous units of the Army of Africa (spahis and tirailleurs) wore red sashes. White linen trousers tucked into short leather leggings were substituted for red serge in hot weather. This was {{the origin of the}} [...] "Beau Geste" [...] image.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} permethrin-impregnated {{curtains}} on {{the incidence of}} malaria episodes, parasitaemia and splenomegaly was assessed during a 22 month period in 2 groups of children aged 0. 5 - 6 years. One group lived in houses where permethrin-impregnated curtains had been installed, the other group lived in houses without curtains. A significant reduction of incidence of malaria episodes, mean parasite density, parasite prevalence and splenomegaly was consistently observed in the intervention group {{towards the end of}} the period of moderate transmission, whereas no clear-cut impact could be demonstrated during the high transmission period. The influence of malaria pressure and community utilization on the <b>protective</b> efficiency of <b>curtains</b> is discussed. Because of their acceptability and the ease of reimpregnation, curtains proved to be a suitable technique for integration into primary health care...|$|R
