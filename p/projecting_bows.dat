The bow has a ground floor double staircase leading to an Ionic colonnaded loggia (with the Truman Balcony at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the façade.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Bow</b> <b>Project</b> invited South African, {{and later}} Faroese, composers to {{transcribe}} and paraphrase or reimagine, for the classical string quartet, the uhadi songs of Nofinishi Dywili. Composers based their transcription {{on the field}} recordings of ethnomusicologist Dr Dave Dargie, made between 1980 and 2002. The medium of the string quartet was seen as providing a perfect bridge between the world of traditional bow music {{and the world of}} new classical music. The <b>Bow</b> <b>Project</b> was launched at the New Music Indaba in 2002, and new works premiered at subsequent festivals. A South African tour in 2009 was followed by the CD production. Each concert included performances of the uhadi songs interpreted by musicians of the next generation, namely Madosini and Mantombi Matotiyana. The project is dedicated to the memory of Nofinishi Dywili who died in 2002. According to Dargie, Dywili possessed [...] "exceptional rhythmic skill… whatever of the marvellous and complex rhythms there were in any of the songs - 10-vs-8 cross-rhythms or whatever - Nofinishi would also effortlessly bring in greater rhythmic complexity, making the songs even more wonderful." ...|$|R

Bottom Of The Sky was released November 12, 2010, and was also recorded at Levon Helm Studios and co-produced, engineered and mixed by Justin Guip. In November 2010, the group had the opportunity to play as the backing band for “Imagine There’s No Hunger” at the Hard Rock Café Hollywood, benefiting Why Hunger. Featured performances included Edgar Winter, Dave Stewart, Booker T. Jones and Ringo Starr. In April 2012, Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck won Boston’s Rock’n’Roll Rumble, at TT the Bear’s in Cambridge. Third studio album, Eden was released on March 5, 2013, and was well received both locally and nationally.American Songwriter praised the record, saying “In a different era, Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck would have some well-deserved gold records on their walls.” Prior to the release of Eden, Bow and Perfect Trainwreck performed the record to the sold-out Chandler Music Hall in Randolph, VT on January 19, 2013. On Earth Day, April 22, 2014, Eden: Live at the Chandler was released as the group’s fourth full length and first live album.

The high slate roof is pierced by two gable windows, more reminiscent of a farmhouse than a sophisticated mansion.

6000|$|... 18. You have then, observed, {{two great}} principles, {{as far as}} {{northern}} architecture is concerned; first, that the pointed arch {{is to be the}} means by which the weight of the wall or roof is to be sustained; secondly, that the steep gable is the form most proper for the roof itself. And now observe this most interesting fact, that all the loveliest Gothic architecture in the world is based on the group of lines composed of the pointed arch and the gable. If you look at the beautiful apse of Amiens Cathedral--a work justly celebrated over all Europe--you will find it formed merely of a series of windows surmounted by pure gables of open work. If you look at the transept porches of Rouen, or at the great and celebrated porch of the Cathedral of Rheims, or that of Strasbourg, Bayeux, Amiens, or Peterborough, still you will see that these lovely compositions are nothing more than richly decorated forms of gable over pointed arch. But more than this, you must be all well aware how fond our best architectural artists are of the street effects of foreign cities; and even those now present who have not personally visited any of the continental towns must remember, I should think, some of the many interesting drawings by Mr. Prout, Mr. Nash, and other excellent draughtsmen, which have for many years adorned our exhibitions. Now, the principal charm of all those continental street effects is dependent on the houses having high-pitched gable roofs. In the Netherlands, and Northern France, where the material for building is brick or stone, the fronts of the stone gables are raised above the roofs, and you have magnificent and grotesque ranges of steps or curves decorated with various ornaments, succeeding one another in endless perspective along the streets of Antwerp, Ghent, or Brussels. In Picardy and Normandy, again, and many towns of Germany, where the material for building is principally wood, the roof is made to project over the gables, fringed with a beautifully carved cornice, and casting a broad shadow down the house front. This is principally seen at Abbeville, Rouen, Lisieux, and others of the older towns of France. But, in all cases, the effect of the whole street depends on the prominence of the gables; not only of the fronts towards the streets, but of the sides also, set with small garret or dormer windows, each of the most fantastic and beautiful form, and crowned with a little spire or pinnacle. Wherever there is a little winding stair, or <b>projecting</b> <b>bow</b> window, or any other irregularity of form, the steep ridges shoot into turrets and small spires, as in fig. 8,[6] each in its turn crowned by a fantastic ornament, covered with curiously shaped slates or shingles, or crested with long fringes of rich ironwork, so that, seen from above and from a distance, the intricate grouping of the roofs of a French city is no less interesting than its actual streets; and in the streets themselves, the masses of broad shadow which the roofs form against the sky, are a most important background to the bright and sculptured surfaces of the walls.|$|R
