It shows that these reinsurers have higher mean values than primary insurers in the following financial ratios: net operating income to net premium earned (NOI/PE), yield on invested assets (YIA), and loss reserves to net premium written (LR/NPW). Primary insurers, on the other hand, have higher mean values in the combined ratio (CRAD), the return to policyholders ’ surplus (RPHS), and net premiums written to policyholders ’ surplus (NPW/PHS). A further study using least square regression analyses indicates that being a <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurer</b> significantly raises a firm’s combined ratio and lowers its return to policyholders ’ surplus. On the other hand, being a reinsurer has no significant effect on net operating income, yield on invested assets, change in policyholders ’ surplus, change in premium written, or current liquidity. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reinsurance}} {{market is}} the secondary market for insurance risks. It has a very specific organization. Direct insurers do not trade risks with each other. They cede part of their primarily underwritten portfolios mainly to <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> with no direct business. This paper offers a model of equilibrium in reinsurance and capital markets where <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> arise naturally to monitor primary insurers. The interplay of financing and reinsurance decisions facing primary insurers is also explicitly modelled.

40|$|The {{reinsurance}} {{market is}} the secondary market for insurance risks. It has a very specific organization. Direct insurers rarely trade risks with each other. Rather, they cede part of their primary risks to specialized <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> who have no primary business. This article offers a model of equilibrium in reinsurance and capital markets in which <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> arise endogenously. Their role is to monitor primary insurers credibly, so that insurers can raise capital more easily. In equilibrium, the financial structure of primary insurers consists of a mix of reinsurance and outside capital. The comparative statics yield empirical predictions which are broadly in line {{with a number of}} stylized facts from the reinsurance market.

50|$|On 10/11 May 1861, {{more than}} 500 houses {{went up in}} flames {{in the town of}} Glarus. Two thirds of the town sank into rubble and ashes; around 3000 {{inhabitants}} were made homeless. Like the fire of Hamburg in 1842 (which led to the foundation of the first <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> in Germany,), the great fire of Glarus in 1861 showed that insurance coverage was totally inadequate in Switzerland in the event of such a catastrophe. Hence the need to provide more effective means of coping with the risks posed by such devastation.|$|R
40|$|This article employs, for {{the first}} time, the private archive {{of one of the}} world s largest and oldest {{reinsurance}} companies, Swiss Re, founded in Z rich in 1863, in order to analyse the early development and internal workings of reinsurance the insurer s insurance in nineteenth century Europe. In the course of overcoming existential crises during its early years, the company s management learned valuable lessons about the technical basis of reinsurance and the importance of information and communication. In the long run, this experience enabled Swiss Re to gain a greater autonomy of action for <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> within the insurance industry as a whole. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} history of short term {{reinsurance}} in South Africa from 1950 to 1985 and shows how it developed from a very limited market in which insurers generally relied on British and European <b>professional</b> <b>reinsurers</b> to a viable local market albeit with strong foreign support. The study demonstrates that the local reinsurance market grew in parallel {{with the development of}} the South African economy and the consequent need for extensive cover arising from the country's industrial expansion. It considers the different problems of the two waves of locally established reinsurers and the different circumstances prevailing in the two distinct eras of South African short term reinsurance. The conclusion reached is that, notwithstanding the varied results of individual reinsurers and the collapse of two local reinsurance companies, the market performed well and succeeded in meeting the needs of the South African short term insurance marke...|$|R
40|$|The {{puzzle of}} {{underwriting}} cycles and insurance crises in property-liability insurance {{has led to}} numerous economic hypotheses and analyses, yet no single theory seems capable of explaining all of its aspects. Reinsurance is hypothesized to be a potential factor in observed cycles in the primary market; despite this, few underwriting cycle studies focus on reinsurance. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate determinants of reinsurance prices in the U. S. Nonproportional reinsurance is highlighted, since it is designed to cover the tail of the loss distribution and is considered to be relatively riskier than proportional reinsurance as a result. Separate samples of <b>professional</b> U. S. <b>reinsurers</b> for property and for casualty are studied, based upon the reinsurers' writings of property versus casualty nonproportional reinsurance. The sample period is 1991 - 1995. The results support both the capacity constraint hypothesis and the risky debt hypothesis, {{and this is the first}} research to support both. A major innovation in this study is the use of capacity variables that are broken down by major region of the world. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance. ...|$|R
