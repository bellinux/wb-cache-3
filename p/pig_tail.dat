5000|$|With {{its rich}} soil, St. Kitts and Nevis grow {{a wide variety}} of fresh produce. Abundant seafood and meats such as goat add to the diet. The style of cooking is fairly simple, flavored much like other West Indian cuisine. Goat water stew, perhaps the country's most {{well-known}} dish, mixes goat, breadfruit, green pawpaw (papaya), and dumplings (also known as [...] "droppers") in a tomato-based stew. Another favorite dish is cook-up, or pelau, which combines chicken, <b>pig</b> <b>tail,</b> saltfish and vegetables with rice and pigeon peas. Conkies bear a large similarity to tamales, though instead of having filling rolled inside the dough, the cornmeal is mixed together with grated sweet potato, pumpkin, coconut, and a few other ingredients; after wrapping the dough in banana leaves, they're boiled rather than steamed. Sweets tend to be simply made, sometimes with nothing more than fruit, like tamarind or guava, and sugar.|$|E
