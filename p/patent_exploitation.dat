40|$|In open {{innovation}} systems, capturing value through external intellectual property (IP) commercialization is {{an increasingly important}} strategy for firms {{to keep pace with}} competitive changes. However, many firms have major difficulties in creating value through external <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation.</b> To understand these challenges, this paper explores how firms manage their external <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> based on a multiple case study research design with fourteen firms from the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. Adopting a desorptive capacity perspective we find four main factors influencing the firms' management of external patent exploitation: the type of value creation, the organizational structure, the locus of initiative, and the extent of know-how transfer along with the patent. Based on these factors, three archetypes of external <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> with different levels of desorptive capacity are identified. The article extends the concept of desorptive capacity and existing literature on intellectual property management in the context of {{open innovation}}.

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new approach, the {{constrained}} maximization approach, to the patent-antitrust interface. It advocates {{a return to}} the utilitarian premise of the patent system, which posits that innovation incentives are preserved so long as the costs of innovation are recovered. While this premise is widely accepted, it is seldom applied by the courts in patent-antitrust cases. The result is that courts and commentators have been overly deferential to dynamic efficiency arguments in defense of <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> practices, and have failed to scrutinize the extent to which patentee reward is genuinely essential to generating innovation incentives. Under the constrained maximization approach, the antitrust courts attempt to maximize the net social benefits of an innovation by adjusting the scope of <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation,</b> subject to the constraint that innovation costs are recouped. This approach will allow the courts to take into account two important considerations in the balance between static and dynamic efficiencies that have been largely overlooked: the contribution of cumulative innovation to social welfare and the variety of ways in which innovators recover their R 2 ̆ 6 D investments in addition to patent protection. Incorporation of both of these considerations lends support to a more robust approach to the patent-antitrust interface...|$|E

The research was carried out following a "pyramidal" approach: from the studying of the innovative phenomenon in the history of economics, the scope of investigation narrowed towards the structure of the IT market and the subjects operating therein, up to investigate the suitability of existing instruments - and, in particular, those of competition law – in order to remedy opportunistic <b>patent</b> <b>exploitations</b> (<b>patent</b> hold-up). Economic and legal framework showed that patent hold-up is a specific issue of the IT market and exploits its features; therefore, sector-specific solutions and economically oriented remedies have been suggested in the proposals (chapter 5 and conclusions). All the solutions offered here move from the assumption that any intervention to be effective, must also be the least invasive as possible and exploit the same physiological features of IT market, that gave rise to opportunistic behaviors. The implications of this work, and the solutions and remedies it offers, are suitable for being implemented in the new context of the Unified Patent Court, which could also be considered a first testing ground for a European common approach to the problem of patent hold-up.

30|$|Another {{aspect of}} change {{has taken place}} in terms of {{strengthening}} the autonomy of universities from the state since the 1990 s in NRW as one of the forerunners of these reforms in Germany (Hüther and Krücken 2018). A third important development for AE in Germany is a new intellectual property rights (IPR) regulation which was passed in 2001. The so-called professors’ privilege was abolished, i.e. professors are now obliged to report any patentable inventions to allow the university to own and exploit the intellectual property while in return the university covers all costs involved in filing patents and academics are entitled to 30 % of revenues from licencing. New structural arrangements such as <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> agencies (“Patentverwertungsagenturen”) were created to assist universities in this new task (cf. Krücken et al. 2007 : 688; Kulicke et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{shift towards}} a {{knowledge-based}} economy has inevitably prompted {{the evolution of}} <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Nowadays, patent {{is more than just}} a prevention tool for a company to block its competitors from developing rival technologies, but lies at the very heart of its strategy for value creation and is therefore strategically exploited for economic pro t and competitive advantage. Along with the evolution of <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation,</b> the demand for reliable and systematic patent valuation has also reached an unprecedented level. However, most of the quantitative approaches in use to assess patent could arguably fall into four categories and they are based solely on the conventional discounted cash flow analysis, whose usability and reliability in the context of patent valuation are greatly limited by five practical issues: the market illiquidity, the poor data availability, discriminatory cash-flow estimations, and its incapability to account for changing risk and managerial flexibility. This dissertation attempts to overcome these impeding barriers by rationalizing the use of two techniques, namely fuzzy set theory (aiming at the first three issues) and real option analysis (aiming at the last two). It commences with an investigation into the nature of the uncertainties inherent in patent cash flow estimation and claims that two levels of uncertainties must be properly accounted for. Further investigation reveals that both levels of uncertainties fall under the categorization of subjective uncertainty, which differs from objective uncertainty originating from inherent randomness in that uncertainties labelled as subjective are highly related to the behavioural aspects of decision making and are usually witnessed whenever human judgement, evaluation or reasoning is crucial to the system under consideration and there exists a lack of complete knowledge on its variables. Having clarified their nature, the application of fuzzy set theory in modelling patent-related uncertain quantities is effortlessly justified. The application of real option analysis to patent valuation is prompted by the fact that both patent application process and the subsequent <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> (or commercialization) are subject to a wide range of decisions at multiple successive stages. In other words, both patent applicants and patentees are faced with a large variety of courses of action as to how their patent applications and granted patents can be managed. Since they have the right to run their projects actively, this flexibility has value and thus must be properly accounted for. Accordingly, an explicit identification of the types of managerial flexibility inherent in patent-related decision making problems and in patent valuation, and a discussion on how they could be interpreted in terms of real options are provided in this dissertation. Additionally, the use of the proposed techniques in practical applications is demonstrated by three fuzzy real option analysis based models. In particular, the pay-of method and the extended fuzzy Black-Scholes model are employed to investigate the profitability of a patent application project for a new process for the preparation of a gypsum-fibre composite and to justify the subsequent patent commercialization decision, respectively; a fuzzy binomial model is designed to reveal the economic potential of a patent licensing opportunity...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a novel data set of 612 European patents and related inventions from five {{different}} industries, it is shown that multiple patents per invention are filed in both discrete and complex technologies. Multivariate analysis of the data suggests that in selected discrete technologies, patent 'fences' may serve to exclude competitors whereas in complex technologies, 'thickets' represent exchange forums for complementary technology. The results expand on traditional views of profitable <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> across industries and elaborate on the most recent findings by Cohen et al. (Cohen, W. M., Nelson, R. R. and Walsh, J. P. (2000) Protecting Their Intellectual Assets: Appropriability Conditions and Why U. S. Manufacturing Firms Patent (or not). Cambridge, MA: NBER.) The analysis suggests that different legislative issues arise from multiple patenting per innovation in complex and discrete technologies depending on the degree of technological complementarity. The results have unexpected policy implications in that they illustrate how patentees could eliminate competition in the form of substitute technologies through fencing. They have wide managerial implications regarding the valuation of patent portfolios and the design of corporate IP strategies.

40|$|Highlights - Research and {{development}} spending has risen rapidly in Asia, particularly in China, {{which is now}} the world's second R&D spender behind the United States. The increase in Korean and Chinese patent applications has been even more rapid, but Chinese <b>patenting</b> for <b>exploitation</b> on the main markets for innovation(the European Union, Japan and the US) is still marginal. - Asia's increased innovation spending is most prominently related to information and communication technologies. Overall, the Chinese and Korean economies are still not specialised in knowledge-intensive goods and services. Furthermore, China in particular is not (so far) capturing much value from {{its role as a}} manufacturer and exporter of high-tech goods; China remains mostly an assembler of goods, the value of which is created elsewhere. - It would be wrong to ignore China's innovation potential {{on the basis of its}} current performance.

30|$|The {{conditions}} for individual scientists {{to engage in}} AE still vary in NRW despite the abovementioned general shifts in Germany. This can partly {{be attributed to the}} diverse organisational landscape of research organisations. Research universities, universities of applied sciences and other public research institutions have their unique organisational structures as well as organisational cultures when it comes to AE. While technology transfer services are institutionalised within universities (TTOs), some services are outsourced to the <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> agencies outside the universities. Universities of applied sciences are more centralised in their decision-making and have closer links to industry due to their applied mission compared to more research-driven research universities, where the power of professors is still holding its base alongside increased centralised management. Their decision-making lines are long and include multiple stakeholder interaction. The German science system also includes public research organisations such as for example research institutes of the Max Planck Society or Fraunhofer Society. All of them engage in knowledge commercialization, even the most basic research-oriented ones. The research institutes differ in their missions: the institutes of the Max Planck Society are rather oriented towards basic research and are largely funded by the state, the institutes of the Fraunhofer Society are oriented towards applied research and are closely linked to collaborations with the private sector. As a rule, the Societies serve as umbrella organisations for their institutes in providing TTO type of apparatuses for technology transfer, such as the Max Planck Innovation or Fraunhofer Venture (Doppelberger 2012; Mahr 2012; Lange and Krücken 2011). Research institutes are smaller organisations compared to universities and operate quite independently from their umbrella Society, thus their decision-making lines are shorter.|$|E

Using unique data collected from 5. 992 academic scientists in 73 German Universities Germany, we find that entrepreneurial peers and performance based monetary incentives have a strong {{positive effect on the}} entrepreneurial intentions. We show that, although there is a comprehensive support infrastructure for start-ups in German academic institutions, these services are little known amongst their staff. Finally we find that market related networks show a high correspondence with high entrepreneurial intentions, whereas networks within the own university do not have any impact. Several mentioned aspects were analyzed before, but mostly on a limited sample (e. g. only stem field), isolated personal variables (e. g. gender) or isolated environmental aspects (e. g. peer groups). Our study provides a holistic view on the impact of several university-specific structural factors on entrepreneurial intentions among academic scientists in Germany by simultaneously focusing on personal and occupational characteristics for different faculties. @Wissenschaftliches Hochschulpersonal generiert im Rahmen seiner Forschungst 4 tigkeit Innovationen und verf aktuelles Wissen, das als Basis f eine innovative Unternehmensgr betrachtet werden kann.

40|$|Research on patent {{valuation}} {{has become}} increasingly important in academic and policy circles {{in the last few}} decades. In part, this is the outcome of the wide consensus that innovation is a crucial ingredient for growth at various levels. On the other hand, there has also been an overcoming of growth models unilaterally focused on technological-oriented approaches. This book presents novel and original research on patent value determinants, which are intrinsic or extrinsic to the innovator's business model. Grid Thoma has undertaken a long study on the strategic factors affecting patent valuation, bringing extensive quantitative evidences across various geographical and institutional contexts. Beforehand, the valuation of the patent real options is appraised when the innovator can postpone the additional investment required for the <b>patent's</b> successful <b>exploitation.</b> Then, he analyses what other complemental IP strategies are combined with patenting that in turn directly affect the value of patents. Moreover, the book scrutinizes the so-called 'strategic patenting' hypothesis according to which innovators obtain patents for other reasons beyond gaining IP protection. A second order of strategic factors affecting the value of patents resides {{at the outset of the}} invention process. These are constituted by knowledge spillovers, which are typically mediated by the local geographical context where the invention process takes place. The analysis shows that the contribution of knowledge spillovers from business and nonbusiness organizations to the value of the patented R&D constitutes a relevant aspect for an innovator's decision making. This thoughtful, cutting-edge research book is vital reading for researchers, academics, and policy decision makers in the area of in market valuation, management of technology, innovation management, and economic geography...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the interplay between patent incentives and corporate innovation.

Our study focus online searching was made available after 1976, as the initial year to conduct the patent search. Up to 2001, there are 2269 patents classified in the H 01 M 008 / 00 ~H 01 M 008 / 24 category, which is the category concerning fuel cell under the classification of the International <b>Patent</b> Classification.

By aligning firms’ patenting strategies and the imparities between book values and market values this study concludes a technological ambidexterity with respect to firms’ technology development. The exploitative firms tend to file patents to defend their leadership in the product market as a result their technology is constrained within a firm’s boundaries.

40|$|EXECUTIVE Summary This brief {{outlines}} simplified Open Science Learning Objectives for {{the main}} stakeholders in the Research Ecosystem. Learning Objectives are structured by Open Science Topics according to a functional Open Science Taxonomy (Pontica et al., 2015), that accompany the main responsibilities of each stakeholders along the Research Lifecycle. The ultimate objective is to support the integration of Open Science best practices into the daily routine of performing and supporting research, to underpin implementation of Horizon 2020 Mandate on Access to Scientific Information, and augment the “societal impact” and uptake of research, {{for the benefit of}} all stakeholders in the knowledge creation process (ultimately underpinning “co-creation”). Specific Learning Objectives are structured in increasing level of competence, frequently ending with successful integration of Open Science best practices in the daily research routine, facilitating self-assessment of the personal workflow. The Learning Objectives can provide a backbone for a structured learning plan for Doctoral Schools with the ambition to train future researchers in optimizing their societal impact, alongside research excellence training, as well as preparing graduates for new and emerging research impact measures and criteria. Support with relevant training content will be provided in parallel through the FOSTER Portal and accompanying e-Learning and self-learning modules. The brief draws on FP 7 FOSTER Work Packages 2 Content, WP 3 Portal (Open Science Taxonomy, and learning portal infrastructure) and WP 4 Training (Deliverable D 4. 5 Training ToolKit). RATIONALE: The political drive for Open Science from the funding agency (EC[1]) point of view is mainly Return On Investment (ROI), ethics (taxpayer access to public funded research), and stimulating Open Innovation[2] through free-flow of ideas in order to boost economic growth through transfer of knowledge to the knowledge-based Small/Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The Open Science community of advocates and practitioners a diverse one, spanning the full breadth of research disciplines, as well as a range of stakeholders with various vested interests and roles in the research process. The cumulative effect {{is that there is a}} rich diversity of strong reasons for and against making “Open Science” the default setting in the research process. Consultation by FP 7 FOSTER of 90 researchers from various disciplines (Fig. 1; attendees of the EuroScience Open Forum, Copenhagen 2014 [1]) lists reasons in favour: ethics, return on investment, societal impact, transparency, rigor and reproducibility; and objections: national security, patient data, confidential data, <b>patent</b> <b>exploitation</b> [2]. Although most are valid, it is beyond the scope of FP 7 FOSTER to provide the definitive summary of training content, or learning objectives, in order to address such a diversity of discipline-specific cases, and arguments. The objective of this document is to support the implementation of the Horizon 2020 Mandate, and focus on research data and knowledge at the time of generation, by: (1) reducing the arguments in favour of adopting Open Science practices to those lowest common denominators that are most Target-centric and discipline-agnostic and offer the highest scalling capacity beyond the lifetime of FP 7 FOSTER, (2) listing the minimal competencies per Target Group required to comply with the Horizon 2020 Mandate and fully capitalize on Open Science potential, in the form of modular Learning Objectives, with gradually increasing level of understanding, and (3) support these Learning Objectives with minimum critical (not exhaustive!) content (WP 2 Content Mapping), e-infrastructure (WP 3 Portal) and actual Training ToolKit & HelpDesk support (WP 4 Training).

40|$|The {{purpose in}} {{registering}} patents {{is to protect}} the intellectual property of the rightful owners. Deterministic and stochastic trends in registered patents can be used to describe a country's technological capabilities and act as a proxy for innovation. This paper presents an econometric analysis of the symmetric and asymmetric volatility of the patent share, which is {{based on the number of}} registered patents for the top 12 foreign patenting countries in the USA. International rankings based on the number of foreign US patents, patent intensity (or patents per capita), patent share, the rate of assigned <b>patents</b> for commercial <b>exploitation,</b> and average rank scores, are given for the top 12 foreign countries. Monthly time series data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for January 1975 to December 1998 are used to estimate symmetric and asymmetric models of the time-varying volatility of the patent share, namely US patents registered by each of the top 12 foreign countries relative to total US patents. A weak sufficient condition for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the univariate GJR(1, 1) model is established under non-normality of the conditional shocks. The empirical results provide a diagnostic validation of the regularity conditions underlying the GJR(1, 1) model, specifically the log-moment condition for consistency and asymptotic normality of the QMLE, and the computationally more straightforward but stronger second and fourth moment conditions. Of the symmetric and asymmetric models estimated, AR(1) -EGARCH(1, 1) is found to be suitable for most countries, while AR(1) -GARCH(1, 1) and AR(1) -GJR(1, 1) also provide useful insights. Non-nested procedures are developed to test AR(1) -GARCH(1, 1) versus AR(1) -EGARCH(1, 1), and AR(1) -GJR(1, 1) versus AR(1) -EGARCH(1, 1) ...|$|R
