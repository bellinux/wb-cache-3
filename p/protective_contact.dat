40|$|ABSTRACT: α-Synuclein is an {{intrinsically}} disordered protein whose aggregation is {{implicated in}} Parkinson’s disease. A second {{member of the}} synuclein family, β-synuclein, shares significant sequence similarity with α-synuclein but is much more resistant to aggregation. β-Synuclein is missing an 11 -residue stretch in the central non-β-amyloid component region that forms the core of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils, yet insertion of these residues into β-synuclein to produce the βSHC construct does not markedly increase the aggregation propensity. To investigate the structural basis of these different behaviors, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance data, {{in the form of}} paramagnetic relaxation enhancement-derived interatomic distances, are combined with molecular dynamics simulations to generate ensembles of structures representative of the solution states of α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and βSHC. Comparison of these ensembles reveals that the differing aggregation propensities of α-synuclein and β-synuclein are associated with differences in the degree of residual structure in the C-terminus coupled to the shorter separation between the N- and C-termini in β-synuclein and βSHC, making <b>protective</b> intramolecular <b>contacts</b> more likely...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} a research project undertaken in 2003 to explore the importance of engaging the families of {{children and young people}} who are in care. The research consisted of three parts: a literature review and report; interviews with children, young people and families; and interviews with practitioners. The aim of the report was to highlight the importance of engaging families and to develop guidelines for good practice in this area. The research found overwhelming evidence for the value of engaging families, but also found that engagement can be a complex process which requires a strong long-term commitment, positive attitude, and great sensitivity, especially to issues of grief and loss. Engagement does not necessarily mean access or contact. Given the wishes of the children and young people, or <b>protective</b> concerns, <b>contact</b> between children and their families may not be immediately appropriate. This does not mean, however, that the family cannot be engaged. Family engagement means more than formal consultation. Parents need to be respected and their own issues of grief and loss understood.

This study aimed to assess 1) the association of farming lifestyle in childhood and asthma, and 2) whether diet in adulthood modifies the association between farming lifestyle in childhood and adult-onset asthma. In the French Etude Epidemiologique des Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale (E 3 N) study (54, 018 females; age 43 – 68 yrs), three indicators of farming lifestyle were defined: one using individual data (having farmer parents) and two using ecological data (born in a rural area and exposure to cattle).

40|$|The T cell lineage is {{generally}} {{divided into two}} distinct subpopulations {{on the basis of}} their function, phenotype, and genetic restriction (1, 2). In the mouse, helper/inducer T cells are L 3 T 4 +, Lyt- 2 -, class II-restricted, and secret multiple lymphokines. CTL are L 3 T 4 -, Lyt- 2 ÷, class I-restricted, and lyse target cells via direct cell-cell <b>contact.</b> <b>Protective</b> immunity against intracellular bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, is mediated by specific T cells and expressed by activated macrophages (2). Class II-restricted, Lyt 2 - L. monocytogenes-specific T lymphocytes produce many lymphokines in vitro, and adoptive protection against listeriosis has been found to be class II-restricted (3 - 6). These findings led to the concept that Th are crucial for cellular antibacterial immunity. This concept, however, requires verification because it was also found that successful adoptive protection against listeriosis depends on Lyt- 2 + T cells and on class I compatibility between T cells and recipients (7 - 9). Whether L. monocytogenesspecific Lyt- 2 + T cells reside in the CTL set has not been addressed by these studies.

In a natural model of tuberculosis, we studied 10 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (non-protective immune response) and 38 healthy household <b>contacts</b> (<b>protective</b> immune response). We tested the lymphocyte proliferative response by T cell Western blotting to eight different antigen fractions and to two purified mycobacterial antigens of 30 and 64 kD. Patients with active tuberculosis recognized fractions with molecular weights of 80 - 114, 60 - 80, 28 - 41 and 14 - 19 kD. Household contacts recognized the same fractions except the 14 - 19 kD. The response to the 64 -kD antigen was not significantly different between groups. In contrast, 10 % of the patients with active tuberculosis and 73 % of the household contacts responded to the 30 -kD antigen. The humoral response against the 30 -kD antigen by ELISA showed a significantly higher production of antibodies in tuberculosis patients compared with household contacts. We conclude that patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis develop an immune response characterized by poor proliferative response to the 30 -kD antigen with a strong humoral response, whereas the opposite occurs in healthy subjects infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis...|$|R

To exclude any possible effect on airborne transfer of bacteria, the isolator was first examined by means of an airborne particle tracer of the same size as bacteria-carrying particles. Such experiments indicated that the isolator might prevent some transfer out of but not into the isolator. This was not confirmed in simulated nursing experiments nor in a patient study, where the air counts of bacteria were practically the same inside and outside the isolator wall. Two patients only were nursed in the isolator. Both patients acquired exogenous colonizations from other patients, one with Ps. aeruginosa and the other with S. aureus.

In addition, plants can activate <b>protective</b> mechanisms upon <b>contact</b> with a previous invader. This interesting phenomenon is termed induced or acquired resistance and often protects the plant against a second invasion by the same or another pest or pathogen.

40|$|Background : Contact lens induced {{trauma to}} the corneal {{epithelium}} results in increased release of inflammatory mediators. The keratocyte apoptosis {{is directly related to}} epithelial injury and has been correlated with increased production of nitric oxide. Potent antioxidant enzymes protect cells from oxidative damage by inactivating reactive oxygen species and thus inhibiting apoptosis. This study aims at determination of total nitric oxide and antioxidant enzymes in tears which will be an indirect criteria for assessing apoptosis. Materials and Methods : Nitric oxide and antioxidant enzymes were estimated in tears of 25 soft contact lens wearers and compared with 25 age and sex matched controls. Results : Statistically significant increase of nitric oxide (P&# 60; 0. 001), superoxide dismutase (P&# 60; 0. 001) and glutathione peroxidase (P&# 60; 0. 001) levels was seen in tears of contact lens wearers as compared to controls. There was also statistically significant increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (P&# 60; 0. 05) and glutathione peroxidase (P&# 60; 0. 01), with increase in the total duration of contact lens wear in years. Conclusions : Increase in the level of nitric oxide and antioxidant enzymes in tears of contact lens wearers suggested that contact lens wear suppresses the process of apoptosis. However, it was also postulated that the increased levels of nitric oxide balances the anti-apoptotic activities of increased levels of antioxidant enzymes by its pro-apoptotic activity leading to <b>protective</b> outcomes in <b>contact</b> lens wearers...|$|R

Comparisons of persons reporting three or more types of contacts with those reporting fewer types yielded age-and gender-adjusted hazard ratios of 0. 73 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 64, 0. 82) for mortality and 0. 75 (95 % CI: 0. 61, 0. 91) for ischemic heart disease. Comparable fully adjusted hazard ratios were 0. 83 (95 % CI: 0. 73, 0. 95) and 0. 82 (95 % CI: 0. 67, 1. 00). These data suggest that health benefits are derived from the diversity of social roles, especially those involving intimate relationships. epidemiologic studies; heart diseases; mortality; myocardial ischemia; social support Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; IHD, ischemic heart disease...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to constitutive plant resistance against pests or pathogens, plants can activate <b>protective</b> mechanisms upon <b>contact</b> with an invader or a chemical elicitor. Studies on induced plant resistance to herbivores, especially piercingsucking insects, are less abundant than those devoted to pathogens. Several experiments under controlled conditions {{have been conducted}} to demonstrate that infestations by Macrosiphum euphorbiae induce plant resistance to Bemisia tabaci in susceptible tomato plants. After three days of exposure to 20 apterous adult aphids, the plants acquired a transiently induced resistance to B. tabaci when aphid removal occurred one or 18 hours prior to B. tabaci infestation; the effect disappeared when four days passed between aphid and whitefly infestations. The resistance observed was both locally and systemically induced. Other assays were performed to evaluate the effect of preinfestation with ten adults of B. tabaci during 48 h on the tomato responses to two different clones (Sp and Nt) of M. euphorbiae. The numbers of nymph and adult aphids were counted after the same time interval as the pre-reproductive period and 20 (Sp clone) or 22 (Nt clone) days after adult aphid removal. The tomato responses induced by whitefly feeding depend on the aphid clone. For the Sp clone, the number of aphid nymphs ten days after adult removal was significantly higher on whitefly preinfested plants than on uninfested plants. However, {{no significant differences were}} observed when the aphid clone Nt was tested. The duration of plant response to a previous infestation by B. tabaci is apparently limited.

40|$|Sexual abuse has severe {{negative}} impacts on childrenâs lives, but {{little is known}} about risk factors for sexual abuse victimization in sub-Saharan Africa. This study examined prospective predictors of contact sexual abuse in a random community-based sample of children aged 10 - 17 (n= 3515, 56. 6 % female) in rural and urban areas in South Africa. Anonymous self-report questionnaires using validated scales were completed at baseline and at one-year follow-up (96. 8 % retention rate). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hypothesized factors and sexual abuse were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions controlling for socio-demographics showed that for girls, previous sexual abuse (OR 3. 44, 95 % CI 2. 03 - 5. 60), baseline school dropout (OR 2. 76, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 6. 19) and physical assault in the community (OR 2. 17, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 3. 48) predicted sexual abuse at follow-up. Peer social support (OR. 84, 95 % CI. 74 -. 98) acted as a <b>protective</b> factor. Previous <b>contact</b> sexual abuse was the strongest predictor of subsequent sexual abuse victimization. Additionally, peer support moderated the relationship between baseline assault and subsequent sexual abuse. For boys, no longitudinal predictors for sexual abuse victimization were identified in this sample. These results indicate that the most vulnerable girls - those not in school and with a history of victimization - are at higher risk for sexual abuse victimization. High levels of peer support reduced the risk of sexual abuse victimization and acted as a moderator for those who had experienced physical assault within the community. Interventions to reduce school dropout rates and re-victimization may help prevent contact sexual abuse of girls in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Background. Deliberate self-harm (DSH) {{ranges from}} {{behaviours}} aiming to communicate distress or relieve tension, but where suicide is not intended, to actual suicide. Not all individuals {{are prone to}} DSH, which {{suggests that there are}} factors that protect against it. Identifying these could {{play an important role in}} the management and prevention of DSH. Objectives. This study examined whether religious beliefs, coping skills and responsibility to family serve as factors protecting against DSH in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. Method. A cross-sectional comparative study assessed DSH patients consecutively admitted or directly referred to Queen Elizabeth General Hospital and Hospital Mesra Bukit Padang during the period December 2006 - April 2007. DSH patients (N= 42) were matched with controls (N= 42) for gender, age, religion, race, occupation and marital status. The DSH and control groups were compared using psychosocial tests that assess coping skills, religious beliefs and responsibility to family. Results. There were significant differences in religious beliefs (p= 0. 01) and responsibility to family (p= 0. 03) between the DSH patients and the control group. There were also significant differences in coping skills, DSH patients tending to use emotion-orientated coping (p= 0. 01) as opposed to task- and avoidance-orientated coping. Conclusion. Consistent with international studies, coping skills (i. e. task-orientated skills), religious beliefs and responsibility to family were more evident in patients who did not attempt DSH than in those who did. These findings imply that treating DSH should not start only at the point of <b>contact.</b> <b>Protective</b> factors such as religious beliefs, responsibility to family and coping strategies can be inculcated from a very young age. However, caution is required in generalising the results owing to limitations of the study. Further extensive research on religious and psychotherapeutic interventions and prospective studies on protective factors will be helpful...|$|R
