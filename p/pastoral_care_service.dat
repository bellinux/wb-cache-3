40|$|This {{research}} is about pastoral care among the youth and young adults. It {{is the study}} of how best the youth and young adult in our society can find and get the help that the society can offer to them. The study is not limited to only the youth and young adults who are Christians, but includes all youth and young adults irrespective of beliefs. In the introduction of the dissertation, I explore the term pastoral care and examine how it is applied and to whom and for whom pastoral care is directed. I study the youth and young adults who fit into this description and their understanding of what pastoral care is about. The study stresses the importance of good listening skills when carrying out pastoral care. Being aware of the hurts that can results as an outcome of callouses response to what is being communicated is also important. Good techniques are the keys to good pastoral care giving. Listening with ones’ feelings as well as ones full attention are important traits in this field. Important issues that arose while carrying out this study included in general, that young people did not know that pastoral care exist for all types of grievances. The study revealed that the youth and young adults do not know about the <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> and the opportunity that it provides in terms of counselling. Some participants expressed the need to have pastoral care for the youth and young adults on a neutral place rather than in the church office. The study suggests the need for a place, where the young people can come in and talk to a competent professional pastoral care giver without a referral or appointment. Personal accounts show that there are many youth and young adults who go behind the “walls” of misery because the problems they are facing do not need a medical or psychiatrists treatment. Hence the study echoes the need to have someone to talk to, someone who can listen and give advice when needed. A number of relevant literatures which are related to the research topic were reviewed. The research questions were categorized into relevant themes. The study concludes with some suggestions as to how the availability of pastoral care can be made better known to the youth and young adults...|$|E

5000|$|School chaplains are {{a fixture}} in {{religious}} and, more recently, secular schools. In religious schools {{the role of the}} chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical.

40|$|The {{research}} is centred upon {{the nature and}} extent of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> provision in five Western Australian Government secondary schools. The project took the form of five case-studies, set in schools which each had well established pastoral strategies in place. The schools plans and policies were influenced by contexts of State and Federal education programmes, by the community setting of each school, by community concerns, and by other priorities within the school itself. In the study, information was collected through interviews and written responses from school staff, through documentary evidence of plans and policies for <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> and through the observation of meetings which related to pastoral concerns. The study found that each school had complex structures in place which were resource intensive and which were designed to deliver <b>pastoral</b> <b>care.</b> The basis of those structures rested upon the presumption that <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> delivery took place at classroom level, particularly in Form classes.

40|$|Prisons in Africa tend {{to focus}} on punitive {{measures}} rather than on the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates into society. In African traditional courts, inmates were not sentenced to be imprisoned but were rather helped to reform. Crime is a great challenge to the growth and development of the African continent. People in the prisons of Africa are in general vulnerable, poor, oppressed and marginalized. From the perspective of liberation theology, the aim would be to give hope to the incarcerated. Prisons in Africa tend to contribute to a culture of delinquency, categorize and isolate criminal types and construct new social subjects. The prison system is flawed and promotes the very reason for the existence of penal institutions. The study seeks to understand the realities of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and prison chaplaincy in Africa. It investigates the ways in which <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and prison chaplaincy could play a constructive and life-changing role in the lives of inmates. The study investigates the nature, work, challenges and contributions of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and chaplaincy in prisons of Africa. The investigation examines what prison chaplaincy in Africa could learn from their counterparts in Latin America, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The specific situation of prisons in Zimbabwe is highlighted as a case study. A qualitative research method was selected because its open-endedness fits well with the investigation at hand. Theological reflection opens avenues and opportunities to make voices of marginalized groups heard. Self-reflection and the participation of marginal groups is core to theological reflection {{as well as to the}} professed political agenda of most nations. A type of penal institution that is new in spirit, method and objective could contribute to the reform of the prison industry, the global reality of which is at present rather complex and confused. The practical theological model of Richard Osmer (2008 : 4) which identifies four tasks of reflection: descriptive-empirical, interpretative, normative and pragmatic is used as a framework for the development of best practice model of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and prison chaplaincy in Africa. Although prisons in South Africa have their shortcomings, the penal systems and <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> seem to be well-organized. In the United States model of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and prison chaplaincy, faith-based organisations are treated equally and federal and state prisons are well structured unlike those in Africa. <b>Pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and prison chaplaincy on the continent of Africa will require an indigenous African-based theology to effectively address the needs of prisoners.

40|$|The thesis "Pastoral {{aspects of}} the baptism in the current {{discussion}} in the German speaking countries" analyzes critically the theological discussion since the seventies. The baptism is deprived of its closely sacramental and christological determination and is treated as an occasional service. Biographical and ritual concepts of the occasional services attribute to these acts a special theological significance that cannot be derived from Christ's commission to preach the gospel, but rather is rooted in a piety, which targets {{the life cycle of}} individuals and families. Occasional services are therefore seen as a pastoral accompaniment of man in his fault (and critical) stage of life. Its aim is to convey his emotional and cognitive stabilization and assist in re-establishing his fluctuating identity. The practice of the baptism, in this perspective, must regard ambivalent experiences of parents and provide them an appropriate religious intervention. Traditional theological contents of the baptism are markedly eliminated with regard to the situation of the distant Christians who became estranged from the reflected Christianity.

In August 2010, the Australian Government announced that a total of $ 222 million would be provided to extend the National School Chaplaincy Program to December 2014 and to fund up to 1, 000 additional schools.   The additional funding will focus on schools in disadvantaged, rural and remote communities. No applications for funding are being accepted at this time. Further information will be provided in early 2011. The Government has also been conducting a national consultation process this year. The consultation has involved a range of stakeholders including state education departments, major service providers, representatives of independent and faith-based school systems and peak representative bodies for parent and community organisations, principals and other relevant interest groups. Interested members of the public also have the opportunity to be involved in this process (see National Consultation Process). The national consultation process is considering the achievements and effectiveness of the National School Chaplaincy Program, its relationship with other student support activities, and canvassing stakeholder views in relation to future chaplaincy and <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> A number of issues are being examined including: Achievements of the program Relationship with other student support activities What is/ is not working well Current and future needs Potential target group(s) / priority areas Possible future program options Funding model/ mechanisms and funding requirements The national consultation process will include two stages: Stage One – Stakeholder Meetings Stage Two – Public Discussion Paper The first stage of the national consultation process involved meetings with key stakeholders around Australia.

Methods A series of {{interviews were conducted with}} service users across directorates of a large NHS mental health Trust. Their views on the quality of SPC services and desired changes were elicited. Grounded theory was used with a constant comparative approach to the interviews and analysis. Results Initial analysis explored views on spirituality and religion in health. Participants’ concerns included what chaplains should do, who they should see, and how soon after admission. Theoretical analysis suggested incorporating an overarching spiritual element into the bio-psycho-social model of mental healthcare. Conclusions Service users’ spirituality should not be sidelined. To service users with strong spiritual beliefs, supporting their spiritual resilience is central to their care and well-being.

Historical developments in <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> are well-documented. However, <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> in Africa has a short and unsystematically documented history. Scholarly discussions on <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> concerning the continent tend to be considered under African theological frameworks. Notwithstanding the already existing weaknesses in African theological discussion, <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> in Africa has remained fragmented with diverse and seemingly knee-jerk approaches in guiding individuals who provide <b>pastoral</b> <b>care.</b> In view of this, this article firstly aims to provide a broad overview and initiate a discussion on the current challenges in <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> in Africa.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to interpret from multiple perspectives the <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leadership role in New Zealand secondary schools. It was based on the rationale that <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leadership within New Zealand secondary schools is increasingly complex. Some shifts are happening for <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leaders as they play more of a role in supporting student learning. The traditional <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leader role of ‘disciplinarian’ has evolved into a more holistic role with a focus on improving student outcomes. However, these shifts have brought new challenges and a greater need for targeted professional development for <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leaders. Research and literature on middle leadership in education has a tendency to default to the curriculum middle leader role in schools, which has left the <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leader role largely unaccounted for. These are therefore critical times for <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leaders. This qualitative research involved three interviews with three senior leaders and three focus groups with a total of eighteen <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> middle leaders.
