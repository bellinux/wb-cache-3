The response variables are: {{modulus of rupture}} (MOR), internal adhesion (AI), apparent density (dap) and wood moisture content (um). The experiments were developed based on the methodological procedures of the ABNT NBR 14810 : 2002 standard. The particleboards were manufactured by hot-pressing at 4 MPa and 90 °C, using timber particles with 5 % of moisture content and 10 % of monocomponent and bicomponent <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin.</b> The higher moisture content was achieved when the monocomponent <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> was used. The bicomponent <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> provided a percent increase of 43. 7 % and 22. 7 % on the modulus of rupture and apparent density, respectively, {{when compared to the}} standard limit. The internal adhesion of the panels manufactured with monocomponent resin was 2. 45 times higher than the standard limit. The confidence interval between means revealed that the internal adhesion and apparent density exhibited statistical equivalence. A good correlation between the internal adhesion and apparent density was found, for this reason it was possible to estimate the internal adhesion of the panels based on the apparent density data...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to develop new PMC using commercially available Epoxy and <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> systems. These resin systems would be reinforced with glass fibers, filler materials and aluminium foils. Laminates are prepared by using the hand lay-up techniques of eight layers and mechanical test such as tensile test and compression test have been conducted. This work {{has been carried}} out to identify the appropriate resin systems, filler materials and glass fiber reinforcement to estimate the strength of the composite. Two types of glass fiber (chopped mat & woven mat) with reinforcement of filler material and aluminium foil used to estimate the strength of composite. As per the results from the present experimental study, reinforcing aluminium foil and graphite filler in the chopped mat with Epoxy resin has high tensile strength compared to woven mat reinforcement. By reinforcing filler material has high tensile and compressive strength, the properties of the laminate is increased due to the filler material reinforcement in Epoxy resin as well as in <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>resin.</b> The properties of the laminate are increased due to the filler material reinforcement in both resin systems. From this investigation we conclude that filler material plays very important role in composite system. In both epoxy and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> system by reinforcing filler material the mechanical properties and strength of the laminate under tensile and compression are increased.

40|$|Context: <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> is a {{possible}} alternative to type IV dental stone for fabrication of indirect restorations however its dimensional accuracy is questionable. Aim: The aim {{was to investigate the}} dimensional accuracy of silica filled <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> die material by evaluating the marginal fit and adaptation of indirect gold castings. Settings and Design: Experimental, in vitro study. Materials and Methods: Totally 40 copper plated replicas of a nickel chrome master die analogous to a veneer gold crown preparation were made and impressions recorded using polyvinylsiloxane material. Twenty impressions were poured in type IV dental stone (control group (Vel-mix, Kerr, UK) and the remaining (n = 20) in silica filled polyurethane die material (test group) (Alpha Die MF, CA, USA). Gold castings were fabricated for each die using standardized techniques. The castings were seated on their respective copper plated dies, embedded in resin and sectioned. The specimens were analyzed by measuring marginal opening and the area beneath the casting at a × 63 magnification and using image analysis software. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed using a Student′s t-test. Results: No significant difference was observed between the experimental groups (P > 0. 05). The mean marginal opening for type IV, dental stone and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin,</b> was 57 ± 22. 6 μm and 63. 47 ± 27. 1 μm, respectively. Stone displayed a smaller area beneath the casting (31581 ± 16297 μm 2) as compared to <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> (35003 ± 23039 μm 2).

5000|$|Going into 2002, LGarde was {{developing}} <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> for a 3-ply composite laminate {{that could be}} used in the fabrication of rigidizable structures suitable for use in space. [...] In a paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), engineers found that such composites can be used to fabricate ultra-lightweight deployable rigidizable structures for space applications and that polyurethane was chosen because it could become rigid when exposed to the low temperatures of space. The paper goes on to observe that under NASA's SSP program (Space Solar Power Truss), a 24-foot long inflatable-rigidizable truss using polyurethane composites withstood a compression load of 556 pounds, 10% above its designed compression strength while reducing mass of comparable mechanical structures by a factor of 4.It had been long theorized that solar sails could reflect photons streaming from the sun and convert some of the energy into thrust. The resulting thrust, though small, is continuous and acts for the life of the mission without the need for propellant. In 2003, LGarde, together with partners JPL, Ball Aerospace, and Langley Research Center, under the direction of NASA, developed a solar sail configuration that utilized inflatable rigidized boom components to achieve 10,000 m2 sailcraft with a real density of 14.1 g/m2 and potential acceleration of 0.58 mm/s2. The entire configuration released by the upper stage has a mass of 232.9 kg and required just 1.7 m3 of volume in the booster. Additional advancement of the solar sail project came as LGarde engineers improved “sailcraft” coordinate systems and proposed a standard to report propulsion performance.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> have {{frequently}} {{been used to}} reinforce the soil and to recover building foundation structures after subsidence.
