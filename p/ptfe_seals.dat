40|$|Die Standardlösung zur Abdichtung von Wellen im Maschinenbau sind Radial-Wellendichtringe (RWDR) aus Elastomeren. Allerdings stoßen Elastomer-Werkstoffe in vielen Anwendungen an ihre Belastungsgrenzen. Durch Einsatz von PTFE-Compounds als Dichtungswerkstoff können die Einschränkungen von Elastomeren weitgehend überwunden werden. Daher werden in der Dichtungstechnik immer häufiger Manschettendichtungen aus PTFE-Compounds (PTFE-MD) eingesetzt. Im Gegensatz zu Elastomer-RWDR sind bei PTFE-MD Rückförderstrukturen (RS) erforderlich, um die dynamische Dichtheit zu gewährleisten. Für Anwendungen mit festgelegter Drehrichtung der Welle gehören PTFE-MD mit Spiralrille zum bewährten Stand der Technik. Die Spiralrille als RS ist aber nur für eine Drehrichtung der Welle geeignet. Bei wechselnder Wellendrehrichtung werden andere RS verwendet. Es gibt zwar bereits funktionierende PTFE-MD mit RS für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, allerdings sind diese noch im Erforschungsstadium und weisen Optimierungspotenziale auf. Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens für Dichtungsanwender durch die Verfügbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller. Dies liegt im Wesentlichen daran, dass die entsprechenden Funktionsmechanismen nicht hinreichend bekannt sind. Ohne Kenntnis der genauen Funktionsmechanismen ist eine gezielte Optimierung nicht möglich. Daher muss mit hohem experimentellem Aufwand durch „Versuch und Irrtum“ optimiert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, zu leisten. Dabei liegt das Hauptaugenmerk der Arbeit auf der numerischen Untersuchung der nachfolgenden Zusammenhänge. • Analyse des Strömungsverlaufs und der Druckverteilung um RS und im Dichtspalt. Dies dient einem besseren Verständnis der Vorgänge im Bereich des Dichtspalts. • Untersuchung unterschiedlicher Einflüsse auf das Umlenk- und Fördervermögen von RS. Ziel ist dabei die Identifikation von relevanten Einflussgrößen auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. • Analyse des Förderverhaltens durch den hydrodynamischen Dichtspalt und durch lokale Erhöhungen des Dichtspalts. • Betrachtung der Einflüsse der Dichtspaltgeometrie auf den Förderwert einer PTFE-MD mit RS. • Untersuchung der Auswirkungen von Geometrievariationen am Übergang einer RS in den geschlossenen Ring auf das Druckaufbauvermögen und damit auch indirekt auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. Durch ein besseres Verständnis der obigen Zusammenhänge können die dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS besser nachvollzogen werden. Hieraus lassen sich besonders wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fördervermögens und damit der dynamischen Dichtsicherheit von PTFE-MD mit RS ableiten. Damit ist eine effektivere Optimierung möglich, wodurch der experimentelle Aufwand bei der Weiterentwicklung von PTFE-MD mit RS reduziert werden kann. The common {{solution}} for sealing shafts {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of radial shaft seals made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of lip <b>seals</b> made of <b>PTFE</b> compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric radial shaft <b>seals</b> <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. • Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the sealing gap. This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the sealing gap. • Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic sealing gap and through local elevations of the sealing gap. • Exploration of the influences of the sealing gap geometry on the pumping ability of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic <b>sealing</b> reliability of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. The mentioned measures imply a more efficient optimization, whereby the experimental effort in the advancement of <b>PTFE</b> lip <b>seals</b> with pumping structures can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|A new passive {{sampling}} device {{was developed for}} field equilibrium sampling of geosmin (GSM) and 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB) in surface water. The sampling device was prepared by coating a 50 cm length polypropylene hollow fiber tubing (50 mu m wall thickness, 280 pm inner diameter) with polypropylene glycol 4000. The sampler was brought into equilibrium with the sample in the field, and then transferred and immersed into 100 mu L of methanol held in a little desorption device for room temperature desorption and preservation of the sampled analytes. After being transported to the laboratory, the analytes were determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction-GC-MS. The large surface area-to-volume ratio of the developed sampler facilitated the reaching of sampling equilibrium in 1 h, while the equilibrium sampling minimized the effects of environmentally relevant sampling conditions. Variation of sample pH (4. 0 - 9. 0) and salinity (0 - 100 mM NaCl) had no significant effects on the distribution coefficients of analytes to the sampler. The desorption device, constructed with a 200 mu L glass insert, and a 2 mL brown glass vial with <b>PTFE</b> <b>sealed</b> screw cap, has no loss of analytes during the storage of the sampler.

40|$|Extrusion of the {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (<b>PTFE)</b> pilot <b>seal</b> {{used in the}} monomethylhydrazine (fuel) valve of the Orbiter Primary Reaction Control System (PRCS) thrusters {{has been}} implicated in numerous on-orbit thruster failures and on-ground valve failures. Two extrusion mechanisms have been proposed, one or both may be occurring. The first mechanism is attributed to thermal expansion mismatch between adjacent PTFE and metal parts used in the fuel valve, and {{is referred to as}} thermal extrusion. The second mechanism is attributed to nitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) leakage from the adjacent oxidizer valve on the same thruster during ground turnaround, and is referred to as oxidizer-induced extrusion. Model calculations of <b>PTFE</b> pilot <b>seal</b> in an exact pilot valve configuration show that extrusion can be caused by differential thermal expansion, without the intervening influence of oxidizer. Experimental data on semitrapped PTFE and TFM (modified PTFE) specimens simulating a fuel pilot valve configuration show that thermal extrusion 1) is incremental and irreversible, 2) increases with the size of the thermal excursion, 3) decreases with successive thermal cycling, and 4) is accompanied by gap formation. Both PTFE and TFM exhibit a higher affinity for oxidizer than fuel. The property changes associated with oxidizer uptake may explain why oxidizer seals do not exhibit extrusion. Impression replicas of fuel pilot seals removed from the Orbiter fleet show two types of extrusion: extrusion of the entire seal (loaded extrusion), or extrusion of non-sealing surface (unloaded extrusion). Both extrusion types may arise from differences in service history, rather than in failure mechanism. The plausibility oxidizer-induced extrusion was evaluated. Preliminary calculations suggest that enough energy, heat, or gas may be liberated under certain operational scenarios to cause catastrophic extrusion. However, given the lack of supporting data, conclusions implicating oxidizer leakage as a factor in extrusion must be made with caution...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{rotary shaft}} <b>seals</b> made of <b>PTFE</b> {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable rotary shaft seals, there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by <b>PTFE</b> rotary shaft <b>seals.</b> The relieved rotary shaft lip seal represents a special design among <b>PTFE</b> rotary shaft <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary shaft seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary shaft seal. Earlier designs of the relieved rotary shaft seal, similar to other commercially available rotary shaft seals, sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

40|$|Pilot {{operated}} valves (POVs) {{are used}} to control the flow of hypergolic propellants monomethylhydrazine (fuel) and nitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) to the Shuttle orbiter Primary Reaction Control Subsystem (PRCS) thrusters. The POV incorporates a two-stage design: a solenoid-actuated pilot stage, which in turn controls a pressure-actuated main stage. Isolation of propellant supply from the thruster chamber is accomplished {{in part by a}} captive polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> pilot <b>seal</b> retained inside a Custom 455. 1 stainless steel cavity. Extrusion of the pilot seal restricts the flow of fuel around the pilot poppet, thus impeding or preventing the main valve stage from opening. It can also prevent the main stage from staying open with adequate force margin, particularly if there is gas in the main stage actuation cavity. During thruster operation on-orbit, fuel valve pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by low or erratic chamber pressure or failure of the thruster to fire upon command (Fail-Off). During ground turnaround, pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by slow gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) main valve opening times (greater than 38 ms) or slow water main valve opening response times (greater than 33 ms). Poppet lift tests and visual inspection can also detect pilot seal extrusion during ground servicing; however, direct metrology on the pilot seat assembly provides the most quantitative and accurate means of identifying extrusion.

A rash of six extrusion-related in-flight anomalies over a six-mission span from December 2001 to October 2002 led to heightened activity at various NASA centers, {{and the formation of}} a multidisciplinary team to solve the problem. Empirical and theoretical approaches were used. For example, thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and exposure tests showed that some extrusion is produced by thermal cycling; however, a review of thruster service histories did not reveal a strong link between thermal cycling and extrusion. Calculations showed that the amount of observed extrusion often exceeded the amount allowed by thermally-induced stress relief. Failure analysis of failed hardware also revealed the presence of fuel-oxidizer reaction product (FORP) inside the fuel valve pilot seal cavity, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the FORP was intimately associated with the pilot seal material. Component-level exposure tests showed that FORP of similar composition could be produced by adjacent oxidizer valve leakage in the absence of thruster firing. Specific gravity data showed that extruded fuel valve pilot seals were less dense than new pilot seals or oxidizer valve pilot seals, indicating permanent modification of the PTFE occurred during service.

40|$|International audienceIn most clay-rock {{geological}} formation studied for {{the storage of}} nuclear waste,pore water compositions {{are expected to be}} at equilibrium with carbonate minerals, which are always included in predictive models for pore water composition calculations [1]. Among the carbonates known to be present, dolomite may be problematic in the pore water composition calculation because its solubility spans a large range of values as a function of its crystallinity in thermodynamic databases. In addition, the composition of dolomite minerals observed in clay-rock formations such as Callovian-Oxfordian or Opalinus clay formation differs from this of a pure dolomite: the Ca/Mg stoichiometry is not ideal, and the minerals contain minor amounts of Fe and traces of many other elements [2]. To understand the influence of secondary phases precipitation during dolomite dissolution on pore water chemistry, the dissolution of monocrystals of dolomite were investigated at 25 °C and at 80 °C in a pH range 3 to 8 for various time periods (30 minutes to 21 days) in <b>sealed</b> <b>PTFE</b> reactors.

Morphological characterizations performed with Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) evidenced that the precipitation occurs along a specific crystallographic plane of the dolomite monocrystal.
