5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

25|$|Hot Creek {{has been}} a popular {{swimming}} hole for decades. Over a dozen <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> Hot Creek since the late 1960s, {{but most of these}} deaths happened to people who ignored the numerous warning signs and attempted to use the hydrothermal pools as hot tubs (like the stream portion of the creek, these pools alternate in temperature but the eruptions in the pools are of super-heated water in already very hot water). Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials are unsure of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{study by}} Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 220,000 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> the {{conflict}} between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 – 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence. The report examines the widespread use of sexual violence against women and girls as a weapon of war, as well as the invisibility of this phenomenon. 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war.|$|E

In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. A Special Jurisdiction for Peace will be created to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict. Its purpose would be to satisfy victims' right to justice. A Special Unit was created to search for persons deemed as missing within the context of and due to the armed conflict.|$|E
500|$|The {{content and}} {{distribution}} of the main amatoxins (alpha-amanitin, beta-amanitin) and phallotoxins (phallacidin, phallisin, phalloin, phalloidin) in the three tissues (cap, stipe and volva) of Amanita exitialis have been determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The cap had the highest content of total toxins, reaching over 8000µg/g dry weight (µg of toxin per gram of dried tissue), the toxins content in the stem was over 3700µg/g dry weight, whereas the volva had the lowest content of total toxins, with about 1150µg/g dry weight. Amatoxins content (alpha-amanitin and beta-amanitins especially alpha-amanitin) in the cap, stem or volva of A.exitialis was {{higher than that of}} Phallotoxins (Phallacidin, Phallisin, Phalloidin and Phalloin), but the content of phallotoxins (especially phallacidin) was gradually higher from cap to stem and to volva. A 2011 study reported the presence of additional toxins amaninamide, phallacin, phallisacin and desoxoviridin. A Chinese study concluded that this species had the highest mortality rate of all toxic mushrooms in China. It has been estimated that about [...] of fresh mushrooms contains sufficient toxin to cause the death of a [...] adult.

2500|$|On a less broad scale, Sims and Baumann {{explained}} how {{regions in the}} United States cope with natural disasters differently. [...] The example they used was tornados.

[...] They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their {{way of thinking about}} events that occur in their lives. [...] Illinois residents, however, were more internal. [...] Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado. [...] Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.|$|E
