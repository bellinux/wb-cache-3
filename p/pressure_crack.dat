Also with its proximity to Four Mile Run Park, the area was highlighted during the December 2015 stabbing death of 22 year old Eduardo Almendarez found in Four Mile Run Park. [...] The Hume Springs neighborhood has recently seen changes in the ethnic and racial make-up of residents as increasing numbers of young white professionals seek more affordable housing closer to Old Town Alexandria, downtown DC, Crystal City and The Pentagon. As well, the aging of established residents has influenced turn-over. In 2010 there were roughly 50% Latino (mostly from El Salvador), 20% African American and 30% White/Other.|$|E

40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>cracking,</b> hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>cracking,</b> a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water <b>pressures,</b> hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>cracking</b> appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>cracking</b> are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that do not seal water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to the {{verification}} of the capability of epoxy-SbF 5 system as a healing chemistry for rapidly retarding and/or arresting fatigue cracks in epoxy materials at room temperature. Owing to the very fast curing speed of epoxy catalyzed by SbF 5, epoxy monomer and the hardener (ethanol solution of SbF 5 –ethanol complex) are successively infiltrated into the fracture plane under cyclic loading during the tension-tension fatigue test. As a result, the mechanisms including hydrodynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>crack</b> tip shielding, polymeric wedge and adhesive bonding of the healing agent are revealed.

In this study, fretting fatigue tests were performed under high contact pressure applied in line-contact conditions using 12 % Cr steel with parameters of the mean stress, contact pressure, and material strength.

Cracks were found to propagate in stage II at the angle where the maximum stress intensity factor range ΔKθmax occurred. Also, test results concerning the fretting fatigue strength could be successfully explained by the micro-crack propagation model in which a micro-crack can propagate when its stress intensity factor range ΔK is greater than the threshold value ΔKth when considering small crack effects and mean stress effects. This model also confirmed the experimental results that showed the length of non-propagating cracks decreased as the mean stress and the material strength increased...|$|E

To investigate the influence of decreasing osmotic pressure on the opening of cracks in the disc. Summary of Background Data. In the degeneration process, the disc changes structure (i. e., cracks occur, and osmotic pressure decreases). Disc herniation typically develops when hydration declines, but, on the other hand, {{it is said that}} the anulus of a highly hydrated disc has a high risk of rupture. We hypothesized that disc herniation is preceded by the opening of cracks as a result of decreasing osmotic pressure. Methods. The osmotic pressure was changed in hydrogel samples with a crack, which was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Go¨ ttingen, Germany). A 3 -dimensional finite element mixture model simulated a decrease in osmotic pressure around a crack in a swelling material. Results. Experiments and simulations show that a decrease in osmotic pressure results in the opening of cracks. The simulations show high effective stress concentrations around the crack tip, while the overall stress level decreases, indicating an increased risk of crack growth. Conclusions. Decreasing osmotic pressure in a degenerating intervertebral disc enhances the opening of existing cracks, despite the concomitant decrease in anular stresses.

40|$|Runs of {{the model}} {{developed}} and described in the previous report were undertaken to investigate the effect of residual stress and continuously welded rail (CWR) stress on crack growth in rails. The areas investigated were: Prediction of crack growth rates and directions, and how residual stress affects these; The effect of CWR stress on crack growth rate, including when it acts in combination with residual stress; The way in which initial crack angle affects the influence residual stresses have on crack propagation rates; The effect of contact pressure, surface friction and crack face friction on the crack growth rate {{in the presence of}} residual stress. It was found that: The inclusion of residual stress in the modelling of a crack at 30 ° below the rail surface produced a tendency for the crack to branch down into the rail, but this effect does not begin until the crack exceeds 20 - 25 mm in length. Tensile CWR stress (cold rails) could produce around a 70 % rise in crack growth rate over that of no CWR stress. Compressive residual stresses (hot rails) had almost no effect on crack growth rates. Without residual stresses crack growth rate was predicted to increase with increasing crack angle. With residual stresses present this trend was reversed, with 30 cracks showing the highest growth rates, and the growth rate of cracks of 60 ° or above showing insensitivity to crack angle. Trends in crack growth rate with variations in contact <b>pressure,</b> <b>crack</b> face friction and surface friction levels were largely similar for cases with and without residual stresses applied.

40|$|An {{introduction}} to the phenomena of <b>pressure</b> <b>crack</b> figures is given with special reference to static-impact figures produced on glass and diamond. The optical techniques and the apparatus used are described, including the Inter-ferometric technique used for the detection and measurement of the surface distortions for crack figures obtained first on glass, and then on diamond. The spherical impactors used were of steel (for glass), tungsten carbide and diamond (mainly for diamond). A study is made of the fracture strength properties of ten different types of optical glass {{and the results are}} compared with other properties of the glasses, including measurements of their surface hardnesses obtained by an abrading method described in the Appendix. Orientated crack figures have been produced on three different faces of diamond, the shapes being hexagonal on the octahedral and the dodecahedral faces, and square on the cubic face. For the octahedral and a cubic face, the development of these figures is studied as the load is gradually increased; and the mechanism of the crack formation and the accompanying cracking effects within the body of the crystal are discussed in terms of easy cleavage and shattering, respectively. It is found that the octahedral face is definitely the least resistant to fracture by this method, the cubic face appearing to be most resistant: also the critical stresses involved are found to be considerably less than a theoretically calculated value which indicates some form of flaw distribution over the surface analogous to the Griffith cracks for glass. It has also been seen that the octahedral face of diamond can be cracked in this way by using Tungsten Carbide or Sapphire balls, although in the latter case the tip of the ball was shattered by the occurrence of multiple slip. Both for glass and diamond, the observations obtained from the interferograms of the surface distortions is considered to offer strong evidence for the existence of micro plastic flow. No signs of micro slip could be detected in the studies on diamond except possibly in connection with the crystallo-graphic shattering which occurred internally for one test on the octahedral stone. <p...|$|E

25|$|A {{demand valve}} detects when the diver starts inhaling and {{supplies}} the diver with {{a breath of}} gas at ambient pressure. This is done by a mechanical system linking a pressure differential sensor (diaphragm) to a valve which is opened to an extent proportional to the displacement of the diaphragm difference. The pressure difference between {{the inside of the}} mouthpiece and the ambient pressure outside the diaphragm required to open the valve is known as the <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure.</b> This <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> difference is usually negative but may be slightly positive on a positive pressure regulator (a regulator that maintains a pressure inside the mouthpiece, mask or helmet, which is slightly greater than the ambient pressure). Once the valve has opened, gas flow should continue at the smallest stable pressure difference reasonably practicable while the diver inhales, and should stop as soon as gas flow stops. Several mechanisms have been devised to provide this function, some of them extremely simple and robust, and others somewhat more complex, but more sensitive to small pressure changes.|$|R
