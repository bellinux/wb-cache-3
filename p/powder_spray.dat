The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{increasing}} employment of powder coating technology, the complex interrelations in the powder application, mainly the particle size distribution and its influence, must be understood. For that, in the first part a new measuring method had to be developed, to make visible the problematics and in the next part to find a solution for it. This includes: the monitoring of the process control parameters (powder mass flow rate, particle size distribution, electrostatics, air flow and climate), {{the development of a new}} testing method for <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> systems, the development of a simulation method to predict the recycling behaviour (KAP-SIM-method), the employment of a newly developed charge spectrometer for coating powder. With the aim of these methods in the experimental optimization measures the following process parameters were taken into consideration: particle size spectrum of coating powder, coating powder recovery method and the distribution nozzles of the spray systems. For an increasing and efficient use of powder coating systems in the future, the users demand more flexible <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> guns. That means powder guns with which the dimensions of the spray cloud may be shaped continuously. The present thesis was aimed at realizing such <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> systems in form of <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> guns using aerodynamical and electrostatical solution approaches. Two completely different solutions were separately realized. On the field of electrostatics mainly the influence of steering electrodes was tested. In combination with tribo charging powder this electrodes are very effective. On the other hand, a new pistol could be dimensioned and optimized with the help of numerical simulation. The continuous regulation of the spray cloud was realized with additional controlling airs. In the future, the simulation will be an important tool in the investigation of complex powder coating processes. In the development of such systems the simulation will be used more and more. With it, the development time of the product is reduced. Therein the powder guns are only one part in the coating process. In the future, not only powder applicators will be simulated on the computer but also whole coating processes and coating lines...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> arrangement has a powder channel (4) for transporting a powder gas mixture, which opens out into a nozzle opening for distributing the powder-gas mixture {{in the form of a}} cloud. The channel has a triboelectric active surface which allows the powder to be charged up with a primary polarity. A corona electrode (3) is located before or after the active surface, so a secondary polarity can be produced. The powder channel is in the form of a ring gap or channel and at least one corona electrode is located behind the nozzle opening. A distribution member is located behind the nozzle opening and the corona electrode voltage can be controlled. The triboelectric material is e. g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (which produces a positive charge) or polyamide (which produces a negative charge). USE - For use as a powder spraying unit.

40|$|Heat {{recovery}} from milk <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> dryer exhausts has proven challenging due to {{both economic and}} thermodynamic constraints. Integrating the dryer {{with the rest of}} the process (e. g. evaporation stages) can increase the viability of exhaust recovery. Several potential integration schemes for a milk powder plant have been investigated. Indirect heat transfer via a coupled loop between the spray dryer exhaust and various heat sinks were modeled and the practical heat recovery potential determined. Hot utility use was reduced by as much as 21 % if suitable heat sinks are selected. Due to high particle loading and operating temperatures in the particle sticky regime, powder deposition in the exhaust heat exchanger is perhaps the greatest obstacle for implementing heat recovery schemes on spray dryers. Adequate cleaning systems are needed to ensure continuous dyer operation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPeptic {{ulcer disease}} {{is the most}} common cause of upper {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) bleeding. In most of the cases, bleeding from a peptic ulcer stops spontaneously. Arterial diameters in bleeding ulcers can measure up to 3. 45 mm, but in most cases the diameter of the bleeding artery is small (< 2 mm). High-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors after endoscopic therapy for a bleeding ulcer reduce recurrent bleeding risk and surgery. The endoscopic appearance of an ulcer provides important prognostic information. Clean based ulcers and ulcers with a flat pigmented spot have low rebleeding risks. Major stigmata of hemorrhage (an adherent clot, a visible vessel, or active bleeding) are associated with high rebleeding risks. Endoscopic treatment in patients with high-risk stigmata results in improved outcomes. Common endoscopic techniques and the devices used to treat upper GI ulcer bleeding, including injection therapy, thermal coagulation, endoclip application, and hemostatic <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> are described in the given video.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{summarizes the}} results of the simulation of the electrostatically supported powder paint coating process using a corona charging <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> gun. A commercial CFD code (Fluent) has been extended to account for the joint effect of aerodynamic and electrostatic forces acting on the charged paint particles. For the charging of the particles, a model based on the time dependent and inhomogeneous field strength is applied. The free ion charge density (corona discharge) is calculated solving a conservation equation for the charge density. As input condition, a fully developed turbulent pipe flow inside the spray gun is assumed. The inlet particle size distribution is measured using a Fraunhofer diffraction type instrument. The coating process of various target geometries was simulated, applying practically relevant operating conditions, e. g. air flow rate, particle loading or high voltage. The calculated paint film thickness distributions on the target derived from the local particle mass flux and the transfer efficiency (fraction of particles reaching the target) are in excellent agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{air flow}} {{patterns}} {{in an industrial}} milk <b>powder</b> <b>spray</b> dryer were investigated. Isothermal three-dimensional transient simulations were carried out using the commercial CFD code CFX 10. 0. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was implemented to model the effects of turbulence. These simulations differ from previously published studies of spray dryer air flows in that they include features found in industrial scale plant. First, they include a second inlet air stream through the internal fluid bed {{at the bottom of}} the drying chamber. Second, the two outlet ducts are located near the top rather than the bottom of the dryer, which has been the case in most previous studies. It was found that the main air jet oscillated and precessed about the central axis. In turn, the recirculation zones between the main jet and the chamber walls fluctuated in size relative to the movement of the jet. Validation was achieved by observing the oscillation of the main air jet of a large dryer visualised by tell-tail tufts attached to a central pole...|$|E
