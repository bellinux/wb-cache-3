25|$|A {{machine for}} making a {{continuous}} sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for Saint-Léger Didot family in France. The <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> {{is known as a}} Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, who were stationers in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} {{approved}} in January 1912. Most {{of the work}} was completed in 1915, when the first <b>paper</b> <b>machine,</b> PM1, was concluded. PM2 opened the following year. It was the first-largest paper mill in Norway, {{with most of the}} output being exported to the United Kingdom. The company bought Ørje Bruk in 1913, which operated a 9,000-tonne pulp mill. It was bought predominantly to secure its hydroelectric rights.|$|E

25|$|The 1973–75 {{recession}} hit {{the demand}} for newsprint hard, and from 1973 to 1978 the mill experienced low prices, high inflation, increasing energy and lumber prices combined with a stagnation of newsprint prices. Meanwhile, the company was working on establishing a third <b>paper</b> <b>machine,</b> PM3. Formal work commenced in 1972 and the corporate assembly approved the plans on 5 December 1977, giving the board freedom to proceed as was deemed favorable.|$|E
25|$|Kosmos {{collapsed}} in 1988 {{and was taken}} over by I. M. Skaugen. They aimed at divesting the diversified portfolio in the company in the aim of restructuring Kosmos as a pure shipping company, and placed Saugbrugsforeningen and other assets up for sale. Noegotiations for a sale to Norske Skog commenced on 12 January 1989. The company was valuated at NOK1.8 billion, although a purchaser also had to carry out the plans for a new <b>paper</b> <b>machine,</b> estimated to cost NOK3 billion. An important strategic consideration for Norske Skog was that it did not have any production of magazine paper, something the inclusion of Saugbrugsforeningen's production line would allow for. The take-over was approved by the purchaser on 9 November 1989 and effectuated on 1 December. The decision included approval of a new <b>paper</b> <b>machine.</b> Saugbrugsforeningen changed its name to Norske Skog Saugbrugs. Norske Skog paid NOK460 million in cash and took over NOK980 million in debt. The remaining NOK360 million was financed through issuing new shares. Kosmos thus received NOK820 million from their NOK100 million investment six years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{population}} of the region is engaged in agriculture; cereals, oilseeds, cotton, and pulses (legumes) are the major crops. There are multipurpose irrigation and hydroelectric-power projects, including the Pochampad, Bhaira Vanitippa, and Upper Pennai Aaru. Industries (located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool) produce cotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, <b>paper,</b> <b>machine</b> tools, and pharmaceuticals. Cottage industries are forest-based (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo products) and mineral-based (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite).|$|E

50|$|The modern {{paper mill}} uses {{large amounts of}} energy, water, and wood pulp in an {{efficient}} and complex series of processes, and control technology to produce {{a sheet of paper}} {{that can be used in}} diverse ways. Modern <b>paper</b> <b>machines</b> can be 500 ft in length, produce a sheet 400 in wide, and operate at speeds of more than 60 mph. The two main suppliers of <b>paper</b> <b>machines</b> are Metso and Voith.|$|R
5000|$|Paper {{drilling}} {{describes a}} technology for providing paper with round holes. For this purpose <b>paper</b> drilling <b>machines</b> are used. <b>Paper</b> drilling <b>machines</b> is the generic term for manual, motorised and fully automated paper drills. [...] Paper drilling system describes an automated <b>paper</b> drilling <b>machine</b> usually integrating several production steps into one continuous workflow. The phrase paper drill {{is used as}} well for <b>paper</b> drilling <b>machines</b> as for the tools used for paper drilling.|$|R
25|$|A modern {{paper mill}} {{is divided into}} several sections, roughly {{corresponding}} to the processes involved in making handmade paper. Pulp is refined and mixed in water with other additives to make a pulp slurry. The head-box of the <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> (Fourdrinier machine) distributes the slurry onto a moving continuous screen, water drains from the slurry (by gravity or under vacuum), the wet paper sheet goes through presses and dries, and finally rolls into large rolls. The outcome often weighs several tons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{much of the}} growing American paper {{industry}} was based along the Hudson River {{in and around the}} cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking. To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{transformation}} to more automated processes. The accounting systems {{were transferred to}} computers in 1970, followed by the paper machines in 1972 and 1973. These systems automatically measured the water content of the pulp at various stages and then adjusted the input factors as needed. PM1 was renovated and upgraded in a two-month period in 1975. This followed the standardization of newsprint to 48.8g/m2 as well as optimized the paper for offset printing. This and other refinements allowed {{the speed of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> to increase to 900 meters per minute, up from 430 at start-up.|$|E

25|$|Parallel these plans, Norske Skog {{considered}} the possibility of building a fourth <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> at Fiborgtangen. PM4 was planned to produce magazine paper, but was dependent on the thermal power station to receive sufficient power. Between the two investments were stipulated to between NOK7 and 8 billion. The investments were placed on hold of several factors. One was a general decline in the demand for paper, and general increasing costs in Norway, making Noske Skog prefer investments in their foreign mills. Another reason was that Norske Skog spent most of its capital purchasing foreign mills {{in an attempt to}} become a dominant worldwide manufacturer of newsprint and magazine paper.|$|E
25|$|Proposals for a mill {{came from}} the Norwegian Forest Owners Association, who wanted a major {{industrial}} facility to buy lumber in Central Norway. Originally named Nordenfjelske Treforedling AS, the company was incorporated on 1 March 1962. Forest owner associations held {{a majority of the}} shares and the mill was long considered part of the agricultural cooperatives. The first lumber was delivered on 1 March 1966 and the first <b>paper</b> <b>machine,</b> PM1, became operation on 15 September. PM2 started running on 14 November 1967. After buying Van Severen and Ranheim Papirfabrikk, the company took the name Norske Skog in 1972 and gradually expanded beyond their inaugural mill at Skogn.|$|E
25|$|Sectional {{electric}} drives were developed using control theory. Sectional {{electric drives}} are used on different sections {{of a machine}} where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making the paper sheet shrinks as it passes around steam heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> in 1919. One {{of the most important}} developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928.|$|E

25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} sulfite pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} <b>paper</b> <b>machine,</b> PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.|$|E
500|$|Today {{the local}} economy is driven by mainly the sawmill, lumber and paper industries. Kajaani paper mill, {{established}} in 1907 by Kajaani Oy (ex Kajaanin Puutavara Osakeyhtio), was the largest private employer in Kajaani. The factories are on the river bank, at Tihisenniemi. They built a new <b>paper</b> <b>machine</b> in the town in 1980 which was projected to have an annual output of 170,000 tons. Kajaani Oy was eventually acquired by Valmet in 1983, and the subsidiary Kajaani Electronics was formed. Kajaani Electronics was cited as [...] "one of the leading makers of special sensors and analyzers for the pulp and paper industry" [...] in 1990.|$|E

40|$|International audienceModern <b>paper</b> <b>machines</b> are {{equipped}} with heat recovery systems that transfer heat from the humid exhaust air of the <b>paper</b> <b>machine's</b> dryer section to different process streams. As a result of process changes, the heat recovery systems may operate in conditions far from the original design point, creating a significant potential for energy efficiency improvement. In this paper we demonstrate this potential with {{a case study of}} three operating <b>paper</b> <b>machines.</b> Both operational and structural improvement opportunities are examined. Since the existing retrofit methodologies for heat exchanger networks can not be applied to cases with condensing air, we use thermodynamic simulation models presented earlier to assess the effects of possible changes on the existing heat recovery systems. In order to reduce the required processing time of the simulation models, {{only a limited number of}} pre-screened retrofit designs are considered. The pre-screening is carried out on the basis of guidelines presented earlier. The analysis in the case mill revealed savings of 110 GWh/a in process heat with profitable investments. According to the follow-up study, the investments carried out have resulted in 12 % lower fuel use and 24 % lower CO emissions. The results imply that all operating <b>paper</b> <b>machines</b> should be similarly examined...|$|R

2500|$|Especially after 2005 China started buying large {{quantities}} of old newsprint from North America, particularly from the West Coast. In addition to causing a shortage in recycled paper, the exports caused a steep increase in the prices.
