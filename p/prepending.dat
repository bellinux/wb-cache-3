25|$|Traditionally, {{a married}} woman keeps her name unchanged, without {{adopting}} her husband's surname. A child would inherit his/her father's surname. This is still the norm in mainland China, though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, {{for a child to}} combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of greater China, such as Hong Kong and Macau, have also adopted the tradition of women changing their last name, or <b>prepending</b> their husbandâ€™s to her own.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, when a {{function}} in a derived class overrides {{a function}} in a base class, the function to call {{is determined by the}} type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called dynamic dispatch. Virtual member functions or methods allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using virtual function tables. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by <b>prepending</b> a fully qualified class name before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.|$|E
