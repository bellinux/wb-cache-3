This took place while the pro-statehood factions argued that the public education should be in English in order to facilitate a future admission. However, Villaronga supported the use of the established Spanish language. Understanding the implications that this had on the status of Puerto Rico, Fernós sided with Villaronga, noting that conserving the Spanish language {{played a key role in}} conserving the Puerto Rican cultural identity. His arrival also coincided with the proposal of Public Law 362, which amended the Jones Law to allow Puerto Ricans the right to elect their own governor. Fernós firmly supported these initiatives, believing that it was instrumental towards establishing a sovereign constitution in the near future and played a key role in its approval, turning Puerto Rico into the first territory to democratically elect a governor. While remaining Muñoz's main contact in Washington, Fernós also developed an interest in the process that created an Organic Act for Guam, a long-standing military possession with parallels to his own case. He <b>pushed</b> <b>status</b> language that would later be used as precedent when attending Puerto Rico's status. Between 1945 and 1950, Fernós modified his status proposal a total of 28 times. His efforts were supported by a parallel initiative undertaken by the DOI that tried to harmonize the public policy on territories with the anti-colonialism treaties that the United States reached with the United Nations.|$|R

2500|$|However, the {{approval}} of 2.5 millions for a referendum overseen by the US Department of Justice in the Obama administration's budget led to a pause in actions. Despite the development, the soberanistas felt that a Constituent Assembly should take place first, serving as the negotiation table between Puerto Rico, the US Department of Justice and Congress, with the viable options that emerged from this collaboration being voted for in a referendum. The onset of the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis <b>pushed</b> the <b>status</b> issue to a secondary role and after several months of inactivity, García Padilla revived the Joint Commission. Leading to the PPD's convention during the summer, the ideological schism resurfaced, with conservatives supporting a referendum as proposed by the Obama administration while the sovereigntists continued arguing for a Constituent Assembly. García Padilla pursued the first option and avoided defining the basics of the status option that was being proposed, instead proposing a [...] "permanent discussion" [...] on the matter.|$|R

40|$|In 19 th century Britain, the {{expanding}} middle classes and their aspirations to distinction through cultural capital {{led to a}} change in the perception of cultural products and their status. The century witnessed extraordinary cultural growth and diversification, especially in musical works and activities. In this period there was a gradual separation between music perceived to be 'art' and that seen as 'popular'. From the 1830 s, supported by new upwardly mobile consumers, art music evolved greater complexity, whilst new popular forms and styles, such as opera fantasies, ballads and blackface minstrelsy, proliferated in counterbalance. Social groupings began to distinguish themselves through the kind of cultural products they preferred and in England the upper middle classes moved into positions of cultural leadership, for example running the Philharmonic Society of London and initiating the Tonic Sol Fa movement. This evolving cultural landscape with its potential for distinctions of taste, power and class was imported to Australia by successive waves of immigrants. This paper will show how Newcastle, New South Wales, resisted the transposition of such a hierarchy and how popular music and entertainment became mainstream, <b>pushing</b> high <b>status</b> music and theatre to the fringes...|$|R

40|$|Education is characterised by marked and {{damaging}} schisms among its specialties, especially between classroom practitioners and academic {{members of the}} profession. While many or most commentators accept this rift as arising from real and {{significant differences between the}} groups, this article argues that the schism {{can be seen as the}} consequence of the reduced status of education as an institution. Mary Douglas’s cultural theory is utilised to explore ways in which low <b>status</b> <b>pushes</b> any institution, education included, towards the world-view of a cult or sect. The origins of aspects of contemporary educational thought that attract considerable criticism from ‘outside’ are traced to thought styles that are typical of a cult. The suggestion is made that continuing criticism that further erodes education’s status will not lead to desired change but instead entrench practitioners’ stance of resistance to demands that originate from outside the profession...|$|R

30|$|Our {{data suggest}} that {{professional}} roles and contexts influence the vision educators develop about STEM education. These results {{raise questions about the}} coherence of this innovation when people in the same school or district make sense of it in such different ways. Given the variety of institutionalized practices and contexts across schools, we are not convinced that a single worldwide definition of STEM education is critical. What we do see as essential is that those working in the same system, be it a department, school, or district, explore the common elements that are being attributed to STEM education and co-construct a vision that provides opportunities for all their students to attain STEM-related goals. Visioning, however, is insufficient, as what is envisioned and what is implemented are often very different. Educators must <b>push</b> on the <b>status</b> quo in areas of instruction, curriculum, learning opportunities, assessment, and school structures. Sensemaking as a collaborative, reflective, and iterative process can surface the differences and commonalities in people’s understandings to better ensure consistency in students’ learning opportunities across classrooms.|$|R

The ebbits [1] platform addressed those issues, taking advantages from the IoT vision and providing a middleware infrastructure for the integration of heterogeneous industrial devices and sensors, transforming them into web services and thus enabling their seamless integration into existing legacy systems. This paper will introduce the platform and its software architecture, describing features like semantic devices interoperability and entity virtualization. Furthermore, the paper will describe an innovative, IoT oriented, model driven development toolkit. This toolkit leverages on the semantic discovery service, allowing to dynamically selecting and locating available resources or devices, and provides a flexible instrument, including a graphical interface, that enables developers to compose mashup applications...|$|R
40|$|This ethnographic thesis investigates collegiate women’s rugby and the {{conflict}} between the ‘cultural ideology’ surrounding the sport and a current drive towards what I term a ‘professionalization’ of women’s rugby. The focus of the thesis is on the Bryn Mawr-Haverford women’s rugby team, a bi-college team comprised of women from both college campuses. 	One side on the debate on the future of women’s rugby in the United States advocates a more professionalized image of the sport. The organization, USA Rugby, for example, is <b>pushing</b> for varsity <b>status</b> for collegiate club teams. In this way, they hope to achieve a more ‘legitimate’ image that will help raise funding opportunities and increase competitiveness among US teams. However, rugby’s historical status as a marginalized sport and its strong ties to an alternative rugby culture result in a strong resistance to professionalization. On the Bryn Mawr-Haverford team, changes in recent years have led to what I describe as a more ‘heterosexual’ and ‘mainstream’ image. In the past, the team has also been perceived as less legitimate than other sports at Bryn Mawr and Haverford. Moving away from an aggressively alternative team identity associated with lesbianism, rowdiness, hard partying, and open sexuality has helped the team become more integrated into the athletic environment at Bryn Mawr. However, this professionalization of the team image has also been at the expense of traditional rugby culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{buildings}} sector consumes approximately 40 % {{of energy}} in the United States, and presents a major opportunity for reducing society's energy consumption and environmental impact. Given the potential downside impacts of climate change and resource depletion, it is imperative that the construction industry deliver buildings that meet owner requirements while using less energy and natural resources. In response to this challenge, the construction industry has adopted voluntary green building programs that provide guidelines for construction projects wishing to reduce their environmental impact. Green building programs also present the opportunity for those <b>pushing</b> beyond the <b>status</b> quo to receive increased recognition and market visibility; however, certification under these programs is not without an added cost. The added cost of certification varies by project, but building owners and builders must be able to justify this added cost through increased market recognition and sales and leasing prices. Given the relatively low recognition of a price premium for green certified residential properties by the real estate appraisal community and financial institutions, a need exists to demonstrate the added market recognition of these homes. Through the development of a hedonic regression pricing model this study isolates the effects of green building certification on housing sales prices, in order to prove the hypothesis that a significant increase in sales price is associated with green certified housing.

50|$|There are {{scenarios}} {{in which}} a Push Initiator may want to send identical messages to multiple recipients. Rather than submitting multiple identical push messages, one to each recipient, the Push Initiator may submit a single push message addressed to multiple recipients. This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations on multiple recipients. When the PPG returns the push-response message, after a push submission to multiple recipients, the response corresponds to the message, regardless {{of the number of}} recipients specified in the push submission (there is one response for each push submission). When a <b>Push</b> Initiator requests <b>status</b> (section 9.8) with multiple addresses specified, the PPG MUST reply with a single statusquery-response (section 9.9) containing the individual statuses. The same is true when only a push-id is specified (no address specified) in the query for status of a multiple recipient message. Result notifications (section 9.6) MUST be sent by the PPG for each individual recipient, if result notification is requested by the Push Initiator during the submission of a message to multiple recipients. In cases where a message is sent to multiple recipients and later a cancel is requested by the initiator, the PPG MAY send back individual responses related to each of the multiple recipients or it MAY send responses related to many or all of the recipients. Support of multiple addresses is OPTIONAL in a PPG.|$|R
40|$|Honors {{colleges have}} been an {{increasing}} development in higher education across the United States, and while investigations have been made into the place and functions of these programs, it is equally important to determine what the connection is between the larger university environment {{and the development of}} honors colleges. Reviewing archival data for a historical-comparative study of two regional, public universities in Texas, this paper seeks to illuminate the decisions which led to developing honors programs which later transitioned into honors colleges. Investigations of Sam Houston State University and the University of Texas San ? Antonio?s archival records found similar efforts by both universities to raise the prestige of the institutions through the creation of full-fledged honors programs. These programs were believed to increase the academic profile of the student body, boost faculty prestige, and increase research output. These programs transitioned to honors colleges in response to both universities? <b>pushes</b> towards research <b>status,</b> but this change was in name only and did not result in any curricular or functional changes to the programs in place. While the economic function of the honors programs and colleges exhibit an inherent logic in the universities decisions, a content analysis of the documentation showed inequalities in the types of students enrolled in the honors programs and colleges. This indicates that while the meritocratic principles of both the parent and honors institutions should allow deserving individuals entrance into an elite educational program, in practice it serves to exacerbate the gap that already exists in education between minority students and their white counterparts...|$|R
40|$|In general, what {{we think}} of as "diversity work" in {{undergraduate}} engineering education focuses in the following ways: more on the overlooked assets of minority groups than on the acts of overlooking, more on the experiences of marginalized groups than on the mechanisms of marginalization by dominant groups, more on supporting and increasing minority student retention than on critiquing and remediating the systems which lead minority students to leave engineering. This dissertation presents a series of arguments which <b>push</b> beyond a <b>status</b> quo understanding of diversity in engineering education. The first approach the dissertation takes up is to problematize educational facts around failure by interrogating their roots in interactions and cultural norms in an engineering classroom. In another argument, the dissertation places the engineering classroom cultural norms of competition, whiteness, and masculinity in a critical historical context of the discipline at large. Finally, I demonstrate how engaging students in a critique of marginalizing educational culture can be an important source of agency. In addition to applying and demonstrating the value of specific novel approaches in engineering education, the dissertation contributes to the research community by discussing the respective affordances between these and other possible scholarly approaches to culture and marginalization in education. I also suggest how a consideration of the taken-for-granted culture of engineering education can be an important tool for instructors seeking to gain insight into persistent educational problems. In addition, this dissertation makes implications for diversity support practice, envisioning new forms of support programming rooted in intersectionality and critical praxis...|$|R
40|$|We, as librarians, are {{adept at}} {{challenging}} academics, students and administrators about {{the crucial role}} of information literacy in higher education and lifelong learning. Consequently, the push for strategic partnerships with academics is frequently in the foreground of our thinking. Concomitantly, the <b>push</b> for academic <b>status</b> for librarians is raised occasionally, particularly as a pay and equity issue. Yet, our purposes may appear somewhat misguided or rhetorical when contrasted to the nominal prerequisites required for professional practice, especially when {{compared with those of}} academics. The issues of information literacy and knowledge production within a knowledge economy compound such debate. This paper argues that ‘credential creep’ is catching up with librarians in the university sector. In order to be regarded as integral to academic endeavour, those of us who ‘teach’ information literacy may need to match the qualifications normally required by academics. Consonant with this proposal is the Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework: Principles, Standards and Practice (Bundy, 2004) of the Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL) and the Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL). The Framework mirrors many of the desired outcomes of a doctoral degree, a degree possessed by approximately one per cent of Australian librarians but, in comparison, by more than fi fty-four per cent of Australian academics. This paper challenges—not academics—but librarians, to embrace the notion of undertaking doctoral study to enhance our professional (or amateur) practice and our information literacy. The recommendation is derived in essence from my study on doctoral research and information literacy (Macauley, 2001). It also incorporates the current discourse on these issues and uses personal narrative to articulate the findings. It seeks also to explore those tensions and contradictions commensurate with practising what we preach. <br /...|$|R
