40|$|SUMMARY. Existing laws in Italy propose olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomaces</b> (OMP), {{produced}} by the two phase system, as a soil amendant. The direct supply of such a raw material poses sorne problems due to the rainy season and its phytotoxicity. The bioremediation of olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomaces</b> can be an useful and economic technology to overcome those backdowns. Composting has been performed in a forced aerated static pile, mixing OMP with chopped wheat straw. During the process moisture content, pH, EC, organic carbon, nitro gen and phytotoxicity were determined. The thermophilic phase lasted 60 days. The phytotoxicity disappeared {{at the end of}} the thermophilic phase. The final product has been examined to determine its physical, chemical and biological characteristics. At the end of the process a C/N = 31 was determined. This high value depends on the presence ofthe grinded stones, hardly to be microbiologically degraded.

50|$|Olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomace</b> is a {{by-product}} from {{the olive oil}} mill extraction process. Usually it is used as fuel in a cogeneration system or as organic fertiliser after a composting operation.|$|R
5000|$|A later {{innovation}} was the toothed roller-mill. These mills use toothed cylinders made {{of stone}} or metal to grind the apples into <b>pomace.</b> Such <b>mills</b> are portable, and produce a pomace that is finer {{than that of the}} large horse-mills. It was first introduced to England in 1689 by agriculturalist John Worlidge, who adapted it from the sugar-cane crushers used in the West Indies. Yet as of the beginning of the 19th-century, such mills could not handle the same quantity in bulk as the horse-driven mills.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{represents}} an innovative attempt {{to give a}} solution to the double necessity of seeking for new energy sources, and avoiding the disposal of the most abundant wastes from agricultural and food activities in the Apulia region in order to preserve the environment. In particular olive <b>pomaces,</b> olive <b>mill</b> wastewaters and whey milk have a high organic content (100 g/l, 60 g/l and 60 g/l respectively), they are acid (pH between 3, 5 - 5, 5), total solid percentage concentrations of 30 %, < 5 % and 5 % respectively. These chemical characteristics make these wastes potential sources of contamination for the land and aquifers, but also an interesting feedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion process. This work includes two experimental campaigns, both conducted at Asja Ambiente's research centre in Ceglie Messapica (Italy). In the first one, different waste-mixtures, obtained from olive <b>pomace,</b> olive <b>mill</b> wastewaters and whey milk, were feeded in a 45 liters anaerobic reactor in order to evaluate their biogas yields. The best feed mixture was the combination of olive pomace at 25 % w/w concentration with whey milk, with a daily biogas production of about 40 liters, approximately 0, 75 liters of biogas per liter of reactor. The second experimental campaign was carried out using the above combination of whey milk and olive pomace has the main feed mixture in a anaerobic pilot plant of 1. 8 m 3 of volume. The duration of campaign was of 75 days and, after a period of acclimatization of the biomass to the substrates charged in the reactor, lead to a stable daily biogas production of about 2000 liters (approximately 1, 1 liter of biogas per liter of reactor), with a methane concentration in the range 65 - 70 % w/...|$|R
40|$|Global waste {{production}} has raised recently due to numerous agricultural and industrial activities. Among other actions devoted to waste reduction, revaluation {{seems to be}} the most advantageous one from an environmental and economic point of view. In the olive oil sector, by-product management (namely olive <b>pomace,</b> olive <b>mill</b> wastewater, and sludge residue) poses serious problems for companies, with the energy use of these wastes being a feasible option to solve these problems. Due to their high moisture content, drying constitutes the main stage for a possible bio-fuel conversion. This research work deals with the analysis of drying for the three main wastes from olive oil by using a prototype dryer. This equipment has different working regimes depending on the kind of convection (natural or forced for passive and active mode, respectively), the incidence of solar radiation on the product (indirect or mixed type) and the use of an additional system for energy supply (hybrid type). From the results, it could be said that all the wastes were suitable for solar drying. However, drying conditions were different for each case. Olive <b>pomace</b> and olive <b>mill</b> wastewater showed promising results for solar drying application in mixed active mode. Concerning sludge residue, its special physical structure could employ the use of turners for drying, in order to improve heat transfer to the product. Moreover, hybrid active mode enabled a considerable reduction in drying time, being an aspect to take into account for its use during low solar radiation or at night time...|$|R
40|$|Chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa) are {{nowadays}} {{believed to}} exhibit potential cardioprotective and antidiabetic effects principally {{due to their}} high content in bioactive phenolic compounds. The stability of the phenolic compounds was studied during different stages of a juice production line and a method for the valorization of pomace was evaluated. Samples were taken from a commercial juice production plant, extracted and analyzed for phenolic constituents and antioxidant potential. Prototypes of functional food ingredients were produced from the <b>pomace</b> by wet <b>milling</b> and micro-milling. Alongside juice processing, the contents of phenolic berry constituents did not vary {{to a great extent}} and the overall antioxidant activity increased by about 34 %. A high quality juice and a by-product still rich in polyphenols resulted from the process. The phenolic compounds content and the overall antioxidant activity remained stable when milling and micro-milling the <b>pomace.</b> During coarse <b>milling,</b> extractability of total phenolic compounds increased significantly (40 % to 50 %). Nanosized materials with averaged particle sizes (x 50, 0) of about 90 nm were obtained by micro-milling. These materials showed significantly enhanced extractability of total phenolic compounds (25 %) and total phenolic acid (30 %), as well as antioxidant activity (35 %), with unchanged contents of total procyanidins and anthocyanins contents...|$|R
40|$|New immunosensors {{working in}} organic solvent {{mixtures}} (OPIEs) {{for the analysis}} of traces of different pesticides (triazinic, organophosphates and chlorurates) present in hydrophobic matrices such as olive oil were developed and tested. A Clark electrode was used as transducer and peroxidase enzyme as marker. The competitive process took place in a chloroform–hexane 50 % (V/V) mixture, while the subsequent enzymatic final measurement was performed in decane and using tert-butylhydroperoxide as substrate of the enzymatic reaction. A linear response of between about 10 nM and 5. 0 μM was usually obtained in the presence of olive oil. Recovery tests were carried out in commercial or artisanal extra virgin olive oil. Traces of pesticides were also checked in the oily matrix, in <b>pomace</b> and <b>mill</b> wastewaters from an industrial oil mill. Immunosensors show good selectivity and satisfactory precision and recovery tests performed in olive oil gave excellent results...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{management}} has important effects on soil properties, runoff, soil losses and soil quality. Traditional olive grove (OG) management {{is based on}} reduced tree density, canopy size shaped by pruning and weed control by ploughing. In addition, {{over the last several}} decades, herbicide use has been introduced into conventional OG management. These management strategies cause the soil surface to be almost bare and subsequently high erosion rates take place. To avoid these high erosion rates several soil management strategies can be applied. In this study, three strategies were assessed in OG with conventional tillage in three plots of 1. ha each. Soil properties were measured and soil erosion rates were estimated by means of the RUSLE model. One plot was managed with no amendments (control), and the other two were treated with olive leaves mulch and oil <b>mill</b> <b>pomace</b> applied yearly from 2003 until 2013. The control plot experienced the greatest soil loss while the use of olive leaves as mulch and olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomace</b> as an amendment resulted in a soil loss reduction of 89. 4 % and 65. 4 % respectively (assuming a 5 % slope). In addition, the chemical and physical soil properties were improved with the amendments. This combined effect will created a higher quality soil over the long term that it is more resilient to erosion and can provide better ecosystem services, as its functions are improved. </p...|$|R
40|$|Olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomace</b> (OMP) {{produced}} by low water consuming mill technologies (LWCT) were composted with chopped wheat straw in a forced aerated static pile. During the process temperature, oxygen consumption, moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon, total extractable carbon, humic and fulvic acids, nitrogen, C/N, phenols, lipids and lignin were determined. Urease and casein-hydrolysing protease activities were also assayed. The humification was assayed following {{the degree of}} humification, the humification rate and the humification index which respectively reached the values of 0. 12, 89 % and 15 % during the maturation phase. The analyses of final product revealed the presence of considerable amounts of mineral nutrients and stabilized organic matter and absence of harmful levels of heavy metals.

40|$|Different {{mixtures}} of olive <b>pomace</b> (OP), olive <b>mill</b> wastewater (OMWW) and olive pruning residues (OPR) were aerobically co-composted under natural conditions. Compost temperature showed a {{sharp increase in}} the first 40 - 60 days, followed by a stabilization at 60 °C and a decline after 150 days, whereas compost water content ranged from 50 - 55 % to 25 - 30 %. Total and selec-tive microbial counts were followed throughout the experiment by means of innovative (IMT) and conventional (CMT) microbiological techniques. Pseudomonas spp., anaerobic bacteria, actino-mycetes, and fungi reached levels of 8, 7, 5 and 6 log CFU g– 1 compost, respectively, with a slight depression after 30 - 80 days. Total and fecal coli- forms strongly decreased during the compost-ing process. The use of IMT allowed to detect a higher and more stable growth of microorgan-isms if compared to CMT. IMT was demonstrated to be an appropriate and reliable method for mo- nitoring the microbial pools during the co-com- posting process...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{an index}} for the {{evaluation}} of compost maturity based on the evolution of molecular weights of humic acids (HA) during composting. The evolution of HA molecular weight was followed during the composting of both olive mill wastewater (OMW) and olive <b>mill</b> <b>pomace</b> (OMP). The wastes were composted in forced aeration static piles. Samples of the compost were collected at different times during composting. The elution profiles of HA obtained by gel filtration (Sephadex G- 150) showed the disappearance of fractions with molecular weights ≤ 50 KDa and the contemporary increase of fraction with molecular weights ≥ 102 KDa. In this range, two fractions can be separated: the first one (A 1) with molecular weights greater than 102 KDa and below 2 102 KDa, and the second one (A 2) with molecular weight greater than 2 102 KDa. During composting, the ratio A 2 /A 1 tends to reach a constant value which indicates the evolution toward the polymerization of HA. The ratio A 2 /A 1 was named HAEI (Humic Acid Evolution Index). It varies with the material composted and the composting process and represents the maximum possible degree of HA polymerization, A comparison between HAEI and the usually used maturity indexes is also presented.

40|$|Olive oil {{and dairy}} {{production}} {{are among the}} most important and widespread agro-food activities in southern Italy and particularly in the Puglia region. According to a territorial survey of the Puglia region, the related wastes, olive <b>pomace</b> (OP), olive <b>mill</b> wastewater (OMWW) and whey milk are very abundant (741, 000 tons/year) and represent potential sources of contamination for the land and aquifers; however, these wastes also represent an interesting feedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion. OP,OMWWand wheymilk are high in organic content (100 g/l, 65 g/l and 60 g/l, respectively), are acidic (with pH values between 3. 5 and 5. 5), and have high total solid percentage concentrations (30 % (w/w), < 5 % (w/w) and 5 % (w/w), respectively). In this study, the results of two experimental campaigns, both conducted at Asja Ambiente's research center in Ceglie Messapica (Italy) are reported. In the first campaign, different waste mixtures obtained from OP, OMWW and whey milk were fed into a 45 -L anaerobic reactor to evaluate their biogas yields. In the second campaign, a combination of whey milk and OP was fed into an anaerobic pilot plant with a volume of 1. 6 m 3. In the case of feed composed of 25 % (w/w) OP and 75 % (w/w) whey, a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction of 64 % and a biogas production of approximately 1. 3 L/L day were obtained, which correspond to 0. 013 Lbiogas/gTSin. This performance is potentially able to cover 0. 015 % of Puglia's yearly total demand for energy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Known {{for their}} {{physiological}} effects of stimulating gastro-intestinal movement, lowering the cholesterol level and preventing cardiovascular diseases, dietary fibers {{have been applied}} to various types of food products in recent years. This study employs the pomace (including husk) of squeezed orange (Liu-cheng) as the raw material for making high-fiber noodles of delightful taste and good texture. The experiment processes the orange pomace samples through four different approaches (direct freeze-drying, direct oven-drying, post-washing freeze-drying, post-washing oven-drying). The dried orange <b>pomaces</b> are <b>milled</b> and screened into samples of three different particle diameters (< 125 μm, 104 - 149 μm, 149 - 250 μm) to replace some of the flour added to make fresh and dry noodles. The physicochemical and texture properties of these noodles {{as well as their}} texture profile, tensile strength, flex strength, are analyzed. Sensory evaluation is also conducted to compare these noodles with those sold in the market. The results of the orange pomace analysis indicate that the total dietary fiber contents of washed and unwashed orange pomaces are 64. 41 % and 79. 91 %, respectively. The contents of pectin are 5 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. The water-holding capacity of unwashed orange pomaces is less than that of washed orange pomaces. The impact of unwashed orange pomaces on the formation of gluten during noodle making is less significant. The results of noodle quality analysis show that the impacts of orange pomaces, dried through freeze-drying and oven-drying, on the quality of fresh noodles are not significantly different. Quality analysis of fresh noodles made of unwashed orange pomaces (< 125 μm) is closer to that of the controled samples. Addition of orange pomaces will affect the quality of fresh and dry noodles, increase the adhesiveness and decrease the springiness, gumminess, chewiness and tensile strength of the noodles. Addition of unwashed pomace (< 125 μm) to dry noodles enhances the flex distance of the noodles so they won't break easily. The result of sensory evaluation of boiled fresh noodles, in which oven-dried unwashed orange pomaces (< 125 μm) replace 15 % of the flour and gluten replace 5 % of the flour, showed that the color, odor, and overall acceptance of the noodles are within the acceptable range, except that the springiness of the noodles is slightly lower than that of the controled samples. 中 文 摘 要 膳食纖維(dietary fiber) 有促進腸胃蠕動、降低血膽固醇、預防心血管疾病等生理功效，近年來被努力開發運用於各類食品。本研究以柳橙榨汁後剩餘之果渣(含皮) 為原料，製作高纖、風味特殊且具良好口感的麵條。實驗以四種方式(直接冷凍乾燥、直接烘箱乾燥、漂洗後冷凍乾燥、漂洗後烘箱乾燥) 處理果渣。將果渣粉碎過篩，取得三種粒徑(< 125 μm、 104 - 149 μm、 149 - 250 μm) 樣品。以果渣取代部分麵粉添加於新鮮麵條與乾麵條，探討其理化性質及質地剖面分析、抗拉強度、抗彎曲度，並做官能品評。 果渣分析結果顯示，無漂洗果渣和有漂洗果渣的總膳食纖維含量 分別為 64. 41 %、 79. 91 %，其中果膠含量分別約有 5. 2 %、 1. 8 %。無漂 洗果渣的保水力顯著小於有漂洗果渣。無漂洗果渣對麵條製作過程之 麵筋形成的影響較小。 以果渣取代 15 %麵粉、小麥麵筋蛋白取代 5 %麵粉並添加水量至 40 %的麵條品質分析結果顯示，凍乾或烘乾處理之果渣對新鮮麵條的品質影響無顯著差異。無漂洗果渣(< 125 μm) 所製作的新鮮麵條，品質分析結果較接近標準品(無添加果渣的白麵條) 。添加果渣會影響新鮮麵條與乾麵條的品質，使麵條附著度增加，彈性度、膠性度、咀嚼度、抗拉強度變小。無漂洗果渣(< 125 μm) 的添加，使乾麵條的抗彎曲長度增加，較不易斷裂。 由官能品評的結果得知，以烘乾無漂洗果渣(< 125 μm) 取代 15 % 麵粉、小麥麵筋蛋白取代 5 %麵粉並添加水量至 40 %，所製成之新鮮果渣麵條烹煮後，除彈性度較標準品略小，色澤、風味、整體接受性等項目都在可接受的程度。目 錄 中文摘要………………………………………………………… [...] 	 1
