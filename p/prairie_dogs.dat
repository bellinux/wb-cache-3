5|$|Species can be arboreal, fossorial (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils and capybaras. Other {{animals such as}} rabbits, hares, and pikas, whose incisors also grow continually, {{were once}} {{included}} with them, but are now considered {{to be in a}} separate order, the Lagomorpha. Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups, sharing a most recent common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Infanticide {{exists in}} {{numerous}} rodent species {{and may be}} practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, {{in the case of}} males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Plains, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is a {{keystone}} species. Studies comparing species abundances {{in areas}} of colonization against areas with no <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonization show clear evidence that the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> does {{have a significant impact}} on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog’s</b> extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, striped skunk and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> does this. In conclusion, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.|$|R
25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|R

5|$|When {{competing}} for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (Lynx rufus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, {{as has been}} recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species {{is known to be}} dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> from ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.|$|E
25|$|Up to 90% of the black-footed ferret's diet is {{composed}} of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs.</b> The diet of the black-footed ferret varies depending on geographic location. In western Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, black-footed ferrets historically associated with white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> and were forced to find alternate prey when white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> entered their four-month hibernation cycle. In Wyoming, alternate prey items consumed during white-tailed prairie dog hibernation included voles (Microtus spp.) and mice (Peromyscus spp. and Mus spp.) found near streams. In South Dakota, black-footed ferrets associate with black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs.</b> Because black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> do not hibernate, little seasonal change in black-footed ferret diet is necessary.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2003, due to {{cross-contamination}} at a Madison, Wisconsin-area pet swap from an unquarantined Gambian {{pouched rat}} imported from Ghana, several <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> in captivity acquired monkeypox, and subsequently a few humans were also infected.

25|$|Alarm {{response}} behavior varies {{according to}} the type of predator announced. If the alarm indicates a hawk diving toward the colony, all the <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> in its flight path dive into their holes, while those outside the flight path stand and watch.

For coyotes, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> move to the entrance of a burrow and stand outside the entrance, observing the coyote, while those <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> that were inside the burrows will come out to stand and watch as well. For domestic dogs, the response is to observe, standing in place where they were when the alarm was sounded, again with the underground <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> emerging to watch.|$|E
25|$|For black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> the {{resident}} male {{of the family}} group fathers all the offspring.

The subject of cooperative breeding in <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> has been debated among biologists. Some argue <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> will defend and feed young that are not theirs, and it seems young will sleep in a nursery chamber with other mothers; since most nursing occurs at night, this may be a case of communal nursing.

25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators.

According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how big it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> have calls for things that are not predators to them.
