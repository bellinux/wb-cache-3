5|$|The list below {{gives the}} <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> acting as editor. In some cases, {{such as at}} the start of Cele Goldsmith's stint, the {{official}} editor was not the same person; details are given above.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{exploitation}} of a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> mentally disabled; being involved in, furthering, benefiting from, or living from {{the earnings of}} the sexual {{exploitation of}} a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> mentally disabled; or promoting sex tours with <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> mentally disabled (sec. 23) ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{a citizen}} does not lose {{citizenship}} by reason only of acquiring the citizenship of another country (Art 16) and <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> citizens {{of other countries}} may acquire Kenyan citizenship (Art 15(4)).|$|R

50|$|Narrative {{communication}} {{is a kind}} of a detached communication, where the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> speaking is more involved in what he/she says rather than in the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> he/she <b>is</b> saying it to.|$|R
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
50|$|Gay bashing and gay {{bullying}} is {{verbal or}} physical abuse against a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{perceived by the}} aggressor to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, including <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually heterosexual or of non-specific or unknown sexual orientation.|$|R

5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5000|$|Boghossian {{has stated}} {{that he wants to}} be [...] "the type of <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> willing to revise his beliefs, maybe I want to be the type of <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> inquisitive, trustful of reason and treats people well." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that she knew. Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death. Julie also found out, so he panicked, and shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed <b>person,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
50|$|Surtaxes can {{be imposed}} on other taxes. They are usually imposed {{on the grounds of}} moral justification; they only affect <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> already paying taxes rather than {{extending}} taxation to new areas or <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not previously being taxed.|$|R
5000|$|The District Court {{stayed the}} {{enforcement}} of its decision during appeal after the Department of Defense presented arguments [...] "based on new evidence from several sources indicating that hostile intelligence agencies target <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> especially vulnerable, and that among others, <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> homosexuals are considered vulnerable by these agencies." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{erroneous}} {{to state}} [...] "all persons are not married" [...] (i.e. [...] "there exists no <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> married") {{when it is}} meant that [...] "not all persons are married" [...] (i.e. [...] "there exists a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not married"): ...|$|R
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> neither {{a party to the}} proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

25|$|According to Shahnameh ancient Persian book, {{the hero}} Rostam {{was the first}} <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> born with this method and term رستمينه (rostamineh) is corresponded to Caesarean. Also, Hindu mythical monkey god Hanuman was born through a similar {{procedure}} on his mother Anjani.|$|E
50|$|Skell, as a stereotypical or archetypal designation, {{refers to}} a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> homeless, vagrant or derelict. It {{is often used to}} connote such a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> habitually engaged in small-time {{criminal}} activity, especially by one working as a con artist or panhandler.|$|R
