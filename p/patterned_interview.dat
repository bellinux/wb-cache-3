This article analyzes the role of national judges in the Andean Community, a regional legal system whose judicial institution - the Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ) - was modeled directly on its European predecessor. Our analysis is based on an original coding of every publically available national court referral to the ATJ from 1987 to 2007 and interviews with over forty participants in the Andean legal system. We find that the relationship between the ATJ and national judges differs significantly from the relationship between the ECJ and its domestic judicial colleagues. As in Europe, references from national judges account {{for the vast majority of}} cases on the ATJ 2 ̆ 7 s docket. But unlike in Europe, {{national courts}} are mostly passive intermediaries.

40|$|Suburban multifamily {{housing is}} an often {{overlooked}} housing typology {{that is the}} fasted growing housing market {{in the country and}} holds strong potential for achieving smart growth goals in suburbia. This housing type is ubiquitous throughout all regions in the nation, is a widespread example of density in suburbia, and is typically located next to commercial uses. The proximity between suburban multifamily housing and commercial uses creates the potential for nodes of concentrated activity, mixed use, and the possibility of substantial non-auto transport in suburbia. While this potential exists, the design of this housing type often follows an enclaved pattern of development, negating any synergy, minimizing the possibility of non-auto transport, and denying any potential for sustainable development. Through case studies of suburban multifamily development in Oregon, Arizona, Florida, and Massachusetts, this report looks at the specific ways in which regulation, typical development practice, and design culture have shaped the current pattern of suburban multifamily development.

This study asks whether the microbrewery and craft distillery industry is growing within New York City, and whether there is a cluster forming which may provoke New York City to activate local legislative initiatives. The purpose of this thesis is threefold: first, to examine industry trends in NYC and the metro-area since the reemergence of microbreweries in the 1990 s to present day, and the reappearance of craft distilleries in 2004 to present day; second, to analyze the effect of City and State policy on breweries/distilleries in NYC; and to further the academic conversation about economic localism and urban agglomeration economies in terms of production and distribution within the city boundaries. This thesis includes spatial analysis which identifies the significance of spatial <b>patterns,</b> <b>interviews</b> of microbrewery and craft distillery owners, and descriptive economic analysis (percent change). The interviews of the microbrewery and craft distillery owners add a qualitative layer to the data and add to the identification of factors and perceptions of legislative intervention.

The paper represents an attempt to quantitatively estimate the impact of industry restructuring of the ESI, on regional economic characteristics such as: employment; income generation; and the aggregate consumer purchasing power. Three kinds of primary information were explored. The former State Electricity Commission's (SEC) and its successors' financial statements and personnel data were used to identify: how the ESI injected money into the regional economy both prior to and during the reform: and how the reform affected employment in the region.

Yet little {{has been written about}} the impact of the spirituality of the teaching ministry on Lutheran teachers themselves. Reliable research is still needed on a group of Lutheran teachers 20 - 25 years after their professional formation. How many are still teaching, or have left teaching, and WHY? What is their continuing understanding of and commitment to the spiritual principles of their own teaching ministry? The 1972 graduates of Concordia Teachers College, Nebraska were asked to explore their expectations, motives, perceptions, and experiences. All who could be located received the survey instrument. Respondents became the self-selected sample to be analyzed. The survey focused on their professional formation, continuing career commitment, and their understanding of the spirituality of the teaching ministry. When all returned surveys were analyzed for thematic <b>patterns,</b> <b>interviews</b> were conducted on the basis of significant themes which emerged in the survey evidence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{variation}} {{in time to}} listing and rates of listing for transplantation between renal units in the UK. While research has mainly focused on healthcare organization, {{little is known about}} patient perspectives of entry onto the transplant waiting list. This qualitative study aimed to explore patients' views and experiences of kidney transplant listing. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients aged under 75, who were on dialysis and on the transplant waiting list, not on the waiting list, undergoing assessment for listing or who had received a transplant. Patients were recruited from a purposive sample of nine UK renal units, which included transplanting and non-transplanting units and units with high and low wait-listing <b>patterns.</b> <b>Interviews</b> were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (5 - 7 per renal unit) were interviewed. Patients reported that they had received little information about the listing process. Some patients did not know if they were listed or had found they were not listed when they had thought they were on the list. Others expressed distress when they felt they had been excluded from potential listing based on age and/or comorbidity and felt the process was unfair. Many patients were not aware of pre-emptive transplantation and believed they had to be on dialysis before being able to be listed. There was some indication that pre-emptive transplantation was discussed more often in transplant than non-transplant units. Lastly, some patients were reluctant to consider family members as potential donors as they reported they would feel 'guilty' if the donor suffered subsequent negative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a need to review current practice to further understand individual and organizational reasons for the renal unit variation identified in patient understanding of transplant listing. The communication of information warrants attention to ensure patients are fully informed about the listing process and opportunity for pre-emptive transplantation {{in a way that is}} meaningful and understandable to them...|$|R

A total of 67 men between 64 and 89 years of age were visited in their homes on two occasions with 1 - 2 weeks in between. The participants were diagnosed with one of the three diseases Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or stroke. A food survey, with repeated 24 -h recall, was used to assess food intake and meal <b>patterns.</b> <b>Interviews</b> with 18 participants were conducted with open-ended questions. The interviews were further analysed with a thematic framework approach. The findings showed that eating events were distributed over a 24 -h period. Further, co-living men had a significantly larger number of eating events over the day (p= 0. 001). No differences in daily energy intake were observed between co-living and single-living men. Co-living men’s hot eating events were compared with those of single-living men more often cooked from fresh ingredients (p= 0. 001), including a greater mix of vegetables/roots (p= 0. 003). Thematic analysis revealed three different approaches to food-related activities(FRA), namely ‘Cooking as a pleasure’, describing joy in cooking; ‘Cooking as a need’, indicating no habits or skills in cooking; and ‘Food is served’, that is, being served meals by a partner. The men's approaches to FRA were affected in particular by gender-related roles, but also by changed life circumstances, activity limitations, personal interests, and a wish to maintain continuity and independence. Further adaptive strategies were used among the men in attempts to maintain continuity and independence in FRA. In conclusion, single-living older men, especially those with activity limitations, were identified as being a vulnerable group from a nutritional perspective. Further, health care efforts in promoting FRA should preferably be individualised with respect to the older man’s approach to these activities...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the regional {{implications of the}} microeconomic reform of the electricity generation industry {{in the state of}} Victoria. 93 per cent of the electricity generation is located in a small open region of La Trobe Valley, in which this sector is a major industry base. The ultimate goal of the reform has been to transform the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the natural monopoly responsible for coal mining, electricity generation, transmission and distribution, into a privatised competitive industry. As a result, even though the state as a whole is enjoying some benefits of this measure, the main power supplying area of the State - the La Trobe Valley Region appears to be negatively affected. A few thousand people have been retrenched and considerable migration of population has taken place from the region to other areas of Victoria and interstate. General equilibrium approach to regional economics and the MONASH Model instrumentality are used to evaluate the overall impact of the microeconomic reform on the regional economy in terms of the reduction of local employment and purchasing power. A combination of primary and secondary information is used to implement the model. The multi-regional version of the Monash model and its data are used as an environment for a regional model. The model of the region is based on a comprehensive survey of the La Trobe Valley's economy. Three kinds of primary information were explored. The State Electricity Commission and its successors financial statements and personnel data were used to identify how the industry injected money into the regional economy both prior to and during the reform, and how the reform affected employment in the region. An income and expenditure survey of the current employees was undertaken as well as of a sample of voluntary departure package recipients still residing in the region.

Three types of attitudes of the managers interviewed were distinguished: 1. 	Informants actively oriented toward the interview, tending to be interviewed in isolation and eliminating or limiting the presence of third persons, adjusting themselves to the natural length of the interview or even trying to prolong it; characteristic for these informants was a semi-official spacial <b>pattern</b> of the <b>interview</b> (e. g. at a coffee table); % of all informants belonged to this type. 2. 	Informants actively oriented toward the interview, but reluctant to find an isolated place for interviewing, encouraging or inviting third persons to be present or to participate in the interview; they tended to cut down the <b>interview,</b> official special <b>pattern</b> ("from behind the desk”) being a characteristic feature of interview situation (1 / 5 of all informants). 3.
