40|$|Efficiency, {{the ratio}} of work {{generated}} to the total metabolic energy cost, has been suggested {{to be a key}} determinant of endurance cycling performance. The purpose of this brief review is to evaluate the influence of gross efficiency on <b>cycling</b> <b>power</b> output and to consider whether or not gross efficiency can be modified. In a re-analysis of data from five separate studies, variation in gross efficiency explained ~ 30 % of the variation in <b>power</b> output during <b>cycling</b> time-trials. Whilst other variables, notably VO 2 max and lactate threshold, have been shown to explain more of the variance in <b>cycling</b> <b>power</b> output, these results confirm the important influence of gross efficiency. Case study, cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention research designs have all been used to demonstrate that exercise training can enhance gross efficiency. Whilst improvements have been seen {{with a wide range of}} training types (endurance, strength, altitude), it would appear that high intensity training is the most potent stimulus for changes in gross efficiency. In addition to physiological adaptations, gross efficiency might also be improved through biomechanical adaptations. However, ‘intuitive’ technique and equipment adjustments may not always be effective. For example, whilst ‘pedalling in circles’ allows pedalling to become mechanically more effective, this technique does not result in short term improvements in gross efficiency. <br /...|$|R

50|$|A {{watchdog}} timer may initiate any of {{several types of}} corrective action, including maskable interrupt, non-maskable interrupt, processor reset, fail-safe state activation, <b>power</b> <b>cycling,</b> or combinations of these. Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a processor reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a processor reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses.|$|E

50|$|A hang may be {{temporary}} if {{caused by a}} condition that resolves itself, such as slow hardware, {{or it may be}} permanent and require manual intervention, {{as in the case of}} a hardware or software logic error.

In more severe hangs affecting the whole system, the only solution might be to reboot the machine, usually by <b>power</b> <b>cycling</b> with an on/off or reset button.|$|E
