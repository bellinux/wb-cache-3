The war, which lasted two years (1142-1144), was marked by the occupation of Champagne by the royal army and the capture of Vitry-le-François, where many persons perished in the deliberate burning of the church by Louis. The scholastic Pierre Abélard, famous for his love affair with and subsequent marriage to his student Héloïse, sought asylum in Champagne during Theobald II's reign. Abelard died at Cluny Abbey in Burgundy, a monastery supported by the Thebaudians for many centuries.|$|R

40|$|Our {{theory of}} meter, Bracketed Grid Theory, begins from the {{observation}} that in all metrical traditions, poets {{must be able to}} count the number of syllables in the line. We propose a set of rules by which counting is undertaken; these rules <b>permit</b> <b>counting</b> no higher than three, and build a bracketed grid as their output. This is the basis of metricality and is common to metrical traditions which on the surface are very different, such as the syllabo-tonic meters of English verse and the syllable-counting meters of French and early modern Polish verse. As no previous theory of meter has been able to provide a unified account of these different kinds of meter, we believe that we have made a significant advance in the understanding of metricality...|$|R

40|$|WI- 38 and HeLa {{cells in}} mitosis have been {{selected}} from fixed monolayer cultures and serially sectioned for electron microscopy. Sections perpendicular to the spindle axis <b>permit</b> <b>counting</b> {{of the number of}} microtubules at each position on the spindle axis and hence the preparation of tubule distribution profiles. Errors intrinsic to this method are discussed. The changes in the tubule distributions from one mitotic stage to another provide evidence concerning the behavior of the spindle tubules during mitosis. The ratio of the number of tubules passing the chromosomes on the metaphase plate to the maximum number in each half spindle is about 1 / 2. This ratio changes little in early anaphase, and then decreases in late anaphase {{at about the same time}} that a zone of increased tubule number develops at the middle of the interzone. The region where the stem bodies form contains about 3 / 2 the number of tubules seen elsewhere in the interzone. This ratio is almost constant as the midbody forms in telophase and then increases to 2 / 1 in early interphase before the final stages of cytokinesis occur. The structure and behavior of the mitotic spindl...|$|R

40|$|Harbour seals {{were counted}} {{along the entire}} Norwegian coast at known {{moulting}} haulout sites in the period mid-August to early September 2003 - 2006. In 2003 - 2005, almost all known moulting areas from Finnmark to Vestfold counties were covered by aerial photo surveys flown at altitudes of approximately 800 - 900 ft (243 - 274 m), and at low tide (± 2 hours). Surveys in the Østfold County were flown in 2003 - 2006 at 300 ft (91 m), and the small tidal amplitudes <b>permitted</b> <b>counts</b> {{to be carried out}} irrespective of the tidal cycle. In some sub-areas, two or three independent surveys were conducted. Visual counts using binoculars from smaller boats and islands were carried out in some selected areas. The surveys revealed a total minimum population of 6, 705 harbour seals in Norwegian waters. Harbour seals were most abundant in the Nordland and Sør-Trøndelag counties with minimum estimates of approximately 2, 500 and 1, 500 seals, respectively. The presented minimum estimate is approximately 800 seals lower than an estimate obtained in a comparable study carried out during the moult in 1996 - 1999.
