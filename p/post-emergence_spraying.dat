40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to test the response of morning-glory species (Ipomoea hederifolia and Ipomoea quamoclit), two important weeds in Brazilian agricultural fields, growing after application of increased doses of carfentrazone-ethyl and saflufenacil. Pot dose-response tests were performed by spraying doses of carfentrazone-ethyl (0 up to 30 mL ai ha- 1) and saflufenacil (0 up to 35 g ai ha- 1) directly onto 6 - 8 leaved morning-glory plants. Dry mass accumulation was determined 14 days after spraying. At maximum field dose of carfentrazone-ethyl (30 mL ai ha- 1), dry mass reduced by 59 % for I. quamoclit and 75 % for I. hederifolia; for saflufenacil (35 g ai ha- 1), dry mass reduced by 83 % for I. quamoclit and 71 % for I. hederifolia. Both carfentrazone-ethyl and saflufenacil were very efficient to control I. hederifolia and I. quamoclit, since doses required to kill plants were very lower than recommended field doses (5. 5 % and 10 % for carfentrazone-ethyl and saflufenacil, respectively, considering both species). Although I. hederifolia and I. quamoclit show a short different response to carfentrazone-ethyl and saflufenacil, both herbicides are efficient to control young plants in early <b>post-emergence</b> <b>spraying...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dichelops melacanthus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an {{important}} pest of many crops insouthern Brazil, that feed and cause damage to young plants of maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Thespraying of insecticide with herbicide to weed control has become a common practice to control this bug in the northand west region of Paraná State. In order to investigate strategies for bug management, the efficiency of thiametoxam+ lambdacialotrina and methamidophos was evaluated, sprayed on maize at pre and post-emergence, with and withoutseed treatment (ST). In the group without ST, insecticide spraying at pre-emergence presented small or no effect onD. melacanthus, even with added attractive (soy milk and salt). Insecticide <b>spraying</b> at <b>post-emergence</b> showed a goodcontrol of D. melacanthus, comparable to the ST, although not sufficient to reduce damage. In the group with ST,pre-emergence application was not effective in controlling the insect. <b>Post-emergence</b> <b>sprays</b> associated to ST reached 80 % of control [...] Insecticide <b>spraying</b> at <b>post-emergence</b> in addition to ST was significant at the present experimentalconditions, although is only justified if the cost/benefit ratio is satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of {{herbicides}} on varied species of weeds. The experiment used of four general methods of treatment with various concentrations of herbicidal materials, namely, pre-emergence (application of the herbicidal material either as a liquid spray or as a dry powder of dust on the soil surface of the infested area), <b>post-emergence</b> foliage <b>sprays</b> (application of a spray or dust to the vegetative parts of the undesired species), treatment of the seed in the field, and treatment of fully-headed plants. All plots were replicated and randomized wherever a sufficiently large area of infestation permitted. Where experimental areas were small, permitting only a single unreplicated treatment, these tests were considered as exploratory and used mainly as indicators for future experiments. Results of the various treatments were recorded in actual per cents of weeds killed where size of plots permitted accurate stand counts to be made. In the case of the larger experimental units, such as square red plots, the use of a weedy grass index was employed. Overall the results indicated that specific conditions and types of treatments worked best at the removal of the differing species of weeds. This experiment was carried out during the Summer and Fall of 1947. Advisor: Noel S. Hanson...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} finger-harrowing (FH) on weed control and yield {{of durum wheat}} (Triticum durum Desf) grown under {{conventional}} tillage (CT) or no-tillage (NT) was studied in 1995 - 96. Mechanical weeding-eight combinations between four tine adjustments and two treatment intensities (one or two passes) -was compared with <b>post-emergence</b> herbicide <b>spraying</b> and an unweeded control. Tine working depth was higher in CT than in NT due to lower soil dry bulk density, and increased with the theoretical aggressiveness of tine adjustments, but its correlation with short- and long-term effects on crop and weeds overall was poor, suggesting that tine adjustment was not a major factor involved. In 1995, durum wheat grain yield in FH was very low, because of high weed development in both tillage systems. In 1996, lower weed pressure resulted in FH grain yield, on average 3982 kg ha- 1 for CT and 2809 kg ha- 1 for NT, comparable with that obtained with herbicides. Durum wheat grain yield and weed biomass were much more affected by tillage system than by tine adjustment or harrowing intensity, and seemed mostly dependent on the lower crop competitive ability in NT, caused by reduced emergence, higher weed abundance and presence of aggressive weed species, Ammi majus in 1995 and Lolium multiflorum in 1996. Dependence of FH effect upon soil and weed conditions encountered seasonally in the two tillage systems suggests that, in low-input durum wheat, mechanical methods alone would not always guarantee adequate weed control and grain yield...|$|R

40|$|Herbicides {{are widely}} used in soybean for weed control, and the {{selection}} pressure attributed to the repeated use of herbicides with similar modes of action on the same site has caused selection for resistant biotypes within and among previously susceptible species, such as Euphorbia heterophylla L., in relation to ALS enzyme inhibitors, in the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo, Brazil. Seeds of E. heterophylla were collected to examine possible new cases of resistant populations and to test alternative herbicide treatments to manage these populations, in the Caarapó region, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in areas where plants of this species have survived continuous herbicide applications. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, where biotypes {{with a history of}} suspected resistance were compared with a known susceptible biotype. Several <b>post-emergence</b> herbicides were <b>sprayed</b> at zero, one, two, four, and eight times the recommended field application rates. Twenty days after application, plants were harvested, and control percentage and fresh weight were determined to establish dose-response curves, in the aim to obtain the resistance factor using CD 50 and RD 50 data. The chlorimuron-ethyl resistance factor values for the control percentage and fresh weight parameters were higher than 16. 5 and 16. 9, respectively, while imazethapyr showed resistance factors higher than 25. 0 and 23. 5, respectively. The resistant biotype showed different resistance levels to chlorimuron-ethyl and imazethapyr, showing cross-resistance to the sulfonylurea and imidazolinone groups. Nevertheless, this biotype was effectively controlled by fomesafen (250 g ha- 1), lactofen (120 g ha- 1), flumiclorac-pentyl (40 g ha- 1), glufosinate-ammonium (150 g ha- 1), and glyphosate (360 g ha- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of pre-emergence herbicide, post-emergence herbicide and hand weeding alone {{as well as}} in combination with farm yard manure (FYM) were studied in potato for three years. The emergence percentage was at the top (84. 6) where pre-emergence herbicide was sprayed and FYM was not added followed by (84. 3) hand weeding in which FYM was used. The uncontrolled weed plots gave an average of 535. 8 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than weeds controlled plots. The hand weeding plots gave an average of 58. 9 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than chemically weed controlled plots. The pre-emergence herbicide controlled plots yielded an average of 111. 1 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight as compared to post-emergence herbicide controlled plots. The percentage of > 55 mm tubers was at the top (55. 1) where <b>post-emergence</b> herbicide was <b>sprayed</b> and FYM was added followed by (50. 2 %) pre-emergence herbicide treated plots in which FYM was not added.
