50|$|To date several {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} to predict RD values from protein sequences. Yuan and Wang proposed a computational framework that uses sequential evolutionary information contained in PSI-BLAST profiles and the global protein size information to quantify the relationship between RD and protein sequence. Zhang et al. proposed the RDpred method to predict RD values based on predicted secondary structure, residue position and PSI-BLAST profile. More recently, Song et al. described another sequence-based method that also uses support vector regression to quantify the RD-sequence relationship. Their webserver Prodepth, is developed to facilitate RD <b>prediction</b> <b>analysis</b> for sequences submitted by interested users. In addition, Prodepth server can predict the solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) value for each residue for users' submitted sequence.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} that enhances {{the process and the}} methodology used in a performance <b>prediction</b> <b>analysis.</b> An automatic dynamic instrumentation methodology is added to Warwick’s Performance Analysis and Characterization Environment PACE [1]. The automation process has eliminated the need to manually obtain application information and data. The Dynamic instrumentation has given PACE the ability to extract and utilize data that were hidden and unobtainable prior to execution. We give two examples to illustrate our methodology. While it was impossible to perform the analysis using the original method due to lack of essential information, the new technique successfully enabled PACE to conduct the <b>prediction</b> <b>analysis</b> in a dynamic environment. The results show that with the automated dynamic instrumentation, the performance <b>prediction</b> <b>analysis</b> of dynamic application execution is possible and the results obtained are reliable.
