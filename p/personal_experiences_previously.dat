40|$|Background: Cancer is a {{relevant}} topic {{at this time}} as {{there have been many}} structural and policy changes in the NHS regarding this area. <b>Personal</b> <b>experience</b> of nurses outside of practice is a concept that has received little investigation, although the small amount of literature available does talk about it in the cancer context. There is a large amount of literature regarding carers of cancer patients but does not acknowledge that these carers may also be nurses. Aim: To find out how <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of cancer in a spouse, relative or close friend has an impact on professional practice. Methods: Registered nurses studying in the School of Nursing were recruited for interview. The interviews were semi-structured and asked questions about the respondents’ <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of cancer and how this has influenced them in their lives and work. These interviews were transcribed and then analysed using a qualitative method. Themes emerged and were presented in the findings. Findings: Four core themes relevant to the research question were found from the data; <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can improve general nursing skills, <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can improve interactions with patients, <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can improve interactions with patients’ relatives, and <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can cause difficulties {{in the role of the}} nurse. Two other themes not identified by the research question were also found; overlaps between professional and the <b>personal,</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of cancer as a child can influence nursing practice. Conclusions: Although nurses are already encouraged to reflect on their <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> in professional practice, this new evidence suggests that it is also beneficial to reflect on <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> outside of practice. This study has shown that although <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of cancer in a relative or close friend can cause difficulties, there are also many positive influences on nursing practice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} competing theories {{concerning the}} role of mass media in hindering or facilitating the translation of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> into political preferences. Using national survey and media content data that allows evaluations of both media coverage and individual patterns of media use, this study evaluates the influence of mass media on the direct impact of <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> on presidential performance as Ronald Reagan completed his second term in office, and on the indirect impact of <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> by means of their impact on collective-level issue judgments. Exposure to unemployment news appears to strengthen the impact of <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> on presidential performance ratings. Heavy unemployment coverage also increases {{the extent to which}} perceptions of national unemployment conditions are generalized from <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> Overall, results suggest that mass media may counter the tendency to morselize <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> and help legitimize the translation of private interests into political attitudes...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Expertise by experience' is {{a highly}} valued element of service {{delivery}} in recovery-oriented mental health care, but is unacknowledged within the mental health nursing literature. AIM: To explore the extent and influence of mental health professionals' <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental ill health on clinical practice. METHOD: Twenty seven mental health nurses with their own <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental ill health were interviewed about how their <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> informed their mental health nursing practice, {{as part of a}} sequential mixed methods study. RESULTS: The influence of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> in nursing work was threefold: first, through overt disclosure; second, through the 'use of the self as a tool'; third, through the formation of professional nursing identity. DISCUSSION: Mental health nurses' experience of mental illness was contextualised by other life experiences and by particular therapeutic relationships and clinical settings. In previous empirical studies nurses have cited <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of mental illness as a motivator and an aspect of their identity. In this study there was also an association between <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and enhanced nursing expertise. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: If drawing on <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> is commonplace, then we must address the taboo of disclosure and debate the extent to which personal and professional boundaries are negotiated during clinical encounters...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ways in which <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and native {{language}} status shape individual medical background knowledge. In this exploratory study, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with native (NES, n= 10) and non-native English speaking (NNES, n= 7) participants. From the interviews it emerged that <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> or <b>personal</b> (emotional) involvement with any kind of medical condition have several effects on an individual’s knowledge and perception of medical terminology. Three main effects were found: 1) <b>Personal</b> <b>experience</b> fosters the retention of medical terms; 2) <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can promote the development of deeper underlying knowledge structures for the medical terms in question; 3) <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> can aid participants in becoming aware of the different meanings health professionals and lay people attach to one and the same medical term. These findings, however, only hold true for NES participants. NNES participants experience many difficulties in medical communication. Most of their problems relate to English proficiency, their respective native language and the unfamiliarity with Western medical practice. 31 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} male perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of ‘unwanted attention’ (UA), {{as well as}} possible associations between perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of UA. Ninety-one male college students, from five Portuguese universities, {{were asked to indicate}} which of a continuum of 47 behaviours represented UA. Although UA, stalking and harassment are rarely addressed in Portugal, male college students shared a clear understanding of what behaviours constituted UA, with the identification of four main categories of UA behaviours: ‘aggressive’, ‘threatening’, ‘classic’ and ‘dysfunctional attachment’. Almost all participants (96 %) reported <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of at least one UA behaviour. There was a minimal relationship between perceptions and <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> of the individual behaviours. The findings highlight the widespread risk of male victimisation and the need to legitimise male complaints...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that human cooperative behaviour towards other individuals is often conditioned on information about previous interactions. This information derives both from <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> (direct reciprocity) and from experience of others (i. e. reputation; indirect reciprocity). Direct and indirect reciprocity have been studied separately, but humans often have access to both types of information. Here, we experimentally investigate information use in a repeated helping game. When acting as donor, subjects can condition their decisions to help recipients with both types of information at a small cost to access such information. We find that information from direct interactions weighs more heavily in decisions to help, and participants tend to react less forgivingly to negative <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> than to negative reputation. Moreover, effects of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and reputation interact in decisions to help. If a recipient’s reputation is positive, the <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the donor has a weak effect on the decision to help, and vice versa. Yet if {{the two types of}} information indicate conflicting signatures of helpfulness, most decisions to help follow <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> To understand the roles of direct and indirect reciprocity in human cooperation, they should be studied in concert, not in isolation...|$|R
40|$|Researchers in {{the past}} have found that <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and formal {{training}} lead to better accuracy when predicting research outcomes in areas of psychology. <b>Personal</b> <b>experience</b> and formal training were compared in this study on the ability of students to predict research outcomes in social psychology. Students completed questionnaires that measured their social engagement (a proxy to <b>personal</b> <b>experience),</b> their academic history and status, and their knowledge of social psychological findings. Students with more psychology classes taken in college were better able to predict research outcomes (r =. 24). Psychology majors knew more findings in social psychology than nonpsychology majors (d =. 28). Students with higher academic status were better able to correctly identify research findings (η=. 31). Measures of <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> (i. e., social engagement) did not predict accuracy in identifying correct research findings. Formal training was a better predictor of accuracy than <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> Students had the opportunity to change their misconceptions about the social world when they were taught research findings in the classroom. People might also learn about human social behavior vicariously or from small amounts of social interaction rather than from high amounts of social engagement...|$|R
