Despite the front office changes, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39–31–12, resulting in a seventh-place finish in the Central Division.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for a route {{avoiding}} Central London {{had been}} in <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. In 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had built up schemes for new roads, including what became the North Circular Road, {{which was designed to}} skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.|$|E

5|$|The final {{modification}} to SH-34 occurred {{just under}} a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 {{instead of the}} old alignment of the now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40. No further changes have taken <b>place</b> <b>since</b> then.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} been in <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support {{than their counterparts in}} England do.|$|E
5|$|Angel is a {{proposed}} {{station on the}} Crossrail 2 (Chelsea-Hackney line) project, providing an interchange between Crossrail 2 and the Northern Line.

5|$|Armenia {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the newly minted Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh War. Despite a cease-fire in <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1994, Armenia has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Armenia became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E
5|$|Four {{significant}} changes to Highway3 have taken <b>place</b> <b>since</b> {{the designation of}} the route in 1920. The first was an adjustment to the eastern terminus. The second was the Essex Bypass, built through the 1970s between Windsor and Leamington. The third was the St. Thomas Expressway, a super two highway built in the late 1970s. The final change was the provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of Highway3 being decommissioned: between Leamington and Talbotville Royale, through Port Colborne and within Fort Erie.|$|E

5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY149 was then extended northward along NY22's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 {{that had been in}} <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 at this time to match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate that has taken <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored each year by the Icelandic Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to {{maintain}} an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents have taken <b>place</b> <b>since</b> {{the introduction of}} mass-production plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2008.

5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the turn of the century.|$|E
