An experimental set-up is designed to study the behavior of liquid sloshing in partially filled prismatic container. At every instant of time, slosh amplitude is computed at specified location {{with the help of}} capacitance probe. The resulting slosh heights for various excitation frequencies and amplitudes are compared with the data available in literature. It is observed that the numerical results are closer to that obtained experimentally and little variations in the data are due to ineptness of the experimental set-up and the input parameters.

Thanks to its light weight and failure resistance, this type of design shows potential {{to be used in}} aerospace applications. The simulation imitates a drop test from the height of 20 m on a rigid surface, in accordance with Military Handbook testing guidelines for fuel tanks. The focus is on establishing the best practices for modelling and solving this type of problems. The computational methods are tested on a generic model of a rectangular <b>prismatic</b> <b>tank</b> with rounded edges. The walls of the tank are made of a combination hyperelastic rubber material orthotropic fabrics. The simulation is performed for the 70 % and 100 % water lled tank. All calculations are performed using the Altair HyperWorks 13. 0 software suite, in particular the RADIOSS solver and OptiStruct Solver and Optimiser. The criteria for evaluation of model and simulation quality are suggested. Comparison is made between various uid (ALE and SPH) and solid (composite and hyperelastic) modelling approaches. Material parameters are found using the least-squares t to the experimental measurements. The nal, most robust and accurate model serves as a basis for establishing a design optimisation procedure, aiming at reduction of mass of tank components while ensuring the structural integrity. Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks of di erent modelling approaches are discussed. The main conclusions from the study are summarised and suggested directions for future work are given...|$|E
40|$|The current {{demand in}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) from re-mote marine locations drives the design of floating LNG (FLNG) liquefaction or regasification facilities, where LNG is transferred to shuttle carriers (LNGC). During the loading procedure, which takes about 18 - 24 hours for a standard sized LNGC, free fluid surfaces and varying filling levels occur inside the internal cargo tanks. This condition is critical since the seakeeping behavior of the LNGC — especially the roll motion — is strongly influ-enced and varying. In order to estimate and forecast the LNGC motions, numerical methods based on potential theory are the most efficient and appropriate method. The selected approach is validated by model tests at 30 % water filling height inside four <b>prismatic</b> <b>tanks.</b> In-depth analyses, including force and mo-ment measurements between tanks and hull, revealed a discrep...|$|R

The first purpose-built, fully refrigerated LPG carrier was constructed by a Japanese shipyard, to a United States design, in 1962. <b>Prismatic</b> <b>tanks</b> enabled the ship's cargo carrying capacity to be maximised, thus making fully refrigerated ships highly suitable for carrying large volumes of cargo such as LPG, ammonia and vinyl chloride over long distances.

40|$|A {{chemical}} {{industrial plant}} represents a sensitive {{presence in a}} region and, in case of severe damage due to earthquake actions, its impact on social life and environment can be devastating. From the structural point of view, chemical plants count a number of recurrent elements, which are classifiable in a discrete set of typological families (towers, chimneys, cylindrical or spherical or <b>prismatic</b> <b>tanks,</b> pipes etc.). Within a single typology, each structure may differ from the others for its geometry, mechanical properties of the materials or boundary conditions. The final aim of this work is to outline a general procedure to be followed in order to assign a seismic vulnerability estimate to each element of the various typological families. In this paper, F. E. simulations allowed to create a training set, which {{has been used to}} train a probabilistic neural system. In practical applications, the database may be integrated by real measurements and observations. This network is expected to return a vulnerability estimate for chemical plant structures and predict the type of collapse that presumably would affect the structure in case of strong earthquake. A sample application has concerned the seismic vulnerability of simple spherical tanks...|$|R
30|$|One factor {{influencing}} {{the choice of}} technology is also the implication on storage space in the ship and thus how much footprint all the extra needed technologies take. Often the cargo space size is what defines the rate a shipping company can charge for its services and thus it will have large implications on the choice of technology. Importance of {{this is one of}} the topics planned to be investigated with the customer interviews and questionnaires. New technologies as <b>prismatic</b> LNG <b>tanks</b> also enable placement of the same in spaces already not utilizable as cargo space due to its strange shape (Mohn 2014).|$|R
50|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{the use of the}} two {{different}} membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because <b>prismatic</b> membrane <b>tanks</b> utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the Suez Canal. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} Kelvin {{force has}} been proposed as an artificial gravity to control the orientation of paramagnetic liquid propellants such as liquid oxygen in a microgravity environment. This paper reports experiments performed in the NASA "Weightless Wonder" KC- 135 aircraft, through the Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program. The aircraft flies {{through a series of}} parabolic arcs providing about 25 s of microgravity in each arc. The experiment was conceived, designed, constructed, and performed by the undergraduate student team and their two faculty advisors. Two types of tanks were tested: square-base <b>prismatic</b> <b>tanks</b> 5 cm x 5 cm x 8. 6 cm and circular cylinders 5 cm in diameter and 8. 6 cm tall. The paramagnetic liquid was a 3. 3 molar solution of MnCl 2 in water. Tests were performed with each type of tank filled to depths of 1 cm and 4 cm. Each test compared a pair of tanks that were identical except that the base of one was a pole face of a 0. 6 Tesla permanent magnet. The Kelvin force attracts paramagnetic materials toward regions of higher magnetic field. It was hypothesized that the Kelvin force would hold the liquid {{in the bottom of the}} tanks during the periods of microgravity. The tanks were installed in a housing that could slide on rails transverse to the flight direction. By manually shoving the housing, an identical impulse could be provided to each tank at the beginning of each period of microgravity. The resulting fluid motions were videotaped for later analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} for the undergoing study is {{to better understand the}} sloshing induced impacts that may occur inside a container par-tially filled with liquid. Transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in <b>prismatic</b> membrane <b>tanks</b> exemplifies an area of application where impacting resonant waves cause loads that define the ulti-mate limit strength of the local structure. Model tests are usually performed with a small scale model, typically 1 : 50. Physical and economical considerations in general also restrict other test para-meters, so that the liquid phase is water and the gas is air with a ullage pressure equal to the ambient atmospheric pressure. The model tank structure is made rigid, so that hydroelastic effects in the model tests are assumed to be negligible. Considering the dif-ferences in scale and physical parameters, the estimation of full-scale loads from model test pressure measurements is a great chal-lenge.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{and limits of}} the complex resistivity and the Spectral Induced Polarization techniques for environmental applications are investigated starting from the controlled laboratory conditions. The solution of the 2 D forward problem for the complex resistivity is achieved on cylindrical-shaped models by a transformed formulation and using the Complete Electrode Model to define boundary conditions. The finite element algorithm, implemented in Matlab to solve numerically these equations, {{has proven to be}} accurate and stable through a comparison with the 3 D full formulation and synthetic simulations. Accordingly, this formulation can be used to produce 2 D reconstruction on cylindrical laboratory devices provided with one horizontal mid-section of electrodes (e. g. lysimeters). The whole geophysical process (data processing, forward modelling and inversion) has been included within EIDORS through an interactive Matlab algorithm with numerous new function added. Simulations with Gaussian noise, performed on heterogeneous models with anomalies included, provide low-error inverted models whereas anomalies are well-detected both for shape and position. EIDORS software could act as a base code for tomographic inversion of time-domain and frequency-domain data, both for laboratory and for in field investigations, because of its high-flexibility and reliability now reached by forward and inversion routines, with the primary aim of to share data and promote collaboration between groups working these fields. A new experimental device was presented to perform 2 D and 3 D measurement on cylindrical physical models in order to simulate typical subsoil configurations. The cylindrical symmetry avoids to have boundary effects of <b>prismatic</b> <b>tanks</b> and allows us to provide horizontal cross-section within the different layers. Preliminary water and sand models have highlighted the main problems due to saturation, electrodes, array and frequency range. The experimental AC instrument, after the calibration, provides reliable amplitude and phase dataset with stable and repeatable measurements. Measurements are not affected by the inductive coupling for frequency up to 5 - 10 Hz. Physical models built up in the laboratory have concerned the preparation of a typical sand-clay-sand multilayer model, simulating a shallow aquifer by saturation of the top layer. The HFE 7100, having physical properties similar to the chlorinated solvents, was spilled from the top to simulate a point source spilling, that is for example a failure of a little storage tank. Laboratory experiments have confirmed the reliability of the algorithm proposed. After HFE spilling, impedance amplitude increases progressively as expected, taking into account the percentage ratio between the global volume of HFE spilled and the sand volume. On the other hand the phase increases less evidently, since they are probably more sensible to the particular working conditions. Evidences from SIP phase spectra seems to be also convincing as we detect a single peak for frequency of about 1 - 2 Hz. These results confirm that complex resistivity tomography can play an important for contaminant detection, stressing once more the importance to define codified criteria for acquiring CR ad SIP in field data...|$|R
40|$|Sloshing is {{a violent}} resonent free surface flow in a container. The main {{objective}} of this thesis has been to study sloshing in rectangular and <b>prismatic</b> <b>tanks.</b> The tank may be excited by a harmonic motion or it may move with a ship in waves. In the latter case, the coupled ship motions and sloshing problem is investigated. A nonlinear analytically based sloshing model {{is used in the}} solshing calculations. Experiments have been conducedand collected data are utilized in the validation of the sloshing model and computations of interaction between sloshing and ship dynamics. Tank roof impacts are studied. Energy in the impact jet is dissipated and this leads to damping of the sloshing motion. An iterative procedure is applied to incorporate the effect of energy dissipation in the calculations. Damping of the soloshing motion is an important parameter around resonance for the coupled ship motion and sloshing system. The sloshing model is based on a nonlinear theory analysis of two-dimensional nonlinear sloshing of an imcompressible fluid with irrotational flow in a rectangular tank. Infinite tank roof height and no overtuning waves are assumed. The free surface is expressed as a Fourier series and the velocity potential is expanded in terms of the linear natural modes of the fluid motion. The infinite-dimensional modal system is approximated and the result is a finite set of ordinary differential equations in time for generalized coordinates (Fourier cofficients) of the free surface. This theory is not valid for small water depth or when water impacts heavily on the tank roof. The proposed method has a high computational efficiency, facilitates simulations of a coupled vehicle-fluid system and has been extensively validated for forced motions. Experiments with a smooth rectangular tank exited by forced harmonic horizontal oscillations have been performed and the results are used to validate the analytical sloshing model. Transients and associated nonlinear modulation of the waves, beating, are important due to the low level of damping of the fluid motion. The measured parameters are the motion of the tank and the free surface elevation at three positions. Pictures and video are used to study local flow details and the dynamics of the flow. At excitation periods {{in the vicinity of the}} first natural period for the fluid motion in the tank, even small motion amplitudes lead to violent sloshing and impacts between the rising water surface and the tank roof. Impacts cause high pressures and forces. The effect of slamming in the tank is included by a local anlysis interacting with the nonlinear sloshing model. A Wagner based mthod is used to find the flow induced by slamming. Hydroelastic effects are ignored. The hypothesis that the kinetic and potential energy in the jet flow coused by the impact is dissipated when the jet flow hits the free surface, enables a rational calculation of the damping effect of impacts on the slishing flow. The Wagner approach requires a small angle between the impacting free surface and the tank roof. A correction by a similarity solution, or alternatively, by a generalization of Wagner's theory valid for larger angles is applied when this is not the case. Since anslytically based methods are used, fluid impact load predictions are robust. A coupled ship motion and sloshing system is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Two-dimensional experiments on a box-shaped ship section excited by regular beam sea have been conducted. The section contains two tanks and can only move in sway. Fluid motion inside the tanks has a large effect on the sway motion response of the section. Simulatons of a corresponding system are performed by assuming a mainly linear external flow and applying the nonlinear sloshing model. The linear external hydrodynamic loads due to body motion are expressed in terms of a convoltion integral representing the history of the fluid motion. detailed numerical study of how to accuratly and numerical sway motion of the ship section is reported. The calculated cooupled motion is sensitive to the damping of the sloshing motion in a certain frequency range where the coupled sloshing and ship motions couse resonant ship motions. A quasi-linear frequency domain analysis is used to explain this by introducing the sloshing loads as a frequency dependent spring. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
