My position, expressed in this paper, is that in this current landscape, {{there is room for}} a new publication model, combining OpenArchives for immediate access with editorial peer-reviewing. A key interest of this proposal is that peer-reviewing happens after the results have been released. I start by reviewing recent changes in <b>publication</b> <b>methods</b> in Computer Science and some of their consequences, drawing practical examples from Computer Graphics. I then review existing forces that are contributing to changes in <b>publication</b> <b>methods,</b> and how these forces push towards a new publication model.

50|$|The {{development}} of the Internet created the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on Web sites. This is a relatively low cost <b>publication</b> <b>method</b> compared to paper and makes court decisions more easily {{available to the public}} (particularly important in common law countries where court decisions are major sources of law). Because a court can post a decision on a Web site as soon as it is rendered, the need for a quickly printed case in an unofficial, commercial report becomes less crucial. However, the very ease of internet publication has raised new concerns about the ease with which internet-published decisions can be modified after publication, creating uncertainty about the validity of internet opinions.|$|E

We develop a linear-time algorithm for computing anatomized tables that obey the l-diversity privacy requirement, and minimize the error of reconstructing the microdata. Extensive experiments confirm that our technique allows significantly more effective data analysis than the conventional <b>publication</b> <b>method</b> based on generalization. Specifically, anatomy permits aggregate reasoning with average error below 10 %, which is lower than the error obtained from a generalized table by orders of magnitude. 1...|$|E
40|$|Today {{there is}} a strong {{interest}} in publishing set-valued data in a privacy-preserving manner. Such data associate individuals to sets of values (e. g., preferences, shopping items, symptoms, query logs). In addition, an individual can be associated with a sensitive label (e. g., marital status, religious or political conviction). Anonymizing such data implies ensuring that an adversary should not be able to (1) identify an individual’s record, and (2) infer a sensitive label, if such exists. Existing research on this problem either perturbs the data, publishes them in disjoint groups disassociated from their sensitive labels, or generalizes their values by assuming the availability of a generalization hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative. Our <b>publication</b> <b>method</b> also puts data in a generalized form, but does not require that published records form disjoint groups and does not assume a hierarchy either; instead, it employs generalized bitmaps and recasts data values in a nonreciprocal manner; formally, the bipartite graph from original to anonymized records {{does not have to be}} composed of disjoint complete subgraphs. We configure our schemes to provide popular privacy guarantees while resisting attacks proposed in recent research, and demonstrate experimentally that we gain a clear utility advantage over the previous state of the art...|$|E

40|$|In the Shimabara {{area which}} was {{damaged by the}} {{volcanic}} eruptions of the Mt. Fugen in Unzen between 1990 and 1995, many disaster prevention facilities have been constructed in sand erosion control districts to improve the regional safety. The sand erosion control districts however are extensive and some are located in a national park. Furthermore, {{since many of the}} sand erosion control districts are closely located to local residential areas, and the frequency of debris flows was decreasing, requests were made by the local residents and municipalities to utilize the districts for the rehabilitation and development of the Shimabara area. In response, a plan was established which addresses the needs of the local communities by using part of the sand erosion control districts for such a purpose without sacrificing their functions, and projects were carried out in stages in accordance with the plan. Since there is little precedence for the use of sand erosion control districts for purposes other than the original intent, the results of the attempt in the Shimabara area are expected to yield important insights for future application of this approach. This paper summarizes the progress and outcomes of the use of the sand erosion control facilities for rehabilitation and development between 1995 and 2004, and presents the results on the public opinion and recognition of and needs {{for the use of the}} districts for such a purpose which have been obtained through a questionnaire survey conducted on the local residents and tourists.

40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{language}} limitations, the abstract of journal article {{may be the}} only way for people of non-Chinese speaking countries to know about trials in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, {{little is known about the}} reporting quality of these trial abstracts. Our study is to assess the reporting quality of abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCT) published in four leading Chinese medical journals of TCM, and to identify any differences in reporting between the Chinese and English version of the same abstract <b>publication.</b> <b>Method</b> Two reviewers hand-searched the Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine, the Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine, the China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica and the Chinese Acupuncture & Moxibustion for all abstracts of RCTs published between 2006 and 2007. Two reviewers independently assessed the reporting quality of the Chinese and English version of all eligible abstracts based on a modified version of the CONSORT for reporting randomised trials in journal and conference abstracts (CONSORT for abstracts). Results We identified a total of 345 RCTs of TCM with both a Chinese and English abstract. More than half of Chinese abstracts reported details of the trial participants (68 %; 234 / 345), control group intervention (52 %; 179 / 345), the number of participants randomized (73 %; 253 / 345) and benefits when interpreting the trial results (55 %; 190 / 345). Reporting of methodological quality or key features of trial design and trial results were poor; only 2 % (7 / 345) included details of the trial design, 3 % (11 / 345) defined the primary outcome, 5 % (17 / 345) described the methods of random sequence generation, and only 4 % (13 / 345) reported the number of participants analyzed. No abstracts provided details on allocation concealment and trial registration. The percentage agreement in reporting (between the Chinese and English version of the same abstract) ranged from 84 % to 100 % across individual checklist item. Conclusion The reporting quality of abstracts of RCTs published in these four TCM journals needs to be improved. Since none of the four journals adopted CONSORT for Abstracts, we hope that the introduction and adoption of CONSORT for Abstracts by TCM journals will lead to an improvement in reporting quality. </p...|$|E

30|$|For {{the last}} 150  years, {{the sharing of}} {{information}} within the medical community has largely occurred through presentation of work in scientific meetings and publication in scientific journals. Abstracts submitted for presentations must be scrutinised by reviewers and accepted {{before they can be}} presented. Similarly, in scientific journals, the articles submitted undergo a rigorous (blinded) reviewing process, thus ensuring, to the greatest extent possible, that the information is correct and reproducible. While far from perfect, this process does {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of the presented or published material. Medical journals are ranked according to the impact they have on the scientific community. Calculation of the “impact factor” of a journal is based upon the number of citations divided by the number of published articles in that particular journal for any given year. In other words, with the “traditional” <b>publication</b> <b>method,</b> a more hierarchical pathway must be followed before the information is distributed. Papers published in journals with a high impact factor do have more “weight” and influence in the medical community than those published in journals with a low impact factor or none at all. Similarly, there are also high-profile and low-profile meetings. In SoMe, on the other hand, there are no barriers or hierarchy, and there is no peer review process. Anyone can publish anything online, unhindered by a lack of in-depth knowledge on a specific topic. Although this can be perceived as a disadvantage or potential risk in using SoMe to obtain medical information, SoMe should not be regarded as a completely uncontrolled information resource. Since there are no hierarchical or editorial barriers, users of SoMe can freely post their critiques and comments. In this respect, an “open review process” among the virtual community in SoMe replaces the more traditional review procedure; in other words, so-called collective intelligence is used to accept or reject the posted information. This open review process or assessment by the online professional community may evolve into a new type of scoring system resulting in another form of stratification of more and less relevant information when implemented on a large scale in SoMe. Such a scoring system is already being applied in ResearchGate, as explained in the previous section. SoMe can also have a significant impact on the visibility and popularity of material published in scientific journals. Several radiological organisations and journals are exploring how they can use SoMe to extend the reach of the traditional Web-based or printed publications. A recent study provided evidence that dissemination and discussion of scientific information via a radiology blog and SoMe can significantly increase the number of readers in comparison with more traditional publication venues [32]. This study concluded that there is growing awareness among researchers and academic and professional society leadership that further integration of SoMe within their communication strategies must be seriously considered, since it might also lead to more extensive networking among people with common interests and priorities.|$|E
