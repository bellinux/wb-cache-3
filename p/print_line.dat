A close look on the quality of the <b>printed</b> <b>lines</b> reveals that depending on the process parameters the droplets are distributed more or less inhomogeneously within the <b>printed</b> <b>lines.</b> We attribute this to the Saffman force, which should be taken into account for a more accurate description, especially when only little sheath gas is applied.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of surface {{wettability}} on the cross-sectional profiles of printed nanofluid inks which can have a significant role on conductivity of <b>printed</b> <b>lines</b> {{that are used in}} the production of printed electronics. Glass substrates were coated with heptadecafluorodecyltrichlorosilane, nonafluorohexyltrimethoxysilane and methyltrimethoxysilane using a dipping method to enhance the wettability of the nanofluid silver ink. Inkjet printing techniques were also applied to develop micro-structural textures {{on the surface of the}} glass substrate and thereby modify the wettability of the substrate. The glass substrate, coated with heptadecafluorodecyltrichlorosilane was micro-structured using a UV curable ink to enhance the wettability for the silver nanoparticle ink. Using inkjet printing techniques to micro-structure the substrate allows modification of the wettability of the substrate whilst simultaneously printing on to the substrate. This enables the potential of increasing the performance of such <b>printed</b> <b>lines,</b> essentially permitting additional particulate material to be deposited thus increasing conductivity. The cross-sectional profile of the <b>printed</b> <b>line</b> was predicted numerically and analytically and compared to experimental data where agreement was observed. In addition, three analytical expressions for <b>printed</b> <b>lines</b> on the substrate were developed by writing the force balance equations in the x, y and z directions on a slice of <b>printed</b> <b>line</b> between z and z+dz...|$|R

Some non-IBM hardware vendors such as Mohawk Data Sciences used Bisync for other purposes such as tape-to-tape transmission. A programmer can easily emulate an RJE terminal or other device.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a <b>print</b> <b>line,</b> with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Printing {{offers the}} {{possibility}} of producing mass quantities {{of a wide variety}} of electronic components and devices quickly and at lower cost. Flexography is mainly used for packaging applications, but is also a potential method for the micro manufacture of electronic devices, smart packaging and RFID. Fine solid lines of high quality are essential to enable printing of ink tracks for electronic applications. Plate characteristics are among a number of process parameters that will influence <b>print</b> <b>line</b> quality, which will affect the electrical performance of printed tracks. Deformation of the photopolymer plate is an important factor in determining the line quality. Therefore, an investigation into plate deformation is vital. A numerical model of close multiple lines has been developed and used to examine its deformation under a range of printing conditions. An Ogden constitutive model was used to describe the response of the photopolymer plate material. A series of uniaxial tension and pure shear experiments was carried out to provide mechanical properties of the photopolymer. In validation of the material model, numerical results agree well with the experimental data in both simple tension and pure shear. Numerical models were then used to determine the change in line profile, as the deformations occur on a microscopic level and cannot be assessed experimentally. The simulations yield information on line width increase due to plate deformation. However, the predicted line width is smaller than that of printed line measured using image analysis. The difference in line width is due to ink spreading and by relating the numerical results with those from the printed copy; the proportion of increase in line width due to the deformation of the printing plate has been quantified at 53 to 69 %.
