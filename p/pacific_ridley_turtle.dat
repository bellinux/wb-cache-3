40|$|Sea erosion {{along the}} coast of Karnataka has {{resulted}} in the loss of valuable beaches which is important for marine turtle nesting.

The three coastal districts of Karnataka such as Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada have a coastline of about 300 km of sandybeaches which are preferred nesting sites of Olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles.</b> Sea erosion especially during monsoon is the major reason for loss of beach in this coastal stretch.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{studied the}} beach {{fidelity}} of Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>Turtles</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea) for three seasons at the Rushikulya rookery {{on the coast}} of Orissa in India between December and May (2003 - 2005). We monitored sporadic nesting and arribadas for tagged turtles. Multiple nesting by individual turtles and recapture of tagged turtles confirmed beach fidelity in Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>Turtles.</b> The inter-nesting intervals ranged from 20 - 25 d and remigration intervals varied between 1 - 8 yr. There was an inter-seasonal shift in movement of Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>Turtles</b> from Rushikulya rookery. It is possible that beach exchange is part of a complex phenomenon that Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>Turtles</b> use to colonize new areas or even move to another beach altogether...|$|R

40|$|Olive <b>ridley</b> sea <b>turtles</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea) {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{with respect to their}} arribada nesting behavior but there is paucity of solitary nesting data and no solitary data for Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB). This thesis commences the first-ever study of solitary nesting olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> and was conducted within PNMB during October-March 2009 - 10 and June- March 2010 - 11. Nightly beach surveys were undertaken to quantify turtle emergences, internal nest temperatures were monitored to predict hatchling sex ratios and hatched nests were excavated. Turtle nests experienced high hatching success (82. 1 % during 2010 - 11) and low nest temperatures (average temperature during the critical period was 29. 1 °C) suggesting that mostly male hatchlings were produced. Data were then compared to olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> nesting in arribadas, other solitary nesters and to leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting in PNMB. Most solitary olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtle</b> nesting beaches had higher success and lower internal nest temperatures than arribada beaches. This thesis suggests that solitary nesting beaches may host populations separate from arribada beaches and are important sources of hatchling production for olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles.</b> If solitary and arribada nesting turtles are not separate populations, production of male hatchlings on solitary beaches may be another justification for maintenance of a dual nesting strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|December 15 - 17, 2007 Royal Phuket City Hotel, Phuket, ThailandElectroejaculation and semen {{evaluation}} {{were successfully}} {{performed on the}} olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) at Phuket Marine Biological Center (PMBC), Phuket province and Eastern Marine and Coastal Resources Research Center (EMCOR) Rayong province, in Thailand. Six male Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> aged approximately 30 years old and weighing between 28. 0 – 35. 4 kilograms and 3 male Hawksbill turtles aged approximately 16 years old and weighing between 40. 0 - 49. 0 kilograms were used. The study on the Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtle</b> was performed in May (Summer season) and on the Hawksbill turtle was performed in October (Rainy season). Before electroejaculation, each turtle was sedated and an electrical rectal probe was applied into its cloaca and stimulated with 2 - 6 volts electrical stimuli in 4 cycles. After electrical stimulation, manual stimulation was continued for complete penile erection. The results of semen evaluation found that, an average semen volume was 1 ml (range 0. 01 to 2. 2 ml) for Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtle</b> (n= 6), and 4. 4 ml for Hawksbill turtle (n= 1). Seminal fluid had turbidity, opalescence, viscosity and mucoid appearance. An average sperm motility was 28. 25 % (range 0 to 98 %) for Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtle,</b> and 60 % for Hawksbill turtle. An average sperm concentration was 67. 3 million/ml (range 11. 5 to 150 million/ml) for Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtle,</b> and 512 million/ml for Hawksbill turtle. The sperm had narrow heads and moved in a spiral movement. There were also some motile lobulated appearances in seminal fluid which were of unknown function. Sperm viability in external milieu was approximately 90 minutes. Several staining agents {{used in the study}} were not suitable for sperm morphology evaluation. In conclusion, this study was the first report of successful semen collection using electroejaculation in olive <b>ridley</b> and hawksbill <b>turtles</b> in Thailand. The semen collection method developed here is a useful technique for an artificial insemination in order to conserve the threatened and endangered sea turtle species in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} the beach {{dynamics}} at Gahirmatha sea turtle rookery along Odisha coast of India have forced the olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> to nests in a non-conducive environment.

40|$|Olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> Lepidochelys olivacea nest {{along the}} east and west coasts of India, with major mass nesting beaches in the state of Orissa. The coast of Andhra Pradesh, the state {{immediately}} south of Orissa, has sporadic nesting of olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> and is believed to form part of the migratory route of the turtles that nest in Orissa. A survey of nesting beaches and offshore waters of the Andhra Pradesh coast was carried out from November 2000 to April 2001. Preliminary interviews and secondary data were used to determine potential nesting beaches. During January–March 2001 intensive surveys of seven beaches and monthly surveys {{of the rest of the}} coast provided a lower bound of c. 4, 000 nests along the Andhra Pradesh coast. Nesting densities were higher at beaches near river mouths, at 60 – 100 nests km− 1 in northern and central Andhra Pradesh, and 15 – 20 nests km− 1 in southern Andhra Pradesh. Sightings and incidental catch in experimental trawls indicated the presence of olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> in offshore waters. Fisheries related mortality is the major threat to the species, with nearly 1, 000 dead turtles being washed ashore during January–March, but depredation of eggs by humans and feral animals was also widespread. Conservation efforts need to address these issues, and also the effects of coastal development and artificial illumination, especially at beaches that support relatively high densities of nesting olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles...</b>|$|R

40|$|While olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea) occur {{throughout}} tropical oceans their physiological ecology {{has been}} poorly documented. In May 2005, satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) were attached during oviposition to four adult female olive <b>ridley</b> <b>turtles</b> on the Wessell Islands, northern Australia.

Internesting intervals were relatively long (27 and 18 days, respectively) for hard-shelled turtles given the warm (27 – 28 °C) water temperatures, possibly due to a low metabolic rate for this species. Turtles travelled considerable distances during the internesting interval (200 and 125 km respectively), possibly associated with a search for food or alternative nesting sites.

50|$|Several {{projects}} worldwide seek {{to preserve}} the olive <b>ridley</b> sea <b>turtle</b> population. For example, in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, when the turtles come to the beach to lay their eggs, {{some of them are}} relocated to a hatchery, where they have a much better chance to survive. If the eggs were left on the beach, they would face many threats such as getting washed away with the tide or getting poached. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are carried to the beach and released. Another major project, in India involved in preserving the olive <b>ridley</b> sea <b>turtle</b> population was carried out in Chennai, where the Chennai wildlife team collected close to 10,000 Olive <b>Ridley</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs along the Marina coast, of which 8,834 hatchlings were successfully released into the sea in a phased manner.|$|R
