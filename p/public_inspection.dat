40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{approach}} for governments {{to harness the}} information contained in social media in order to make <b>public</b> <b>inspections</b> and disclosure more efficient. As a case study, we turn to restaurant hygiene inspections – which are done for restaurants throughout the United States and in most of the world and are a frequently cited example of <b>public</b> <b>inspections</b> and disclosure. We present the first empirical study that shows the viability of statistical models that learn the mapping between textual signals in restaurant reviews and the hygiene inspection records from the Department of Public Health. The learned model achieves over 82 % accuracy in discriminating severe offenders from places with no violation, and provides insights into salient cues in reviews that are indicative of the restaurant’s sanitary conditions. Our study suggests that public disclosure policy can be improved by mining public opinions from social media to target inspections and to provide alternative forms of disclosure to customers. ...|$|R

40|$|Data {{dependability}} {{maintenance is}} the major objective in cloud storage. It includes inspection using TPA for unauthorized access. To give security for the outsourced data in cloud storage against various problems like corruptions, and providing data dependability becomes difficult. One of the important issue is the fault tolerance to protect the data in the cloud. Now a days, renewing codes got importance because of their lower repair bandwidth. For renewing coded data the remote checking methods only provide private inspectioning, for this we require data holders to always to be in online and handle inspectioning, and also repairing, which is difficult at sometimes. In this paper we are proposing a scheme called <b>public</b> <b>inspectioning</b> for renewing code based cloud storage. To obtain solution for renewing problem of failed authenticators {{in the absence of}} data holders, we make a proxy, which is privileged to renew the authenticators, in the traditional <b>public</b> <b>inspectioning</b> system model. We also design a novel public verifiable authenticator, which is made by some keys. Thus, this scheme can almost release data holders from online burden. We also randomize the encode coefficients with a pseudorandom function to preserve data privacy. Extensive security analysis shows this system is secure and provable under random oracle model. Experimental evaluation model indicates that this system is highly efficient and can be feasibly integrated into the renewing-code cloud based storage...|$|R

25|$|The ROC's law {{enforcement}} system built upon the foundations laid down during the Ching Dynasty {{with the establishment}} of the Peking <b>Public</b> <b>Inspection</b> Headquarters in 1902. Following the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic in 1912, a National Police Department was established {{under the auspices of the}} Ministry of the Interior. This early centralized system consisted of a national headquarters in the capital, provincial police administrations for each province, police departments and bureaus at the municipal and county level respectively. This system was extended to Taiwan following its transfer to ROC control in 1947, two years after the close of hostilities in World War II, though the basic system from the Japanese era was retained.|$|E

25|$|In {{the time}} of Elizabeth I, the {{persecution}} of the adherents of the Reformed religion, both Anglicans and Protestants alike, which had occurred {{during the reign of}} her elder half-sister Queen Mary I was used to fuel strong anti-Catholic propaganda in the hugely influential Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Those who had died in Mary's reign, under the Marian Persecutions, were effectively canonised by this work of hagiography. In 1571 the Convocation of the Church of England ordered that copies of the Book of Martyrs should be kept for <b>public</b> <b>inspection</b> in all cathedrals and in the houses of church dignitaries. The book was also displayed in many Anglican parish churches alongside the Holy Bible. The passionate intensity of its style and its vivid and picturesque dialogues made the book very popular among Puritan and Low Church families, Anglican and Protestant nonconformist, down to the nineteenth century. In a period of extreme partisanship on all sides of the religious debate, the exaggeratedly partisan church history of the earlier portion of the book, with its grotesque stories of popes and monks, contributed to fuel anti-Catholic prejudices in England, as did the story of the sufferings of several hundred Reformers (both Anglican and Protestant) who had been burnt at the stake under Mary and Bishop Bonner.|$|E
