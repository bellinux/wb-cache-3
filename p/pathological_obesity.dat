40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} is common and {{is determined by}} physiological (aging, physical fitness), <b>pathological</b> (<b>obesity)</b> and genetic factors. The metabolic compensatory response to insulin {{resistance is}} hyperinsulinaemia, {{the primary purpose of}} which is to maintain normal glucose tolerance. The ‘carnivore connection ’ postulates a critical role for the quantity of dietary protein and carbohydrate and the change in the glycaemic index of dietary carbohydrate in the evolution of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. Insulin resistance offered survival and reproductive advantages during the Ice Ages which dominated human evolution, during which a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet was consumed. Following {{the end of the last}} Ice Age and the advent of agriculture, dietary carbohydrate increased. Although this resulted in a sharp increase in the quantity of carbohydrate consumed, these traditional carbohydrate foods had a low glycaemic index and produced only modest increases in plasma insulin. The industrial revolution changed the quality of dietary carbohydrate. The milling of cereals made starch more digestible and postprandial glycaemic and insulin responses increased 2 – 3 fold compared with coarsely ground flour or whole grains. This combination of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia is a common feature of many modern day diseases. Over the last 50 y the explosion of convenience and takeaway ‘fast foods ’ has exposed most populations to caloric intakes far in excess of daily energy requirements and the resulting obesity has been a major factor in increasing the prevalence of insulin resistance...|$|E

40|$|Because the {{prevalence}} of obesity has increased dramatically in recent years, {{one of the key}} targets of public health is obesity and its associated <b>pathological</b> conditions. <b>Obesity</b> occurs as a result of white adipose tissue enlargement, caused by adipocyte hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy. Recently, endocrine aspects of adipose tissue have become an active research area and these adipose tissue-derived factors are referred to as adipokines. These adipokines interact with a range of processes in many different organ systems and influence a various systemic phenomena. Therefore, dysregulated production of adipokines has been found to participate in the development of metabolic and vascular diseases related to obesity. The obese state is also known to be associated with increased local and systemic inflammation. Adipokines influence not only systemic insulin resistance and have pathophysiological roles in the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, but also contribute toward an increase in local and systemic inflammation. Thus, circulating levels of adipokines can be used as high-throughput biomarkers to assess the obesity-related health problems, including low grade inflammation. This review focuses on the usefulness of measuring circulating adipokine levels for the assessment of obesity-related health problems. </p...|$|R

In {{pathophysiological}} conditions such as Prader–Willi syndrome and ghrelinoma, elevated ghrelin plasma levels are associated with <b>pathological</b> <b>obesity.</b> Clinical {{studies have shown that}} somatostatin downregulates ghrelin plasma levels in healthy volunteers. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of two somatostatin analogues, SOM 230 and octreotide, on ghrelin secretion in rats. Methods: Ghrelin secretion was either unstimulated or stimulated by overnight fasting. Treatment with SOM 230 and octreotide was either acute (s. c. injection 1 h before blood sampling) or prolonged (continuous s. c. infusion via 14 -day osmotic minipumps). Results: Acute treatment with octreotide dose-dependently inhibited unstimulated and stimulated secretion of total and active ghrelin. SOM 230 (30 mg/kg) inhibited active ghrelin in fasted rats. Lower doses had no effect. After 7 days of treatment, active ghrelin was strongly inhibited by both compounds in fasted animals, with a stronger effect for octreotide. Lower inhibition was achieved in fed rats. After 14 days, the inhibition with octreotide in fasted rats was lower and SOM 230 had no effect. Somatostatin receptor expression analysis in the rat glandular stomach revealed a predominant sst 1 and sst 2 expression, low expression of sst 3 and sst 4, and hardly detectable sst 5 mRNA expression. Conclusions: Somatostatin analogues may be useful for the inhibition of physiologically elevated ghrelin plasma levels.

In such patients previous controlled diet programs failed to achieve and maintain weight loss. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the weight decrease induced by IB placement. Methods. Thirty patients were admitted to the study (age: 22 – 64 years; 11 males). The patients weight ranged 90 – 180 and BMI ranged 30 – 57.

The results of the various tests were subdivided into three levels (0  = normal, 1  = moderately altered, 2  = seriously altered). The impression cytology and adaptometry results were correlated with vitamin A levels and other patient data (age, nutritional condition, time since operation, percentage weight loss). All the examinations were repeated after intramuscular therapy with vitamin A.  RESULTS—Corneoconjunctival alterations visible with fluorescein and rose bengal staining were present in 67. 7 % of cases, impression cytology alterations in 93. 7 %, adaptometric alterations in 82. 2 %; vitamin A plasma levels were below normal in 95. 8 % of cases. After the therapy with vitamin A a significant reduction was found for every examination. The correlation between impression cytology and adaptometry and vitamin A plasma levels and between corneoconjunctival alterations and vitamin A plasma levels was significant.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Obesity-induced hepatic fat {{accumulation}} or nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is the leading}} cause of liver disease in the United States. Unfortunately, NALFD patients are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The development of hepatic steatosis is multi-factorial and leads to a variety of pathologies. Yet, the molecular mechanisms behind liver disease during hepatic fat accumulation remain unclear. Here, we describe novel mechanisms of impaired liver function in the context of obesity-induced hepatic stress. Using chemical- and fatty acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we discovered ER stress decreases the activation of the pro-growth, pro survival, receptor tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in vitro. Importantly, EGFR was inhibited during these stress conditions by the induction and stabilization of mitogen inducible gene 6 (Mig 6). Furthermore, Mig 6 knockdown in vitro enhanced EGFR signaling and promoted survival. We demonstrated that mice fed a high fat diet have decreased EGFR activation and increased Mig 6 protein expression, likely due to obesity-induced ER stress. To determine the functional consequences of increased Mig 6 expression, we generated Mig 6 liver-specific knockout mice (Mig 6 LKO) and subjected them to high fat feeding. During diet-induced obesity, Mig 6 LKO mice had improved hepatic glucose tolerance despite no improvements in whole-body insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Hepatic insulin signaling, measured by AKT activation, was similar between Mig 6 LKO and littermate controls. However, several insulin-sensitive genes involved in gluconeogenesis were altered in Mig 6 LKO mice compared to controls. In addition, Mig 6 LKO mice had higher plasma high density lipoproteins and triglycerides despite similar liver lipid content. Using RNA sequencing we discovered Mig 6 regulates several metabolic pathways in liver. These findings indicated Mig 6 not only controls hepatic growth and survival but also regulates metabolism. This work will help us to better understand how augmented growth factor signaling impacts metabolic regulation during <b>pathological</b> <b>obesity...</b>|$|E
40|$|The pineal gland {{has become}} the subject of {{considerable}} investigation as it provides a productive experimental model for studying circadian rhythms and regulation of end organs. In the rat, the pineal gland provides a convenient model for investigating the noradrenergic receptor system {{and the effects of}} various drugs on this system. The effect of appetite suppressants on the rat pineal gland function is described. Appetite suppressants increase melatonin synthesis in organ cultures of rat pineal glands. This effect appears to be mediated by noradrenaline acting on β-adrenoceptors on the pinealocyte membrane. When β-adrenoceptors are blocked, the appetite suppressant-induced rise in melatonin synthesis is prevented. Depletion of noradrenaline in sympathetic nerve terminals also prevented the appetite suppressant-induced rise in melatonin synthesis. Activation of β-adrenoceptors is followed by a rise in N-acetyltransferase activity via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system. The effect of appetite suppressants on the activity of liver tryptophan pyrrolase was also investigated. The activity of this enzyme is an important determinant of tryptophan availability to the brain and consequently of brain serotonin levels. The results show that appetite suppressants inhibit both holoenzyme and total enzyme activities of tryptophan pyrrolase. This finding suggests that appetite suppressants may act by inhibiting tryptophan pyrrolase activity thereby increasing brain serotonin, a phenomenon known to be associated with anorexia. There are two possible mechanisms by which appetite suppressants inhibit tryptophan pyrrolase activity. Firstly, these agents, being drugs of dependence, may increase liver NADPH concentrations which inhibit pyrrolase activity. Secondly, appetite suppressants may act on the pineal gland to stimulate melatonin synthesis. Melatonin inhibits pyrrolase activity in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition will elevate plasma tryptophan levels which result in a rise in brain serotonin synthesis. The present study suggests a possible relationship between the pineal gland and appetite centres in the hypothalamus. Melatonin may have a direct effect on appetite centres since food restriction is associated with an increased melatonin binding in the hypothalamus. If this possible relationship can be extended, melatonin can open new possibilities for the control of food intake and consequently, of <b>pathological</b> <b>obesity.</b> ...|$|E

As long as the meals contain enough fat, a transient increase in triacylglycerolaemia and a change in lipoprotein pattern occurs. The extent and kinetics of such postprandial changes are highly variable and are modulated by numerous factors. This review focuses on factors affecting postprandial lipoprotein metabolism and genes, their variability and their relationship with intermediate phenotypes and risk of CHD. Postprandial lipoprotein metabolism is modulated by background dietary pattern as well as meal composition (fat amount and type, carbohydrate, protein, fibre, alcohol) and several lifestyle conditions (physical activity, tobacco use), physiological factors (age, gender, menopausal status) and <b>pathological</b> conditions (<b>obesity,</b> insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus). The roles of many genes have been explored {{in order to establish}} the possible implications of their variability in lipid metabolism and CHD risk.

30|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is defined as}} metabolic disorder that results from impaired insulin secretion and action. However, it is now {{believed to be a}} manifestation of ongoing sub-clinical inflammatory response (Schmidt et al. 1999), the molecular origin of which is unknown, probably involving cross-talks between metabolic and inflammatory pathways. One such response linking metabolic and inflammatory pathways is the activation of TNF-TNFR axis through an adipokine, Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) (Hotamisligil et al. 1993; Uysal et al. 1997). The most crucial player of this pathway is TNFR 2, type 2 receptor for TNFα because of its involvement in lipid and glucose metabolism in addition to its role in inflammation and apoptosis. TNFR 2 is also an important contributor to insulin resistance (Liu et al. 1998). Increased TNFR 2 expression and plasma soluble TNFR 2 levels have been found in various <b>pathological</b> conditions including <b>obesity,</b> insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases (Hotamisligil et al. 1997; Fernandez-Real et al. 1998; Shai et al. 2005).|$|R

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} inducers of angiogenesis, therefore blocking angiogenesis has led to great promise in the treatment of various cancers and inflammatory diseases. VEGF, expressed in response to soluble mediators such as cytokines and growth factors, is important in the physiological development of blood vessels as well as development of vessels in tumors. In cancer patients VEGF levels are increased, and the expression of VEGF is associated with poor prognosis in diseases. VEGF is a mediator of angiogenesis and inflammation which are closely integrated processes in a number of physiological and <b>pathological</b> conditions including <b>obesity,</b> psoriasis, autoimmune diseases and tumor. Mast cells can be activated by anti-IgE to release potent mediators of inflammation and can also respond to bacterial or viral antigens, cytokines, growth factors and hormones, leading to differential release of distinct mediators without degranulation.

Here we report a strong link between VEGF and mast cells and we depict their role in inflammation and immunity...|$|R
40|$|Although {{described}} initially as an intracellular adipocyte-specific triacylglycerol lipase, it is {{now clear}} that HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) is expressed in multiple tissues and plays a number of roles in lipid metabolism, including that of a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase. The major isoform is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of approx. 84 kDa and which comprises three major domains: a catalytic domain, a regulatory domain encoding several phosphorylation sites and an N-terminal domain involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. The activity of HSL is regulated acutely by several mechanisms, including reversible phosphorylation by a number of different protein kinases, translocation to different sites within the cell and interaction with a number of proteins, some of which may serve to direct the inhibitory products of HSL away from the protein. It is also apparent from work with HSL null mice that more than one enzyme species may be classified as a hormone-sensitive lipase. The possible presence of HSL in macrophages remains controversial, and the role of the protein in pancreatic beta-cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Altered expression of HSL in different cell types may be associated with a number of <b>pathological</b> states, including <b>obesity,</b> atherosclerosis and Type II diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of chronic liver injury across the world. It is also {{strongly}} related to other <b>pathological</b> conditions, including <b>obesity,</b> diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Pathogenesis of NAFLD remains not fully characterized but is generally attributed to the occurrence of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism dysfunction, 0 oxidative stress, inflammation, and necro-apoptosis. Every potential therapeutic strategy should target one or some of these pathological events in the liver. Over the past decades, application of herbal treatment for NAFLD has received increasing attention due to its wide availability, low side effects, and proven therapeutic mechanisms and benefits. In recent years, some monomers and certain functional mixtures of herbs have been extensively examined for their potential uses in NAFLD treatment. In the present review, we selected several herbal derivatives under intense basic and/or clinical investigations by carrying out a PubMed search of English language articles relevant to herbal derivatives and NAFLD, such as polysaccharide portion of wolfberry, garlic-derived monomers, red grape-derived resveratrol, and milk thistle-derived substances. They have been shown to target the pathological events during NAFLD initiation and progression both in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Although more detailed mechanistic researches and long-term clinical evaluations are needed for their future applications, they offer unanticipated and great health benefits without obvious adverse effects in NAFLD therapy. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Role of <b>obesity</b> in renal <b>pathological</b> and {{structural}} changes remains poorly investigated, and {{this study was}} designed to examine the <b>pathological</b> effects of <b>obesity</b> on renal structural components in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). METHODS: The study subjects were obese (body mass index, BMI > or = 25 kg/m 2) patients with nonglomerulonephritis (non-GN, n = 26), IgA nephropathy (IgAN, n = 19), benign nephrosclerosis (BNS, n = 15), and thin basement membrane disease (TMD, n = 6), and 65 nonobese controls (n = 20, 20, 10, and 15, respectively). Patients were evaluated for glomerular lesions (mesangial proliferation and focal segmental/global glomerulosclerosis), glomerular size, and thickness of glomerular basement membrane (GBM). RESULTS: Urinary protein was higher in obese non-GN, IgAN, and BNS groups than in the respective controls. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesions were noted in all obesity groups. The glomeruli were larger in size in obese than in nonobese patients of the non-GN and IgAN groups. The glomeruli of nonobese TMD and BNS patients were significantly larger in size than those of nonobese non-GN patients. GBM were thicker in obese than in nonobese patients irrespective of types of glomerular diseases, but only significantly so in non-GN and BNS groups. CONCLUSION: In non-GN, IgAN, and BNS, obesity worsens proteinuria and is associated with structural changes such as glomerulomegaly and GBM thickening, similar to changes observed in obesity-related nephropathy. Obesity seems to worsen the renopathological state in CKD...|$|R
40|$|Most notable {{among the}} acute phase {{proteins}} is serum amyloid A (SAA), levels {{of which can}} increase 1000 -fold during infections, aseptic inflammation, and/or trauma. Chronically elevated SAA levels {{are associated with a}} wide variety of <b>pathological</b> conditions, including <b>obesity</b> and rheumatic diseases. Using a recombinant hybrid of the two human SAA isoforms (SAA 1 and 2) that does not exist in vivo, numerous in vitro studies have given rise to the notion that acute phase SAA is a pro-inflammatory molecule with cytokine-like properties. It is however unclear whether endogenous acute phase SAA per se mediates pro-inflammatory effects. We tested this in samples from patients with inflammatory arthritis and in a transgenic mouse model that expresses human SAA 1. Endogenous human SAA did not drive production of pro-inflammatory IL- 8 /KC in either of these settings. Human neutrophils derived from arthritis patients displayed no signs of activation, despite being exposed to severely elevated SAA levels in circulation, and SAA-rich sera also failed to activate cells in vitro. In contrast, two recombinant SAA variants (the hybrid SAA and SAA 1) both activated human neutrophils, inducing L-selectin shedding, production of reactive oxygen species, and production of IL- 8. The hybrid SAA was approximately 100 -fold more potent than recombinant SAA 1. Recombinant hybrid SAA and SAA 1 activated neutrophils through different receptors, with recombinant SAA 1 being a ligand for formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR 2). We conclude that even though recombinant SAAs can be valuable tools for studying neutrophil activation, they do not reflect the nature of the endogenous protein...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} {{regulatory}} RNAs that play {{important roles in}} development of diseases. Several studies have provided evidences showing that miRNAs affect pathways that are fundamental for metabolic control in adipocyte and skeletal muscle differentiations. Some miRNAs have been implicated in lipid, amino acid, and glucose homeostasis. This leads {{to the possibility that}} miRNAs may contribute to common metabolic diseases and point to novel therapeutic opportunities based on targeting of miRNAs. CONTENT: miRNAs have been recognized as a class of epigenetic regulators of metabolism and energy homeostasis, primarily because the simultaneous regulation {{of a large number of}} target genes can be accomplished by a single miRNA. Emerging evidences suggest that miRNAs play a key role in the <b>pathological</b> development of <b>obesity</b> by affecting adipocyte differentiation. miRNAs have been implicated as novel protagonists in the pathogenesis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), regulation of insulin production, secretion and action. They also appear to play a role in the development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy and cardiac hypertrophy. SUMMARY: Involvement of miRNAs in glucose and lipid metabolism has provided strong evidences to confirm their roles as key players in regulation of complex metabolic pathways. Additionally, it indicates potential outlook for novel therapeutic strategies in the management of obesity, metabolic syndrome and DM. Further research in this field is needed to ascertain the full potential of miRNAs as novel metabolic biomarkers and potent therapeutic agents against obesity and its metabolic disorders.
