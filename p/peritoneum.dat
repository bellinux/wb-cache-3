5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the <b>peritoneum</b> causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the heart}} varies among the {{different}} animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging {{from those of the}} smallest mice (12mg) to the blue whale (600kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies {{in the middle of the}} ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. which in some fish may be connected to the <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by <b>peritoneum,</b> which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the <b>peritoneum</b> (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, <b>peritoneum</b> (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her <b>peritoneum.</b> She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{bodies in}} the <b>peritoneum</b> can include {{retained}} surgical instruments after abdominal surgery. Rarely, an intrauterine device can perforate the uterine wall and enter the <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carcinosis of the <b>peritoneum</b> {{may cause}} pain through inflammation, disordered visceral motility, or {{pressure}} of the metastases on nerves. Once a tumor has penetrated or perforated hollow viscera, acute inflammation of the <b>peritoneum</b> appears, inducing severe abdominal pain. Pleural carcinomatosis is normally painless.|$|E
25|$|The stomach also {{possesses}} a serosa, consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Others—in the minority—are of {{the view}} that {{abdominal}} pregnancy should be defined by a placenta implanted into the <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} colon is encased in <b>peritoneum,</b> {{and is therefore}} mobile (unlike {{the parts of the}} colon immediately before and after it).|$|E
25|$|The gonads are the {{precursors}} of the testes in males and ovaries in females. They initially develop from the mesothelial {{layer of the}} <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rationalization}} of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy {{permits the}} surgeon to differentiate both from intraperitoneal adhesions—also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral {{aspect of the}} <b>peritoneum</b> overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal <b>peritoneum</b> in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the <b>peritoneum</b> proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either {{intraperitoneal}} or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of <b>peritoneum,</b> so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by <b>peritoneum</b> and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|All {{chordates}} are coelomates, {{and have}} a fluid filled body cavity called a coelom with a complete lining called <b>peritoneum</b> derived from mesoderm (see Brusca and Brusca).|$|E
25|$|As the {{inflammation}} progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly {{to the right}} lower quadrant, as the <b>peritoneum</b> becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal <b>peritoneum</b> is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.|$|E
25|$|Properitoneal hernia: rare hernia located {{directly}} above the <b>peritoneum,</b> for example, when {{part of an}} inguinal hernia projects from the deep inguinal ring to the preperitoneal space.|$|E
25|$|Congenital diaphragmatic hernia* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Most diaphragmatic hernias {{are caused by}} trauma. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are usually communications between the <b>peritoneum</b> and pericardium. They are often incidental findings.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{forms are}} those {{affecting}} {{the lining of}} the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, anus), larynx, and other mucosal surfaces including the genitals, <b>peritoneum,</b> ears, nose, bladder and conjunctiva of the eyes.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower part}} of the right half, below the {{transverse}} colon, is covered by <b>peritoneum</b> continuous with the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon, and is in contact with the coils of the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|Gunshot wounds, {{which are}} higher energy than stab wounds, are usually more {{damaging}} than the latter. Gunshot wounds that penetrate the <b>peritoneum</b> result in significant damage to major intra-abdominal structures in some 90 percent of cases.|$|E
25|$|Sliding hernia: {{occurs when}} an organ drags along {{part of the}} <b>peritoneum,</b> or, in other words, the organ {{is part of the}} hernia sac. The colon and the urinary bladder are often involved. The term also {{frequently}} refers to sliding hernias of the stomach.|$|E
25|$|The {{outer layer}} of the fundus of gallbladder, and the {{surfaces}} not {{in contact with the}} liver, are covered by a thick serosa, which is exposed to the <b>peritoneum.</b> The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics. The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue.|$|E
25|$|Abdominocentesis, or the {{extraction}} of fluid from the <b>peritoneum,</b> {{can be useful in}} assessing the state of the intestines. Normal peritoneal fluid is clear, straw-colored, and of serous consistency, with a total nucleated cell count of less than 5000 cells/microliter (24–60% which are neutrophils) and a total protein of 2.5 g/dL.|$|E
25|$|Salpingitis is an {{infection}} and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes. It {{is often used}} synonymously with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although PID lacks an accurate definition and can refer to several diseases of the female upper genital tract, such as endometritis, oophoritis, myometritis, parametritis and infection in the pelvic <b>peritoneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The apex (prev.vertex) is {{directed}} forward toward {{the upper part}} of the pubic symphysis, and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. The <b>peritoneum</b> is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold.|$|E
25|$|Primary peritoneal carcinomas develop {{from the}} <b>peritoneum,</b> a {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} abdominal cavity that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary. They are often discussed and classified with ovarian cancers when they affect the ovary. They can develop even after the ovaries have been removed and may appear similar to mesothelioma.|$|E
25|$|Surgical techniques, using a tube or {{catheter}} {{to drain}} fluid from the <b>peritoneum,</b> chest, or the pericardium around the heart, often {{are used in}} cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially {{when a person is}} experiencing early signs of shock. In those with low blood-pressure, likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, cutting through the abdominal wall surgically is indicated.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{abdominal}} pregnancy {{refers to}} a pregnancy that first implanted directly in the <b>peritoneum,</b> save for the tubes and ovaries; such pregnancies are very rare, only 24 cases having been reported by 2007. Typically an abdominal pregnancy is a secondary implantation which means that it originated from a tubal (less common an ovarian) pregnancy and re-implanted. Other mechanisms for secondary abdominal pregnancy include uterine rupture, rupture of a uterine rudimentary horn and fimbrial abortion.|$|E
25|$|While {{the base}} of the {{appendix}} is at a fairly constant location—2cm below the ileocecal valve, the tip of the appendix can be variably located—in the pelvis, outside the <b>peritoneum</b> or behind the cecum. The prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations with the retrocecal position being most common in Ghana and Sudan, with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence respectively, in comparison to Iran and Bosnia where the pelvic position is most common, with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} surgical procedures {{that can be}} employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending {{on the extent of}} the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the <b>peritoneum</b> and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.|$|E
25|$|Hydrosalpinx may be {{diagnosed}} using ultrasonography as the fluid filled elongated and distended tubes display their typical echolucent pattern. However, a small hydrosalpinx may be missed by sonography. During an infertility work-up a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), an X-ray procedure {{that uses a}} contrast agent to image the fallopian tubes, shows the retort-like shape of the distended tubes {{and the absence of}} spillage of the dye into the <b>peritoneum.</b> If, however, there is a tubal occlusion at the utero-tubal junction, a hydrosalpinx may go undetected. When a hydrosalpinx is detected by an HSG it is prudent to administer antibiotics {{to reduce the risk of}} reactivation of an inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins are spiky {{echinoderms}} with spherical bodies {{which usually}} contain five gonads. They move slowly, feed mostly on seaweed, and {{are important for}} the diet of sea otters. Sea urchins are dioecious, having separate male and female sexes, although there is generally {{no easy way to}} distinguish the two. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the <b>peritoneum,</b> and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place. Their roe (male and female gonads) is soft and melting, with a colour ranging from orange to pale yellow, and is sought after as a human delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean section can be {{performed}} with single or double layer suturing of the uterine incision. Single layer closure compared with double layer closure has been observed to result in reduced blood loss during the surgery. It is uncertain whether this is the direct effect of the suturing technique or if other {{factors such as the}} type and site of abdominal incision contribute to reduced blood loss. Standard procedure includes the closure of the <b>peritoneum.</b> However, research questions this may not be needed, with some studies indicating peritoneal closure is associated with longer operative time and hospital stay. The Misgave Ladach method is a surgery technical that may have fewer secondary complications and faster healing, due to the insertion into the muscle.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{hemorrhage}} into a {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} causes severe upper right quadrant pain, {{and may be}} life-threatening, requiring emergency surgery or other emergency intervention. A tumor can expand {{the size of the}} liver several times and consequent stretching of its capsule can cause aching pain in the right hypochondrium. Other causes of pain in enlarged liver are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal <b>peritoneum</b> against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain.|$|E
25|$|Interposed {{between the}} hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the {{transverse}} colon along a further band or fold of <b>peritoneum.</b> Dissection through this allows {{access to the}} cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon {{is associated with a}} similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.|$|E
