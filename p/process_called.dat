5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> translation.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one thousand million) kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E
5|$|After these disappointments, Pioneer Pictures {{released}} a short film in three-strip technicolor called La Cucaracha which was well received. The film won an Academy Award in 1934. Pioneer released the first full-length technicolor film, Becky Sharp in 1935. Cooper helped to advocate and {{pave the way}} for the ground-breaking technology of technicolor, as well as the widescreen <b>process</b> <b>called</b> Cinerama.|$|E

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> class {{switching}} {{that changes the}} one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be {{produced}} in a simple <b>process</b> (<b>called</b> sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E

5|$|Ida's {{regolith}} {{is composed}} of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> space weathering. Because of this process, older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> reassortment.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, {{to eat and}} kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative <b>process</b> <b>called</b> follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} a button of silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like <b>process</b> <b>called</b> a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} chrysalis.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that the}} coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form by different <b>process,</b> <b>called</b> enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research since the early 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore do not imply that brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a <b>process</b> <b>called</b> annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
