40|$|Increasing {{parts of}} the world are facing ageing {{societies}} with growing figures of morbidity and disability. Focus of attention for European countries is directed towards prevention of old age impairment. As considerable time is spent at <b>work,</b> preventative <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment measures could be entry points for a healthier ageing. The aims of this study are to i) explore the impact of mid-life <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> on old age disability ii) to examine the independent effects of the <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> components on disability, iii) to analyse the relation between education and disability and whether <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> mediates parts of this association. <b>Work</b> <b>strain</b> and baseline data will be collected from Level of Living Survey (LNU) 1981 and disability data from Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old (SWEOLD) 2004 (n= 626). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that persons in high <b>strain</b> <b>work</b> had the lowest odds of being IADL disabled compared to the passive group. Low demand was not associated to disability, low control group had more than twice the odds of being ADL disabled. Further results indicated that <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> may mediate the association between education and disability.

40|$|Abstract Background Germany {{currently}} {{experiences a}} situation of major physician attrition. The incompatibility between work and family has been discussed {{as one of the}} major reasons for the increasing departure of German physicians for non-clinical occupations or abroad. This study investigates predictors for one particular direction of Work-Family Conflict – namely work interfering with family conflict (WIF) – which are located within the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment or work organisation of hospital physicians. Furthermore, effects of WIF on the individual physicians' physical and mental health were examined. Analyses were performed with an emphasis on gender differences. Comparisons with the general German population were made. Methods Data were collected by questionnaires as part of a study on <b>Psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> hazards and <b>strains</b> of German hospital physicians during April–July 2005. Two hundred and ninety-six hospital physicians (response rate 38. 9 %) participated in the survey. The Copenhagen <b>Psychosocial</b> Questionnaire (COPSOQ), <b>work</b> interfering with family conflict scale (WIF), and hospital-specific single items on work organisation were used to assess WIF, its predictors, and consequences. Results German hospital physicians reported elevated levels of WIF (mean = 74) compared to the general German population (mean = 45, p p Conclusion In our study, work interfering with family conflict (WIF) as part of Work-Family Conflict (WFC) was highly prevalent among German hospital physicians. Factors of work organisation as well as factors of interpersonal relations at work were identified as significant predictors for WIF. Some of these predictors are accessible to alteration by improving work organisation in hospitals. </p...|$|R
40|$|The undisputed {{increase}} of the relevance of mental work load is confronted {{with a lack of}} qualified or at least well documented measuring instruments covering all important aspects. The COPSOQ (Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire), a comprehensive instrument for the assessment of <b>psychosocial</b> factors at <b>work,</b> was tested in a partly modified version in a large German sample (N = 2561 employees). The aims of the study were the detailed investigation of the psychometric measurement properties, and based on these results, the development of an abbreviated version of the instrument. The analysis of objectivity, acceptance, practicability, sensitivity and content validity of the questionnaire as a whole did not show any problematic results – with some limitations regarding the length of the questionnaire. The assessment of the reliability, generalisability, construct validity, criterion validity and diagnostic power of the single scales showed medium to good measuring qualities {{for the majority of the}} scales (i. e. Cronbach’s alpha mostly > 0. 7). In addition, the psychometric properties were very similar to those in the Danish COPSOQ-study. Considering all aspects of the measurement quality, a shortened version of the instrument was created. It attempts to combine measuring qualities as high as possible with a number of questions as low as possible. The German COPSOQ questionnaire is a free screening-instrument for the recording of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> load and <b>strain</b> for all enterprises and organisations interested. The next step is the construction of a "job exposure matrix" for <b>psychosocial</b> factors at <b>work,</b> that means a central database with work load profiles and reference values for as many occupational groups as possible...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physician {{jobs are}} {{associated}} with adverse <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions. We summarize research {{on the relationship of}} physicians' <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions and quality of care. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycINFO. All studies were classified into three categories of care quality outcomes: Associations between physicians' <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions and (1) the physician-patient-relationship, or (2) the care process and outcomes, or (3) medical errors were examined. Results: 12 publications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies relied on observational cross-sectional and controlled intervention designs. All studies provide at least partial support for physicians’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions being related to quality of care. Conclusions: This review found preliminary evidence that detrimental physicians’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions adversely influence patient care quality. Future research needs to apply strong designs to disentangle the indirect and direct effects of adverse <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions on physicians as well as on quality of care.

40|$|Abstract Background Attempts to {{identify}} particular aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions {{as predictors of}} sickness absence remain inconclusive. A global measure has previously been suggested to be {{an efficient way to}} measure <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions in questionnaires. This paper investigates whether satisfaction with specific aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions explains sickness absence beyond its association with a global measure of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions. Methods The participants were 13, 437 employees from 698 public service workplaces in Aarhus County, Denmark. 33 items from a questionnaire fell in groupings around six aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions: skill discretion, professionalism, management, decision authority, workload and cooperation. A global measure rating satisfaction with <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions on a scale from 0 to 10 was also included in the questionnaire. Individual ratings were aggregated to workplace scores. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression was used to compare the average number of days of yearly sickness absence with different levels of satisfaction with six aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions. The covariates included were gender, age, occupation, size of workplace, contact to hospital, civil status and children below 13 living at home. Results Dissatisfaction with each of the six aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions was associated with an increase in sickness absence. When all aspects were simultaneously included in the model, only skill discretion and professionalism were negatively associated with sickness absence. When a global measure of satisfaction with <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions was also included in the model none of the specific aspects showed a statistically significant association with sickness absence. Conclusion Low global satisfaction with <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions is associated with increased levels of sickness absence. Including specific aspects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions in the model does not provide further information regarding the nature of this association. </p...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient {{competence}} among {{nursing staff}} {{is a major}} concern in elderly care worldwide as the healthcare needs of the elderly become increasingly complex. In previous research, insufficient competence has been associated with work dissatisfaction and stress among elderly care nurses, and with lower quality of care. This thesis describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an educational intervention for nursing staff in elderly care. In a prospective, controlled study, evaluation of the educational toolbox was based on nursing staff ratings of their competence and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment, as well as on care recipients’ and family relatives’ ratings of the quality of elderly care. Paper I validated a questionnaire measuring care recipient relatives’ perceptions of quality of care. Paper II compared self-rated competence, <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> stress, and <b>work</b> satisfaction between staff working in home-based care and nursing homes. Papers III and IV evaluated the impact of the educational intervention on staff perceptions of their competence and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment (Paper III) and on care recipients’ and relatives’ perceptions of the quality of care (Paper IV). The results showed that staff ratings of their competence and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment, including work satisfaction and work stress, improved significantly over time in the intervention municipality, compared to the reference group. Neither care recipients’ nor relatives’ ratings of the quality of care changed significantly over time in the intervention organization. Furthermore, there were no significant interaction effects over time between the intervention and reference groups for quality ratings. These results indicate that an educational toolbox that can be used according to local workplace needs may be an effective and sustainable intervention for improving staff competence and the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment. However, further studies are needed to investigate whether, and under what conditions, improved staff competence and work environment have an impact on quality of care...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} to {{what extent}} <b>psychosocial.</b> <b>work</b> characteristics predict sickness absence in a cohort of 890 human service professionals (84 % women), followed-up for 3 years. We measured 16 different <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> characteristics at baseline and analysed their associations with number of sickness absence days at follow-up using multivariate Poisson regression. In addition, we computed a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment index, summarizing eight psychosocial scales. Participants with exposure to violence and threats, high emotional demands, high demands for hiding emotions, low influence at work, low meaning of work, low quality of management, and role conflicts had an increased number of sickness absence days at follow-up, after adjustment for numerous confounders. Adjusting for sickness absence history caused little change in most effect estimates. Scoring in the most adverse quartile of the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment index {{was associated with a}} 71 % increase in sickness absence days. Improving the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment index and eliminating exposure to violence and threats would have prevented 32 % of all sickness absence days in the study population. In particular we found that exposure to violence was a strong predictor of absence. This study shows that a wide range of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> characteristics contribute to sickness absence in human service workers. Improving the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment might help to reduce sickness absence in this population...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{examined}} the self-reported <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment for audiologists working in three practice types (public, completely private, and private but publicly funded). Design: A cross-sectional e-mail survey using the demand-control-support questionnaire, a short version of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire, and descriptive data. Study sample: Five-hundred Swedish licensed audiologists. Results: Overall, the results indicate differences in <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment pertaining to the practice types. These differences are small and the type explains few percent of the variability accounted in the measures of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment. Social support seems important for the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment and is considered a reward in itself. Using the demand-control model, 29 % of the audiologists reported working in a high-stress <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment. Using the ERI-ratio to estimate the imbalance between effort and reward it was shown that that 86 % of the participants experienced an unfavorable work situation where the rewards do not correspond to the efforts made. Conclusions: The organizational framework has minor effect on self-reported <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment for Swedish licensed audiologists. The percentage of unfavorable ERI-ratios seen in Swedish audiologists seems conspicuously high compared to other working populations in general, but also compared to other health service workers...|$|R

40|$|Psychological strain {{received}} considerable research {{attention in}} the organizational stress research. The prevalence of psychological strain at the workplace is explained by various theoretical models of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment such as job demand-control model, job demand-resources model, and effort-reward imbalance model. This study aims to investigate the effect of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment on psychological strain among employees in banking sector. In banking sector, the employees’ psychological strain is caused by unfeasible sales target, lower salaries, high workload and job insecurity. Thus, this study defines <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment as the combination of social and psychological aspect at work. The researcher integrates the effort-reward imbalance model and the organizational justice model as the predictor of psychological strain. The target population {{for the present study}} is specifically the bank tellers in a development financial institution (DFI) and a commercial bank. The data was collected quantitatively by distributing questionnaires. This study is a preliminary study. Thus, only 150 respondents were involved in this study.

Objective: The present study investigated how childhood mental ability and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> characteristics relate to health in terms of mental distress, neck/shoulder pain (NSP) and self-rated health (SRH). Methods: Data on childhood GMA, occupational level, self-reports of demands, control and social support and health (mental distress, NSP and SRH) in midlife came from working women (n= 271) and men (n= 291) included in a Swedish school cohort. Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for occupational level, were used to examine associations between childhood GMA, self-reports of high demands, low control and poor social support and the three health indicators. Taking into consideration the gendered labor market and variations in health patterns between women and men, gender specific analyses were performed. Results: There were no significant associations between childhood GMA and health indicators. Further, there were no significant interactions between GMA and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether {{the development of}} job involvement of primary healthcare (PHC) employees in Southern Municipality (SM), where PHC services were outsourced to an independent non-profit organisation, differed from that in the three comparison municipalities (M 1, M 2, M 3) with municipal service providers. Also, the associations of job involvement with factors describing the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment were investigated. Methods: A panel mail survey 2000 – 02 in Finland (n 369, response rates 73 % and 60 %). The data were analysed by descriptive statistics and multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: Despite the favourable development in the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment, job involvement decreased most in SM, which faced the biggest organisational changes. Job involvement decreased also in M 3, where the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment deteriorated most. Job involvement in 2002 was best predicted by high baseline level of interactional justice and work control, positive change in interactional justice, and higher age. Also other factors, such as organisational stability, seemed to play a role; after controlling for {{the effect of the}} <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> characteristics, job involvement was higher in M 3 than in SM.

In order to gain useful knowledge about the complex associations between unfavorable work environment and sickness absence, assessment tools of high quality should be of high priority. However, the employee surveys used in organizations today have been argued to vary greatly in regards to their quality. 	The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate if an actual employee survey can provide information on the associations between <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors and sickness absence.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, Swedish {{livestock}} farming has undergone considerable structural changes and technical development, which {{have influenced the}} work environment and health of the workers in several ways. The general aim of the studies {{was to investigate the}} work environment and health among Swedish livestock workers on large modern dairy and pig farms. The studies were mainly based on questionnaires. The results showed that the livestock workers reported high frequencies of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially in the upper extremities and in the back, and especially among the females. Body height or repetitive work among dairy farm workers and awkward working postures or being exposed to dust among pig farm workers were identified as potential risk factors for MSD in the upper extremities. No risk factors were identified for MSD in the back. Machine milking among the dairy farm workers and manual raking of manure among the pig farm workers were the most time-consuming work tasks and the tasks with the highest rated physical <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> (PWS). Milking in a rotary system was found to be demanding with respect to high values of velocities and repetitiveness and almost no time for rest for hands/wrists, which might be contributing factors for the development of symptoms and injuries in the hands. The livestock workers assessed their <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment and mental health as good, although the quality of leadership, feedback and social support was experienced as being slightly poorer on dairy farms compared to pig farms. No psychosocial risk factors were identified for MSD. Dairy farm workers working with healthy cows had poorer physical and mental health than those working with less healthy dairy cows.

This study assesses whether an improved compared to stable unfavourable and stable favourable {{exposure to}} <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors {{is associated with}} a change in mental health in older employees at 3 -year follow-up. Methods The current study used data from the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM), in workers aged 45 - 65 years (n = 5249). Two-year (2010 - 2012) exposure was assessed for psychological demands, autonomy, support, mental load, and distributive justice. Linear regression analyses were performed to compare improved exposure to unfavourable <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors with stable unfavourable and stable favourable exposure and mental health at follow-up (2013), corrected for confounders. Analyses were stratified for age groups (45 - 54 and 55 - 65 years) and gender. Results In certain subgroups, stable unfavourable exposure to psychological demands, autonomy, support, and distributive justice was associated with a significantly lower mental health score than improved exposure. Stable favourable exposure to support was associated with a higher mental health score than improved support, whereas stable favourable exposure to autonomy was associated with a lower mental health score compared to improved exposure. Conclusions There is a longitudinal association between changes in exposure to <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors and mental health. Improvement in unfavourable exposure to <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors was associated with improved mental health. This is important information for organisations that consider deploying measures to improve the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment of older workers.

40|$|Background: The {{associations}} between physical exercise, physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands, {{and risk of}} musculoskeletal pain are well documented. However, studies investigating these independent associations related {{to the risk of}} fibromyalgia (FM) are limited. Further, the protective effect of physical exercise on the risk of FM among subjects with physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands has never been assessed. Hence, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to examine the independent effect of leisure time physical exercise, physical <b>work</b> demands, and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands, on the future risk of FM. A second objective was to assess the combined effect of physical exercise and respectively, physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands, on the risk of FM to investigate if physical exercise could compensate for the possible adverse effects of high work demands. Methods: A population-based health survey (HUNT 1) was conducted from 1984 to 1986 in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, with follow-up during 1995 - 97 (HUNT 2). With baseline measurements of physical exercise (frequency, duration and intensity), and physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands, the risk of FM among 16, 785 women aged ≥ 20 years without FM or physical impairments at baseline was examined. Risk of FM was assessed by calculations of odds ratio (OR), with adjustments for possible confounders. Results: At follow-up, 366 cases of incident FM were reported. A moderate inverse dose-response association was found between physical exercise and risk of FM (P for trend, 0. 02), where women who reported ≥ 2. 0 hours of exercise per week had a 35 % lower risk of FM compared to inactive women (OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 42 - 1. 00). Furthermore, a positive dose-response association was observed between physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands and risk of FM (P for trend, < 0. 001 for both types of demands), with an OR of 2. 08 (95 % CI 1. 26 - 3. 43) and 2. 25 (95 % CI 1. 32 - 3. 82) among women who reported the highest level of physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands, respectively. The combined analysis showed an increased risk of FM among inactive women who reported high physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands; ORs were respectively 1. 86 (95 % CI 1. 29 - 2. 68) and 2. 18 (95 % CI 1. 48 - 3. 21). Conclusion: In this prospective longitudinal study of female workers, we found that being physical inactive during leisure time and having high physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands were associated with an increased risk of FM, whereas physical exercise seemed to reduce the risk of FM among women with high work demands. Thus, emphasizing the importance of leisure time physical exercise in relation with high physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> demands is important when recommending strategies for the prevention of FM...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions, {{health and}} {{leadership}} are concepts {{that have been}} studied for a long time, more knowledge is needed on how they are related in managers. Existing research suggests that managers are very influential in their workplaces, but {{the way in which}} their workplaces influence them is often overlooked. As a result, the potential reciprocity between managers’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions, health and leadership is not in focus. Furthermore, managers have often been studied as a uniform group and little consideration has been given to potential differences between managers at different managerial levels. The overall aim of this thesis is to increase knowledge about the relationships between managers’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions, their health, and their leadership; and to elucidate differences between managers at different managerial levels in these relationships. The thesis consists of four separate papers with specific aims. In Paper I, the aim was to compare the differences in work conditions and burnout at three hierarchical levels: subordinates, first-line managers, and middle managers; and to investigate if the association between work conditions and burnout differs for subordinates, first-line managers, and middle managers. In Paper II, the aim was to advance knowledge of workplace antecedents of transformational leadership, by investigating what <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions of first-line managers are associated with their display of transformational leadership; and whether superiors’ leadership is associated with first-line managers’ display of transformational leadership. In Paper III, the aim was to deepen the understanding of how managers’ health and leadership is related by combining two perspectives in previous research. The two specific research questions were: What <b>psychosocial</b> conditions at <b>work</b> affect managers’ health? How does managers’ health influence their leadership? In Paper IV, the aim was to further the understanding of managers’ perceptions of social support, and to increase our understanding of how managers perceive that receiving social support affects their managerial legitimacy. The empirical material is based on three research projects with quantitative and qualitative designs. Papers I and II are based on cross-sectional data from 4096 employees in nine Swedish organizations. Paper III is based on 42 interviews with managers in a Swedish industrial production company, and Paper IV is based on 62 interviews with managers in a Swedish industrial production company and a Swedish municipality. The interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis. The results showed that <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions and symptoms of burnout generally differed between subordinates and managers, and few {{differences were found between the}} managerial levels (Paper I). However, in the associations between <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions and symptoms of burnout, similarities were found between subordinates and first-line managers, while middle managers differed. First-line managers’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions were also found to be associated with their display of transformational leadership (Paper II). <b>Psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions were perceived to influence managers’ performance and health, and particularly first-line managers described being dependent on favourable work conditions (Paper III). Furthermore, managers’ health was perceived to influence their leadership, and affect both the quality of their work and the quality of their relationships with subordinates. Managers’ social support came from different people within and outside their workplace (Paper IV). Support that concerned their work came from people within the workplace and was perceived to increase their managerial legitimacy, whereas support that concerned personal and sensitive matters was sought from those outside the workplace so that their managerial legitimacy would not be questioned. The results suggest that managers’ <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions, health and leadership are closely related and can be conceptualized as reciprocal spirals. Some resources in the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment, such as social support, may be hard to take advantage of, even if they are available. The <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions of managers at different managerial levels differ to some extent, which has consequences for how the relationship between <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions, health and leadership is expressed. Especially first-line managers seem to be in a vulnerable position because their influence  s more restricted, and they are more dependent on favourable <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> conditions...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} (1) perceived stress as felt by the nursing staff working in psychiatric inpatient care, (2) possible differences between nurses and nurse assistants, and (3) associations among individual characteristics, the ward atmosphere, the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment, and perceived stress. Ninety-three members of the nursing staff completed three instruments [...] one each measuring perceived stress, the ward atmosphere, and the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment. There were no differences among the staff groups concerning perceived stress.

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To study leadership factors and their associations with <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environmental among nursing assistants who {{are engaged in}} old age care and to analyse (i) differences {{in the assessment of}} leadership factors and the assessment of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environmental in nursing homes and home help services and (ii) the association between the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment and factors that are related to leadership in nursing homes and home help services. Background Leadership factors are an important element of the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing assistants is larger in home help services than in nursing homes. Therefore, it is important to study leadership separately in nursing homes and home help services. Design Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in nursing homes and 288 in home help services (45 nursing homes and 21 home help service units) were analysed. Methods The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally controlled in Model 2. Results <b>Psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in nursing homes than in home help services. Empowering leadership, support from superiors, the primacy of human resources and control over decisions were associated with higher assessments on all the variables that were related to the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment in both the nursing homes and home help services. Conclusions Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better prerequisites for creating and maintaining a positive <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment for nursing assistants in nursing homes and home help services. Implications for practice Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in prerequisites in conducting leadership. To influence nursing assistants' performance and to increase quality in old age care in the long term, appropriate leadership is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mental health {{problems}} (MHP) {{are the leading}} cause of disability worldwide. The inverse association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and MHP has been well documented. There is prospective evidence that factors from the work environment, including adverse <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors, could {{contribute to the development of}} MHP including psychological distress. However, the contribution of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors to social inequalities in MHP remains unclear. This study evaluates the contribution of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors from two highly supported models, the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) and the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) models to SEP inequalities of psychological distress in men and women from a population-based sample of Quebec workers. Methods Data were collected during a survey on working conditions, health and safety at work. SEP was evaluated using education, occupation and household income. <b>Psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors and psychological distress were assessed using validated instruments. Mean differences (MD) in the score of psychological distress were estimated separately for men and women. Results Low education level and low household income were associated with psychological distress among men (MD, 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 06; 1. 05) and 1. 26 (95 % CI 0. 79; 1. 73) respectively). In men, the contribution of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors from the DCS and the ERI models to the association between household income and psychological distress ranged from 9 % to 24 %. No clear inequalities were observed among women. Conclusions These results suggest that <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> factors from the DCS and the ERI models contribute to explain a part of social inequalities in psychological distress among men. <b>Psychosocial</b> factors at <b>work</b> are frequent and modifiable. The present study supports the relevance of targeting these factors for the primary prevention of MHP and for health policies aiming to reduce social inequalities in mental health...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to assess}} the effects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> {{environment}} and self-efficacy on stress, de-pression, and burn-out among office workers. Methods: Survey {{data were collected from}} 331 office workers who worked in one workplace from April 10 to 30, 2012. The impact of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment and self-efficacy on stress, depression, and burn-out was analyzed with hierarchical multiple regression using SAS version 9. 3. Results: Work-family conflicts and emotional demands were identified as main factors influencing mental health. Other work environment factors influencing mental health were role clarity for stress, possibilities for development, meaning-of work, social support-from supervisors and job insecurity for depression, and social community at work for burn-out. Self-efficacy was correlated with most <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environment and factor with independent influence on stress and depression. The final models including general characteristics, <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> environ-ment, and self-efficacy accounted for 34 %, 44 %, and 36 % for stress, depression, and burn-out respectively.

40|$|In the Job Demand Control Model (JDCM) and the EFQM Excellence Model, <b>psychosocial</b> <b>work</b> {{conditions}} {{are regarded as}} critical factors for {{the functioning of the}} personnel and the organisation. In order to gain insight into the role of work conditions for the development of <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and well-being, an empirical study was conducted in an innovating addiction treatment centre in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Work Stress Monitor on Mental Health (WSMMH) was used as a measure of the JDCM. A cohort of 209 employees of an addiction treatment centre, in which a far-reaching innovation programme was carried out, participated in this study. With the exception of physical demands, job demands, were high, whereas job controls and the organisational supports were low. Seven out of the 18 work condition scales significantly predicted <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and well-being. Age and educational level were positive related to well-being. Compared with other health care sectors, work in this addiction treatment centre can be characterised as high-demand low-control and thus as a high strain job. Seven important predictors for this undesirable situation were identified. These predictors can be translated into criteria for the EFQM Excellence Model and can be used to enhance the overall quality of addiction treatment service...|$|R
