5000|$|Rubble mound breakwaters use {{structural}} voids {{to dissipate}} the wave energy. Rock or concrete armour units {{on the outside}} of the structure absorb most of the energy, while gravels or sands prevent the wave energy's continuing through the breakwater core. The slopes of the revetment are typically between 1:1 and 1:2, depending upon the materials used. In shallow water, revetment breakwaters are usually relatively inexpensive. As water depth increases, the material requirements, and hence costs, increase significantly.New breakwaters, the wave attenuators - wawtech.net - are now available. Wave attenuators consist of concrete elements properly dimensioned ( [...] L = 2,10 m x H = 1,40 m x W = 2 m [...] ) placed horizontally just one feet under the free surface, positioned along a lone parallel to the coast.The wave attenuator has fours sea-side ( [...] seaward [...] ) slabs, one vertical slab and two rear-side ( [...] landward [...] )slabs each separated from the next by a space of 200 mm ( [...] 8" [...] ).An extra front-side ( [...] seaward [...] )shield stops the sand erosion near the installation area and the approaching of elements like plastic bags, all types of seaweeds, small size woods, etc. This row of 4 front side slabs and two rear side slabs, reflects the offshore wave by the action of the volume of water located under it which, made to oscillate under the effect of the incident wave, creates waves in <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> to the incident wave downstream from the slabs.The use of this type of wave attenuator solves a number of problems unsolved by rock breakwaters in the past.Such attenuators offer the following main advantages:- transparency to currents- no destruction of the seabed- partially invisible- maintenance of natural environments- coasts more competitive as water depth increases- possibility of modular installation- reversibility.- possibility to install each Wave attenuator elements stream-oriented or wind-oriented in order to stop the effect of the main erosion.- Realization of a sand-trap able to form new sand volumes.- Realization of a garbage-trap able to stop floating elements.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies {{endeavor}} to reveal periodicities in sensory and cognitive functions, by comparing the distribution of ongoing (pre-stimulus) oscillatory phases between two (or more) trial groups reflecting distinct experimental outcomes. A systematic relation between the phase of spontaneous electrophysiological signals, before a stimulus is even presented, and the eventual result of sensory or cognitive processing for that stimulus, would be indicative of an intrinsic periodicity in the underlying neural process. Prior studies of phase-dependent perception have {{used a variety of}} analytical methods to measure and evaluate phase differences, and there is currently no established standard practice in this field. The present report intends to remediate this need, by systematically comparing the statistical power of various measures of <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> between two trial groups, in a number of real and simulated experimental situations. Seven measures were evaluated: one parametric test (circular Watson-Williams test), and three distinct measures of <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> (phase bifurcation index, <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> sum and <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> product) combined with two procedures for non-parametric statistical testing (permutation, or a combination of z-score and permutation). While these are obviously not the only existing or conceivable measures, they have all been used in recent studies. All tested methods performed adequately on a previously published dataset (Busch, Dubois & VanRullen, 2009). On a variety of artificially constructed datasets, no single measure was found to surpass all others, but instead the suitability of each measure was contingent on several experimental factors: the time, frequency and depth of oscillatory phase modulation; the absolute and relative amplitudes of post-stimulus event-related potentials for the two trial groups; the absolute and relative trial numbers for the two groups; and the number of permutations used for non-parametric testing. The concurrent use of two <b>phase</b> <b>opposition</b> measures, the parametric Watson-Williams test and a non-parametric test based on summing inter-trial coherence values for the two trial groups, appears to provide the most satisfactory outcome in all situations tested.

40|$|Mixed layer depth (MLD) {{variability}} from seasonal to decadal {{time scales}} in the Bay of Biscay is studied in this work. A hydrographic time series running since 1991 {{in the study}} area, a climatology of the upper layer vertical structure based on the topology of this temperature profile time series and a one-dimensional water column model {{have been used for}} this purpose. The prevailing factors driving MLD variability have been determined with detail, and agreement with observations is achieved. Tests carried out to investigate climatological profile skill to reproduce the upper layer temporal evolution have demonstrated its ability to simulate variability at seasonal time scales and reproduce the most conspicuous events observed. This has enabled us to carry out a reconstruction of the MLD variability for the last 60 years in the study area. Favourable sequence of intense mixing events explains interannual differences and cases of extraordinary deepening of winter mixed layer. The negative phase of the Eastern Atlantic pattern seems to determine important interannual variability through intense episodes of cooling and mixing as in winter 2005 in the Bay of Biscay. Low-frequency variability is also observed. A very striking and unexpected shallower winter MLD during the 1970 s and 1980 s than those observed from 1995 has been found. Simulation results support this counter-intuitive outcome of shallower winter mixed layers concurrent with generalized upper water warming trends reported on several occasions for the area. The long-term trends in MLD seem related with decadal variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation, being in <b>phase</b> and <b>opposition</b> with other deepening-shallowing cycles found from subtropical-to-subpolar areas in the North Atlantic.
