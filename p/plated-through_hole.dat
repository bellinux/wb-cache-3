40|$|The {{status of}} {{printed circuit board}} {{inspection}} is reviewed with special focus placed on the existing techniques of assessing <b>plated-through</b> <b>hole</b> quality. The need for developing a non-destructive method for <b>plated-through</b> <b>hole</b> inspection has been identified and is the major objective of this research. The {{results of the investigation}} into various methods that could lead to this objective are presented. This investigation has been concerned with the application of image processing techniques and the leakage light detection method. The hardware and software requirements for automatic visual inspection of stuffed board components are established initially using available equipment from the Department of Production Technology. Image processing techniques are found to be capable of discriminating copper-plated and unplated surfaces using the difference in reflectance between the surfaces. This suggests the possibility of applying such techniques to assess the quality of through-hole plating. The leakage light detection method can be implemented to assess the plating coverage of plated-through holes. A low cost inspection system demonstrating the principle of leakage light detection has been constructed. This system is particularly relevant to the small batch manufacturers in the printed circuit board industry. The performance of the demonstration system has illustrated the simplicity and reliability of the design. It is concluded that the leakage light detection technology offers a practical low cost solution for non-destructive <b>plated-through</b> <b>hole</b> inspection...|$|E

40|$|Micro-vias are minute {{holes in}} circuit boards with a {{diameter}} of 6 mils or less that are placed within or underneath component pads. These structures allow the interconnection of outer and inner layers, which results in an increased routing area or available space for the placement of denser components. A via-in-pad is a <b>plated-through</b> <b>hole</b> that is used as an interlayer connection from a component land, but {{in which there is}} no intention to insert a component lead or other reinforcing material.

This is phase 1 of an R&D project and this paper presents the solderability results for different via-in-pad locations and sizes based on assembly criteria. Although the design includes Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), Quad Flat Packs (QFPs) and passive components, only BGAs were examined at this stage.

50|$|Through-hole {{technology}} {{almost completely}} replaced earlier electronics assembly {{techniques such as}} point-to-point construction. From the second generation of computers in the 1950s until surface-mount technology (SMT) became popular in the late 1980s, every component on a typical PCB was a through-hole component. PCBs initially had tracks printed on one side only, later both sides, then multi-layer boards were in use. Through <b>holes</b> became <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes</b> (PTH) {{in order for the}} components to make contact with the required conductive layers. <b>Plated-through</b> <b>holes</b> are no longer required with SMT boards for making the component connections, but are still used for making interconnections between the layers and in this role are more usually called vias.|$|R

25|$|At {{the glass}} {{transition}} temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes.</b> Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require high Tg matrix.|$|R
2500|$|Semi-additive is {{the most}} common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it. A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a {{subtractive}} process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the traces.) Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces. [...] Some single-sided boards which have <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes</b> are made in this way. [...] General Electric made consumer radio sets in the late 1960s using additive boards.|$|R

2500|$|The hole walls for boards {{with two}} or more layers can be made {{conductive}} and then electroplated with copper to form <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes.</b> [...] These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. [...] The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.|$|R

40|$|A flight {{printed wiring}} board (PWB) for a {{satellite}} project was observed {{to have a high}} incidence of measling. Other PWB's produced for the program by the same manufacturer did not exhibit the degree of measling as did the 'measle-prone' board. Measling susceptibility during hand soldering and measling effects on PWB insulation resistance were investigated for three production PWB's. Measling resistance was significantly different between the three boards: the 'worst' exhibited five times the number of measles as the 'best' board. 'Severe' measling (that which is likely to affect board reliability) did not exist on the 'best' board, even under extreme soldering conditions (399 degrees C for 12 - 15 sec.), whereas the 'worst' board showed an average of one 'severe' measle for every two pads under more normal soldering conditions (288 - 343 degrees C for 2 - 5 sec.). Both soldering time and temperature affected measling, with time having a slightly greater influence (2 percent versus 12 percent). Measling effects on PWB insulation resistance were inconclusive. These were evaluated by in situ resistance measurements on the same three boards at elevated temperature and humidity. The measured resistance for all three boards decreased for exposures greater than 50 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. The 'measle-prone' board showed a resistance decrease at only 25 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. However, no definitive difference was detected between measled and not-measled (control) samples. The boards evaluated were production boards, so the effect of interlayer traces connecting the <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes</b> was not controlled. It is likely the resistance measurements were over different volumes of PWB laminate, which would account for the widely varying resistances measured. Thermomechanical measurements on board laminate materials did not reveal any differences attributed to measling. Differences in glass transition temperature were significantly different when measured by DTA, but not by SDT. Laminate thermal expansion differences were significant for the 35 degrees C evaluations, but not for any higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} modelling and control of the acid copper electroplating process for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCB). The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of process and product parameters on the workpiece level uniformity during the acid copper plating of lithographic patterns, <b>plated-through</b> <b>holes</b> (PTH) and blind-via (BV), and to explore the minimization of the deposit thickness variation. The parameters studied were the average current density (ACD), plating duration, concentration of additive and sulphuric acid, electrode separation (ES), line width and active area density ratio (AADR) of the circuit pattern. The effects of the copper sulphate concentration, aspect ratio (CAR) and depth ratio were also studied for the PTH and BV plating. The results of the study enhance the understanding of the limitations of applying current distribution and statistical models to the copper electroplating of PCB at a workpiece level. Multifactor two-level factorial and the central composite rotatable five-level experiments were designed, and a total of fourteen sets of experiment were conducted sequentially and used to generate statistical process models. For the plating of uniform patterns, ACD, ES and their quadratic effects were found to be significant and a 6 - term second order model was built and verified to predict and minimize the workpiece level variability. The existence of a minimum plating variability was attributed to the minimum deviation from the Faraday's nominal thickness observed under a particular combination of ACD and ES. For non-uniform patterns, ACD, AADR and the ACD x ES interaction were found significant and an 8 -term first-order prediction model was constructed. The minimum variability achievable was found to increase with the AADR, and was explained by the scattering effect of AADR on the average plating thickness. Verification of the model with patterns of same AADR but different line width revealed the limitation of the continuum concept, i. e. AADR alone is not sufficient to characterize a non-uniformly patterned substrate. Subsequent verification runs using a simple circuit pattern showed further that a composite parameter involving the overall active area density, the continuum area and the number of AAD contrasts, was appropriate. For the PTH plating, ACD, CAR, ACD 2 and the ACD x ES, ES x CAR interactions were found significant but only ES, ES 2 and ACD x ES were active for BV plating. Second-order models were also developed for the two processes in their respective optimum regions and verified experimentally. The optimum values of ACD and ES, and the minimum variability achievable were found to increase with the corrected aspect ratio of the through-hole. Given the difference in the optimum regions of the PTH and BV plating, a new response surface of the PTH process was constructed at the optimum region of the BV process and vice versa. The process limiting the workpiece level uniformity under different combinations of ACD and ES was found by the intersections of these responses surfaces. Finally, process parameters limiting the simultaneous minimization of the plating variability of pattern, PTH and BV were discussed. It showed that under most situations, the workpiece level variability of BVs was higher than that of the PTHs...|$|R
