40|$|The erosion rate of aft closure {{insulation}} in {{a number}} of large solid propellant motors was empirically analyzed by correlating the average ablation rate with a number of variables that had previously been demonstrated to affect heat flux. The main correlating parameter was a heat flux based on the simplified Bartz heat transfer coefficient corrected for two-dimensional effects. A multiplying group contained terms related to <b>port-to-throat</b> <b>ratio,</b> local wall angle, grain geometry and nozzle cant angle. The resulting equation gave a good correlation and is a useful design tool...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analytical model}} which considers {{time and space}} development of the flow field in solid propellant rocket motors with high volumetric loading density is described. The gas dynamics in the motor chamber is governed {{by a set of}} hyperbolic partial differential equations, that are coupled with the ignition and flame spreading events, and with the axial variation of mass addition. The flame spreading rate is calculated by successive heating-to-ignition along the propellant surface. Experimental diagnostic studies have been performed with a rectangular window motor (50 cm grain length, 5 cm burning perimeter and 1 cm hydraulic port diameter), using a controllable head-end gaseous igniter. Tests were conducted with AP composite propellant at <b>port-to-throat</b> area <b>ratios</b> of 2. 0, 1. 5, 1. 2, and 1. 06, and head-end pressures from 35 to 70 atm. Calculated pressure transients and flame spreading rates are in very good agreement with those measured in the experimental system...|$|R
40|$|Erosive burning {{changes the}} burning rate of solid rocket {{propellants}} which can normally {{be approximated by}} St. Robert 2 ̆ 7 s law. This can {{play a major role}} in the performance of a solid rocket motor depending on the geometry of that motor. A 2 -D slab combustor has been developed for the study of erosive burning. The modular design permits study of planar and slotted propellant configurations (as are present in segmented rocket motors) with adjustable <b>port-to-throat</b> area <b>ratios.</b> The main focus of this thesis is to experimentally investigate erosive burning by comparing test firings where erosive burning is expected with tests where it is not. Thermocouples were added to the original design to help gather burnout data from the tests. A ballistic element model has also been developed and has been used to analyze the tests using the classical Lenoir-Robillard erosive burning model. Although the test data that has been gathered seems reliable and consistent, reconstructing the tests with the ballistic model has proven difficult. This is likely do to the limitations of the Lenoir-Robillard erosive burning model and a new model would be required to better match the test data. ...|$|R
40|$|Erosive {{effects in}} Polybutadiene Acyrlonitrile and Hydroxyl Terminated Polybutadiene based {{composite}} propellants are investigated using a planar geometry combustor. An adjustable <b>port-to-throat</b> area <b>ratio</b> allows {{high and low}} port Mach numbers to be evaluated at multiple pressures. Head, mid, and aft motor pressure instrumentation as well as aft burning rate measurements using an ultrasonic transducer provide the necessary information about {{the operation of the}} motor. Erosive burning was studied using the classical Lenoir Robillard model, a modified form of Dickenson 2 ̆ 7 s model, the Thompson McClure model, and the Saderholm model. Erosive burning parameter estimates were made by fitting to an inferred burning rate based upon pressure measurements and by matching to pressure reconstructions. The experiment covers chamber conditions ranging from 300 psi to 700 psi and port Mach numbers from 0. 1 to 0. 7. Data and reconstructions of 8 tests are included and indicate that the Lenoir Robillard model is best suited of the models considered to estimate erosive burning using inferred burning rate alone. In addition, no significant differences were observed in regards to erosive burning for the PBAN and HTPB propellants studied herein. ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing use {{of solid}} rocket motors with low <b>port-to-throat</b> area S <b>ratios,</b> {{including}} the ul imate case of nozzleless motors, {{is leading to}} increased occuriencc and severity of burning rate augmentation due to flow of propellant produ:ts across burning propellant surfaces (erosive burring).
