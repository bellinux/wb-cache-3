However, development was halted and it was not marketed. <b>Perospirone,</b> another azapirone derivative with antipsychotic properties, was synthesized and assayed several years after tiospirone.

A 64 -year-old woman who experienced hallucinations was treated with <b>perospirone</b> (8 mg/day). She also complained of depressed mood and was prescribed paroxetine (10 mg/day). She exhibited finger tremors, sweating, coarse shivering, hyperactive knee jerks, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, and psychomotor agitation. After the discontinuation of paroxetine and <b>perospirone,</b> the symptoms disappeared. Another 81 -year-old woman, who experienced delusions, was treated with <b>perospirone</b> (8 mg/day). Depressive symptoms appeared and paroxetine (10 mg/day) was added. She exhibited tachycardia, finger tremors, anxiety, agitation, and hyperactive knee jerks. The symptoms disappeared after the cessation of paroxetine and <b>perospirone.</b> Recently, the effectiveness of coadministrating 5 -HT 1 A agonistic psychotropics with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been reported, and SSRIs with 5 -HT 1 A agonistic activity have been newly approved {{in the treatment of}} depression. <b>Perospirone</b> is a serotonin–dopamine antagonist and agonistic on the 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Animal studies have indicated that mild serotonin excess induces low body temperature through 5 -HT 1 A, whereas severe serotonin excess induces high body temperature through 5 -HT 2 A activation. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that mild serotonin excess induces side effects through 5 -HT 1 A, and severe serotonin excess induces lethal side effects with hyperthermia through 5 -HT 2 A. Serotonin toxicity via a low dose of paroxetine that is coadministered with <b>perospirone,</b> which acts agonistically on the 5 -HT 1 A receptor and antagonistically on the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, clearly indicated 5 -HT 1 A receptor involvement in mild serotonin toxicity.

40|$|RATIONALE: Both psychotropic {{drugs and}} mental {{disorders}} have typical signatures in quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). Previous {{studies found that}} some psychotropic drugs had EEG effects opposite to the EEG effects of the mental disorders treated with these drugs (key-lock principle). OBJECTIVES: We performed a placebo-controlled pharmaco-EEG study on two conventional antipsychotics (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and four atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, <b>perospirone,</b> quetiapine, and risperidone) in healthy volunteers. We investigated differences between conventional and atypical drug effects and whether the drug effects were compatible with the key-lock principle. METHODS: Fourteen subjects underwent seven EEG recording sessions, one for each drug (dosage equivalent of 1 mg haloperidol). In a time-domain analysis, we quantified the EEG by identifying clusters of transiently stable EEG topographies (microstates). Frequency-domain analysis used absolute power across electrodes {{and the location of}} the center of gravity (centroid) of the spatial distribution of power in different frequency bands. RESULTS: <b>Perospirone</b> increased duration of a microstate class typically shortened in schizophrenics. Haloperidol increased mean microstate duration of all classes, increased alpha 1 and beta 1 power, and tended to shift the beta 1 centroid posterior. Quetiapine decreased alpha 1 power and shifted the centroid anterior in both alpha bands. Olanzapine shifted the centroid anterior in alpha 2 and beta 1. CONCLUSIONS: The increased microstate duration under <b>perospirone</b> and haloperidol was opposite to effects previously reported in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a key-lock mechanism. The opposite centroid changes induced by olanzapine and quetiapine compared to haloperidol might characterize the difference between conventional and atypical antipsychotics...|$|E

Methods: Using a retrospective cohort study design, we screened all outpatients (n = 7936) who visited the Shioiri Mental Clinic between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2010. We identified a cohort of patients (n = 703) diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and calculated the time to discontinuation of each second-generation antipsychotic. Results: Of the 703 patients, 149 were newly treated with aripiprazole, 67 with blonanserin, 95 with olanzapine, 36 with quetiapine, 74 with <b>perospirone,</b> and 120 with risperidone.

40|$|Cognitive {{impairments}} {{are considered}} to largely affect functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia, other psychotic illnesses, or mood disorders. Specifically, there is {{much attention to the}} role of psychotropic compounds acting on serotonin (5 -HT) receptors in ameliorating cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that atypical antipsychotic drugs, e. g. clozapine, melperone, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, <b>perospirone,</b> blonanserin, and lurasidone, have variable affinities for these receptors. Among the 5 -HT receptor subtypes, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor is attracting particular interests as a potential target for enhancing cognition, based on preclinical and clinical evidence. The neural network underlying the ability of 5 -HT 1 A agonists to treat cognitive impairments of schizophrenia likely includes dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurons. A novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in psychosis may be benefitted by focusing on energy metabolism in the brain. In this context, lactate plays a major role, and has been shown to protect neurons against oxidative and other stressors. In particular, our data indicate chronic treatment with tandospirone, a partial 5 -HT 1 A agonist, recover stress-induced lactate production in the prefrontal cortex of a rat model of schizophrenia. Recent advances of electrophysiological measures, e. g. event-related potentials, and their imaging have provided insights into facilitative effects on cognition of some atypical antipsychotic drugs acting directly or indirectly on 5 -HT 1 A receptors.

40|$|Abstract: Atypical {{antipsychotics}} {{and selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been prescribed extensively, often {{in combination with}} each other. When toxic encephalopathy develops with neuromuscular and autonomic symptoms in a patient taking medication including atypical antipsychotics, it has tended to be diagnosed as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). However, there have recently been several case reports where the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is given or raised as a likely differential diagnosis to such cases. In the present review, the author addressed himself to the issues surrounding the neurotoxic reaction to the treatment regimen containing atypical antipsychotics, focusing on the “atypical ” forms of NMS and pathophysiological as well as clinical features of serotonin toxicity. Although NMS is idiosyncratic in nature, it appears practically useful to comprehend this syndrome as a spectrum-based concept. Likewise, serotonin toxicity is {{a broad spectrum of}} clinical syndromes in close connection with serotomimetic drug use, including varied severity. Some of atypical antipsychotics, i. e., <b>perospirone,</b> aripiprazole, ziprasidone, clozapine, and quetiapine, have been shown to behave as partial agonists at 5 -HT 1 A receptors, providing direct evidence that these atypical antipsychotics are serotomimetic per se. The reciprocal interaction between the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems disturbed by either dopaminergic blockers or serotonergic enhancers leads to the disruption of homeostasis, with typical forms of NMS and serotonin syndrome representing the ends of the common pathophysiological background. The practical and flexible way to consider and manage such cases with updated knowledge derived from basic research should be warranted to be beneficial to our patients...|$|E

Methods: We performed a literature search of data published in PubMed®, the Cochrane Library database, the Japan Medical Abstracts Society, and PsycINFO® up to January 5, 2014. The odds ratio (OR), number-needed-to-harm (NNH), and standardized mean difference (SMD) {{based on a}} random effects model were calculated. Results: We identified five relevant studies (seven comparisons, n= 684; one comparison each for haloperidol [n= 243], mosapramine [n= 238], olanzapine [n= 39], quetiapine [n= 42], <b>perospirone</b> [n= 100], and two comparisons for risperidone [n= 66]). There {{were no significant differences}} in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, negative, and general scores (SMD= 0. 10, SMD=- 0. 09, SMD= 0. 10, respectively); discontinuation rate associated with all causes (OR= 1. 35); or side effects (OR= 1. 03) between aripiprazole and the pooled antipsychotics. Aripiprazole was inferior to the pooled antipsychotics in PANSS positive subscale scores (SMD= 0. 17) and discontinuation because of inefficacy (OR= 2. 21, NNH= 11). However, aripiprazole had fewer side effects compared with the pooled antipsychotics (OR= 0. 21, NNH= 20 for one or more side effects), including fatigue (OR= 0. 22, NNH= 8), hyperprolactinemia (OR= 0. 00, NNH= 1), extrapyramidal symptoms (OR= 0. 46, NNH= 6), and weight gain (OR= 0. 36, NNH= 7). Moreover, aripiprazole was associated with lower total cholesterol (SMD=- 0. 20) and triglyceride (SMD=- 0. 17) levels and body weight (SMD=- 0. 20) compared with the pooled antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the discontinuation rate associated with inefficacy was higher with aripiprazole than with the pooled antipsychotics, aripiprazole was associated with a lower risk of hyperprolactinemia and metabolic and extrapyramidal symptoms compared with the pooled antipsychotics.

This study aimed {{to examine whether}} previous findings could be replicated in a genetically distinct and homogenous group (ie, Japanese patients with schizophrenia) and whether previous findings could be extended to {{a broader range of}} antipsychotics with previously unclear relative efficacy and tolerability. Methods: Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed in which randomized trials comparing any of the following interventions were included: second-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol, or placebo. The primary outcomes for efficacy and acceptability were the response rate and all-cause discontinuation. The secondary outcomes included the improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, discontinuation because of adverse events, and individual adverse events. Results: Eighteen relevant studies were identified (total n= 3, 446; aripiprazole = 267, blonanserin = 285, clozapine = 47, clocapramine = 295, haloperidol = 857, mosapramine = 493, olanzapine = 179, paliperidone = 136, <b>perospirone</b> = 146, placebo = 138, quetiapine = 212, and risperidone = 338; mean study duration = 8. 33 ± 1. 41 weeks). In primary outcomes, olanzapine and paliperidone showed efficacy than placebo, and olanzapine and paliperidone showed superior acceptability compared with placebo. There were differences in the incidences of individual adverse events (the best antipsychotic: extrapyramidal symptoms = olanzapine, hyperprolactinemia-related symptoms = quetiapine, sedation = paliperidone, and weight change = blonanserin) among antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the current analysis exclusively included Japanese patients with schizophrenia, no remarkable differences were observed in efficacy and safety compared with previous meta-analyses. Diverse hierarchies in safety outcomes also support the implication that individual risk expectations for adverse events can guide clinical decisions. However, the sample size was relatively limited. Additional efficacy and safety data are required to fully obtain a conclusive understanding. Keywords: antipsychotics, Japanese schizophrenia, network meta-analysis, efficacy, safet...|$|E
