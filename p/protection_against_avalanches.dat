It is an interesting alternative to get to Cortina from Agordino area also because the road of Passo Giau, unlike the Passo Falzarego road is passable by trucks and coaches. However, despite the efforts made over the years, the winter season is often compromised by the avalanches that come down to block the uncovered parts of the road.|$|E

The older admits avalanche as unavoidable {{and strains}} to palliateits effects. Works of this inspiration are qualified : passive protection worksor defence works. The second method {{is based upon}} recent knowledges on snowpurchased by helvetic specialists. This method acts with success oncauses of avalanches. Their formation is prevented by stabilisationworks in the departure area. Works of this inspiration are qualified : active protection works orextinction works. These two methods are successively examined. About defencework, {{the greater part of}} the development is reserved for types ofconstructions. Three categories are distinguished : stopping constructions,deviation constructions and slowing constructions. Theconception of this works is still empiric. Advantages and inconveniencesof this types of constructions are briefly indicated. Extinction works are studied more complety. Indications are givenabout formation and location of dangerous areas. Various factors interveningon snow evolution are indicated. Normes of constructionare deducted. Principal types of stabilisation works are describedbut the greater part of the development is point on articulated constructions. Indications are furnished on efforts than constructions areundergoing. A method for calculation of articulated construction isgiven.

3000|$|Planted forests, {{defined as}} [...] "forests {{predominantly}} composed of trees established through planting and/or deliberate seeding of native or introduced species" [...] (FAO, 2010) {{are becoming increasingly}} important in world forestry, natural resources' conservation, and climate-change policies. According {{to the most recent}} global forest resources assessment, planted forests occupy approximately 258 million ha, or 6 percent of the total world forest area (FAO, 2010). Their usefulness includes wood production and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> erosion, <b>avalanches,</b> and desertification, with often a mix of purposes. The potential of planted forests for carbon sequestration and conservation of natural forests is increasingly being recognised (AFB, 2012, WWF, 2012). Furthermore, planted forests are, and will, remain an essential source of fuelwood and industrial roundwood. Recent studies suggest that they have the potential for production of up to two thirds of the global roundwood supply (Carle and Holmgren, 2008, Del Lungo et al., 2006).|$|R
40|$|Steel {{wire rope}} nets have become common as <b>protection</b> measure <b>against</b> <b>avalanches</b> in Europe by {{preventing}} a release in the potential starting zone. A novel approach that has gained much ground through new {{research is to}} retard the movement of an avalanche {{after it has been}} initiated, that is in its path or run out zone. Such systems have the potential to be more cost efficient than traditional structures such as avalanche protection dams, saving both time and space of installation. In Lech (Vorarlberg- Austria) a Snowcatcher prototype was installed and instrumented with several load measuring pins, which record the dynamic loads caused by an avalanche. 24 avalanche events in 4 years were detected. In addition to the field tests, scaled granular experi-ments were performed in the laboratory. These tests show that the Snowcatcher leads to a significant reduction of avalanche velocities. Subsequently the calculated Froude numbers decrease, indicating less destructive power of the avalanche. As well, the spreading of the avalanche in the deposition zone decreases downslope of the Snowcatcher. Key words: snow net, protection measure, granular experimen...|$|R
50|$|The term Bann {{dates back}} to the Middle Ages. At that time a Bannwald {{referred}} to a forest area where the respective territorial lord had the exclusive right to use the forest (forest privilege). Originally this applied only to hunting (hunting privilege) and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of Switzerland banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for fencing torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches,</b> rockfalls and flooding. The concept of Bannwald plays an important part in Ludwig Ganghofer's novel Die Martinsklause in which a tyrannical administrator in Berchtesgaden claims excessive privileges.|$|E
50|$|In {{the rural}} areas, people {{generally}} had less freedom, but some lords furthered the colonization of remote areas by granting some privileges to the colonists. One well-known colonization movement {{was that of}} the Walser from the Valais to the Grisons, colonizing some valleys there in the 14th century. In the mountainous areas, a community management of common fields, alps, and forests (the latter being important as a <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches)</b> soon developed, and the communes in a valley cooperated closely and began buying out the noble landowners or simply to dispossess them of their lands. Regional diets, the Landsgemeinden, were formed to deal with the administration of the commons; it also served as the high court and to elect representatives, the Landamman.|$|E
40|$|Elbrus {{region is}} {{characterized}} by the highest degree of avalanche danger, and now the intensive development of winter tourism is coming there. The plan of building <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches</b> was created here. The snowkeeping shields were built on southern slopes. In winter of 2009, after intensive snowfalls, the shields were partial covered with avalanche snow, but they did not let the bigger avalanches to form. The builders did not consider the complexity of avalanche structure and made some mistakes in the sequence of shields building. The distribution of snow cover on slopes, the dominant avalanche genetic types that define the volume, speed, and the power of blow and the range of emission must be considered during the designing and building of avalanche protection systems. The experience of MSU works must be used during the building of avalanche protection systems in others places of Elbrus region. </p...|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a <b>protection</b> forest <b>against</b> an <b>avalanche)</b> is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} catastrophic {{incidents}} due to slope instability problems in China {{is a major}} problem, with> 2400 major events occurring in recent years, resulting {{in the destruction of}} urban and rural environments and the loss of human life. Cost-effective and ecologically friendly methods can be used to avoid certain potential catastrophes. Such techniques involve the use of vegetation to stabilize a slope or arrest erosion, but can also include for example, the management of <b>protection</b> forests <b>against</b> <b>avalanches</b> and landslides. Shallow landslides can be avoided by planting species which improve soil cohesion, either through having an increased Root Area Ratio (RAR), a high root tensile strength, or a combination of both. A large number of species, both woody and non-woody, have been identified as useful in improving soil cohesion. However, with regard to tree species, it is not known whether tree age affects soil cohesion through differences in either RAR or root mechanical properties. Therefore, we carried out a study on root distribution and mechanical properties of trees at different ages, growing in plantation forests in Sichuan province, China. Soil cores (150 × 450 mm) were extracted at different distances around trees of Japanese cedar (Cryp-tomeria japonica D. Don) growing in plantations aged 9, 20 and 30 years old. All plantations were close together on the same type of soil and the same slope angle. Each soil core was divided into three different depth classe...|$|R

40|$|In the {{southern}} Julian Alps we described two communities whose tree layer {{is dominated by}} species from the genus Sorbus and noted two successional stages in the overgrowing of abandoned agricultural land (pastures, hay meadows). In the secondary succession on former subalpine pastures above the alp Planina Razor und under the Breginjski Stol ridge, where potential natural vegetation consists of subalpine beech forest, dwarf pine has been overgrown with mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) whose stands are classified into the new association Rhododendro hirsuti-Sorbetum aucupariae. Whitebeam (Sorbus aria) has established itself on steep former hay meadows in the belt of altimontane beech forests under Mts. Jalovnik and Krikov Vrh, on gullied slopes on mixed geological bedrock dominated by chert, and these stands are classified into the association Calamagrostio arundinaceae-Sorbetum ariae. While occupying only small areas these two pioneer stages, as the sites of some rare or protected species, are nevertheless important biotopes and {{play a vital role}} in <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches...</b>|$|E
40|$|In mountainous regions, forests play {{a crucial}} role in {{protecting}} the local population from natural hazards. In cases where existing forests are destroyed, e. g. by wind throws or diseases, the protection function has to be restored through technical measures. To determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches,</b> a choice experiment has been conducted and different experiment specifications have been tested to determine possible impacts on the results. The present study contributes to a comprehensive assessment of protection measures, and helps to identify efficient solutions based on the judgement of the people potentially endangered by natural hazards. The stepwise approach has the advantage to gradually check data fit, thereby didactically showing an operational way of dealing with different model specifications. The detailed case study can serve as a manual for conducting choice experiments with a similar focus and demonstrates the suitability and caveats of this approach to value protection from natural hazards in general...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} {{to emphasize that the}} concept of “local knowledge” should not be understood as a clearly defined epistemological space. It represents a field of study in which the importance of the contextuality of knowledge—or how it is embedded in local cultural concepts—is a defining factor. Generalizable aspects of local knowledge include the fact that any body of local knowledge {{is in a state of}} constant change, that it tends to be unevenly distributed among members of the community, and that it is integrated into a particular natural, social, and cultural context. Accordingly, any creative adaptation to a changing environment may also lead to destructive resource use strategies. For example, farmers cleared huge forests in the Safien valley during the fourteenth century to create space for pastures. At the time, local environmental knowledge was a driver of land degradation, which amplified hazard exposure. The local knowledge that encourages the maintenance of certain forests as a <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches</b> and landslides by stabilizing the slopes only became commonplace over time, due to the repeated threat of landslides and avalanches to individual farms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Snow-supporting {{avalanche}} defence {{structures are}} increasingly being built at high altitudes in potential permafrost areas. Special construction methods and guidelines {{have been developed to}} ensure a minimal stability of the structures, which have a vital role in the protection of underlying settlements and transport infrastructure against snow avalanches. If the avalanche slopes are located on ice-rich permafrost terrain, {{as is the case in}} a steep avalanche gully above Pontresina (Eastern Swiss Alps), other means of protection must be used – such as deflection or retention dams – as construction on ice-rich sediments can be very problematic. Experimental snow-supporting structures were built in 1997 in order to test different types of structures and their foundations, to develop specially adapted construction methods and to monitor the long-term behaviour of the structures in moderately creeping frozen ground with volumetric ice contents under 20 %. Snow-nets were found to be the most suitable type of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches</b> in this type of permafrost terrain due to their deformability and because they are well adapted to rock fall. The structures do not improve slope stability but contribute towards maintaining permafrost as they delay snow melt by modifying the spatial and temporal distribution of the snow cover. The results of the project described have led to a better understanding of permafrost-related avalanche defence prob-lems...|$|E
40|$|The Aosta Valley is a densely {{populated}} mountainous {{area in which}} interaction between natural hazards and human activities has been shaping the development of settlements and infrastructure for centuries. The forests cover almost 30 % of the totals surface (326088 ha) and have been providing <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>avalanches,</b> rock fall and floods. During the past decades, {{the importance of the}} forests as a protection against natural hazards in Aosta Valley, and more in general in the whole European Alps, has increased. Remote valleys, that were formerly avoided during winter, are now expected to be permanently accessible for tourists, settlements have been spreading into areas that were considered unsafe and transports crossing the Alps have strongly increased. The forests that directly protect settlements, railways, main roads and socio-economical infrastructures represent a priority in the forest and landscape management at the regional scale since the direct prote ctive role of forests needs to be efficiently and continuously effective. Protective forest mapping is the first step of a sustainable long-term silvicultural management. Starting from a digital terrain model (DTM) in a raster format with a spatial resolution of 10 m, other numerical maps and forest information, a regional map (1 : 10000) of the forests that play a direct protection has been developed. The forests that potentially play a protective role and the forests that play a potentially direct protective role cover represents respectively 79. 8 % and 42. 7 % of the forest cover...|$|E
