5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) <b>planking,</b> a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge <b>planking</b> with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker <b>planking</b> is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping <b>planking,</b> though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} <b>planking</b> {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to bungee jump off the bridge without a restraining cord. The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy <b>planking.</b> This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5000|$|There are 16 tapered <b>planks</b> per side. The {{garboard}} <b>planks</b> {{are near}} vertical where they {{attach to the}} keel. The garboard <b>planks</b> are narrow and remain only slightly wider to take {{the turn of the}} bilge. The topside <b>planks</b> are progressively wider. Each oak <b>plank</b> is slightly tapered in cross section to allow it to overlap about 30mm the <b>plank</b> above and below in normal clinker (lapstrake) style. Iron rivets are about 180 mm apart where the <b>planks</b> lie straight and about 125 mm apart where the <b>planks</b> turn.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>plank</b> is the front <b>plank</b> which {{is held in}} a push-up-like position, with the body's weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes. Many {{variations}} exist such as the side <b>plank</b> and the reverse <b>plank.</b> The <b>plank</b> is commonly practiced in pilates and yoga, and by those training for boxing and other sports.|$|R

5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood <b>planking,</b> which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2014, the {{expedition}} announced that on 7 September it had located one of Franklin's two ships. The ship is preserved {{in very good}} condition, with side-scan sonar picking up even the deck <b>planking.</b> The wreck lies {{at the bottom of}} the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island. On 1 October at the House of Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that the wreck is indeed HMS Erebus.|$|E

5|$|Rochambeau {{completed}} her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly {{under the command}} of Captain (Capitaine de vaisseau) Jules-François-Émile Krantz (a future Minister of Marine) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve. She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a one-piece cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, Rochambeau was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine <b>planking</b> underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak.|$|E
5|$|The present bridge {{dates from}} 1842. The bridge was {{constructed}} with a Town lattice, patented by Ithiel Town who {{is said to}} have supervised the construction of the bridge. If accurate, Town would have supervised the construction of the current bridge in the years preceding his death. The bridge has vertical <b>planking</b> and the seams are covered by battens and the roof of the structure has wood shingles. A lot of the joinery has been preserved, though the queen-post trusses around the Town lattices are not original.|$|E
5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with <b>planking</b> and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E

5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between the frames, excluding <b>planking.</b> The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (<b>planking)</b> are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E

25|$|According to René Tinner and Stephan <b>Plank</b> {{in a radio}} {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Conny <b>Plank,</b> it was Brian Eno's idea that <b>Plank</b> should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, <b>Plank</b> turned down the job ("I cannot work with this singer"). According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny <b>Plank</b> – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, <b>Plank</b> firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced <b>Plank</b> to the audience as their new producer. Thereupon <b>Plank</b> has left the concert and never again talked to any member of U2.|$|R
50|$|During the 1800s, 202 <b>plank</b> road {{companies}} {{were established in}} Michigan, and 5,802 and 1/2 miles of <b>plank</b> roads were chartered, with roads as long as 220 miles (from Zilwaukee to Mackinaw City, and going through Traverse City) to as short as one mile (in Sault Ste. Marie). The man who signed the law {{was one of the}} major supporters of <b>plank</b> roads in Michigan, governor Epaphroditus Ransom. Ransom signed the general <b>plank</b> road incorporation act, and throughout his governorship viewed <b>plank</b> roads as the solution to increasing Michigan's economy. <b>Plank</b> roads were very popular in rural areas, because, even when it was wet and muddy, people could still travel on <b>plank</b> roads. Properly maintained <b>plank</b> roads were known to cut four to six day trips to as short as ten to fifteen hours.|$|R
5|$|Various {{types of}} {{ammunition}} {{could be used}} for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, spiked bar shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and canister shot packed with sharp flints produced a devastating shotgun effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the Mary Rose's hull <b>planking,</b> indicating a stand-off range of at least 90m (295ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden <b>planking</b> at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the Republican majority in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad <b>Planking</b> event in Wakefield.|$|E

5000|$|The canoes were {{typically}} {{made out of}} <b>planks</b> split from redwood (Sequoioideae) or pine driftwood washed up on the shore. This driftwood was usually chosen because it was available and usually knot free and easy to work with. Some of these driftwood logs were selected, cut to length, split, shaped and then their split out <b>planks</b> [...] "sewn" [...] {{together to form a}} canoe. The side <b>planks</b> and canoe bottom were split out of straight knot free logs utilizing whalebone and antler Wedges driven by rock mallets. The <b>planks</b> were then shaped, trimmed and leveled using flint and seashell tools and shark hide sandpaper. Where <b>planks</b> needed to be connected holes were bored in the <b>planks</b> using wood drills tipped with chert or bone. These drilled <b>planks</b> were then connected by [...] "sewing" [...] split and shaped knot free <b>planks</b> together on their ends to get the necessary length. They {{were typically}} fastened together with red milkweed (tok) fiber cords. After the <b>planks</b> had been shaped and sewn together for length they were carefully shaped, bent and mounted six to eight <b>planks</b> vertically to form the canoe's sides around a large split bottom <b>plank</b> that formed the bottom of the canoe. Over 20 pieces of shaped wood are used to make a typical tomol. Once the <b>planks</b> were bent, fitted and lashed together the heart of dry tule rush was forced into the cracks between the <b>planks</b> {{on the outside of the}} canoe hull to act as caulking. All seams between <b>planks,</b> <b>plank</b> ends and holes for cords or thongs were then caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. In many respects their boat construction technique mirrored that utilized for making small wooden boats around the world. The lack of metal tools and fasteners forced them to use stone age tools and materials.|$|R

5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine <b>planking</b> {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The group {{discovered}} U-853 bottomed in , {{and dropped}} depth charges and hedgehogs during a 16-hour attack. At first the U-boat attempted to flee, {{and then tried}} to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. The morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in <b>planking,</b> life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 {{was one of the last}} U-boats sunk during World War II. and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters. Atherton and Moberly received credit for the kill.|$|E
5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom <b>planking</b> below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
