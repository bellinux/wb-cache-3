30|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{magnitude}} of the effect of DSSW we use the estimation results presented in columns 2 a and 2 b of Table  5 and imagine a counterfactual scenario where <b>partial</b> <b>pensions</b> are subject to the application of reduction coefficients in case the worker partially retires before reaching the age of 65. With this hypothetical policy design we are eliminating one of the major appeals of partial retirement legislation. We provide in Table  6 the marginal effects that DSSW has on transition intensities at each duration. We again evaluate the marginal effects at every observation and use the sample average of the individual marginal effects. We measure the marginal effect by the decrease that DSSW is going to suffer if reduction coefficients also affect <b>pensions</b> stemming from <b>partial</b> retirement before reaching the ordinary age of retirement. Table  14 in Appendix presents descriptive statistics for this relevant difference in DSSW. As we want to evaluate these effects not only in absolute but also in relative terms, we include the percentage of change that transition intensities will experiment at each age as a result of reducing DSSW. As it can be seen in Table  6, the decreasing in the transition intensities to partial retirement are quite substantial. The main effect is observed at the age of 60, the first time partial retirement is allowed and the age when the application of reduction coefficients is more severe. At this age, the probability to partially retire would be reduced by 50 % or more if <b>partial</b> <b>pensions</b> were penalized. Thus, the non-applicability of reduction coefficients in case of partial retirement before the ordinary age of retirement {{is one of the main}} determinants of the use of this figure.|$|R

All residents aged 18 or older are {{required by law to}} pay insurance contributions to Bituach Leumi as part of the old age insurance system.

Upon reaching retirement age and claiming the pension, contributors are means-tested, with those above certain income levels entitled to only a <b>partial</b> <b>pension</b> or no pension at all until age 70. The basic old age pension is NIS 1,531 for an individual. In the case of a couple where one of them is not eligible for an old age pension, the pension is NIS 2,301, composed of the pension for an individual with an increment for the spouse. Upon reaching age 80, this increases to NIS 1,617 for an individual and NIS 2,387 for a couple. A seniority increment is added to the basic pension, calculated according to the years of insurance contributions accumulated up to a maximum of 50% of the basic pension. Additional increments are available to pensioners living with dependant spouses and children, {{as well as those who}} are entitled to no pension or only a small pension which the pensioner must waive to receive the increment.

40|$|Abstract Background Timely {{return to}} work after longterm {{sickness}} absence and {{the increased use of}} flexible work arrangements together with partial health-related benefits are tools intended to increase participation in work life. Although partial sickness benefit and <b>partial</b> disability <b>pension</b> are used in many countries, prospective studies on their use are largely lacking. Partial sickness benefit was introduced in Finland in 2007. This register study aimed to investigate the use of health-related benefits by subjects with prolonged sickness absence, initially on either partial or full sick leave. Methods Representative population data (13 375 men and 16 052 women either on partial or full sick leave in 2007) were drawn from national registers and followed over an average of 18 months. The registers provided information on the study outcomes: diagnoses and days of payment for compensated sick leaves, and the occurrence of disability pension. Survival analysis and multinomial regression were carried out using sociodemographic variables and prior sickness absence as covariates. Results Approximately 60 % of subjects on partial sick leave and 30 % of those on full sick leave had at least one recurrent sick leave over the follow up. A larger proportion of those on partial sick leave (16 %) compared to those on full sick leave (1 %) had their first recurrent sick leave during the first month of follow up. The adjusted risks of the first recurrent sick leave were 1. 8 and 1. 7 for men and women, respectively, when subjects on partial sick leave were compared with those on full sick leave. There was no increased risk when those with their first recurrent sick leave in the first month were excluded from the analyses. The risks of a full disability pension were smaller and risks of a <b>partial</b> disability <b>pension</b> approximately two-fold among men and women initially on partial sick leave, compared to subjects on full sick leave. Conclusions This is the first follow up study of the newly adopted partial sickness benefit in Finland. The results show that compared to full sick leave, partial sick leave - when not followed by lasting {{return to work}} - is more typically followed by <b>partial</b> disability <b>pension</b> and less frequently by full disability pension. It is anticipated that the use of partial benefits in connection with part-time participation in work life will have favourable effects on future disability pension rates in Finland. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} of the various part-time pension schemes in Sweden and relates the systems and the changes in them to the development of part-time work. Sweden had a special <b>partial</b> <b>pension</b> scheme between 1976 and 2001. One intention behind the introduction of the system was to increase labour supply. It was one of three part-time pension schemes in the social security system. The three schemes have been: 1) A partial early old-age pension (leading to a lower pension even after 65), 2) A partial disability pension, and 3) The special part-time pension scheme (which does not lead to a lower pension after 65). The possibility of combining pension and work may be seen {{as a part of the}} Swedish welfare state and a part of a strong commitment to the work principle. The special <b>partial</b> <b>pension</b> scheme became very popular with a high take-up rate and was criticized for being too expensive. As a part of the decision on the old age pension scheme in 1994, the <b>partial</b> <b>pension</b> scheme was made less generous.

Therefore, the analysis will be done in two steps: First, we will analyze the duration of the sickness spells, and then we will analyze the process that governs the type of exit.

40|$|This study {{occupies}} {{itself with}} legal aspects of invalidity from youth. It represents {{an issue that}} is very significant from the social point of view although not regulated as single problem by law. However the whole theme infiltrates to another specific fields: social insurance, assessment medicine, psychology, juristic section, medicinal issue, ethics, upbringing and special pedagogy in a broad meaning. Current Czech law regulation of theme concerning benefits for persons with long-term unfavorable health state is based on concept of full and <b>partial</b> invalidity <b>pension</b> as benefits within pension insurance scheme and pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Generally full and <b>partial</b> invalidity <b>pension</b> benefits originate from reduction of gainful activity and reaching of relevant time period of pension insurance. According to a survey it is evident that number of awarded full and <b>partial</b> invalidity <b>pensions</b> has increased in Jihočeský" region. Respecting diagnostic flags structure the greatest occurrence of full invalidity pensions from youth has been recorded in group of intermediate cephalonia. Solving of social insurance of the elderly is planned under the pension reform at the present. The main goal of invalidity pension is permission to live {{as close as possible to}} normal state thus to face up to a handicap and to secure appropriate family, social and work life. In fine we could deduce that there should be confirmation of obligatory conversion of full invalidity pension to old-age pension when reaching retirement age within Czech pension reform. In my study I have focused on some factors decisive for occurrence of full or partial invalidity. It represents socially significant problems in broad range of relations that establish or could establish. Long-term loss or reduction of ability to work have negative impact not only on individuals but also affect social status of their families and thus negatively influence the whole society. Exclusion from work process traumatizes young people. Pension benefits provided to the disabled from youth are not deduced from tolled premiums. That is the reason I think this should be solved out of the pension insurance system as well as pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Costs on these benefits would be compensated by state budget within pension insurance system in the near future with perspective of transmission of these benefits to other social scheme. In this connection it is necessary to emphasize that mankind should be made sure that there is basic perception and crucial aim of social welfare in focusing on level and quality of life of individuals and their families not affected by unfavorable social or economic influences as well as their health state and well-being that will not be compounded by diseases and injuries.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Swedish OAP system is to {{compensate}} for income loss from work (Olsen 2002). In addition to OAP, most people in Sweden also have occupational pensions, which are becoming increasingly important over time. The OAP system was changed considerably in the period 1999 to 2003. While the old system was a pay-as-you-go defined benefit pension system, the new system is a mixture of a notional defined contribution pay-as-you-go pension system and a fully funded pension scheme with individual accounts. In the new system, lifelong accrual is implemented. Payments are longevity adjusted and adjusted according to the development in the Swedish economy. Individuals with small or no pension claims receive a guaranteed pension. There is no normal retirement age, but a minimum age of withdrawal at 61. <b>Partial</b> <b>pension</b> is abolished. Instead, {{it is possible to}} combine work and pension from age  61. Economic incentives to delay payments of pensions are implemented implying a gain for each month pension payments are delayed from age  61 and on. Unlimited deferral of retirement is made possible in the pension system, but the employer’s consent is required after the age of 67 (before 2001 / 2003, this age limit was 65  years 4). <b>Partial</b> <b>pension</b> tied to occupational pension schemes was implemented in 2003 for state employees and in 2007 for local government employees. Further, two different labour tax credits were introduced for workers aged 65 and above in 2007. First, with the purpose of stimulating labour supply, an earned income tax credit was introduced to all workers that was substantially larger for those older than 65. The size of this tax deduction increased gradually from 2007 and on. Second, to compensate for e.[*]g. productivity declines or workplace accommodations, a payroll tax credit aimed at stimulating demand was introduced for workers aged 65 or above (Johansson et al. 2014; Midtsundstad and Bogen 2013; Laun 2012; OECD 2012; Lindquist and Wadensjö 2009).|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} {{are in line}} with the experiences of other countries concerning part-time and <b>partial</b> <b>pension</b> schemes. These schemes don’t seem to be successful in prolonging working life but rather to act as alternative pathways in early retirement. Given the enormous costs, further reforms {{in the design of the}} scheme are necessary. First of all, the entrance age into the scheme should be oriented towards statutory retirement age in order to arrange phasing out of working life around usual retirement age and, thus, actually increasing final retirement age. The current law did not give any incentive to increase employment beyond statutory retirement age; instead the lawmakers were worried that many elderly Austrians did not even reach this statutory retirement age. Second, the blocking option—allowing workers to allocate all their workload at the beginning of the OAPT, which in fact is violating the idea of phased retirement in the first place—should be banned. This would reduce the attractiveness of the scheme but also the deadweight loss.|$|E
