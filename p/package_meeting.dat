All necessary auto-zero clock signals are generated internally, and no external capacitors are needed. The amplifier is completely self-biasing. Offsets at 250 °C are typically less than 10 micro-volts, and input noise from 0. 1 to 10 Hz is typically 5 micro-volts pk-pk. This makes this amplifier suitable for input conditioning for high-resolution DC or low-frequency applications. This design has been developed under the U. S.

40|$|This paper evaluates sealed {{hardware}} {{that meets}} the requirements of DOE-STD- 3013, ''Criteria for Preparing and packaging Plutonium Metals and Oxides for Long-Term Storage'' with respect to radioactive material (Type B quantity) transportation requirements. The Standard provides criteria for packaging of the plutonium materials for storage periods of at least 50 years. The standard requires the hardware to maintain integrity under both normal storage conditions and under anticipated handling conditions. To accomplish this, the standard requires that the plutonium be loaded in {{a minimum of two}} nested stainless steel sealed containers that are both tested for leak-tightness per ANSI N 14. 5. As such the 3013 hardware is robust. While the 3013 STD may provide appropriate storage criteria, it is not intended to provide criteria for transporting the material under the requirements of the Department of Transportation (DOT). In this evaluation, it is assumed that the activity of plutonium exceeds A 1 and/or A 2 curies as defined in DOT 49 CFR 173. 431 and therefore must be shipped as a Type B <b>package</b> <b>meeting</b> the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements of 10 CFR 71.

40|$|As part of Disease Control Priorities 3 rd Edition, the World Bank {{will publish}} a volume on Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health that {{identifies}} essential cost-effective health interventions {{that can be}} scaled up to reduce maternal, newborn, and child deaths, and stillbirths. This Review summarises the volume's key findings and estimates the effect and cost of expanded implementation of these interventions. Recognising that a continuum of care from the adolescent girl, woman, or mother to child is needed, the volume includes details of preventive and therapeutic health interventions in integrated packages: Maternal and Newborn Health and Child Health (along with folic acid supplementation, a key reproductive health intervention). Scaling up all interventions in these packages from coverage in 2015 to hypothetically immediately achieve 90 % coverage would avert 149 000 maternal deaths, 849 000 stillbirths, 1 498 000 neonatal deaths, and 1 515 000 additional child deaths. In alternative calculations that consider only the effects of {{reducing the number of}} pregnancies by provision of contraceptive services as part of a Reproductive Health <b>package,</b> <b>meeting</b> 90 % of the unmet need for contraception would reduce global births by almost 28 million and consequently avert deaths that could have occurred at 2015 rates of fertility and mortality. Thus, 67 000 maternal deaths, 440 000 neonatal deaths, 473 000 child deaths, and 564 000 stillbirths could be averted from avoided pregnancies. Particularly effective interventions in the Maternal and Newborn Health and Child Health packages would be management of labour and delivery, care of preterm births, and treatment of serious infectious diseases and acute malnutrition. Nearly all of these essential interventions can be delivered by health workers in the community or in primary health centres, which can increase population access to needed services. The annual incremental cost of immediately scaling up these essential interventions would be US$ 6. 2 billion in low-income countries, $ 12. 4 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and $ 8. 0 billion in upper-middle-income countries. With the additional funding, greater focus on high-effect integrated interventions and innovations in service delivery, such as task shifting to other groups of health workers and supply and demand incentives, can help rectify major gaps in accessibility and quality of care. In recent decades, reduction of avoidable maternal and child deaths has been a global priority. With continued priority and expansion of essential reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions to high coverage, equity, and quality, as well as interventions to address underlying problems such as women's low status in society and violence against women, these deaths and substantial morbidity can be largely eliminated in another generation...|$|E
