40|$|In {{this article}} we study a construction, due to Pak and Stanley, with which every region RR of the Shi {{arrangement}} is (bijectively) labelled with a <b>parking</b> <b>function</b> λ(R). In particular, we construct an algorithm that returns R out of λ(R). This is done by relating λ to another bijection, that labels every region S of the braid arrangement with r(S), the unique central <b>parking</b> <b>function</b> f such that λ− 1 (f) ⊆S. We also prove that λ maps the bounded regions of the Shi arrangement bijectively onto the prime parking functions. Finally, we introduce a variant (that we call “s-parking”) of the parking algorithm {{that is in the}} very origin of the term “parking function”. S-parking may be efficiently used in the context of our new algorithm, but we show that in some (well defined) cases it may even replace it...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Shi {{arrangement}} is {{the set of}} all hyperplanes in Rn of the form xj − xk = 0 or 1 for 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n. Shi observed in 1986 {{that the number of}} regions (i. e., connected components of the complement) of this {{arrangement is}} (n+ 1) n− 1. An unrelated combinatorial concept is that of a <b>parking</b> <b>function,</b> i. e., a sequence (x 1, x 2, [...] ., xn) of positive integers that, when rearranged from smallest to largest, satisfies xk ≤ k. (There is an illustrative reason for the term <b>parking</b> <b>function.)</b> It turns out that the number of parking functions of length n also equals (n + 1) n− 1, a result due to Konheim and Weiss from 1966. A natural problem consists of finding a bijection between the n-dimensional Shi arragnement and the parking functions of length n. Stanley and Pak (1996) and Athanasiadis and Linusson 1999) gave such (quite different) bijections. We will shed new light on the former bijection by taking a scenic route through certain mixed graphs. 1...|$|E

If all drivers are successful we speak about a <b>parking</b> <b>function</b> for the tree or mapping. We transfer well-known characterizations of parking functions to trees and mappings.
