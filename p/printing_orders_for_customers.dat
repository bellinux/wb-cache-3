The series depicts two aliens from warring races trying to survive with their newborn daughter. The book is Vaughan's first publication for Image Comics, and represents the first time he has employed first-person narration in his comics writing. The first issue sold out of its first printing ahead of its March 14 release date, with a second <b>printing</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>for</b> April 11, the same release date for issue #2. The series has received positive reviews from MTV, Ain't it Cool News, Comic Book Resources, IGN, Publishers Weekly and Time magazine. It has also appeared on the New York Times Graphic Books Best Seller List, won three 2013 Eisner Awards, won a Hugo Award and was nominated for seven Harvey Awards.|$|R
