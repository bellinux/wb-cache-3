The Center could rely on very modern equipment to meet NATO standards, and in 1963 became {{the first and only}} Special School for Aeronautical and Spatial Medicine in Italy. Because of its relevance in the field of medicine, it was visited in 1965 by Col. John Glenn, USAF, the first US astronaut to orbit the Earth.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Rendering of an Ericsson engine. A cold gaseous working fluid, such as {{atmospheric}} air (shown in blue), enters the cylinder via a non-return valve at the top-right. The air is compressed by the piston (black) as the piston moves upward. The compressed air {{is stored in}} the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tank</b> (at left). A two-way valve (gray) moves downward to allow pressurized air {{to pass through the}} regenerator where it is preheated. The air then enters the space below the piston, which is an externally heated expansion-chamber. The air expands and does work on the piston as it moves upward. After the expansion stroke, the two-way valve moves upward, thus closing off the tank and opening the exhaust port. As the piston moves back downward in the exhaust stroke, hot air is pushed back through the regenerator, which reclaims most of the heat, before passing out the exhaust port (left) as cool air.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports a}} new perfusion-based, micro {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) cell culture platform for high-throughput cell culture using enabling microfluidic technologies. In this work, the micro 3 -D cell culture platform is fabricated based on SU- 8 lithography and polydimethylsiloxane replication processes. The micro cell culture platform can maintain homogenous and stable culture environments, {{as well as}} provide pumping of multiple mediums and efficient cell/agarose (scaffold) loading functions, which allows realization of more precise and high-throughput cell culture-based assays. In this study, the design of a high-throughput medium pumping mechanism was especially highlighted. A new serpentine-shaped pneumatic micropump was used to provide the required medium pumping mechanism. Pneumatic microchannels with a varied length and U-shape bending corners were designed to connect three rectangular pneumatic chambers such that one can fine-tune the pumping rate of the S-shape micropump by using the fluidic resistance. To achieve a high-throughput medium pumping function, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tank</b> was designed to simultaneously activate all of the 30 pneumatic micropumps with a uniform pumping rate. Results show that the pumping rates of the 30 integrated micropumps were statistically uniform with a flow rate ranging from 8. 5 to 185. 1 microl h(- 1), indicating the present multiple medium pumping mechanism is feasible for high-throughput medium delivery purposes. Furthermore, as a demonstration case study, 3 -D culture of oral cancer cell was successfully performed, showing that the cell viability remained as high as 95 % - 98 % during the 48 h cell culture. As the result of miniaturization, this perfusion-based 3 -D cell culture platform not only provides a well-defined and stable culture condition, but also greatly reduces the sample/reagent consumption and the need for human intervention. Moreover, due to the integrated capability for multiple medium pumping, high-throughput research work can be achieved. These traits are found particularly useful for high-precision and high-throughput, 3 -D cell culture-based assay...|$|E
50|$|Galloway devised an {{improved}} walling cradle enabling two teams of workers {{to operate on}} different levels at the same time. He also devised a means of substituting the cages with water tanks to remove large quantities of water from flooded mines quickly. They became known as Galloway <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tanks</b> In 1875, he patented {{the idea of using}} twin guides or guide ropes for the kibble, allowing two kibbles to be used to sink a shaft. He also devised improved counterbalanced doors to cover the shaft top, speeding up operations and reducing the danger of injury to men, and damage to the shaft. He designed a steel bucket to carry the coal underground with wheels lubricated from hollow axle boxes and buffers, giving a smoother ride and lessening the amount of coal dust dropped on the road, and he also devised an engine small enough to be taken down in a cage and which could run along the tracks and be operated by compressed air, removing the need for pit ponies for hauling coal trucks. He installed a compressed air system using two engines to raise and lower equipment at Llanbradach colliery.|$|R

40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: Brood year 2008 {{production}} and experimental hatchery & supplemental crossed eggs {{continue to be}} incubated and chilled water at 380 Fahrenheit for the month. Temperature units are {approx} 960 TU's {{at the end of}} the month. Hatching was observed at {approx} 900 temperature units (TU's). The 2007 Brood year (BY) has approximately 773, 477 juveniles on hand at the end of December, averaging 30. 6 fish per pound. Fish tagging operations wrapped up on the 5 th. Transportation of fish to acclimation sites is tentatively scheduled to begin January 12 th. FISH CULTURE: Production pond cleaning continues on a weekly basis, and feeding continues to be performed two days per week due to the colder river water temperatures. Eggs in the incubation continue to be tempered in 38 degree water and temperature units recorded daily. On the 20 th the river became too inclement for normal operations as the intake screens were covered with ice, at that time we shutdown two river pumps and turned on wells four and six to get 6, 825 gallons of water. This was the operation at the facility for twenty-four hours at which point we were able to get back to normal operations. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 756 gallons/min. The river pumps are supplying 13, 571 gallons per minute. Well pumps No. 2 and No. 4 are operating and supplying 1, 185 gallons/min. More on well pumps in the well field maintenance section of this report. ACCLIMATION SITES: Preparation of acclimation sites for fish transfer was the main focus for the month of December. Each week thermographs that record water temperature have the data disc changed at the acclimations sites. Ford Excavation with assistance from YKFP maintenance has started clearing snow out of the Easton acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: The snowmobiles were taken in to have annual maintenance performed. The full-size John Deere tractor needed and was taken to Barnet Implement in Yakima. The tractor needed a new clutch installed and was picked up on the 31 st. SHOP BUILDING MAINTENANCE: On the 12 th the facility domestic water hydro <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tank</b> and its system malfunctioned. The problem persisted and had to be dealt with multiple times; first it caused the tank to over flow and floods the shop. Wallace Electric was called and after extensive monitoring of the tank, compressor and electrical operations an electrical relay switch was replaced. Weekly cleaning and tool inventory continues to be a priority. The shop is home to our liberation truck along with fish transfer equipment, fish pump and seine nets. ELECTRICAL BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The large generator is located in the electrical building and is checked daily for routine inspections. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The incubation building is being used to clean and repair isolation buckets, egg incubation baskets and troughs. An experiment involving remote site incubators (RSI's) continued through the month. Chad Stockton, WDFW, records flows and monitors emergence of fry on a daily basis. Chad is working with Steve S. and Curt K. on the RSI's research along with spawning channel fry emergence. RIVERWATER COOLING FACILITY: The one pump in operation in this building is checked daily during our routine inspections, the variable pump is supplying water to the artificial spawning channel. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four river pumps are in operation and pumping {approx} 13, 571 gallons/min to the facility. The building is cleaned monthly and the air burst system is cycled daily during the morning checks. The crew continued weekly changing of the graph paper on the river temperature thermograph throughout the month, continuing this activity as part of the daily checks routine. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Wells No. 1 and No. 4 were in operation and supplying 1, 185 gallons/minute to the facility and incubation building. Weekly test well readings are recorded and sent via fax to CH 2 MHILL. Also weekly well meter readings are recorded. Well No. 5 had been determined to have a faulty drain valve while trying to operate the pump for emergency water usage. It was determined that water was not able to drain and began to flow out from the test hole (TH 9). Charlie and Simon pumped out the remaining water from the test hole prior to replacing the valve. The valve was subsequently dug up, replaced and tested for operation. SAFETY AND TRAINING: The winter season has approached and conditions can be hazardous as Cle Elum staff stress safety while working and preparing acclimation sites for upcoming fish transfer. Some examples include wearing proper clothing, extra caution while driving and plowing snow. GROUNDS: Linda Lamebull of fisheries and personnel from Tribal Purchasing came to the hatchery to inventory two way radios...|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} {{development of}} renewable energy sources utilization was not reached in last years in Slovakia. This is caused by some barriers. These barriers decrease the easiness of investments into the Renewable energy sources utilization. We recognize specific barriers for each {{of renewable energy}} sources and general barriers for all renewable energy sources. Activities of the Renewable Energy Sources Centre help to eliminate both specific and general barriers in Slovakia. The main activities are: a realization of research projects, working out expertises and feasibility studies, information of public about principals and specifics of the wind energy utilization. How the Renewable Energy Sources Centre encourages of the utilization wind energy can be demonstrated {{on one of the}} research projects: The designing a stable standpoint with a sufficient storage tank of wind energy, possibly of compressed air. The wind energy serves as a primary resource when it powers the compressor, which fills the <b>pneumatic</b> accumulator (storage <b>tank</b> of compressed air).

40|$|The Barnett shale basin, {{the largest}} onshore gas {{field in the}} state of Texas, mainly {{produces}} natural gas. The basin’s oil and gas productions have dramatically increased {{over the past two decades}} with the enhancement via shale fracturing (fracking) technology. However, recent studies suggest that air emissions from shale fracking have significantly contributed to the growing air pollution problem in North Texas. In this study, air emissions from the Barnett shale basin during the production phase of the oil and gas activities (once the product is collected from the wells) are quantified. Oil and gas production data were acquired from the Texas Railroad Commission for the baseline years of 2010 through 2013. Methodology from prior studies on shale basins approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was employed in this study and the emission inventories from the production phase sources were quantified. Accordingly, the counties with the most gas operations in the basin, Tarrant, Johnson, Denton and Wise, were found to be the highest emitters of air pollutants. Tarrant County was responsible for the highest emitted NOx (42, 566 tons) and CO (17, 698 tons) in the basin, while Montague County released the maximum VOC emissions (87, 601 tons) during the study period. Amongst the concerned emitted pollutants, VOC was the largest emitted pollutant during the study period (417, 804 tons), followed by NOx (126, 691 tons) and CO (47, 884 tons). Significant Sources of air emissions include: storage tanks, wellhead compressor engines, and <b>pneumatic</b> devices. Storage <b>tanks</b> and <b>pneumatic</b> devices contributed to about 62 % and 28 % of the total VOC emissions, respectively. Whereas, wellhead compressor engines are primarily responsible for about 97 % of the total NOx emissions. Finally, in Tarrant, Wise and Denton counties, the emissions increased during the study period due to increase in the oil and gas production, while Johnson County’s emission contribution declined throughout the study period...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Vehicles used in military, agricultural, forestry, or {{construction}} applications often encounter different road surfaces {{during a}} single journey. In order to optimise {{the mobility of}} these vehicles, different tyre pressures are required for different types of terrain (sand, mud, cross country, tar road, etc.). An in-motion tyre pressure control system will enable the vehicle's operator to change the tyre pressures without leaving the vehicle. Such a system will not only allow optimum surface contact between the tyres and the terrain - thus improving vehicletraction, {{but it can also}} increase the lifespan of the tyres and reduce fuel consumption. The key design criteria for such a system are: quick reaction times, an effective operator interface, and reliability. In case of system failure, the operator must be able to override the control, and the tyres should be inflated to a pre-set default pressure. When the fault had been corrected, the system can be restarted from within the cabin, to inflate or deflate the tyres as required. The focus of this thesis is on the design criteria of a tyre pressure control system, receiving inputs from the driver and from onboard vehicle sensors; and then adjusting individual tyre pressures if necessary, while the vehicle is on the move. Based on the inputs to the control system, the optimum setting for the tyre pressure is determined from a look-up table stored in memory of an onboard computer. This table contains the pressure-speed and pressure-axle load relationship. A unique relation is programmed into the microprocessor for each different vehicle. To install a tyre pressure control system on a vehicle, a computer program is used to control the following hardware which are necessary to inflate or deflate tyres: An air compressor and storage <b>tank.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> valve. Rotating seal. Pressure and speed sensing elements. Electronic control unit. An experimental set-up was built, from various components or sub-systems, which were integrated systematically until the system was working as a unit. The functionality of the system was tested, and although the results obtained do not yet justify the commercial manufacturing of such systems, it is trusted that this research has contributed towards the increased emphasis that is placed upon vehicle safety and comfort systems...|$|R
