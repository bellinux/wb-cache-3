50|$|In 1979 Dean {{joined the}} Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit in Edinburgh under the {{directorship}} of Norman Kreitman and conducted collaborative {{research on the}} epidemiology of depression which involved interviewing {{a random sample of}} the female population in Edinburgh. The findings were that women who were working class, unemployed and divorced, separated or widowed had more than ten times the rate of depression and anxiety compared with women who were middle class, married or single and employed.Shortly after this Dean became a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh under Professor Robert Kendell who was Head of Department. She conducted research with Professor Kendell on post-natal depression and <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> and found that women who were having their first baby, those who had a caesarean section and those who were unmarried were more likely to develop <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> following childbirth. At this time Dean collaborated with Sir Patrick Forrest (Professor of Surgery at Edinburgh University) in the first random controlled study to compare the psychological effects of mastectomy, for breast cancer, compared with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. The study demonstrated the psychological and practical benefits of immediate breast reconstruction and this is now routinely offered to women requiring mastectomy.In 1982 Dean took up a consultant psychiatrist post in Manchester and with Francis Creed, established one of the first day hospitals to provide an alternative to hospital admissions for people with acute mental health problems. Whilst in Manchester she was appointed {{as one of the first}} medical Unit General Managers in the UK, following the Griffiths Report (1983), and managed the mental health services, the community services and the dental hospital at Central Manchester Health Authority. During this time Dean set up an Arts project for patients, START. The project resulted in some of the works produced by the patients being displayed in Manchester City Art Gallery.|$|E

40|$|Most {{clinical}} and genetic {{evidence suggests that}} <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> {{is closely related to}} bipolar affective disorder. During a linkage study of bipolar disorder we ascertained a British family in which <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> was associated with consanguinity in three sisters. All three subjects had lifetime RDC diagnoses of bipolar I or manic disorder. An inbred brother also had bipolar I disorder. The only female member of the sibship to escape <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> was outbred. These findings are consistent with several genetic models for bipolar disorder in this family. The most interesting possibility is a single major susceptibility locus of recessive effect.

If other inbred families can be found in which the same putative recessive locus is operating, the power to localise the gene by homozygosity mapping would be greatly increased...|$|E
40|$|Background Previous {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} highlighted {{a number of}} obstetric variables that {{may be associated with}} the development of broadly defined puerperal (post-partum) psychosis. These include: (a) primiparity, (b) pregnancy complications, (c) delivery complications, (d) Caesarean section, (e) female baby and (f) shorter gestation period. Aims To examine these risk factors in women with well-characterised bipolar affective <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Method A sample of 129 women with bipolar affective <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> were investigated using a design that takes advantage of within-subject comparisons of affected and unaffected deliveries. Results Two of the variables studied were independently associated with an episode of puerperal psychosis: primiparity (odds ratio= 3. 76, P < 0. 001) and delivery complications (odds ratio= 2. 68, P= 0. 022).

40|$|<b>Puerperal</b> <b>{{psychosis}},</b> {{an episode}} of mania or psychosis precipitated by childbirth follows approximately one in 1000 deliveries. The evidence of clinical, outcome and genetic studies supports {{the hypothesis that the}} majority of puerperal psychotic episodes are manifestations of an affective disorder diathesis with a puerperal trigger. Furthermore the available evidence supports the hypothesis that genes are involved in susceptibility to both diathesis and trigger. For complex genetic disorders such as affective illness there are marked benefits in focussing on a homogeneous subtype which allows a subset of hypotheses to be tested. Molecular genetic studies of <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> provide an excellent example of this strategy, allowing a hierarchy of hypotheses concerning the involvement of neurosteroid pathways in pathophysiology to be tested. <b>Puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> results in considerable suffering to a woman and her family.

40|$|A {{number of}} lines of {{evidence}} point to the possible involvement of estrogen pathways in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder in general and <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> in particular. There is strong evidence from clinical, follow-up, and genetic studies to {{support the hypothesis that}} most cases of <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> are manifestations of an affective disorder diathesis with a puerperal trigger and that genes influence susceptibility to both diathesis and trigger. The nature of the trigger is unknown but in view of the abrupt onset at a time of major physiological change it is widely believed that biological, probably hormonal, mechanisms are of paramount importance, with estrogen receiving the most attention to date. We have undertaken a case control association study of bipolar disorder and <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> at two known polymorphisms within the estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR 1) in a sample of 219 unrelated bipolar probands and 219 controls. We could exclude these polymorphisms from an important contribution to susceptibility to bipolar disorder {{with a high level of}} confidence. We found no support for the hypothesis that they contribute specific susceptibility to the puerperal trigger, but due to the small numbers of puerperal probands (n = 26) no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their involvement in <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Am.

40|$|Genes {{involved}} in estrogen pathways {{have been proposed}} as possible candidates influencing susceptibility to bipolar disorder and the affective symptoms suffered by many women during the puerperal period. The estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene in particular has been a subject of interest and has recently been intensively screened for variations of potential relevance to psychiatric disorders, resulting {{in the identification of}} four mutations in individuals with bipolar disorder or <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis.</b> We have examined the frequency of these four ERα variations in a case control study using a group of mixed gender bipolar individuals (N[*]=[*] 231), further classified into subsets of parous bipolar females with (N[*]=[*] 112) and without (N[*]=[*] 50) <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and a non-psychiatric comparison group (N[*]=[*] 110). We have also investigated the families in which the variations were initially detected, for evidence of co-segregation of the variants with mood disorder. We found no evidence in our case control sample to support the involvement of any of the ERα variations in either the aetiology of bipolar disorder or puerperal triggering of bipolar episodes. Nor did we find co-segregation of ERα variants and disease in any of the four families examined. We conclude that variation in the coding sequence and flanking splice junctions of the ERα gene does not play an important pathogenic role in the majority of cases of Bipolar Disorder or Bipolar Affective <b>Puerperal</b> <b>Psychosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Perinatal {{mental illness}} {{influences}} obstetric outcomes, mother-baby interactions and longer term emotional and cognitive {{development of the}} child. Psychiatric disorders have consistently {{been found to be}} one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, often through suicide. Postnatal depression and <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> are two disorders most commonly associated with the perinatal period. The most efficient strategy to identify patients at risk relies on focussing on clinically vulnerable subgroups: enquiries about depressive symptoms should be made at the usual screening visits. Attention should be paid to any sign of poor self-care, avoidance of eye contact, overactivity or underactivity, or abnormalities in the rate of speech. Particular care should be taken to ask about suicidal ideation and thoughts of harming others, including the baby. One of the most important risk factors is a previous history of depression. The degree of risk is directly correlated with severity of past episodes. Both antenatal and postnatal depression are being increasingly recognised in men. <b>Puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> is rare (1 to 2 per 1, 000). Sixty per cent of women with <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on 13 papers {{published}} in peer reviewed journals. These include studies on epidemiology and treatment of major psychotic disorders, and metanalysis of studies on Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) and {{its relationship with the}} Gross Domestic Product and the outcome in Low and Middle Income (LAMl) countries. Based on this research that highlighted the extent and impact of untreated psychosis, a series of papers presented a novel approach for early intervention in psychosis in LAMl countries. The final paper presents the randomised controlled trial evaluating this approach. Seven publications on <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> homicide by patients suffering from Schizophrenia, and the impact of cannabis use on symptomatology and course of schizophrenia highlighted significant gaps in the care of schizophrenia in developing countries. Only 12 patients (24 %), charged with homicide had received some form of treatment before the index crime, despite the fact that duration of illness was more than 5 years in most cases. In a clinical sample of 35 patients suffering from acute episode of <b>Puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> the mean time between the onset of symptoms and receiving psychiatric care was almost a month. Two third of mothers suffering from <b>Puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> could not breast feed, most showing almost total lack of concern for the baby and also other behavior which could result in harm to baby. The publications on <b>Puerperal</b> <b>psychosis</b> argued that prevention of the disorder should be feasible in developing countries in view of high incidence of the disorder following an identifiable life event (childbirth) and {{the fact that most of}} the risk factors could be screened in the antenatal period. A paper published in British Journal of Psychiatry estimated the Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) and its impact on the outcome of psychosis. Based on metanalysis of 98 studies (23 from LAMI countries and 75 were from high-income countries) the DUP of LAMI countries (125 weeks) was twice as long as the DUP in high-income countries (63 weeks, p=O.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vulnerability to the {{triggering}} of bipolar episodes by childbirth aggregates {{in families}} and may define a genetically relevant subtype of bipolar disorder. The authors conducted a search by systematic whole genome linkage scan for loci influencing vulnerability to bipolar affective <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis.</b> METHOD: The authors selected families with bipolar disorder from their previous bipolar disorder genome scan, {{in which there}} was at least one family member with a manic or psychotic episode with an onset within 6 weeks of delivery. Individuals were coded as affected if they had been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, according to DSM-IV. A total of 36 pedigrees contributed 54 affected sibling pairs to the cohort. A genome scan with 494 microsatellite markers was analyzed using GENEHUNTER and MAPMAKER/SIBS. RESULTS: A genome-wide significant linkage signal was observed on chromosome 16 p 13, and a genome-wide suggestive linkage was observed on chromosome 8 q 24. No significant or suggestive linkage was observed in these regions in our original bipolar scan.

40|$|The {{macrophage}} {{theory of}} depression proposes that an excessive secretion of monocyte / macrophage cytokines causes symptoms of depression. It {{has been suggested}} that changes in immune function that accompany pregnancy and childbirth could contribute to the affective symptoms suffered by many puerperal women. Tumour necrosis factor [alpha] (TNF[alpha]) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in inflammatory infections and immune diseases.

The - 308 promoter polymorphism has been associated with elevated production of TNF[alpha] and has been found to influence the neurological outcome of various infections. In a case-control association study, we have examined the frequency of this polymorphism in groups of parous DSM-IV Bipolar females with (N = 116) and without (N = 56) <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and a female non-psychiatric comparison group (N = 72).

Animals were selected from carefully phenotyped unrelated infanticide and control groups (representing extremes of the phenotypic spectrum), from four different lines. Permutation and sliding window analyses and an analysis to see which haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were compared to identify concordant regions. Across all analyses, intervals on SSCs 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13 were constant, contained genes associated with psychiatric or neurological disorders and were significant in multiple lines.

To investigate this possibility, regions of likely functional significance (all coding exons and flanking splice junctions) of the ERα and TRα genes were scanned in patients with schizophrenia (113), along with pilot studies in patients with bipolar illness (BPI), <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and alcoholism. A total of 1. 18 megabases of the ERα gene and 1. 16 megabases of the TRα gene were scanned with Detection of Virtually All Mutations-SSCP (DOVAM-S), a method that detects virtually all mutations. Four missense mutations, seven silent mutations and one deletion were identified in the ERα gene, while only four silent mutations {{were present in the}} TRα gene. Two of the missense mutations in ERα are conserved in the six available mammalian and bird species (H 6 Y, K 299 R) and a third sequence variant (P 146 Q) is conserved in mammals, birds, and Xenopus laevis, hinting that these sequence changes will be of functional significance.

The clinical picture resembles that of <b>puerperal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and there are at least 20 women who have suffered both psychoses at different epochs in their lives.
