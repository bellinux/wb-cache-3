The process of driving chain producing on the Daugavpils driving chain factory obtains all types of <b>perforated</b> steel <b>band.</b> Mechanical properties of several types of <b>perforated</b> steel <b>band,</b> which are differed by their thicknesses, widths, diameters and shapes of holes so as the grades of steel, were estimated. Thicknesses and widths of considered types of <b>perforated</b> steel <b>band</b> changes from 1, 4 to 1, 7 mm and from 80 to 90 mm respectively. Possibilities to obtain several kinds of cross-sections from the considered types of <b>perforated</b> steel <b>band</b> by the profiling were stated. It was shown, that the steel profiles {{on the base}} of <b>perforated</b> steel <b>band</b> are suitable for the several structural applications, such as profiles for plastering and other types of finishing works, light weight beams and columns, so as decorative elements.

30|$|The gauge design, if {{like that}} of a {{standard}} model a half-century earlier (Eccles 1901 a, pp 11 – 13), included a stilling well that communicated with the sea through a hole 2.5  cm in diameter (Eccles 1901 b, p 9). A float in the stilling well was suspended on a <b>perforated</b> copper <b>band</b> that turned a wheel on the graphing device. This wheel, through gears and a cable, moved a pencil across a gridded sheet mounted on a rotating drum nearly 1.6  m long.

500|$|The {{project would}} soon head off in more {{productive}} directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, {{for which he}} departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a [...] "chronophotographic gun"—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon {{his return to the}} United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a <b>perforated</b> image <b>band</b> was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device {{is often referred to as}} an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily [...] "freeze" [...] the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During surgery, {{controlled}} haemostasis {{to prevent}} blood loss {{is vital for}} a successful outcome. It {{can be difficult to}} ligate vessels located deep in the abdomen. A device that is easy to use and enables secure ligatures could be beneficial. Cable ties made of nylon have been used for ligation but the non-resorbable material caused tissue reactions. The objective {{of this study was to}} use a resorbable material to construct a device with a self-locking mechanism and to test its mechanical strength and ligation efficiency. Methods The device was manufactured by injection moulding of polydioxanone, a resorbable polymer used for suture materials. Polydioxanone with inherent viscosities of 1. 9 dL/g and 1. 3 dL/g were tested. The device consisted of a <b>perforated</b> flexible <b>band</b> which could be pulled through a case with a locking mechanism. After a first version of the device had been tested, some improvements were made. The locking case was downsized, corners were rounded off, the band was made thicker and the mould was redesigned to produce longer devices. Tensile tests were performed with the second version. The first version of the device was used to ligate the ovarian pedicle in a euthanized dog and to test echogenicity of the device with ultrasound. Compression of vessels of the ovarian pedicle was examined by histology. Both versions of the device were tested for haemostasis of and tissue grip on renal arteries in six anaesthetised pigs. Results The tensile strength of the flexible band of the devices with inherent viscosity of 1. 9 dL/g was 50. 1 ± 5. 5 N (range 35. 2 - 62. 9 N, n = 11) and the devices with inherent viscosity of 1. 3 dL/g had a tensile strength of 39. 8 ± 8. 1 N (range 18. 6 - 54. 2 N, n = 11). Injection moulding of the polymer with lower inherent viscosity resulted in a longer flow distance. Both versions of the device had an effective tissue grip and complete haemostasis of renal arteries was verified. The device attached to the ovarian pedicle could be seen with ultrasound, and vessel compression and occlusion were verified by histology. Conclusions Tests of functionality of the device showed complete haemostasis and good tissue grip. Devices with a band of sufficient length were easily applied and tightened in tissue. </p...|$|R
50|$|By far {{the largest}} class of tunicates is the Ascidiacea. The body of an ascidiacean is {{surrounded}} by a test or tunic, from which the subphylum derives its name. This varies in thickness between species but may be tough, resembling cartilage, thin and delicate, or transparent and gelatinous. The tunic is composed of proteins and complex carbohydrates, and includes tunicin, a variety of cellulose. The tunic is unique among invertebrate exoskeletons in that it can grow as the animal enlarges and {{does not need to be}} periodically shed. Inside the tunic is the body wall or mantle composed of connective tissue, muscle fibres, blood vessels, and nerves. Two openings are found in the body wall: the buccal siphon at the top through which water flows into the interior, and the atrial siphon on the ventral side through which it is expelled. A large pharynx occupies most of the interior of the body. It is a muscular tube linking the buccal opening with the rest of the gut. It has a ciliated groove known as an endostyle on its ventral surface, and this secretes a mucous net which collects food particles and is wound up on the dorsal side of the pharynx. The gullet, at the lower end of the pharynx, links it to a loop of gut which terminates near the atrial siphon. The walls of the pharynx are <b>perforated</b> by several <b>bands</b> of slits, known as stigmata, through which water escapes into the surrounding water-filled cavity, the atrium. This is criss-crossed by various rope-like mesenteries which extend from the mantle and provide support for the pharynx, preventing it from collapsing, and also hold up the other organs.|$|R
5000|$|Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting {{progress}} at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 {{of an inch}} wide, directly on to a cylinder (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as Monkeyshines, No. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.The project would soon head off in more productive directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, for which he departed August 2 or 3, 1889.
