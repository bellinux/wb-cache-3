40|$|The Belgian medical {{profession}} clearly {{suffered from a}} lack of internal coherence in the nineteenth century. The interests and objectives of, for example, the Royal Academy of Medicine, the <b>provincial</b> <b>medical</b> <b>boards</b> and the Fe´de´ration Me´dicale Beige, were by no means homogeneous. And even within the Federation itself, there tended to be a split on every question of tactics. In this article, two general trends will be described: the legal unification of the profession and its institutional development. In the third section, attention will be focused on the impact of the professional associations on medical education and on the control of medical practice. Each section begins with a survey {{of the state of the}} Belgian {{medical profession}} prior to the Belgian independence in 1830. Finally, some concluding comments are given. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Medical {{failures}} often hampered {{the reputation}} of these physicians which made their status as professionals harder to implement and make the general population accept them as this. Not to mention over-crowding eventually became a problem. the profession called on the government for help especially {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Restriction on who could get in medical schools, and higher demands on their education were put in place. As well, greater attentions to their professional ethics were among the strategies employed to distinguish themselves as high status professionals. Physicians also pressured the government for better attention to the health of its citizens. For example, the recollection of data of the births and deaths which it had stopped doing in the Maritimes in 1877. <b>Provincial</b> <b>medical</b> <b>boards,</b> allowance of registration for practice across all provinces, better schools, protection against the unlicensed physicians and unskilled persons, were some other actions taken.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Simcoe, Upper Canada, the son of John O'Donnell, a native of Ireland, and was educated at Victoria University and Trinity Medical College. In 1861, he married Hannah Routledge. He practised in St. Catharines, Ontario and Montreal before coming to Manitoba during the Red River Rebellion of 1869. While helping defend John Christian Schultz's property, O'Donnell was taken prisoner. He was a {{justice of the peace}} and made out the arrest warrant for Louis Riel when the Wolseley Expedition arrived in 1870. He was the first {{president}} of the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Medical</b> Health <b>Board</b> of Manitoba. O'Donnell served as provincial coroner and helped found the Winnipeg General Hospital. He was a professor of sanitary science at the Medical College of the University of Manitoba and served on the council for the University.|$|R
40|$|Research, {{all over}} the world, is {{starting}} to recognize {{the potential impact of}} physicians’ dissatisfaction and burnout on their productivity, that is, on their intent to leave the job, on their work ability, on the amount of sick leave days, on their intent to continue practicing, and last but not least, {{on the quality of the}} services provided, which is an essential part of the general medical care system. It was interest of the <b>provincial</b> <b>medical</b> <b>board’s</b> ethical committee to acquire information about physician’s work-related stress and dissatisfaction. The research group was committed to define the indicators of dissatisfaction and work-related stressors. Focus groups were carried out, 21 stressful experience’s indicators were identified; we developed an online questionnaire to assess the amount of perceived stress relating to each indicator at work (3070 physicians were contacted by e-mail); quantitative and qualitative data analysis were carried out. The grounded theory perspective was applied in order to assure the most reliable procedure to investigate the concepts’ structure of work-related stress. We tested the five dimensions' model of the stressful experience with a confirmatory factor analysis: Personal Costs; Decline in Public Image and Role Uncertainty; Physician's Responsibility toward hopelessly ill Patients; Relationship with Staff and Colleagues; Bureaucracy. We split the sample according to attachment style (secure and insecure -anxious and avoidant-). Results show the complex representation of physicians’ dissatisfaction at work also with references to the variable of individual difference of attachment security/insecurity. The discriminant validity of the scale was tested. The original contribution of this paper lies on the one hand in the qualitative in depth inductive analysis of physicians’ dissatisfaction starting from physicians’ perception, on the other hand, it represents the first attempt to analyze the physicians' dissatisfaction with reference to attachment styles, which is recognized as being a central variable of individual difference supporting caregiving practices. This study represents an original and innovative attempt to address physicians’ dissatisfaction and job satisfaction. The PhyDis scale has been developed and, in line with international findings, our results indicate that role uncertainty and loss of social esteem are the most dissatisfying factors...|$|R

50|$|Axel J. Hojer led Board of Health {{study in}} 1948 {{on the health}} care reorganization. The study {{suggested}} a focus on preventive care and strengthening of <b>provincial</b> <b>medical</b> offices. The proposal was motivated in particular {{by the fact that the}} proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. The study polemicized <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> and <b>Medical</b> Association's view with regard to primary care. Inquiry advocated a polyclinic form, where the reception for outpatient health care would be free and operated by the community.The Höjer study was the first and comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested establishment of centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and was located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and located in provincial stations. Hojer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.|$|R
