5|$|Hill was {{a moving}} {{force behind the}} {{development}} of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, {{and made it a}} key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{as soon as}} {{the season}} had ended, Luckman volunteered as an ensign with the U. S. Merchant Marine.

5|$|McMillin played {{professional}} football {{in the early}} days of the NFL, with the Milwaukee Badgers and the Cleveland Indians.

5|$|Mitchell {{worked out}} for the Kansas City Chiefs on June 6, 2005, {{following}} his release from the Eagles. He signed with the Chiefs on June 17 after Az-Zahir Hakim decided against signing with the team. Mitchell did not receive a signing bonus. He began practicing with the team {{on the last day}} of mini-camps, June 18, and received extra <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coaches the following week. He suffered a knee injury during practice on July 30 and was scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery the following week, but declined to go through with it. He was released on September 2 due to concerns about his knee. Mitchell elected to have knee surgery on September 6 following his release.|$|E
5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} {{as a temporary}} clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took a second job, working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his first-class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.|$|E

5|$|Robinson is {{the first}} player to {{transfer}} from Division III to Division I with a full scholarship according to some sources. During the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Robinson redshirted for the 2014–15 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, meaning that he could not participate in games, but could <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team. In December 2014 with assistant coach Jeff Meyer as his rebounder, Robinson broke Stauskas' Michigan Wolverines men's basketball practice record for three-pointers in a drill (five minutes, one ball, one rebounder) by posting 78, surpassing Stauskas by 3.|$|E

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Penguins in 2015, Sprong rejoined the Islanders for the {{remainder}} of the 2015–16 season. He played 33 games for the Islanders and recorded 46 points. The team made the playoffs, where Sprong scored a further 15 points before the team was eliminated in the second round. An injury sustained during <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Penguins during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs kept Sprong out until January, 2017 when he rejoined Charlottetown. He only played 31 games that season, but finished with 59 points, the highest points-per-game average in the entire league. He finished his career with the Islanders with the third goals and second most points in team history, and during the playoffs he tied the record for most career goals and broke the records for most assists and points. Sprong led the Islanders in scoring with 20 points in 12 games as the team lost in the third round of the playoffs, ending his junior career. Following that he was recalled again by the Penguins to train with them during their time in the NHL playoffs.|$|E

During his absence, the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21, 2009, {{for the first time since}} Richards' hit. The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3, 2010.

5|$|Born in Waukegan, Illinois, Graham's first {{interest}} {{growing up}} was music. Encouraged by his parents, {{both of whom}} were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, cornet and French horn. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him throwing in an intramural game and invited him to <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up. Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. As a senior, he was named a first-team basketball All-American, part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position.|$|E

5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian <b>practice,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> daughter {{of a man who}} died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1989–90 season, Hextall became unhappy {{that his}} eight-year, $4million {{contract}} was only earning him $325,000 a year, and hired a confrontational agent, Ritch Winter, to renegotiate his contract. The Flyers refused {{to deal with}} the agent, and at a tearful press conference, Hextall declared his contract invalid and announced that he would not take part in the team's training camp. After negotiations about which neither side revealed details, Hextall returned to <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team on October20, 42days later. Hextall suffered a slight groin pull during his first game back, and in his second, he hurt his left hamstring. Just under a month later, while playing for the Hershey Bears in an attempt to establish his fitness, he was carried off the ice after once more hurting his groin. In total that season, Hextall appeared nine times; once for the Bears in the AHL, and eight times for the Flyers. In the NHL, he recorded a GAA of4.15, the highest he averaged during any single season of the NHL.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be split on the track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day before had not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the kerbs at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull came back with both of the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E
