5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the <b>protective</b> <b>tariff.</b> While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened in}} Louisville on August 19, 1895. In his first address, Hardin came out squarely for free silver, ensuring {{the division of}} his party {{for the rest of}} the campaign. Bradley reprised much of his argument from the 1887 campaign against Buckner. He charged mismanagement of state government by Democrats, citing Tate's defalcation as evidence. He also stressed Hardin's association with Tate; Hardin had been the state's attorney general when Tate absconded, and the two were known to be friends. He denounced free silver and again called for a high <b>protective</b> <b>tariff.</b> He blamed Democratic President Cleveland for the national depression.|$|E

5|$|In December 1791, Hamilton {{published}} the Report on Manufactures, which recommended numerous policies {{designed to protect}} U.S. merchants and industries {{in order to increase}} national wealth, induce artisans to immigrate, cause machinery to be invented, and employ women and children. Hamilton called for the federally-supervised infrastructure projects, the establishment of state-owned munitions factories and subsidies for privately owned factories, and the imposition of a <b>protective</b> <b>tariff.</b> Though Congress had adopted much of Hamilton's earlier proposals, his manufacturing proposals fell flat, even in the more-industrialized North, as merchant-shipowners had a stake in free trade. There were also questions raised about the constitutionality of these proposals, and opponents such as Jefferson feared that Hamilton's expansive interpretation of the Taxing and Spending Clause would grant Congress the power to legislate on any subject.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong <b>protective</b> <b>tariff,</b> which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a <b>protective</b> <b>tariff,</b> defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a <b>protective</b> <b>tariff</b> that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B. Buckner, a former Confederate general. In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high <b>protective</b> <b>tariff,</b> and developing the state's resources. He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A similar situation existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E

2500|$|Protest {{against the}} {{prospect}} and {{the constitutionality of}} higher tariffs began in 1826 and 1827 with William Branch Giles, who had the Virginia legislature pass resolutions denying the power of Congress to pass <b>protective</b> <b>tariffs,</b> citing the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and James Madison's 1800 defense of them.

25|$|In the mid 19th century {{politics}} in Delaware were {{divided between the}} majority Whigs and minority Democrats. The Whigs were the party in opposition to U.S. President Andrew Jackson, his political successors and their policies. They were for a strong Union, good banks and a <b>protective</b> <b>tariff.</b> As the primary heirs to the old Federalist Party in Delaware, their greatest strength was among the old stock, rural, agricultural population in Kent and Sussex County. Conversely, the Democrats were in support of Jacksonian policies, and found their strength in New Castle County and among Quakers, Ulster-Scots and the more recent immigrants.|$|E
25|$|The period {{preceding}} the Long Depression {{had been one}} of increasing economic internationalism, championed by efforts such as the Latin Monetary Union, many of which then were derailed or stunted by the impacts of economic uncertainty. The extraordinary collapse of farm prices provoked a protectionist response in many nations. Rejecting the free trade policies of the Second Empire, French president Adolphe Thiers led the new Third Republic to protectionism, which led ultimately to the stringent Méline tariff in 1892. Germany's agrarian Junker aristocracy, under attack by cheap, imported grain, successfully agitated for a <b>protective</b> <b>tariff</b> in 1879 in Otto von Bismarck's Germany over the protests of his National Liberal Party allies. In 1887, Italy and France embarked on a bitter tariff war. In the United States, Benjamin Harrison won the 1888 US presidential election on a protectionist pledge.|$|E

25|$|The Tariff of 1816 {{had some}} {{protective}} features, and it received support throughout the nation, {{including that of}} John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian William Lowndes. The first explicitly <b>protective</b> <b>tariff</b> linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the Tariff of 1824. Sponsored by Henry Clay, this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% ad valorem (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal House of Representatives {{by a vote of}} 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate the bill, with the support of Tennessee Senator Andrew Jackson, passed by four votes, and President James Monroe, the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the White House, signed the bill on March 25, 1824. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts led the New England opposition to this tariff.|$|E

A radical liberal in state politics, his government introduced such progressive measures as: electoral reform including the first law to give votes to women in Australia (and second in the world only to New Zealand), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration Act in Australia, establishment of a state bank, a high <b>protective</b> <b>tariff,</b> regulation of factories, a progressive system of land and income taxation, a public works programme, and more extensive workers’ compensation.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Buckner {{relied on}} party {{strength}} and personal popularity {{to give him}} an advantage over Bradley, a decidedly superior orator. In the only debate between the two, held at Grayson, Bradley attacked Democrats for creating [...] "useless offices" [...] such as railroad commissioners. He defended the Republican proposal of a high <b>protective</b> <b>tariff</b> and advocated federal aid for education. When Buckner took the platform, he began by asking if Bradley had charged in an earlier speech that one of Buckner's speeches had been written by former governor J. Proctor Knott. Bradley acknowledged that he had heard that Knott had written the speech and that he (Bradley) had repeated this claim in one of his speeches. Buckner rebuked Bradley for circulating this [...] "infamously false" [...] charge, and withdrew his agreement to participate in any further joint debates. He then delivered a discourse attacking the <b>protective</b> <b>tariff</b> and federal aid for education.|$|E
