Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his <b>professional</b> <b>integrity</b> will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E
