It is hypothesized the light-off temperature and corresponding preheat power required for microthrusters using HAN-based monopropellants decrease with decreasing droplet size.

A preheated electric furnace moves towards and encompasses the droplet locality, producing a sudden rise in ambient temperature, and thus initiating the ignition process. The entire apparatus is enclosed in a pressure vessel and is remotely operated. Data were collected for pressures up to 18 atm absolute and in a temperature range of 773 K to 973 K. Fuels tested comprised n-paraffins (decane, dodecane, and hexadecane), aromatics (mesitylene, o-xylene, and isobutylbenzene) and a cycloparaffin (decalin), as well as selected binary combinations: n-decane/n-dodecane, n-dodecane/n-hexadecane, n-decane/decalin, n-decane/isobutylbenzene, n-decane/mesitylene, and n-decane/o-xylene. Paraffin measurements at low pressures and high temperature revealed a monotonic decrease in ignition times with increasing pressure. However, higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ignitions</b> at lower temperatures showed more complex behaviour by the measurement of two or "twinned" ignition times for the same pressure and temperature condition, indicating a change in reaction mechanism, possibly from one-stage to two-stage ignition. Aromatic fuels did not show "twinned" ignition time behaviour and responded with a slight increase in ignition times with increasing pressure, owing to a weaker reaction rate dependence on pressure.

In the present work, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of eucalyptus biodiesel and natural gas under dual fuel combustion mode on the performance and the exhaust emissions of a single cylinder DI diesel engine. The natural gas (NG) is inducted with the intake air through the inlet manifold. The liquid pilot fuel (eucalyptus biodiesel or diesel fuel) is injected into the combustion chamber to cover approximately 10 % of the maximum power output. Then, keeping constant the pilot fuel flow rate, the power output is further increased using only natural gas. The combustion characteristics (cylinder <b>pressure,</b> <b>ignition</b> delay and heat release rate), performance and exhaust emissions of the dual fuel mode (NG-diesel fuel and NG-biodiesel) are {{compared with those of}} conventional diesel engine mode at various load conditions. The combustion analysis has shown that biodiesel as pilot fuel exhibits similar pressure-time history, with highest peak, as diesel fuel in conventional and dual fuel modes. The performance and pollutant emission results show that, compared to diesel fuel in dual fuel mode, the use of eucalyptus biodiesel as pilot fuel reduces the high emission levels of unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) particularly at high engine loads. However this is accompanied by an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which {{can be explained by the}} lower calorific value and the oxygen presence in the molecule of the eucalyptus biodiesel, respectively.

A new stochastic approach is introduced to model the convective heat transfer, which accounts for fluctuations and fluid-wall interaction effects. This model is included in a partially stirred plug flow reactor (PaSPFR) approach, a stochastic reactor model (SRM), and is applied to study the effect of EGR on pressure, autoignition timing {{and emissions}} of CO and unburned hydrocarbons (HCs). The model accounts for temperature inhomogeneities and includes a detailed chemical mechanism to simulate the chemical reactions within the combustion chamber. Turbulent mixing is described by the interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) model. A Monte Carlo method with a second-order time-splitting technique is employed to obtain the numerical solution.

The analyses of experimental {{results indicate that the}} pressure of the in-cylinder gases rise early in case of B 100, BD 80 E 20 and BD 80 AC 20.

40|$|The {{ignition}} thresholds of TiHx/KC 104, Mg/Teflon, and an A 1 -torch mix {{are measured}} {{as a function}} of gas pressure for ignition by 514. 5 nm pulses from an argon ion laser. The TiHx/KC 104 system in argon gas has three distinct pressure regimes. The thresholds are very high below about 0. 3 MPa, decrease rapidly between 0. 3 and 1. 5 MPa, and decrease gradually and become constant between 1. 5 and 7 MPa. Mg/Teflon and the A 1 -torch mix also have decreasing thresholds with increasing gas pressures and decreasing pellet densities. Ignition pulse lengths between 0. 25 and 20 milliseconds at a spot diameter of 65 microns in the TiHx/KC 104 system indicate that the thresholds are predominantly power, not energy, thresholds for pulses longer than one millisecond. The increase in threshold power below one millisecond is consistent with a calculated time to reach thermal equilibrium of 0. 96 milliseconds. The effect of beam diameters between 40 and 175 microns on the TiHx/KC 104 thresholds is consistent with ignitions occurring at approximately the same temperature {{at the center of the}} beam. TiHx/KC 104 and Zr/KC 104 /Viton/Graphite pyrotechnics are also ignitied in sealed devices through sapphire windows.

40|$|AbstractFor {{international}} trade and production of machinery used in potentially explosive atmospheres {{it is important to}} know about the regulations within the European Union. This paper presents an application of CHEMSAFE flammability data for fulfilling the requirements of the EU explosion protection directives. Most of the published data for flammability of substances are measured under atmospheric conditions although chemical processes operate often under non-atmospheric conditions. A couple of R&D projects were initiated in Germany to get more knowledge on explosion characteristics for non-atmospheric conditions. The explosion protection for machinery operated under non-atmospheric conditions is defined in the 2006 / 42 /EU Directive. CHEMSAFE fulfills this requirement while it contains data of flammable compounds measured under non-atmospheric conditions and with other oxidizers than air. Furthermore it includes flammability data for gas mixtures consisting of flammable, inert, and different oxidizing components and most of the data are measured according to international standards. Safety data on flammable dusts - such as minimum ignition energy, maximum explosion <b>pressure,</b> <b>ignition</b> temperatures - represents also an important part of the database. The potentially explosive atmospheres are defined in revised Directive 2014 / 34 /EU. For preparing risk assessment documents the following data for flammable gases and vapors, relating to the use of equipment, among others are necessary: Flammability limit, flash point, temperature class - auto-ignition temperature, maximum experimental safe gap. CHEMSAFE’ 2013 includes not only these data but also more than 200 triangular explosion diagrams, e. g. the newly measured methane/nitrogen/oxygen system under pressures up to 50 bars.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we report {{experimental}} {{results for the}} behaviour of a LaMnO 3 -based honeycomb in the catalytic combustion of methane, in particular during the start-up and shut-down operations at different <b>pressures.</b> Methane <b>ignition</b> is mainly driven by heterogeneous reactions. The temperature increase due to the heat developed on the catalyst surface is responsible for ignition of homogeneous reactions, allowing the complete fuel consumption. On the other hand, during quenching, the homogeneous reaction front moves towards the exit of the catalytic reactor; a rapid drop in the mean reactor temperature and methane conversion is detected. According to our results, quenching appears {{to be related to}} the decrease in the heat generated by homogeneous reactions. Copyright �� 2013, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{sensitivity}} of the propellant has significant influence on the interior ballistic performance of guns. Many physical and chemical approaches are employed to decrease this temperature {{sensitivity of}} the propellant. In this article, it is proposed that the temperature {{sensitivity of the}} propellant is changed by altering the factors required to ignition. A one-dimensional two-phase flow interior ballistic model is established to analyze the relation between ignition factors and temperature sensitivity. The simulation {{results show that the}} propellant temperature sensitivity is changed by altering the ignition factors. That is, the interior ballistic performance is affected by altering the size of fire hole, breaking liner <b>pressure,</b> and <b>ignition</b> location. Based on the simulation results, the temperature sensitivity can be controlled by matching of charges and intelligent control ignition system...|$|R
