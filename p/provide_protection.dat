5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> to this central station.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting File System (EFS) {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with BitLocker to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> once the operating system is running. Protection of the files from processes and users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as EFS. BitLocker and EFS, therefore, offer protection against different classes of attacks.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to <b>provide</b> <b>protection,</b> honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Higher (av. 9m) and thicker (av. 3m) walls. Walls {{were made}} of stone or stone facing with rubble core. The greater {{thickness}} would protect the wall from enemy mining. The height of the walls would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the rampart would have crenellations to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5|$|In the battle, Japanese naval {{land-based}} torpedo bombers, {{seeking to}} <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, made several attacks {{over two days}} on US warships operating as a task force south of this island. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal {{with the objective of}} engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an Allied transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there.|$|E

50|$|Pedways (and {{pedestrian}} tunnels) {{have been}} more successfully implemented {{in other parts of}} the world especially where fully enclosed connections allow year-round use even during inclement weather. They are sometimes called skyways. Examples include Hong Kong, <b>providing</b> <b>protection</b> from heat and humidity and Toronto, Calgary and Minneapolis, <b>providing</b> <b>protection</b> from cold.|$|R
5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, {{would be}} able to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> over a wider area, {{reducing}} the number of bases needed to provide full-country defense. Work on this concept continued throughout the 1960s, eventually becoming the primary weapon in the following Sentinel system, and in the modified Sentinel system that was later renamed Safeguard.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E

5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E
5|$|Finschhafen {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Imperial Japanese Army on 10 March 1942 as part of strategic moves to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> to Lae, which they had established as an important air base. Throughout early 1943, the Allies had begun offensive operations in the Salamaua area of New Guinea and following the landing at Nadzab and capture of Lae in early September 1943, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance to Finschhafen to begin the Huon Peninsula campaign.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E

5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Remote afterloading systems <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> from {{radiation}} exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.|$|E

5|$|The Stoßtrupp was {{abolished}} {{after the}} failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, {{an attempt by}} the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (Protection Command). It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (Storm Squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch). The new SS was to <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{gained control}} {{over most of}} Dalmatia by 1428, with {{exception}} of the city-state of Dubrovnik which became independent. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Mohács, and in 1527, the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia, {{under the condition that}} he <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Zrinski families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would <b>provide</b> <b>protection</b> over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles.|$|E
