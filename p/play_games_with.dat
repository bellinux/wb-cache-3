25|$|Kanade is {{the younger}} sister of Tomoki's male friend. A first-year at school, she is {{extremely}} timid and cries often, {{which may be}} the main reason she is teased. One of her hobbies is drawing memories from her past. Whilst Kanade already has a brother, she likes to think of the protagonist as a brother, as he would often <b>play</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> her when she was a young child.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the death of his grandfather, Nilsen became more quiet and reserved, often standing alone at the harbour watching the herring boats, on which his grandfather had fished, sail by. At home, he seldom participated in family activities and would actively repel any attempts by adult family members to demonstrate any affection towards him. Nilsen also grew to resent what he saw as the unfair amount of attention his mother, grandmother and later, stepfather would show towards his older brother and, to a lesser degree, his younger sister. In spite of Nilsen's increasing bitterness towards his brother, he envied Olav's popularity. Nonetheless, when not opting to partake in solo activities, he would often talk to or <b>play</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> his younger sister, Sylvia, with whom he was closer than any other family member.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{telephone}} line network which the Meganet ran on {{has been criticized}} for its logistical issues in online gaming.

500|$|When {{they had}} {{finished}} programming and connecting the arcade, {{they realized that}} it was more fun to walk around in the arcade than to actually play the games. They ended up creating more and more rooms in the arcade, with characters to <b>play</b> <b>games</b> <b>with,</b> but as the arcade area and its surroundings grew, they eventually decided to remove the arcade games. Instead, they added new elements, including [...] "shady characters", animals and items; the elements that remained from the arcade were the slot machine and the character Thorvald. Due to frequent discussions at the Thorvalds stugråd message board asking whether various aspects of the game were intended or not, the developers added an animal character that yells [...] "Help, I don't know if I'm a bug or a feature!" [...] before running into the water and disappearing.|$|E

2500|$|Fo {{returned}} to Milan's Teatro Odeon with the play Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man), considered [...] "an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image" [...] of Christopher Columbus. Fo said: [...] "I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats {{on a piece}} of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, <b>play</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch." [...] Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by fascist groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare. He recounted this event in the prologue of Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas.|$|E
2500|$|For {{two years}} Emma {{organised}} a winter reading {{room in the}} local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and <b>play</b> <b>games,</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum." [...] This was a common facility to save men from [...] "resorting to the public house". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as [...] "Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games" [...] had been allowed and [...] "the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting" [...] were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get {{the approval of the}} education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and their neighbours the Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed [...] "to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was [...] "quite out of order" [...] for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. Darwin's health suffered as he argued over natural selection with St. George Jackson Mivart, and in the autumn of 1874 Darwin expressed his exasperation at Ffinden when putting in his resignation from the school committee due to ill health.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not <b>play</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a warm color palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't {{the only thing you can}} do with 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, along with the rest of the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E
