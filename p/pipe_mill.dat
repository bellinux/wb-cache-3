40|$|Abstract: Tubular {{products}} in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> {{are produced by}} different methods in wide range of sizes and materials for various applications. From simple ERW steel tubes to high quality and expensive seamless tubes, depending on the application, different NDT techniques are used extensively. All these tests are implemented to fulfil the required specification or standard {{as well as for}} condition monitoring of the production lines. While on-line test has the advantage of real time inspection by less investment, off-line test is final inspection and more reliable. Selecting a suitable NDT method is possible by optimizing between the costs and reliability in parallel with requirements of the international standards. Today different standards like API, ASTM, ANSI/AWWA, DIN, BS, SEP are used extensively in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> but all these standards give options to select test technique and test palce. In many <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> NDT is not used as they beleive it is an expensive test that reduces the production speed. While, by implementing proper NDT method in proper stage it is neither expensive nor reduces the production speed. In this paper the applicable NDT methods are evaluated according to the international standards for various tubes on the base of longterm experience in Iranian <b>pipe</b> <b>mills.</b> Introduction: Metalic <b>pipes</b> and tubes are classified in different cataegories depending on the material, size, production technique and applications.

50|$|With {{the growth}} of the steel mills, Ambridge became a {{worldwide}} leader in steel production. The borough became known for bridge building, metal molding, and the manufacture of tubes (large iron pipes). During World War II, the American Bridge Company fabricated steel for the building of LSTs (Landing Ship Tanks). The steel was then sent by rail to the adjacent American Bridge naval shipyard in Leetsdale, PA where the LSTs were built. The area was also home to several other steel mills like Armco, the <b>pipe</b> <b>mill</b> which manufactured oil piping, and A.M. Byers, a major iron and tool fabricator. Eventually competition by foreign steel producers began to cause the share of the steel market for U.S. manufacturers to dwindle. With the shift of steel production overseas, the American Bridge Company ended operations in Ambridge in 1983. The legacy of American Bridge can be seen today in bridges around the world.|$|E

40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance welded) pipes and LSAW (submerged-arc welded pipes with longitudinal seam) pipes by SSAW (submerged-arc welded pipes with spiral seam) pipes, the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types. Each testing system is optimized for the specific application and its properties have to be discussed by the system manufacturer, the system user and the final customer of the pipe. The presentation for the WCNDT in Shanghai focuses on three ultrasonic testing systems which were shipped to BAOSTEEL in 2007 and which are currently under installation.

40|$|The {{production}} of large diameter pipe by the helical welding process requires that consecutive coils be welded together {{to facilitate the}} advance of each subsequent coil through the forming section of the <b>pipe</b> <b>mill.</b> Traditionally, the skelp ends have been joined by a single-pass submerged arc weld simply designed to join the skelp ends together and provide sufficient strength and ductility to survive the pipe forming operation. Subsequent to pipe forming, the length of pipe containing the skelp end weld (SEW) has been cut off and discarded. This process results in both a substantial yield loss as well as additional processing costs as the shortened pipes are later double jointed to produce full size lengths. To overcome these inefficiencies, a process has been developed for making high quality skelp end welds which meet API and CSA requirements. In this paper, the welding process will be described and evaluation of {{the integrity of the}} skelp end weld is discussed. Of particular interest are the properties of both the weld and associated heat affected zone {{in the vicinity of the}} “T ” where the skelp end weld merges with the helical weld. This paper demonstrates that skelp end welds meeting rigorous integrity specifications can be successfully produced. Incorporation of suitable skelp end welding and inspection procedures in the pipe production process significantly enhances the efficiency of helical pipe production...|$|E
