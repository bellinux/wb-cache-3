However, a precise quantification of the benefit obtained in terms of spatial reuse is still an open issue. In this paper, a mathematical analysis is carried out in order to derive the spatial reuse efficiency of a multihop wireless network. It is demonstrated through both approximate and exact analysis, that for an unbounded network, the reuse efficiency of the wireless system increases with the number of multiple hops, M, and the spatial <b>protection</b> <b>margin,</b> ∆, defined around the receiver. Significantly, it has been found that even in case of an infinitely large spatial <b>protection</b> <b>margin,</b> the obtained reuse efficiency is a finite value and is limited by the number of multiple hops in the communicating link.

By comparing the performance improvement offered by frequency hopping with intra-timeslot handover, new design thresholds and capacity gain figures are derived for GSM networks.

Hybrid geo-location technologies have emerged to extend GPS coverage [46, 47] (e.g., for indoor applications). Therefore, providing geo-location information {{is not a major}} challenge for a WSD.

Another issue is the propagation model to be considered to determine white space areas.

40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems, a conventional call admission control (CAC) mechanism determines whether a node can {{be admitted to}} the network by firstly monitoring the received interference plus noise and estimate the achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). However, {{in the presence of}} power control, the SINR may vary over time, thus, rendering the conventional CAC inaccurate. The maximum achievable SINR for a new node in a general wireless system depends on the link gains amongst all the co-channel interfering nodes involved. Thus, one of the challenges of CAC in a power-controlled wireless system is the estimation of maximum achievable SINR when information about global link gains is not available. By ignoring the white noise factor, we present a predictor for the maximum achievable signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of a new node trying {{to gain access to the}} medium. Using the SIR predictor we then calculate an optimal active link <b>protection</b> <b>margin,</b> which together with a SIR threshold would constitute an enhanced threshold value for the new node to attain. By doing so current active communication links would be protected from performance degradation should the maximum achievable SIR value common to all the nodes be lower than the SIR threshold. The accuracy of the predictor is evaluated by means of simulation in terms of mean error and root-mean-square error. Together with finding the corresponding optimal active link <b>protection</b> <b>margin,</b> efficient CAC mechanism to ensure stability of the feasible system can be maintained over a wide range of operating SIR values...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, two PBS {{switching}} off algorithms {{have been proposed}} to dynamically reconfigure PBSs’ working mode for energy saving in Hetnets. With our algorithms, network energy consumption can be significantly reduced. The simulation {{results show that the}} number of active PBSs tracks the variation of traffic well while ensuring an acceptable blocking probability. Particularly, the PDSO algorithm can lead to a better effect of energy saving and slightly deteriorates the blocking probability. What is important is that the complexity of the PDSO algorithm is much lower than that of the HDSO algorithm, enabling the network respond to the traffic variation more promptly, which is demonstrated by the simulations that the execution time of the PDSO algorithm is at most one third of the HDSO algorithm. Additionally, simulations imply that the antenna downtilt of the MBS, the bandwidth <b>protection</b> <b>margin</b> of MBS and PBS, and the time interval T all have nonnegligible influence on the performance of our algorithms. As the downtilt increases, more PBSs remain active to guarantee the QoS of the network, which accelerates the execution of the algorithms to some degree. In terms of the bandwidth <b>protection</b> <b>margin,</b> the performance of the PDSO algorithm is more sensitive to the margin of MBS, and the performance of the HDSO algorithm is more sensitive to the margin of PBS, compared to the other two cases. The number of active PBSs of the algorithms increases with the two margins due to less available capacity to accept the transferred PUEs. The blocking probability increases with the time interval more significantly during low traffic times, indicating that the active PBSs set should change frequently in these times. The unobvious difference during peak traffic times indicates that sufficient resource for UEs benefiting from the densification of active PBSs provides more time for some PBSs to be switched off. Hence there exist tradeoffs that can be made to achieve a preferable system performance and energy saving.|$|E

40|$|Future {{generations of}} {{cellular}} networks envision unprecedented growth in capacity requirements essential {{to handle the}} tremendous evolution of multimedia services. Code division multiple access (CDMA) {{has been one of}} the premium candidates to lead the charge in supporting packetized multimedia traffic within mobile cellular networks. This dissertation presents an analytical framework to derive system capacity of CDMA-based cellular networks on the basis of the satisfied-user criteria recommended by universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS). The proposed criteria stretch beyond system-level outage probability that has been commonly adopted in the CDMA literature and proceed to focus on evaluating the percentage of outage during the lifetime of each individual session. Special emphasis is devoted for the downlink as it is considered to be the limiting direction in future cellular systems. The foundation of the proposed analysis is established by recognizing one of the main features of wireless communication channels. Large-scale path-loss depicts measurable/controllable parameters that exhibit high correlations over the scale of consecutive frames. On the other hand, small-scale fading represents fast fluctuations that cannot be reliably predicted. Accordingly, the devised analysis relates the satisfied-user probability to the correlated outage behavior of small-scale fading channels with respect to an effective <b>protection</b> <b>margin</b> set over the large scale. The analytical platform is expanded for capacity evaluation of multi-carrier CDMA (MCCDMA). Multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) has recently emerged as an extremely promising technology to support higher system capacities for its combined advantages of multi-carrier modulation techniques and CDMA in a frequency-selective fading environment. The analytical approach leads to the proposal of power allocation and channel assignment strategies that share the objective of diminishing the effects of multiple access interference (MAI) and increasing system capacity. In particular, an effective margin-based power control operating over the large-scale is introduced for speech services. The base stations target an effective <b>protection</b> <b>margin</b> and avoid allocating un-necessary power to compensate for intra-cell interference that shares the same small-scale fading paths as the target signal. Moreover, a channel assignment strategy based on large-scale interference measurements is used to investigate the migration from MC-CDMA to Grouped MC-CDMA systems. Capacity analysis of Grouped MC-CDMA systems triggers the development of an iterative simulation platform to incorporate the effects of coupling and dependencies of channel assignments and power allocations across base stations of the cellular network...|$|E

40|$|Many {{economists and}} policy analysts have {{conducted}} studies on crop insurance. Three research gaps are identified: i) moral hazard in prevented planting (PP), ii) choice of PP and planting a second crop, and iii) selecting <b>margin</b> <b>protection</b> in the Dairy <b>Margin</b> <b>Protection</b> Program (MPP-Dairy). The first essay analyzes {{the existence of}} moral hazard in PP. The PP provision {{is defined as the}} “failure to plant an insured crop by the final planting date due to adverse events”. If the farmer decides not to plant a crop, the farmer receives a PP indemnity. Late planting (LP) is an option for the farmer to plant a crop while maintaining crop insurance after the final planting date. Crop insurance may alter farmers’ behavior in selecting PP or LP and could increase the likelihood of PP claims even though farmers can choose LP. This study finds evidence that a farmer with higher insurance coverage tends to choose PP more often (moral hazard). Spatial panel models attest to the existence of moral hazard in PP empirically. If a farmer chooses PP, s/he receives the PP indemnity and may either leave the acreage unplanted or plant a second crop, e. g., soybean for corn. If the farmer plants a second crop after the PP claim, the farmer receives a 35 % of PP payment. The current PP provision fails to provide farmers with an incentive to plant a second crop; 99. 9 % of PP claiming farmers do not plant a second crop. Adjusting PP indemnity payment may encourage farmers to plant a second crop. The second essay explores this question using a stochastic simulation and suggests to increase the PP payment by 10 %- 15 %. The third essay investigates why Wisconsin dairy farmers purchase more supplementary protection than California farmers in a MPP-Dairy introduced in the 2014 Farm Bill. MPP-Dairy provides dairy producers with <b>margin</b> <b>protection</b> when the national dairy margin is below a farmer selected threshold.

The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} {{the way in which}} the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) uses the margin of discretion-technique to adjudicate cases involving fundamental rights, and importantly, what this use entails. This thesis will answer these questions by presenting the argument that the margin of discretion-technique opens up discretional spaces in specific instances of adjudication that enable participation of actors from both legal loci, along with their respective readings of legal sources. This creates an adjudicative process that blurs the boundaries between what is a EUropean and what is a nationally defined standard of fundamental rights <b>protection.</b> The <b>margin</b> of discretion-technique therefore promotes euro-national interconnectedness in the formulation of the applicable standard of fundamental rights protection in a given case, rather than separating subject matters and legal conflicts along jurisdictional lines. The presentation of this thesis proceeds as follows. Firstly, the origins of techniques of coordination of overlapping jurisdictions that share commitment to norms, such as margins of discretion, will be investigated and thereafter understood in the context of the European Union. Secondly, three dominant narratives pertaining to discourse on the CJEU's adjudication of fundamental rights will be reconstructed and their reliance on euro-national binary logics will be highlighted. These narratives then serve as points of contrast in what is the main body of the thesis, namely a presentation of three typologies of the CJEU's margins of discretion-use in its case law involving fundamental rights. In contrast to the dominant narratives, these typologies will illustrate the intricate sharing of interpretative authority that the margins of discretion represent, which creates the precondition for an interconnected elaboration of the standard of fundamental rights protection. Lastly, the legal pattern of interconnectedness will be picked apart and understood as a feature of the CJEU's adjudication of fundamental rights...|$|R

The restoration procedures include a 2. 3 ha constructed wetland established in February 2006 and riparian <b>margin</b> <b>protection</b> to reduce external loading, {{as well as an}} Alum application in December 2003 and sediment capping using modified zeolite in September 2008 to reduce internal loading.

Two predictive models based on external P loading data generally underestimated the measured TP concentrations in the water column due to internal P loading. The relatively rapid response of TP concentrations after reduction of the internal loading using modified zeolite suggests that this technique can effect a rapid decrease in lake water TP concentrations though the trophic state of Lake Okaro showed high resilience to the reduced P loading. It is concluded that the combined effect of all restoration procedures resulted in a relatively rapid decrease in TP concentrations in Lake Okaro, which may be prolonged by continued external load reduction...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{firms in}} {{developing}} countries have traditionally been relatively protected. They have also been subject to heavy regulation, much of it biased in favor of large enterprises. Accordingly, it is often argued that manufacturers in these countries perform poorly in several respects: a) markets tolerate inefficient firms, so cross-firm productivity dispersion is high; b) small groups of entrenched oligopolists exploit monopoly power in product markets; and c) many small firms are {{unable or unwilling to}} grow, so important economies of scale go unexploited. The author assesses each of these conjectures, drawing on plant- and firm-level studies of manufacturers {{in developing countries}}. He finds systematic support for none of them. Turnover is substantial, exploited scale economies are modest, and convincing demonstrations of monopoly rents are generally lacking. Overprotection and overregulation are probably less a problem in developing countries then are uncertainty about policies and demand, poor rule of law, and corruption. The author does find some evidence that <b>protection</b> increases firms'price-cost <b>margins</b> and reduces average efficiency levels at the margin. And although the econometric evidence on technology diffusion in developing countries is limited, it does suggest that protecting"learning"industries is unlikely to foster productivity growth. All of which suggests that the general trend toward trade liberalization has yielded greater benefits than the traditional gains from trade.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{the extent to which}} {{developing}} countries receive preferential treatment from the EU, Conforti, Ford, Hallam, Rapsomanikis and Salvatici use a mercantilist trade restrictiveness index (MTRI). They demonstrate that although Least Developed Countries (LDCs) face a relatively low level of protection across all sectors, even before the implementation of the EU’s Everything but Arms (EBA) initiative, many developing countries are highly constrained in their trade with the EU. These developing countries include some of the more competitive developing countries such as Brazil and Argentina, but also the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) non-LDC group. In agricultural trade, LDCs {{do not appear to be}} provided a high degree of preference by the EU, as they seem to face higher MTRI indices than other more developed countries such as Chile and Canada. Taking the issue of ACP non - LDC countries further, the paper investigates in more detail trade in sugar, a product where these countries face high <b>protection</b> at the <b>margin.</b> By using a global partial equilibrium model for the sugar market and a gravity model to replicate LDCs bilateral trade with the EU, to simulate EU sugar market reform proposals, they suggest that trade will be diverted from countries currently enjoying preferential access, particularly higher cost ACP countries exporting within the sugar protocol, and will be displaced by more efficient LDC producers...|$|R
40|$|As trade {{negotiations}} increasingly rely on quantitative assessments, tariff information becomes necessary in shedding light on applied protection at a detailed level. The purpose of such {{information is not}} only to provide a measure of border protection, but also {{to pave the way for}} well-suited economic analysis of the consequences of trade liberalization, in particular through CGE models. The MAcMapHS 6 project has been developed to answer these needs. A joint effort of the International Trade Center (ITC), a cooperation agency of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Geneva), Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales (CEPII, Paris) and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), led to the development of the first version of a Market Access Maps database (MAcMapHS 6 -v 1) (Bouët et al, 2008), the purpose of which was mainly to provide protection figures for the 6 th release of the GTAP database (Bouët et al, 2005). The first version of MAcMapHS 6 represents an unprecedented effort to monitor worldwide border protection at the most detailed level, while accounting exhaustively for preferential trade agreements. This effort has been pursued with the development of an updated version of this database (MAcMapHS 6 -v 2) relying on 2004 data. Methodology and data quality have been improved. The new database provides evidence on the world applied protection in 2004. MAcMapHS 6 -v 2 is also the source of protection data for both the GTAP 7 database and the TASTE software. Its main contributions are: (i) an exhaustive coverage of preferential trade arrangements across the world; (ii) the calculation of the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) for specific duties, acknowledging the differentiated impact of such duties across exporters, depending on their export unit values; (iii) the incorporation of tariff-rate quotas both through the AVE of the resulting <b>protection</b> at the <b>margin,</b> and through the calculation of involved rents; (iv) an original aggregation methodology, using a weighting scheme based on reference groups of countries, and limiting the extent of the endogeneity bias inherent to the standard, import-weighted average protection.
