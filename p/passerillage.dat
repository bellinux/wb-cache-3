25|$|Among {{the many}} types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and tangy, it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, <b>passerillage</b> (straining), or the use of Noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
2500|$|Along the Layon {{river is}} the commune of Rochefort-sur-Loire which {{contains}} {{the village of}} Chaume with a long making tradition that finally received AOC designation in the early 21st century. In 2003 the INAO granted the request for the sweet wines from this region to be called Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du Layon AOC. Made entirely from Chenin blanc, these wines are most often the product of <b>passerillage</b> or [...] "raisining" [...] on the vine than of infection by noble rot. Yields were restricted {{to no more than}} 25 hectoliters per hectares as grapes were harvested with a minimum of 238grams per liter with at least 34grams of residual sugar in the finished wine. The producers in the Quarts-de-Chaume AOC, located on the plateau southwest of Chaume, took exception to the new AOC particularly the inclusion of the term 1er Cru (or Premier cru) which has a quality association with the wines of Burgundy. The producers of the Quarts-de-Chaume AOC felt that consumers would equate Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du Layon as being of a higher quality than their own wines and such their own AOC designation was being devalued. In response to these concerns, the INAO renamed the AOC in 2006 to the shorter Chaume AOC. Quarts-de-Chaume AOC producers still felt that the close associate between their AOC and Chaume was causing damage to the value of their wines and continued to object to the AOC naming. In response the INAO disbanded the Chaume AOC entirely in 2009. Now wine produced in this region must fall under the larger Coteaux du Layon AOC designation.|$|E

5000|$|Vendange tardive ("VT") means [...] "late harvest" [...] in French. The phrase {{refers to}} a style of dessert wine where the grapes are allowed to hang on the vine until they start to dehydrate. This process, called <b>passerillage,</b> {{concentrates}} the sugars in the juice and changes the flavours within it. The name is sometimes written as the plural form, vendanges tardives, referring {{to the fact that}} several runs through the vineyard is often necessary to produce such wines.In others countries such as Germany or Austria the term Spätlese is used to describe wine using the same making process.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dried grape}} wine {{known as the}} Cypriot Manna was {{described}} in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod. Similar principles were {{used to make the}} medieval Cypriot wine Commandaria, which is still produced today. Various Mediterranean raisin wines were described in the first century AD by Columella and Pliny the Elder. Pliny uses the Greek term for honey wine for the following raisin wine, [...] "The grapes are left on the vine to dry in the sun...It is made by drying grapes in the sun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed place upon hurdles, some seven feet from the ground, care being taken to protect them at night from the dews: on the eighth day they are trodden out: this method, it is said, produces a liquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known as melitites {{is also one of the}} sweet wines." [...] Columella discusses the Passum wine made in ancient Carthage. The modern Italian name for this wine, passito, echoes this ancient word, as does the French word used to describe the process of producing straw wines, <b>passerillage.</b> Perhaps the closest thing to passum is Moscato Passito di Pantelleria from Zibibbo, a variety of the ancient muscat grape, produced on Pantelleria, an island in the Strait of Sicily (50 miles from Tunisia) opposite to where Carthage used to be.|$|E
