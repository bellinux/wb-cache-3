5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} <b>population</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> {{agriculture}} and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
25|$|Nowhere {{were the}} wartime effects {{greater than in}} Houston, which in 1940 was a city of 400,000 <b>population</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> {{shipping}} and oil. The war dramatically expanded the city's economic base, thanks to massive federal spending. Energetic entrepreneurs, most notably George Brown, James Elkins and James Abercrombie, landed {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in federal wartime investment in technologically complex facilities. Houston oil companies moved from being refiners and became sophisticated producers of petrochemicals. Especially important were synthetic rubber and high octane fuel, which retained their importance after the war. The war moved the natural gas industry from a minor factor to a major energy source; Houston became a major hub when a local firm purchased the federally-financed Inch pipelines.

Tens of thousands of new migrants streamed in from rural areas, straining the city's housing supply and the city's ability to provide local transit and schools. For the first time high paying jobs went to large numbers of women, blacks and Mexican Americans. The city's African American community, emboldened by their newfound prosperity, became a hotbed of civil rights agitation; the Smith v. Allwright Supreme Court decision on voting rights was backed and funded by local blacks in this period.|$|E

A scoping review of research on human health risk assessments (HHRA) applied to this vulnerable population {{may be used to}} improve assessments applied by government and researchers. This review aims to summarize and describe the characteristics of HHRA methods, publications, and current literature gaps of HHRA studies <b>on</b> rural <b>populations</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> unregulated or unspecified {{drinking water}}. Peer-reviewed literature was systematically searched (January 2000 to May 2014) and identified at least one drinking water source as unregulated (21 %) or unspecified (79 %) in 100 studies. Only 7 % of reviewed studies identified a rural community <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> unregulated drinking water. Source water and hazards most frequently cited included groundwater (67 %) and chemical water hazards (82 %). Most HHRAs (86 %) applied deterministic methods with 14 % reporting probabilistic and stochastic methods.

50|$|The {{forestry}} industry's {{control of}} land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy.

British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land. Nevertheless, landownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. Rather than the former slaves, it was the Garifuna, Maya, and Mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century British Honduras. These groups either rented land or lived as squatters.

It requires that nations be mindful of the environmental factors that affect water resources and preserve them appropriately, such as by preventing water pollution and preserving native ecosystems, even if they are occupying foreign territory during a time of war.
