40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of {{creation}} and development of the energy statistics of the Russian Empire of the initial stage of electrification and the formation of the energy economy, which is related to: 1) the economic upsurge of the 1890 s; 2) the new economic recovery of 1907 – 1913 and 3) the militarization of industry in 1914 – 1916. The real technical and economic indicators and complex statistical data of the pre-revolutionary electric power industry were either hushed up or deliberately distorted during the Soviet era. Even in the encyclopaedic literature it was considered that pre-revolutionaryRussia“was on one of the last places in the world” for the production of electricity. The author analyzes statistical surveys (censuses) of the manufacturing industry for 1900 and 1908 (the “varzar censuses”), which gave the first material on the state of its energy sector, namely: the composition, quantity and power of primary engines and electric motors. For the first time in historiography, the data of the “energy censuses” of the Ministry of Finance for 1905 and 1913 on the number and capacity of central <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and private power stations (block stations) of industrial enterprises, organizations and institutions are cited. The data of the census were conducted with the participation of the apparatus of factory and factory inspections in 1906 and in 1916 inall provinces of the Russian Empire, with the exception of six provinces of the frontline zone. A lot of work was done to record electricity production / consumption, which was conducted by the Russian electrotechnical community. According to incomplete data published in 1917 by the Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the VII All-Russia Electrotechnical Congress, from 1905 to 1913 (that is, for 8 years) the total number of power stations in the Russian Empire increased by 1. 7 times, and the amount of electricity produced by them Has grown in 3, 8 times. The last objective study {{of the state of the}} pre-revolutionary electric power industry in 1920 was carried out by the developers of the GOELRO plan from the 6 th (Petrograd) group (engineers T. F. Makariev, A. I. Firsov, Y. A. Samoilovich and professor N. N. Georgievsky). With the help of expert assessments, they established that in 1916 all <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and block stations of the census industry produced approximately 4, 730 million kWh of electric power-twice as much as in 1913. Based on the revealed range of historical statistical sources, it is proved that in 1913 – 1916, The Russian Empire in terms of electricity production was one of the top five industrialized countries. The dynamic development of the electric power industry in the Russian Empire was interrupted by the succession of social and political cataclysms that shook the very foundations of Russian statehood. This period, which lasted until the end of 1921, was characterized by a complete degradation of the electric power industry. The fuel hunger, separation from the RSFSR of Baku and the Donbass, paralyzed the work of many power plants, both factory and general use.  </p...|$|E

50|$|In 1882 the world's first {{coal-fired}} <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> the Edison Electric Light Station, {{was built}} in London, a project of Thomas Edison organized by Edward Johnson. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler powered a 125-horsepower steam engine that drove a 27-ton generator. This supplied electricity to premises {{in the area that}} could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road, which was the monopoly of the gas companies. The customers included the City Temple and the Old Bailey. Another important customer was the Telegraph Office of the General Post Office, but this could not be reached though the culverts. Johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead, via Holborn Tavern and Newgate.|$|R

50|$|After {{construction}} of the railway line from Yuzovka in 1882, much of the wheat grown in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate and coal from the Donets Basin were exported via the port of Mariupol (the second largest after Odessa in the South Russian Empire), which served as a key funding source for opening a hospital, <b>public</b> library, electric <b>power</b> <b>station</b> and urban water supply system.|$|R

5000|$|Plas Tan y Bwlch {{is thought}} to be the first house in North Wales with {{electric}} lighting powered from its own hydro-electric station, which was commissioned in the 1890s. A pipeline from the lake fed water to a Pelton wheel, which was located in a small power house on the hillside immediately behind the house. It ceased to operate soon after 1928, when the <b>public</b> hydro-electric <b>power</b> <b>station</b> at Maentwrog began supplying the area. [...] In June 2013 a new hydro-scheme, costing £420,000, and similarly tapping the water from Llyn Mair, was opened. The water falls 60 m to the turbine, and the scheme is expected to meet most of the Plas' electricity needs.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{opposed the}} Government's {{nationalisation}} of the British electricity industry. Representatives {{of the industry}} met with the Minister of Fuel and Power in December 1945 to discuss the implications of nationalisation. A company board meeting in January 1946 noted that “the London Companies should combine to oppose the Government’s nationalization proposals”. [...] As {{a result of the}} Electricity Act 1947 on 1 April 1948 most of the private and municipal electricity undertakings and statutory bodies including the CLELCo and the CEB were dissolved. Ownership of all <b>public</b> supply <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and the national grid was vested in the British Electricity Authority.

50|$|Shapur {{is as old}} as the Muslim-ruled Junagadh state. Before Indian Independence {{the village}} was the main military-base and Janana (Muslim Queens) {{residence}} of Muslim-ruled Junagadh state. The Navabs of Junagadh-State used to visit Shapur almost every day to meet their wives and children residing at Shapur. Later on Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Indira Gandhi visited this villages for various independence/political reasons. Even after the Indian independence Shapur remained important in regional and State politics, business, education and social advancement. Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji visited the first and the only <b>public</b> utility Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in that state, at that time located in Shahpur.

The village-economy was almost destroyed after the flooding of 22 June 1983.

The trains were initially hauled by five Jung steam locomotives, which were replaced by four Nippon Saryo and one Diema diesel locomotives around 1980. An Orenstein & Koppel diesel locomotive (1958) was used as a shunter in the steel construction department of the station.
