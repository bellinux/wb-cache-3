5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} <b>poultice</b> for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E

The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis with the roots of Durio zibethinus, Nephelium longan, Nephelium mutabile and Artocarpus integrifolia, and drink the decoction or use it as a <b>poultice.</b>|$|E

5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a <b>poultice</b> of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or <b>poultice,</b> to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E

25|$|Wool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were {{sometimes}} used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful {{because they thought}} the rubber acted as a <b>poultice</b> and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|E

25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a <b>poultice,</b> and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E

500|$|Cleopatra of late Ptolemaic Egypt used a quarter-cup of saffron in {{her warm}} baths, as she prized its {{colouring}} and cosmetic properties. She used it before encounters with men, trusting that saffron would render lovemaking yet more pleasurable. Egyptian healers used saffron {{as a treatment}} for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments: when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging, an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with aager-tree remnants, ox fat, coriander, and myrrh. This ointment or <b>poultice</b> [...] was applied to the body. The physicians expected it to [...] " [...] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog's blood when it is cooked". Urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil-based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans; this was used topically on men. Women ingested a more complex preparation.|$|E

500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} used as a {{medicinal}} mushroom by many herbalists. It was used as a <b>poultice</b> to treat inflammations of the eye, as well as a palliative for throat problems. The 16th-century herbalist John Gerard, writing in 1597, recommended A.auricula-judae for a very specific use; other fungi were used more generally. He recommends the preparation of a liquid extract by boiling the fruit bodies in milk, or else leaving them steeped in beer, which would then be sipped slowly in order to cure a sore throat. The resultant broth was probably not dissimilar to the Chinese soups that use A.polytricha. Carolus Clusius, writing in 1601, also said that the species could be gargled to cure a sore throat, and John Parkinson, writing in 1640, reported that boiling in milk or steeping in vinegar was [...] "the onely use the are put unto that I know".|$|E

She gained weight {{as a result of}} her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah's words, [...] "she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul". Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, described her in 1706 [...] "under a fit of the gout and in extreme pain and agony, and on this occasion everything about her was much in the same disorder as about the meanest of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was rendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the foot affected was tied up with a <b>poultice</b> and some nasty bandages. I was much affected by this sight...".|$|E
500|$|Honey bee {{products}} are used medicinally in apitherapy across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, {{despite the fact}} that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal. [...] They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is honey. It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns, and as an eye <b>poultice</b> to treat infection. Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat colds, cough, throat infections, laryngitis, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. Apitoxin (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, polyneuritis, and asthma. [...] Propolis, a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by menopausal women because of its high hormone content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Royal jelly is used to treat anaemia, gastrointestinal ulcers, arteriosclerosis, hypo- and hypertension, and inhibition of sexual libido. [...] Finally Bee bread, or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections. One of the major peptides in bee venom, Melittin, has the potential to treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis.|$|E

500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco <b>poultice</b> as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.|$|E
