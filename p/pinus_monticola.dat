40|$|International audiencePrevention is {{the best}} way to slow the {{escalation}} of problems associated with biological invasions. Screening of potential introductions is widely applied for assessing the risk of species becoming invasive. Despite advances in the understanding of the determinants of invasiveness, screening still relies heavily on assessments of the potential of species to 'fit in' to the broad environmental conditions of a target region. Most screening systems ask whether species are native to, or are known to be naturalized or invasive in, regions with 'similar' climatic/environmental conditions to the target region. The level of similarity required to make the species a high-risk introduction is generally not specified. This paper describes a protocol for making such assessments more objective, using South Africa as a test case. Using nonparametric niche-based modelling (generalized additive model; GAM) calibrated on the current distribution of each South African biome, we mapped regions of the world that are climatically similar to South African biomes. Lists were produced of countries with the largest areas climatically similar to South Africa overall, and to each biome separately. Validation of the usefulness of the approach was sought by evaluating whether the main invasive plant species in South African biomes occur naturally, or have adventive ranges, in regions mapped as analogous to South African biomes. A very large part of the world is climatically similar to South Africa, with eight countries having larger areas of land classified as climatically similar to South African biomes than the total area of South Africa. Almost all the most prominent invasive species in South African biomes occur naturally or are invasive outside their natural range in areas with similar climates to those that occur in parts of South Africa. This confirms the value of objective climate matching in screening protocols. We examined climatic conditions for a representative sample of major invasive plants from other parts of the world. The analysis identified several species that are already invasive in regions that have matched climates in South Africa but that are not yet introduced or, if already present, have not yet invaded large areas. For example, the following known invasive species should be considered high-risk species in South African grasslands: Alliaria petiolata, Cytisus scoparius, Gleditsia triacanthos, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Hieracium pilosella, Juniperus communis, <b>Pinus</b> contorta, P. <b>monticola,</b> P. ponderosa, P. sylvestris, Prunus laurcerasus, and P. serotina. Objectively matched climatic regions are also useful as a first-cut assessment when evaluating species with no invasive history...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} nutrient uptake {{efficiency and}} subsequent leaching fractions for western white pine (<b>Pinus</b> <b>monticola</b> Dougl. ex D. Don) seedlings grown with exponentially increasing or conventional (constant) fertilization in a greenhouse. Conventional fertilization {{was associated with}} higher leachate electrical conductivity and greater nutrient losses, which were more pronounced for the more mobile NO 3 -N than for NH 4 -N. Exponential fertilization increased seedling nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency (75 %), which helped reduce leaching losses compared to conventional fertilization (50 %). Although exponentially fertilized plants received 45 % less fertilizer (20 mg N·plant – 1) during the establishment and accelerated growth phases compared with conventional cohorts (36 mg N·plant – 1), seedling morphological characteristics and nutrient status were similar {{at the end of}} greenhouse culture and after 2 years of growth in the field, except that exponential fertilization increased root volume after the first year and also increased ectomycorrhizal colonization. Reduction of applied fertilizer quantities and enhanced fertilizer uptake efficiency through exponential fertilization allows for production of high-quality seedlings while simultaneously minimizing fertilizer inputs and mitigating potential environmental contamination.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that branch hydraulic conductivity partly controls foliar stable carbon isotope ratio (δ 13 C) by its influence on stomatal conductance in <b>Pinus</b> <b>monticola</b> Dougl. Notching and phloem-girdling treatments were applied to reduce branch conductivity {{over the course of}} a growing season. Notching and phloem girdling reduced leaf-specific conductivity (LSC) by about 30 and 90 %, respectively. The 90 % reduction in LSC increased foliar δ 13 C by about 1 ‰ (P < 0. 0001, n = 65), whereas the 30 % reduction in LSC had no effect on foliar δ 13 C (P = 0. 90, n = 65). Variation in the δ 13 C of dark respiration was similar to that of whole-tissues when compared among treatments. These isotopic measurements, in addition to instantaneous gas exchange measurements, suggested only minor adjustments in the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO 2 partial pressures (ci/ca) in response to experimentally reduced hydraulic conductivity. A strong correlation was observed between stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic demand over a tenfold range in gs. Although ci/ca and δ 13 C appeared to be relatively homeostatic, current-year leaf area varied linearly as a function of branch hydraulic conductivity (r 2 = 0. 69, P < 0. 0001, n = 18). These results suggest that, for <b>Pinus</b> <b>monticola,</b> adjustment of leaf area is a more important response to reduced branch conductivity than adjustment of ci/ca...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} and tested a theoretical model describing carbon isotope discrimination during photosynthesis in tree bark. Bark photosynthesis reduces losses of respired CO 2 from the underlying stem. As a consequence, the isotopic composition of source CO 2 and the CO 2 concentration around the chloroplasts {{are quite different}} from those of photosynthesizing leaves. We found three lines of evidence that bark photosynthesis discriminates against 13 C. First, in bark of Populus tremuloides, the δ 13 C of CO 2 efflux increased from – 24. 2 %in darkness to – 15. 8 % in the light. In <b>Pinus</b> <b>monticola,</b> the δ 13 C of CO 2 efflux increased from – 27. 7 % in darkness to – 10. 2 % in the light. Observed increases in δ 13 C were generally in good agreement with predictions from the theoretical model. Second, we found that δ 13 C of dark-respired CO 2 decreased following 2 – 3 h of illumination (P< 0. 01 for Populus tremuloides, P< 0. 001 for <b>Pinus</b> <b>monticola).</b> These decreases suggest that refixed photosynthate rapidly mixes into the respiratory substrate pool. Third, a field experiment demonstrated that bark photosynthesis influenced whole-tissue δ 13 C. Long-term light exclusion caused a localized increase in the δ 13 C of whole bark and current-year wood in branches of P. monticola (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 0001, respectively). Thus bark photosynthesis was shown to discriminate against 13 C and create a pool of photosynthate isotopically lighter than the dark respiratory pool in all three experiments. Failure to account for discrimination during bark photosynthesis could interfere with interpretation of the δ 13 C in woody tissues or in woody-tissue respiration...|$|E
