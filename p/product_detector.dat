AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop.

The detectors are both platinum-contact 10 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm CZT crystals, {{each with a}} 4 × 4 array of pixels tiling the anode. One is made from IMARAD horizontal Bridgman CZT, the other from eV Products high-pressure Bridgman CZT. Both detectors were mounted side-by-side in a flip-chip configuration and read out by a 32 -channel IDE VA/TA ASIC preamp/shaper. We enclosed the detectors in the same 40 ◦ field-of-view collimator (comprising a graded passive shield and plastic scintillator) used in our previously-reported September 2000 flight. I-V curves for the detectors are diode-like, and {{we find that the}} platinum contacts adhere significantly better to the CZT surfaces than gold to previous detectors. The detectors and instrumentation performed well in a 20 -hour balloon flight on 23 / 24 May 2001. Although we discovered a significant instrumental background component in flight, it was possible to measure and subtract this component from the spectra. The resulting IMARAD detector background spectrum (from 30 keV to ∼ 450 keV) reaches ∼ 5 × 10 − 3 counts cm − 2 s − 1 keV − 1 at 100 keV and has a powerlaw index of ∼ 2 at high energies.

40|$|We {{present results}} from the flight of two {{prototype}} CZT detectors on a scientific balloon payload in September 2000. The first detector, referred to as ``CZT 1,'' consisted of a 10 mm x 10 mm x 2 mm CZT crystal with a single gold planar electrode readout. This detector was shielded {{by a combination of}} a passive collimator surrounded by plastic scintillator and a thick BGO crystal in the rear. The second detector, ``CZT 2,'' comprised two 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm CZT crystals, one made of eV Products high pressure Bridgman material and the other of IMARAD horizontal Bridgman material, each fashioned with a 4 x 4 array of gold pixels on a 2. 5 mm pitch. The pixellated detectors were flip-chip-mounted side by side and read out by a 32 -channel ASIC. This detector was also shielded by a passive/plastic collimator in the front, but used only additional passive/plastic shielding in the rear. Both experiments were flown from Ft. Sumner, NM on September 19, 2000 on a 24 hour balloon flight. CZT 1 recorded a non-vetoed background level at 100 keV of ~ 1 e- 3 cts/cm 2 /s/keV. Raising the BGO threshold from 50 keV to ~ 1 MeV produced only an 18 % increase in this level. CZT 2 recorded a background at 100 keV of ~ 4 e- 3 cts/cm 2 /s/keV in the eV <b>Products</b> <b>detector</b> and ~ 6 e- 3 cts/cm 2 /s/keV in the IMARAD detector. Both CZT 1 and CZT 2 spectra were in basic agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, though both recorded systematically higher count rates at high energy than predicted. No lines were observed, indicating that neutron capture reactions, at least those producing decay lines at a few 100 keV, are not significant components of the CZT background. Comparison of the CZT 1 and CZT 2 spectra indicates that passive/plastic shielding may provide adequately low background levels for many applications.

40|$|AbstractThe {{scientific}} {{interest in}} the resonance neutron induced capture and fission reactions on 239 Pu is continuously rising during the last decade. From a practical point of view, this is because more precise data on capture and fission cross sections, fission fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions, variation of prompt fission neutron and gamma yields in the resonance neutron region, are needed for the modelling of new generation nuclear power plants and for nuclear spent fuel and waste transmutation. From a heuristic and fundamental point of view, such a research improves our {{knowledge and understanding of}} the fission phenomena itself. To achieve these goals more powerful neutron sources and more precise fission <b>product</b> <b>detectors</b> have to be used. At the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics (FLNP), where already half a century the thermal and resonance neutron induced nuclear reactions are studied, a new electron accelerator driven white spectrum pulsed neutron source IREN has been built and successfully tested. The improved characteristics of this facility, in comparison with those of the former pulse neutron fast reactor IBR- 30, will allow measuring some of the neutron-nuclear reaction data with better precision and accuracy. A new experimental setup for detecting gamma rays (and neutrons) has been designed and is under construction. It will consist of 2 rings (arrays) of 12 NaI(Tl) detectors each (or 1 array of 24 detectors) with variable ring diameter and distance between both rings. Such a setup will make possible not only to measure the multiplicity, energy and angular anisotropy of prompt fission gammas, but also to separate the contribution of prompt fission neutrons by their longer time-of-flight from the fissile target to the detectors. The signals from all the 24 detectors will be recorded simultaneously in digitized form and will be stored on the hard disk of the personal computer for further off-line analysis.
