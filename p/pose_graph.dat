40|$|Abstract — With better {{hardware}} {{and more efficient}} graph-SLAM solvers, {{we are able to}} solve increasingly large mapping problems. An actual implementation of a mapping problem as a <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> requires a certain amount of discretization of the information coming from odometry. Such discritizations are either sensor dependent or use a minimum distance travelled heuristic to add poses to the graph. In this work, we explore the question: how much information we can discard and still {{be able to get a}} correct map estimate using the <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> formulation. We approximate the robot trajectory by a sequence of lines leading to a reduced representation of the original <b>pose</b> <b>graph.</b> This reduction is carried out by using an incremental algorithm that adds new poses to the reduced graph when the perpendicular distance for the current estimated line exceeds a threshold. The reduced representation allows us to recover a part of (or the full) graph when needed.

To address this issue, our method brings two innovations that contribute at different levels: Locally between two motion sequences, we introduce {{a new approach to}} generate realistic transitions using dynamic time warping; More globally, over a set of motion sequences, we propose the essential graph as an efficient structure to encode the most realistic transitions between all pairs of input shape <b>poses.</b> <b>Graph</b> search in the essential graph allows then to generate realistic motions that are optimal with respect to various user-defined constraints.

Our approach estimates the expected information gain of laser measurements with respect to the resulting occupancy grid map.

40|$|Current {{state of}} the art {{solutions}} of the SLAM problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in <b>pose</b> <b>graphs</b> the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e. g. obtained from odometry) and information on loop closures. The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive loop closures will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely increases the overall robustness of the SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a {{solution}} to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in low dynamic environments by using a <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> and an RGB-D (red-green-blue depth) sensor. The low dynamic environments refer to situations in which the positions of objects change over long intervals. Therefore, in the low dynamic environments, robots have difficulty recognizing the repositioning of objects unlike in highly dynamic environments in which relatively fast-moving objects can be detected using a variety of moving object detection algorithms. The changes in the environments then cause groups of false loop closing when the same moved objects are observed for a while, which means that conventional SLAM algorithms produce incorrect results. To address this problem, we propose a novel SLAM method that handles low dynamic environments. The proposed method uses a <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> structure and an RGB-D sensor. First, to prune the falsely grouped constraints efficiently, nodes of the graph, that represent robot poses, are grouped according to the grouping rules with noise covariances. Next, false constraints of the <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> are pruned according to an error metric based on the grouped nodes.

40|$|<b>Pose</b> <b>Graph</b> Optimization (PGO) is {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} a set of poses from pairwise relative measurements. PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently no known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal solution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases. Our first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature on unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results about the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second contribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of eigenvalues of the penalized <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> matrix, which arises from the solution of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then (i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution, and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the penalized <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit the dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal solution for PGO when the penalized <b>pose</b> <b>graph</b> matrix satisfies the Single Zero Eigenvalue Property (SZEP).

40|$|Localization is a {{critical}} capability for many autonomous mobile robots. Implicit in all localization and place recognition techniques {{is the ability to}} decide whether a place is novel or familiar; the idea of “has this place been visited before?”. To make this decision accurately, localization systems typically require prior calibration or training on datasets from the specific type of operating environment; a requirement that is not practical in many environments or applications. One approach to this problem has been to remove the perfect data association requirement for place recognition systems by utilizing robust pose graphs. However, this approach requires a batch-based process and consequently does not solve the problem of real-time navigation in the interim before optimization. We present a novel technique which calibrates the localization system online as the robot moves through an environment, alleviating the need for prior calibration of a localization system.

Many previous approaches to mapping assume a static world.

This paper presents Dynamic <b>Pose</b> <b>Graph</b> SLAM (DPG-SLAM), an algorithm designed to enable a robot to remain localized in {{an environment}} that changes substantially over time. Using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) as the underlying SLAM state estimation engine, the Dynamic <b>Pose</b> <b>Graph</b> evolves over time as the robot explores new places and revisits previously mapped areas.

Because the classification in inliers/outliers is not observable in general, we pose the problem as finding the maximal subset of the measurements that is internally coherent. In the linear case, we show that the selection of the maximal coherent set can be (conservatively) relaxed to obtain a linear programming problem with ` 1 objective.
