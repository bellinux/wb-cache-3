Bushido Blade was the 25th best selling game of 1997 in Japan, selling nearly 388,000 copies. In November 2000, Bushido Blade was voted by the readers of Weekly Famitsu magazine as number 85 in its top 100 PlayStation games of all time.

The game was also added to the PSone Classics roster on the Japanese PlayStation Store in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Worlds Fair Beer {{was also}} {{released}} {{at the beginning}} of the fair. 250,000 cases of beer was sold during the fair, totaling nearly 6 million cans sold over the six months. Rick Kuhlman, who was a marketing director for a beer wholesaler at the time, had come up with the idea for the beer. He had to <b>presell</b> 10,000 cases of the beer to pay for initial batch. The beer would go on to be released in nine different colored cans, beginning with red, then blue, and eventually, green, brown, gold, black, purple, yellow and orange. Each color represented its own production batch and when a color was sold out, that was it. The beer was often purchased and never drank, as people thought the cans would one day be a collectable. [...] To observe the 35th anniversary of the fair, World's Fair Beer was being made in May 2017and will be available at various bars around Knoxville.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a consumption model {{that takes into}} account the valuation and demand uncertainties that consumers face while using access services. Typical examples of such services include telecommunication services, extended warranties for consumer electronics, and club memberships. We demonstrate that consumption is affected by contract structure (pay-peruse vs. three part tariffs) even if the optimal consumption plans are identical. We find that a majority of individuals correctly use a threshold policy that is similar to a nearly optimal heuristic, however they use the free units too quickly leading to overconsumption and lost surplus. These errors are partially driven by mistaken beliefs about the value distribution. We also measure subjects' willingness to pay for a contract with free access units, and we find that nearly half of subjects are willing to pay at least the full per-unit price, with a substantial fraction willing to overpay. The optimal firm strategy is therefore to offer a contract that <b>presells</b> access units at a very small discount; this strategy increases revenue by 8 - 15 % compared to only offering a pay-per-use contract...|$|R

40|$|A common {{practice}} in real estate markets is the sale of housing development units before completion, {{and in some cases}} even before beginning of the actual construction, known as presale. Developers that choose to <b>presell</b> units are subject to default {{on the part of the}} buyers if market conditions become unfavorable. In recent years, court rulings in Brazil have established that developers must refund 70 % to 90 % of payments made if the buyer chooses to opt out of the sales contract. This configures an abandon option for the buyer and creates a contingent liability for the real estate developer. We determine the value of the option to abandon in the Brazilian real estate market and model this flexibility to opt out of the sales contract as an American type option. Our results indicate that the option value is substantial and can have important impacts on the profitability and exposure to risk of the real estate developer with potential consequences to the Brazilian real estate market...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the first-day {{return of}} 182 IPOs {{listed on the}} Italian Stock Exchange from 1985 to 2001. It finds a significantly mean positive underpricing (21. 87 %). Contrary to the evidence detected in the USA by Loughran and Ritter and Ljungqvist and Wilhelm, it highlights that on the main board of the Italian Exchange IPO underpricing decreased in the late 1990 s. It claims that such a pattern can {{be accounted for by}} two determinants: (i) the evolution of pricing strategies, from fixed-price IPOs to bookbuilding, (ii) the segmentation of the Italian Exchange with the birth of a new board for high-growth and technology firms (Nuovo Mercato). It shows that IPOs are intentionally underpriced: both public and private information available at the IPO is only partially incorporated in pricing the shares. The results suggest that negative feedback learned during the <b>preselling</b> is more fully incorporated into the offer price than positive information. Finally, it shows that price revisions are partially predictable on the basis of public information {{at the time of the}} offering. ...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Commodity {{trading of}} {{agricultural}} products originally {{began as a}} mechanism for producers {{to be able to}} hedge against fluctuating markets by <b>preselling</b> forward contracts on their unrealized production, thus locking in guaranteed prices. Peripheral benefits to commodities trading of materials have been the public disclosure of the values of commodities and the development of specifications standardizing quality requirements for traded materials. Commodities trading systems also ease transactions and have mechanisms to resolve disputes between buyers and sellers who do not know each other. Recycled materials, although collected throughout the country and often viewed as commodities, have not had the benefits of any organized system of commodities trading. Best Practice: A recycled commodity exchange was established in 1995 in conjunction with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). This exchange is now managed by the Global Recycling Network (GRN) at www. cbot-recycle. com and carries listings for several grades of recycled materials, including glass. The CBOT Recyclables Exchange is dedicated to the international trade of recyclable goods and is open to all registered users. Becoming a registered user requires that businesses provide a company profile and pay a small one-time registration fee. Sellers post sell listings in the exchange and buyers enter buy parameters into the system for the commodities in which they are interested. The system automatically delivers t...|$|R
40|$|Key words. Newsvendor Model, Inventory Model, Seasonal Product, Weather Risk, Weather Option, Weather Derivative, Weather-Conditional Rebate, CVaR, Mean-CVaR. The {{first model}} {{considers}} {{the problem of}} hedging inventory risk for a newsvendor who sells a seasonal product. The newsvendor not only decides the order quantity, but also adopts a weather hedging strategy. A typical hedging strategy is to use an option that is constructed on a weather index before the season begins, which will compensate the buyer of the option if the actual seasonal weather index is above (or below) a given strike level. We explore the joint decision problem in mean-variance, expected utility, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and mean-CVaR frameworks. We analyze the impact of weather hedging on optimal order quantity. It is proven that the newsvendor may order {{more than in the}} absence of weather options. Numerical analysis on the sensitivity of the optimal order quantity, the risk premium of the option, the portfolio selection and the comparison between the weather option hedging and a particular operational hedging are presented as well. The second model investigates the advantages of early sales of a seasonal product. To induce early sales, the newsvendor adopts a weather-conditional rebate program, which will pay rebates to the customers who buy the product in the <b>preselling</b> period if a specified weather condition for normal selling season is realized. For an example, a certain amount of refund will be paid to early buyer if the seasonal average temperature falls below the past-three-year seasonal average. Two conditional rebate programs with early booking and early purchasing are investigated and compared. Both of them can price differentiate within a customer among his/her post valuation on the seasonal product, and thus increase the sales. For the early purchasing program, it can further save inventory holding cost and ordering cost. The expected profit can be improved by the programs. Moreover, combined with weather derivatives, the conditional rebate program can manage the financial risk with the expected profit being still improved. To investigate the means that firms may adopt in managing the adverse impacts of weather on their businesses, this dissertation proposes and analyzes two inventory models for seasonal products when the demand is sensitive to the weather in the season. Both models are formulated under the newsvendor context. Gao, Fei. "October 2007. "Adviser: Youhua Frank Chen. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 69 - 08, Section: B, page: 5002.
