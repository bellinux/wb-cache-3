25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, <b>pompanos,</b> horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

Pompano then continued to the Marshall Islands, where she found a 16,000-ton Japanese transport at Wotje, which was attacked with four torpedoes. Parks remained off Wotje for five more days and eventually attacked a destroyer, but his first two torpedoes detonated early.|$|E
2500|$|The blue {{trevally}} is {{a moderately}} large fish, growing to a recorded maximum length of 70cm and a weight of 8kg. The species {{is similar in}} general morphology {{to a number of}} other trevallies in the genus Carangoides, having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile. Unlike most of the Carangoides, however, the blue trevally’s snout is bluntly rounded, resembling the snouts of the <b>pompanos</b> of the genus Trachinotus and the lips of adults are notably fleshy. Two separate dorsal fins are found, the first having eight spines, while the second consists of one spine and 26 to 34 soft rays; more than any other species in Carangoides. In young adults, the lobe of the second dorsal fin is often falcate, but usually shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two anteriorly [...] detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has one spine attached to 20 or 21 soft rays. The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch, with the junction of the curved and straight sections vertically below the 15th to 20th soft rays of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 82 to 90 scales, while the straight section has 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is naked ventrally to origin of the pelvic fins and the base of the pectoral fins, but is interrupted laterally by a moderate band of scales. The upper jaw is highly protractile, containing narrow bands of villiform teeth, which become obsolescent with age, {{as is the case in}} the lower jaw. It has a total of 24 to 29 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pompanos</b> engines were {{a unique}} {{prototype}} of the H.O.R. engine, having 8 cylinders. An inherent problem with double-acting cylinders, owing to the piston rod reducing the piston area on one side, is an imbalance in the force {{on each side of}} the piston. The H.O.R. engines were plagued by vibration and other problems as a result. While Pompano was still being built, the Salmon class submarines were ordered. Three of these were built by Electric Boat, with a 9-cylinder development of the same H.O.R. engine. The 9-cylinder arrangement was an attempt to re-balance the engine, so reducing the overall effect of vibration across the engine. Although not as great a failure as <b>Pompanos</b> engines, this version was still troublesome and the boats were later re-engined with the same General Motors 16-248 two-stroke V16 Diesel engines as their sister boats. Other Electric Boat constructed submarines of the Sargo and Seadragon classes were also built with these 9-cylinder H.O.R. engines, but later re-engined.|$|E
50|$|Undaunted, {{at noon on}} 12 August 1942, she dove and set up on a freighter, {{which was}} coming into {{position}} when Pompano sighted an enemy destroyer coming down between the sub and her target. Firing two torpedoes, <b>Pompanos</b> men heard two very loud explosions, and saw a huge column of spray and water through the periscope, blotting out the destroyer's bow at 700 yd. Both sets of screws stopped immediately. As Pompano closed the freighter, it settled below, evidently {{a victim of the}} second torpedo.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 the US {{submarine}} USS Pompano {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the Perch class Six boats were built, with three different diesel engine designs from different makers. Pompano was fitted with H.O.R. (Hooven-Owens-Rentschler) 8-cylinder double-acting engines that were a licence-built version of the MAN auxiliary engines of the cruiser Leipzig. Owing to the limited space available within the submarines, either opposed-piston or, in this case, double-acting engines were favoured for being more compact. <b>Pompanos</b> engines were a complete failure and were wrecked during trials before even leaving the Mare Island Navy Yard. Pompano was laid up for eight months until 1938 while the engines were replaced. Even then the engines were regarded as unsatisfactory and were replaced by Fairbanks-Morse engines in 1942. While Pompano was still being built, the Salmon class submarines were ordered. Three of these were built by Electric Boat, with a 9-cylinder development of the H.O.R. engine. Although not as great a failure as <b>Pompanos</b> engines, this version was still troublesome and the boats were later re-engined with the same single-acting General Motors 16-248 V16 engines as their sister boats. Other Electric Boat constructed submarines of the Sargo and Seadragon classes were also built with these 9-cylinder H.O.R. engines, but later re-engined.|$|E

50|$|Pompano left Midway on 20 August, {{bound for}} Hokkaidō and Honshū. She was {{never heard from}} again, and when she failed to return, was presumed lost. The Japanese knew {{she was in her}} area, however, for two ships fell to her torpedoes during September: Akama Maru on 3 September, and Taiko Maru on 25 September. The enemy made no anti-submarine attacks during this period in <b>Pompanos</b> area, so newly-laid mines in the vicinity, not known to U.S.Navy {{intelligence}} until after she sailed, probably sank her. Pompano was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 January 1944.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{lookdown}} {{is similar}} to the Atlantic moonfish, it can be distinguished by its dorsal and anal fins, the second ray on each fin being many times longer than the surrounding rays. This gives the dorsal and anal fins a noticeably scythe-like shape. Also, the dorsal fin of the lookdown has 9 spines and 23 rays, while the anal fin has only 3 spines and 18 rays. Like the Atlantic moonfish, it has a deep, rhombus-shaped, laterally-compressed body. The head has the mouth set low and the eyes high.
