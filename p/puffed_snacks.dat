This {{study was to determine}} the amount of spices such as garlic and pepper to be added to the products to beneficially improve the health status of the consumer without detrimental effect on the flavour and taste. The Box-Behnken (k = 3, nc = 3) response surface design was used to create a model to determine the optimum garlic and pepper flavour for <b>puffed</b> <b>snacks.</b> Specified quantities of salt (1 - 2 %(w/w)), garlic (0 - 4 %(w/w)), and pepper (0 - 4 %(w/w)) were used in the design. Fifteen spiced snacks were evaluated by 30 Thai panelists. The model showed the optimum pepper quantity of 0. 7 % (w/w) and salt and garlic of no more than 1. 10 and 2. 80 %(w/w), respectively. If 25 g of the <b>puffed</b> <b>snacks</b> were eaten daily the consumer would get enough garlic to satisfy its daily requirements, but not enough pepper to get its purported health benefits. However, as the Thais use copious quantities of pepper in most other dishes, it is likely that eating 25 g of the proposed functional snack with their other dishes would more than likely provide enough pepper to give them the health benefits from this herb...|$|E

40|$|In nature, starch is {{available}} in an abundance, surpassed only by cellulose as a naturally occurring organic compound. Starch is located {{in many parts of}} green leafed plants, such as roots, stems, seeds, and fruits. Starch serves as food for energy during dormancy and germination in plants and functions similarly for humans and animals. However, uses for starch extend far beyond its original function as a source of biological energy. Today, many industries use starch or its derivatives {{in one form or another}} in various applications. In foods, starch is traditionally used at moderately low levels as ingredients that have nutritive value while also imparting functional properties to food systems. Starches play an important role in controlling the aesthetic and organoleptic characteristics of a number of processed foods (Fig. 1). Depending on the type, starch and its derivatives may be used to facilitate processing, provide texture, thicken, suspend solids, yield a desired appearance, and control moisture, consistency, and shelf stability. Starches and starch derivatives have a long history of use in snack foods, especially as functional ingredients to help snacks achieve various textural attributes. For example, in expanded or <b>puffed</b> <b>snacks,</b> the target texture can be obtained by changing the amylose / amylopectin ratio by manipulating combinations of high-amylose and high-amylopectin starches according to th...|$|E

40|$|Milk protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) is a high-protein, low-lactose dairy powder that contains caseins and whey proteins {{in the same}} ratio as milk. Although ideally suited for delivery of nutritionally superior products, MPC has not been extruded into commercial <b>puffed</b> <b>snacks</b> nor breakfast cereals due to its heat sensitivity. Meanwhile, apple pomace (AP) is a marginally utilized by-product of juice production and {{is also a good}} source of fiber and phenolic compounds. Its co-extrusion with MPC using low-temperature, low-shear supercritical-fluid extrusion (SCFX) technology to develop high-protein, shelf-stable products offers an economically and nutritionally attractive opportunity. In this study, SCFX was used to develop expanded products from MPC with added AP and sugar for direct consumption. The expansion ratios, density, porosity, water diffusion coefficient, color, mechanical properties and total phenolic content of the MPC extrudates containing three levels of AP (5 %, 15 % and 25 %) and sugar (5 %, 10 % and 15 %) were measured. The changes in texture, density and water activity of the MPC extrudates during storage were also evaluated. Two extruded commercial products were evaluated for comparison. The results showed that the MPC extrudates had low density, high porosity and good textural properties, which did not change during 9 months of storage. Adding AP at higher concentrations (≥ 15 %) adversely affected the expansion characteristics of the extrudates. At lower AP concentrations, the texture of the extrudates was comparable to commercial products. As expected, the addition of AP and sugar caused the product to appear darker in color. Additionally, SCFX processing increased the availability of phenolic compounds in the extrudates, indicating improvements in the overall nutritional quality of the final product. 2019 - 01 - 3...|$|E
40|$|Published {{research}} for understanding crispness perception {{has relied on}} correlations of sensory results to objective measurements. This research was undertaken to evaluate the contribution of physiological responses to the perception of crispness of corn based <b>puffed</b> <b>snacks.</b> Predictive models published in literature relate crispness perception to instrumental force and sounds produced during biting and compression. These models were {{used as the basis}} for this research. Air-conducted and bone-conducted sounds were measured using both consumer and trained panelists. A novel analysis technique, fractal analysis, was used to analyse the jagged sound wave patterns produced during biting into extruded snacks. A specialised bite force apparatus was designed for measuring bite forces produced by the incisors. All physiological results were then related to panelists' perception of crispness. To minimise sample variability, extruded snack samples were prepared and used throughout the entire trial. A range of crispness levels were achieved by equilibrating the extrudates over various water activities. Consumer panelists and trained panelists consistently agreed on the relative crispness of the extruded snacks. Air-conducted sounds and bite force showed significant correlations with crispness, while bone-conducted sounds did not. Bite force measures were also shown to relate to instrumental measures of force. For statistical validity, the physiological data from the 39 consumers were used to develop predictive equations for crispness. Analysis of the data showed no significant correlation between the physiological data and crispness. Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} develop a predictive equation for crispness based on the physiological measures collected from consumers. While there are reports linking crispness to various instrumental measures, this is the first time in-vivo physiological measures have been collected from a large group of individuals for development of statistically viable models for crispness. The lack of a relationship between crispness and physiological measures indicates that crispness perception across consumers is complex and not adequately explained by bite force and sounds alone...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Snacks are {{commonly}} {{consumed by the}} most of children, that as fast foods and drinks, between main meals. Such fast foods being consumed do not usually provide a balanced meal, {{but they can be}} a useful source of some nutrients especially extra energy. The safety of snacks dietary components, including flavors and colors, is currently a subject of great interest since some of which are proved to be animal toxins and/or carcinogens. Therefore, the present work was carried out to study the chemical and toxicological evaluation of some snacks consumed by children in Egypt. Potato chips, <b>puff</b> <b>snacks</b> and fatty cake samples were purchased within about three months, transported to the laboratory, ground or homogenized before they were freeze-dried to ensure equal moisture content then used for alcohol extracts preparation. Also, extracts were prepared from potato chips samples made in lab for comparative study. Liver cells, isolated from Bolti fish and established in primary culture, were treated with a concentration of 1 x 10 - 1 to 1 x 10 - 7 % snacks extracts for 48 hr. Cytotoxicity in primary cultures was evaluated by changes in lysosomes activity, mitochondrial activity and cell membrane integrity over a range of each extract concentrations. The highest adverse cytotoxic effects were recorded for <b>puff</b> <b>snacks</b> followed by fatty cake and potato chips, respectively. Very little effects induced in lab made potato chips extracts.

The aim {{of this research is}} to determine consumer preferences and specific attributes of whole grain and high fiber products that drive acceptability through descriptive analysis and preference mapping on whole wheat breads and an extruded pinto bean and brown rice flour <b>snack</b> <b>puff.</b> Commercial whole wheat breads, characterized by 26 appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture attributes, were separated into two distinct groups. The first group consisted of attributes similar to white bread: sweet, moist, and sticky. While the second group, had attributes associated with traditional wheat breads: wheaty, earthy, bitter. Consumers were clustered into three groups for clearer understanding of market segmentation. The first cluster liked all breads equally, while the second liked the breads associated with white bread attributes and the third cluster liked the classic wheat breads more. This was confirmed through partial least squares (PLS) regression, which showed if each attribute positively or negatively affected overall liking for each respective cluster. In the second study, composite flours were extruded with varying pinto bean flour levels and feed moisture conditions to produce an acceptable <b>puffed</b> <b>snack</b> product. The level of bean flour affected the majority of the fifteen descriptive attributes, while feed moisture only affected texture and appearance attributes. Consumers found the extruded puffs with up to 15 % bean flour to be the most acceptable. Preference mapping and PLS regression showed higher overall liking scores for samples characterized by rice flavor and larger diameter and lower scores for extrudates with higher bean flavor and grittier textures. Overall, these studies were successful in determining descriptive attributes as well as their relationship to consumer acceptability through preference mapping.

For the analyses, we considered the sample weights and the effect of the study design. The mean (and standard deviations) and frequencies (%) of energy, nutrients, and food groups consumption were estimated for weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekend (Saturday and Sunday), we then estimated the differences according to the days of the week for the population strata analyzed. RESULTS The average daily energy intake for the weekend was 8 % higher than the one observed for weekdays. The average percentage contribution of carbohydrate to the daily energy intake was higher during the week compared to Saturday and Sunday (56. 3 % versus 54. 1 %, p < 0. 01). The inverse was observed for averages of the contribution to the daily intake of energy from total fat (26. 8 % versus 28. 4 %), saturated fat (9. 1 % versus 9. 9 %) and trans fat (1. 4 % versus 1. 6 %).

In {{order to}} {{increase}} the diversity of roselle, different proportion of roselle powder were added into corn grit, and the extrusion technology was used to develop a <b>puffed</b> <b>snack</b> foods, and the extrudates’ antioxidant activity were also investigated. This study {{is divided into two}} parts as follow. In the first experiment, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied in the first stage to analyze the effect of roselle powder level (8 %、 10 %、 15 %、 20 %、 22 %) and screw speed (150 rpm、 180 rpm、 250 rpm、 320 rpm、 350 rpm) on physical properties (radial expansion, longitudinal expansion, bulk density, hardness, maximum shear force) and chemical properties (water solubility index and water absorption index) of the product. Regression analysis of Minitab 14 was applied with contour plots to obtain the fitted extrusion condition under optimized quality; the optimum roselle powder level is 14. 1 % and optimum screw speed is 217. 9 rpm. In the second part, total polypherol, flavonoid and anthocyanin content were determined with the extrudates and pure roselle powder. Roselle extrudates, pure roselle powder, pure corn powder extrudates, and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), vitamin C and vitamin E were used to the experiment of antioxidant properties. DPPH radical scavenging capacity, antioxidant activity (conjugated diene method), reducing power and total antioxidant capacity were estimated to understand the antioxidant properties of roselle extrudates under optimized extrusion. According to the determination of roselle powder and roselle extrudates on polypherol, anthocyanin and flavonoid, roselle powder had the highest results, while roselle extrudates was the second highest; both results were significantly different. The IC 50 of roselle powder, roselle extrudates and corn extrudates on scavenging DPPH radical ability were 2. 485 ± 0. 037 mg/ml, 8. 868 ± 0. 205 mg/ml and 40. 368 ± 3. 013 mg/ml, respectively. According to the Conjugated diene method (0 h) determination, the IC 50 of roselle powder, roselle extrudates and corn extrudates were 0. 208 ± 0. 002 mg/ml, 0. 881 ± 0. 008 mg/ml and 6. 412 ± 0. 084 mg/ml, respectively. The Conjugated diene method (15 h) determination showed that the IC 50 of roselle powder, roselle extrudates and corn extrudates were 0. 254 ± 0. 004 mg/ml, 0. 971 ± 0. 005 mg/ml and 7. 576 ± 0. 087 mg/ml, respectively. As shown in the results of Reducing power determination, with extraction concentration between 3 ~ 13 mg/ml, the optical density (OD) of roselle powder gradually increased from 0. 295 to 0. 766, the OD of roselle extrduate gradually increased from 0. 167 to 0. 433, and the OD of corn extrudate gradually increased from 0. 104 to 0. 196; the higher the OD, the higher the reducing power. As shown in the results of Total antioxidant capacity determination, the IC 50 of roselle powder, roselle extrudates and corn extrudates were 0. 674 ± 0. 054 mg/ml, 4. 393 ± 0. 639 mg/ml and 9. 973 ± 1. 074 mg/ml, respectively. In conclusion, according to the results of the four antioxidant properties above, the results of roselle powder were the highest, second was roselle extrudates, and corn extrudates had the lowest results; significant difference shown between the three. 洛神花為極富營養價值的食物，為增加其多元化利用，本研究擬以添加不同比例之洛神花粉於玉米粉中，利用擠壓技術開發膨發性休閒食品，並分析其抗氧化活性。研究分為下列兩部分： 本實驗第一階段採用反應曲面法(RSM) 之二變數五層級設計，以添加乾洛神花粉比例、螺軸轉速做為擠壓機之操作參數。乾洛神花粉添加比例範圍為(8 %、 10 %、 15 %、 20 %、 22 %) 、擠壓機螺軸轉速範圍為(150 rpm、 180 rpm、 250 rpm、 320 rpm、 350 rpm) ，中心點採五重複，共計有 13 組處理，再針對各項處理組之產品進行物理性質(徑向膨發率、縱向膨發、假密度、硬度值、最大剪切力) 以及化學性質(吸水性指標、水溶性指標) 之測定。根據各項測定結果，利用Minitab 14 統計軟體以迴歸分析配合等高線圖，以尋求最佳品質下之最適擠壓操作條件。本實驗找出之最適擠壓操作條件為洛神花粉添加比例 14. 1 %、螺軸轉速 217. 9 rpm。 第二階段則針對擠壓機最適操作條件下之擠壓產品，與純乾洛神花粉原料，進行總多酚、類黃酮及花青素含量之測定。再將洛神花擠壓產品、純乾洛神花粉原料、純玉米擠壓產品等之實驗處理組，與 BHA、Vitamin C及Vitamin E等藥品對照組，進行抗氧化特性之實驗。評估項目為清除DPPH自由基能力、抗氧化能力(共軛雙烯法) 、還原能力及總抗氧化能力等，以了解最適擠壓條件下之洛神花擠壓產品其抗氧化功能特性。洛神花粉原料與洛神花擠壓產品，在總多酚、類黃酮及花青素含量之測定，三種成分含量測定皆是以洛神花粉原料最高；洛神花擠壓產品其次，且兩者間均有顯著差異。洛神花粉原料、洛神花擠壓產品與玉米擠壓產品在清除DPPH自由基能力之IC 50 濃度分別為 2. 485 ± 0. 037 mg/ml、 8. 868 ± 0. 205 mg/ml與 40. 368 ± 3. 013 mg/ml。共軛雙烯法(0 h) 之測定結果顯示，洛神花粉原料、洛神花擠壓產品與玉米擠壓產品之IC 50 濃度分別為 0. 208 ± 0. 002 mg/ml、 0. 881 ± 0. 008 mg/ml與 6. 412 ± 0. 084 mg/ml。共軛雙烯法(15 h) 之測定結果顯示，洛神花粉原料、洛神花擠壓產品與玉米擠壓產品之IC 50 濃度分別為 0. 254 ± 0. 004 mg/ml、 0. 971 ± 0. 005 mg/ml與 7. 576 ± 0. 087 mg/ml。還原力之測定結果顯示；萃取濃度在 3 ~ 13 mg/ml之間時，洛神花粉原料吸光值分別從 0. 295 逐漸升高到 0. 766 ，洛神花擠壓產品吸光值從 0. 167 逐漸升高到 0. 433 ，而玉米擠壓產品吸光值從 0. 104 逐漸升高到 0. 196 ，測得之吸光值愈高，表示其樣本還原力愈好。總抗氧化能力之測定結果顯示，洛神花粉原料、洛神花擠壓產品與玉米擠壓產品之IC 50 濃度分別為 0. 674 ± 0. 054 mg/ml、 4. 393 ± 0. 639 mg/ml與 9. 973 ± 1. 074 mg/ml。綜合上述四種抗氧化功能測定，皆以洛神花粉原料效果最佳；洛神花擠壓產品其次；玉米擠壓產品最低，且三者間均有顯著差異。中文摘要………………………………………………………………	 i 英文摘要………………………………………………………………	 iii 表目錄………………………………………………………………… viii 圖目錄…………………………………………………………………	X 1. 緒論………………………………………………………………… 	 1 1. 1 研究動機………………………………………………………. 	 1 1. 2 研究目的………………………………………………………. 	 2 2. 文獻探討……………………………………………………………. 	 3 2. 1 擠壓技術………………………………………………………. 	 3 2. 1. 1 擠壓技術簡介………………………………………… [...] 	 3 2. 1. 2 擠壓技術之優點……………………………………… [...] 	 3 2. 2 擠壓機簡介	…………………………………………………… 	 5 2. 3 洛神花…………………………………………………………. 	 7 2. 3. 1 洛神花簡介…………………………………………… [...] 	 7 2. 3. 2 洛神花成分及其應用………………………………… [...] 	 9 2. 3. 3 洛神花生理活性功能………………………………… [...] 	 14 2. 4 自由基與抗氧化物質…………………………………………. 	 16 2. 5 反應曲面法……………………………………………………. 	 19 3. 材料與方法…………………………………………………………. 	 20 3. 1 實驗材料與設備………………………………………………. 	 20 3. 1. 1 實驗材料……………………………………………… [...] 	 20 3. 1. 2 實驗設備……………………………………………… [...] 	 20 3. 2 實驗設計………………………………………………………. 	 22 3. 3 產品量測項目與分析方法……………………………………. 	 24 3. 3. 1 徑向膨發率…………………………………………… [...] 	 24 3. 3. 2 縱向膨發……………………………………………… [...] 	 24 3. 3. 3 假密度………………………………………………… [...] 	 25 3. 3. 4 硬度值………………………………………………… [...] . 	 25 3. 3. 5 最大剪切力…………………………………………… [...] . 	 25 3. 3. 6 吸水性指標及水溶性指標…………………………… [...] . 	 26 3. 4 抗氧化成分及其功能評估…………………………………… [...] 	 26 3. 4. 1 總多酚含量之測定…………………………………… [...] . 	 26 3. 4. 2 類黃酮含量之測定…………………………………… [...] . 	 27 3. 4. 3 花青素含量之測定…………………………………… [...] . 	 27 3. 4. 4 清除DPPH自由基能力之測定……………………… [...] . 	 27 3. 4. 5 抗氧化力(共軛雙烯法) 之測定……………………… [...] 	 28 3. 4. 6 還原力之測定………………………………………… [...] . 	 29 3. 4. 7 總抗氧化能力之測定………………………………… [...] . 	 29 3. 5 統計分析……………………………………………………… [...] 	 29 4. 結果與討論………………………………………………………… [...] 	 31 4. 1 第一階段實驗之結果與討論………………………………… [...] 	 31 4. 1. 1 徑向膨發率…………………………………………… [...] . 	 31 4. 1. 2 縱向膨發……………………………………………… [...] . 	 36 4. 1. 3 假密度………………………………………………… [...] . 	 43 4. 1. 4 硬度值………………………………………………… [...] . 	 47 4. 1. 5 最大剪切力…………………………………………… [...] . 	 52 4. 1. 6 吸水性指標…………………………………………… [...] . 	 57 4. 1. 7 水溶性指標…………………………………………… [...] . 	 62 4. 1. 8 各項反應性狀間之相關性分析……………………… [...] . 	 67 4. 1. 9 最適操作條件之選定與評估………………………… [...] . 	 69 4. 2 第二階段實驗之結果與討論………………………………… [...] 	 70 4. 2. 1 總多酚、類黃酮及花青素含量之測定……………… [...] . 	 70 4. 2. 2 清除DPPH自由基能力之測定……………………… [...] . 	 75 4. 2. 3 抗氧化能力(共軛雙烯法) 之測定…………………… [...] 	 79 4. 2. 4 還原力之測定………………………………………… [...] . 	 90 4. 2. 5 總抗氧化能力之測定………………………………… [...] . 	 93 5. 結論………………………………………………………………… [...] 100 6. 對今後研究工作之建議…………………………………………… [...] . 	 103 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………	 10...|$|R
