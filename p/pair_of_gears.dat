The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must {{move back and forth}} in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. [...] Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.|$|E

5000|$|Cardano's {{work with}} hypocycloids {{led him to}} the [...] "Cardan gear mechanism," [...] in which a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> with the smaller being {{one-half}} the size of the larger gear is used converting rotational motion to linear motion, with greater efficiency and precision than a Scotch yoke, for example.|$|E
5000|$|Backlash is {{the error}} in motion {{that occurs when}} gears change direction. It exists because there is always some gap between the {{trailing}} face of the driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear, and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new direction. The term [...] "backlash" [...] {{can also be used}} to refer to the size of the gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> as having, for example, [...] "0.1 mm of backlash." [...] A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> could be designed to have zero backlash, but this would presuppose perfection in manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system, and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It is usually provided by reducing the tooth thickness of each gear by half the desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however, the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further apart. The backlash of a gear train equals the sum of the backlash of each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears,</b> so in long trains backlash can become a problem.|$|E

Gear selector shaft was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars.

5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. To engage a particular <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears,</b> one gear is slid axially until it fully engages a gear on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|E

50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears.|$|E

The frame was a new full cradle design and with a close-ratio kickstart-less gearbox, 8 inch brakes, Amal TT carburettor, Lucas Racing magneto and a 3 gallon petrol tank. The CS1 was the standard for racing Nortons for the next 20 years. [...] The magneto {{was moved to the}} rear of the engine and the bottom end was a traditional Norton design, but in the side of the crankcase was the oil pump housing and a pair of bevel gears to drive the long shaft which ran in a tube up the side of the engine to a second <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> driving the overhead camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The De Dion-Bouton motor {{tricycle}} {{went into}} production in 1897 weighing just under 80 kg, with an output of 1.5 HP at 1,800 RPM from its 211 cc motor, although the engine {{had already been}} established in a prototype tricycle in 1895. [...] The tricycle with track width of 92 cm was chosen, because according to Dion and Bouton [...] "a bike appeared too fragile for this purpose." [...] The drive was achieved via a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> from the motor directly to the rear axle. A differential balanced the different curve radii. The relatively high purchase price amounted to 1000 to 1500 gold marks. [...] The motor tricycle remained in continuous production for almost ten years. The last model (1904) increased the engine capacity and performance with a 955 cc displacement engine (bore 100 mm, stroke 120 mm) producing 8 HP at 1,800 RPM. On April 13, 1902, the French racer Georges Osmont set a speed record of 109.1 km/h in Nice with a De Dion-Bouton motor tricycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{combination}} of tooth flank hardness and tooth surface roughness on the surface durability of medium-hardness gears are investigated using a disk machine. The meaning {{of the difference in}} hardness between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> is discussed. In the case where the surface roughnesses differ between contact surfaces with the same initial hardness, severe wear and pitting occur on the smooth surface because the asperities on the rough surface are highly hardeneddue to the repetition of contact. Therefore, it is necessary that the initial hardness of the smooth surface is higher than that of the rough surface in a combination of different sufface roughnesses. This means that the hardness combination between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> should be determined in consideration of the final condition of the finished tooth surfaces of the gears...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{accurate}} {{finite element}} contact analysis of helical gears was done directly under ANSYS, while the integrated elastic deformation of the meshed teeth was extracted {{directly from the}} finite element contact analysis results, and considered as the main basis {{of the amount of}} tooth profile modification. Linear, conic, cubic, and sine relief curve are compiled and established in MATLAB, on which gear models of two ways of modified gear are built. Under the same modified parameters, contact method is used on the proposed finite element models of gears by software LS-DYNA, and the effect of the two ways of gear relief on contact force on teeth face is analyzed. The results show that the effect of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> relief is better than one gear relief for linear and conic relief curve, and the effect of one gear relief is better than a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> relief for cubic and sine relief curve.
