2500|$|All Saints Church, Southill is a 14th and 15th century church embellished in 1814 {{built in}} courses of ferrous rubble stone, part-dressed in {{ironstone}} and limestone, alterated and extended {{in red and}} <b>pale</b> <b>brick.</b> Some areas are cement- or lime-rendered. [...] The church contains floor and wall monuments to local people mainly from the 17th and 18th century, some of which in polychrome marble. [...] It is a listed building in the middle category of statutorily protected heritage, Grade II*.|$|E
2500|$|The {{city has}} {{an array of}} {{free-standing}} clock towers in various styles. [...] The landmark Jubilee Clock Tower in the city centre has been called Brighton's [...] "second best known symbol" [...] after the Royal Pavilion; Preston Park, Queen's Park and Blaker's Park each have one; and a fifth was erected in the 1930s in Patcham to publicise the suburb's Ladies Mile Estate. All except the Blaker's Park and Patcham clock towers are Grade II-listed. John Johnson's design for the Jubilee Clock Tower of 1888 combined the Classical style with Baroque motifs and some High Gothic elements. Pink granite, a copper fishscale dome, Corinthian columns and mosaic portraits of Royal Family members combine to give a [...] "supremely confident and showy" [...] design. [...] The tower has withstood fierce criticism and calls for its demolition, {{and is now a}} widely appreciated landmark. Francis May's [...] "pompous" [...] clock tower, built in the newly laid out Preston Park in 1891–92, also combined some Classical and Gothic elements—this time using terracotta, <b>pale</b> <b>brick</b> and stone—but its style is closest in spirit to Neo-Flemish Renaissance. A copper dome with a weather-vane tops the four-stage tower. A London architect, Llewellyn Williams, won the commission for the Queen's Park clock tower in 1915; his three-stage design, on high ground, incorporates Portland stone (partly rusticated) and red brick, and also has a copper roof. Blaker's Park, northeast of Preston Park, was laid out in 1893 when Sir John Blaker (later 1st Baron of Brighton) donated land. [...] He also paid £1,000 towards the construction in 1896 of a [...] red-brick and iron clock tower with a pale green exterior. [...] It is topped by a cupola with a dolphin-shaped weather-vane, and bears Blaker's monogram. Patcham's clock tower, built of pale stone in an International/Modernist style, stands on a green amidst 1930s housing and forms an important landmark.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout East Sussex, few {{original}} libraries {{survive in}} use. [...] In Brighton and Hove, only Hove's central library (1907–08, by Leeds architects Percy Robinson and W. Alban Jones) remains with little alteration. The [...] "highly inventive" [...] Edwardian Baroque design features a domed upper storey and a rotunda at the rear. [...] The façade has egg-and-dart moulding. Brighton's central library {{used to be}} in the early-19th-century complex of buildings designed by William Porden, which later became Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. [...] Distinguished by excellent interior tiling, it had long been too small but was not replaced until Jubilee Library opened in February 2005. Bennetts Associates and Lomax, Cassidy & Edwards designed the [...] "carefully wrought but nonetheless striking" [...] building—a highly glazed [...] "box" [...] with a prominent brise soleil and side elevations laid with dark blue tiles resembling mathematical tiles. As the main element in the regeneration of North Laine, it has been called [...] "the most important public building constructed in Brighton since the Royal Pavilion". Portslade Library, built in 1964, was [...] "a typical Sixties creation" [...] with little regard for disabled access: it was built on a sloping site, and steps lead down from the road to the entrance. [...] Its Modernist design drew comparison locally with Sputnik. Hangleton's library (opened in 1962, although Hove Borough Surveyor T.R. Humble's plans date from 1958) is integrated into a residential building, and the same applies at Coldean. [...] The Archadia firm of architects designed a ground-floor library of [...] with six housing association flats above, in which the windows are emphasised by panels of <b>pale</b> <b>brick.</b> The complex opened in June 2008, replacing the original library of 1975. Moulsecoomb library was designed by Percy Billington in 1964; its large roof seems to [...] "float" [...] as it overhangs the small single-storey structure. Other modern libraries include Patcham (1933; extended in 2003), Westdene (1964) and Woodingdean (1959), for which planning permission to demolish and rebuild on a larger scale to include a doctor's surgery was sought in 2012. Rottingdean's library is housed in the former vicarage, Saltdean's is part of Saltdean Lido, and Hollingbury library occupies the former County Oak pub (1950) which was made up of two prefabricated buildings.|$|E

50|$|The church, {{dedicated}} to Saint Helen, was built of <b>pale</b> orange <b>brick</b> in 1841, {{on the site}} of an earlier church. C. Hodgson Fowler restored the interior in 1892, retaining the 14th-century font. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|R
2500|$|For many years, convalescent {{homes and}} similar {{institutions}} {{have taken advantage}} of the mild climate and sea air. [...] The Convalescent Police Seaside Home in Hove was Britain's first when it opened in 1890 in a house in Clarendon Villas. [...] Almost immediately, architect J.G. Gibbins was engaged to design a purpose-built home on land nearby. [...] This plot on Portland Road was in [...] "a charming position, [...] open to the sea" [...] at the time. [...] William Willett erected the building, which opened in July 1893. [...] The red-brick home has gabled roofs, substantial chimney-stacks and a visually prominent entrance, and is a dominant presence on Portland Road. The home moved to Kingsway in 1966, and East Sussex County Council converted the old building into the Portland House Nursing Home. The French government paid for a large home to be built on the cliffs at Black Rock in 1895–98. [...] The château-like French Convalescent Home was converted into flats in 1999, but retains its slate mansard-roofed corner pavilions, gabled entrance and garden-facing colonnade. [...] The French Renaissance Revival style chosen by architects Clayton & Black contrasts with surrounding seafront developments. [...] St Dunstan's, a charity which looks after blind former members of the Armed Forces, is based at Ovingdean, and its rest and rehabilitation home is based on a prominent downland site overlooking the coast road. [...] The Burnet, Tait and Lorne Partnership's International Modern steel-frame and <b>pale</b> <b>brick</b> home has a cruciform plan with a symmetrical west-facing façade. [...] Some windows are recessed, and others are flanked by brown-tiled columns. [...] Described as [...] "slightly reminiscent of Charles Holden's London Underground stations", its shape recalls that of a biplane. [...] A low chapel in front is topped by a Winged Victory sculpture. [...] On The Drive in Hove, the Grade II-listed number 55 (now flats) was a convalescent home called Catisfield House between 1939 and 1999. [...] It was run by the Rose Elizabeth Greene Charitable Trust: Miss Greene had left the original Catisfield House (in rural Sussex) in her will to house poor women recovering from stays in hospital. [...] It moved to Hove when larger premises were needed.|$|E

60|$|The eyes of this unhappy race {{might have}} been raised to the solitary spire that sprang up {{in the midst of}} them, the bearer of present consolation, the harbinger of future equality; but Holy Church at Marney had {{forgotten}} her sacred mission. We have introduced the reader to the vicar, an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached each week two sermons, and enforced humility on his congregation and gratitude for the blessings of this life. The high Street and some neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers. Lord and Lady Marney came, attended by Captain Grouse, every Sunday morning with commendable regularity, and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew, that occupied half of the gallery, was lined with crimson damask, and furnished with easy chairs, and, for those who chose them, well-padded stools of prayer. The people of Marney took refuge in conventicles, which abounded; little plain buildings of <b>pale</b> <b>brick</b> with the names painted on them, of Sion, Bethel, Bethesda: names of a distant land, and the language of a persecuted and ancient race: yet, such is the mysterious power of their divine quality, breathing consolation in the nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a Saxon peasantry.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{localisation}} of numerals, {{peculiar to}} certain persons, is foreign to me. In my mind's eye the figures appear {{in front of}} me, within a limited space. My peculiarity, however, consists {{in the fact that}} the numerals from 1 to 9 are differently coloured; (1) black, (2) yellow, (3) <b>pale</b> <b>brick</b> red, (4) brown, (5) blackish gray, (6) reddish brown, (7) green, (8) bluish, (9) reddish brown, somewhat like 6. These colours appear very distinctly when I think of these figures separately; in compound figures they become less apparent. But the most remarkable manifestation of these colours appears in my recollections of chronology. When I think of the events of a given century they invariably appear to me on a background coloured like the principal figure in the dates of that century; thus events of the eighteenth century invariably appear to me on a greenish ground, from the colour of the figure 7. This habit clings to me most tenaciously, and the only hypothesis I can form about its origin is the following:--My tutor, when I was ten to twelve years old, taught me chronology by means of a diagram on which the centuries were represented by squares, subdivided in 100 smaller squares; the squares representing centuries had narrow coloured borders; it may be that in this way the recollection of certain figures became associated with certain colours. I venture this explanation without attaching too much importance to it, because it seems to me that if it was true, my direct recollection of those coloured borders would have been stronger than it is; still, the strong association of my chronology with colour seems to plead in favour of that explanation." ...|$|E
