500|$|Once Denmark's {{principal}} fishing port, the Port of Esbjerg {{is still}} a driving force for the town's economy. While it {{has a long history}} of ferry services to England, the town is by no means a tourist destination. Lonely Planet remarked that [...] "nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday, in fact, as with many industrial ports, most visitors rush through as quickly as possible". Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark's oil and offshore activities, with companies like Maersk, Ramboll, Stimwell Services, ABB, Schlumberger, COWI and Atkins all having offshore-related activities in the town. Halliburton has an office in Esbjerg. The port has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas were first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s. More recently, it has become a centre for shipping offshore wind turbines. In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines, which supply [...] of offshore wind <b>power,</b> <b>components</b> have been shipped to various British wind farms. In order to cope with enormous future increases in Danish offshore wind power, 12 companies, including DONG Energy and Bluewater Energy Services are already planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg. In connection with this, in June 2013, the port was significantly expanded with the opening of the Østhavn (East Harbour), covering an area of [...]|$|E

30|$|As seen in Section  2, the FOR of a TPGS or WPGS {{is needed}} to {{calculate}} the expected tidal or wind power output in their chronological model. As mentioned in Introduction, a TPGS or WPGS includes a power electronic converter {{in addition to a}} generator and other components. The mean FOR values of generators and other mechanical or electrical components can be easily estimated from statistical records and do not change over time. However, the failure rates of the <b>power</b> electronic <b>components</b> depend on its voltage, junction temperature and other factors [21, 22]. The junction temperature, as the main factor affecting the failure rate of the <b>power</b> electronic <b>components,</b> is related to its power loss, which is determined by the electric current flowing through the component. The electric current is determined by the power output of the generator unit (wind or tidal), which varies with time. A reliability model of <b>power</b> electronic <b>components</b> associated with junction temperature, power loss and voltage is presented in this section. By calculating the power loss of <b>power</b> electronic <b>components,</b> the junction temperature can be estimated. Therefore, the junction temperature related failure rates of the <b>power</b> electronic <b>component</b> can be estimated.|$|R
