40|$|During {{the last}} years, an {{increasing}} number of newly arrived children and youth have arrived in Sweden from other continents. This migration constitutes, for the Swedish society, a new form of mobility, and challenges some of the established child protection systems constructed for acting within the geographical framework of the nation state. The taken for granted assumptions made by these institutions concerning their <b>protective</b> <b>task</b> and role, are questioned by the existence of children and youth, who assume an independent role and use mobility in their effort to improve their life project. In the project, we are studying how unaccompanied minors and young people describe their encounters with the protection systems in Sweden, and the institutionalized responses of these systems. We are especially interested of how the educational system deals with these challenges, and will therefore especially look at how child mobility is perceived and incorporated in the daily schoolwork and how children use mobility in their daily school lives...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{information}} security has been approached {{in terms of}} how to achieve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. In this paper, we seek to ontologically examine {{information security}} by using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s philosophical concepts of machine, coupling, interruption, and territory. Through these concepts, we conceptualize information security as an order-seeking, connection-based, territorial security machine that attempts to subject and harness other actors – from technical devices and physical barriers to employees and various combinations of these actors – to carry out the security machine’s <b>protective</b> <b>tasks.</b> The goal of the security machine is to block or interrupt the chaotic forces of the outside and, thus, to maintain the fragile order of information. However, the process of interrupting the outside requires interruption of the inside as well: users and organizations are interrupted daily by the security machine and its practices. Yet this aspect of information security has remained largely unexamined. We argue that the question of what information security does to its subjects – what its effects are – in the protected system should be examined more thoroughly...|$|R

A comparison {{was made}} between forestations of Atlas cedar, Douglas fir and Calabrian pine {{realized in the}} mid- 70 s {{of the last century}} with identical modalities and in the same station conditions, in the Presila of Cosenza. The results achieved by the plantations must be considered, according to their main aim that was concerned with the fulfilments of essentially <b>protective</b> <b>tasks,</b> definitely positive. The data relating the rates of take and mortality through the years confirm the great ability to colonise and to form thick and pure crops on behalf of the calabrian pine, while the incremental ones emphasise the Douglas fir as a species with a quicker growth. The densities does not allow, in the test areas, the regeneration to assert itself. Surveyings on the phytosanitary state of the forest stands do not evidence, in the test areas, symptoms of suffering, while the margin plants in the warm slopes of the pine-wood strongly turn out exposed to the processionary attacks. The more important requirement, for the investigated crops, is represented by the carrying-out of silvicultural cuttings, which aim at: regulating their thickness and structure, increasing their biological stability, creating favourable conditions for their renaturalization. </strong...|$|R

Past {{research has shown that}} protective clothing interferes with manual materials handling tasks, medical tasks, and manual dexterity tasks. However, little information exists regarding how <b>protective</b> clothing affects <b>task</b> performance with wearable input devices. As a result, a study was conducted to address this issue and offer recommendations to enhance the compatibility of chemical protective clothing and wearable input devices. Sixteen active-duty soldiers performed a text-entry task with a wearable mouse and touch pad, while bare handed, wearing 7 -mil, 14 -mil, and 25 -mil chemical protective gloves, wearing a respirator alone, and wearing the respirator and each of three gloves. Upon completion of the experiment, participants rated task difficulty, confidence using the input device, and input device preference. Task completion times were 9 % slower with the 25 -mil glove than the 7 -mil glove.

40|$|Biomathematical {{modeling}} {{has become}} an important tool to assess xenobiotic exposure in humans. In the present study, {{we have used a}} human physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and an simple compartmental toxicokinetic model of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) kinetics and its 3 -hydroxybenzo(a) pyrene (3 -OHBaP) metabolite to reproduce the time-course of this biomarker of exposure in the urine of industrially exposed workers and in turn predict the most plausible exposure scenarios. The models were constructed from in vivo experimental data in rats and then extrapolated from animals to humans after assessing and adjusting the most sensitive model parameters as well as species specific physiological parameters. Repeated urinary voids from workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been collected {{over the course of a}} typical workweek and during subsequent days off work; urinary concentrations of 3 -OHBaP were then determined. Based on the information obtained for each worker (BaP air concentration, daily shift hours, <b>tasks,</b> <b>protective</b> equipment), the time courses of 3 -OHBaP in the urine of the different workers have been simulated using the PBPK and toxicokinetic models, considering the various possible exposure routes, oral, dermal and inhalation. Both models were equally able to closely reproduce the observed time course of 3 -OHBaP in the urine of workers and predicted similar exposure scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios suggest that the workers under study were exposed mainly by the dermal route. Comparison of measured air concentration levels of BaP with simulated values needed to obtain a good approximation of observed time course further pointed out that inhalation was not the main route of exposure for most of the studied workers. Both kinetic models appear as a useful tool to interpret biomonitoring data of PAH exposure on the basis of 3 -OHBaP levels...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that neutralizing Mabs that bind to the HIV- 1 Env glycoprotein are more specific reagents than anti-HIV- 1 polyclonal antisera and that {{knowledge of the}} structure of these Mabs facilitates the rational design of effective HIV- 1 vaccine immunogens. However, after more than ten years of unsuccessful experimentation using the structure-based reverse vaccinology approach, it is now evident that {{it is not possible to}} infer from the structure of neutralizing Mabs which HIV immunogens induced their formation nor which vaccine immunogens will elicit similar Abs in an immunized host. The use of Mabs for developing an HIV- 1 vaccine was counterproductive because it overlooked the fact that the apparent specificity of a Mab very much depends on the selection procedure used to obtain it and also did not take into account that an antibody is never monospecific for a single epitope but is always polyspecific for many epitopes. When the rationale of the proponents of the unsuccessful rational design strategy is analyzed, it appears that investigators who claim they are designing a vaccine immunogen are only improving the binding reactivity of a single epitope-paratope pair and are not actually designing an immunogen able to generate <b>protective</b> antibodies. The <b>task</b> of a designer consists in imagining what type of immunogen is likely to elicit a protective immune response but in the absence of knowledge regarding which features of the immune system are responsible for producing a functional neutralizing activity in antibodies, it is not feasible to intentionally optimize a potential immunogen candidate in order to obtain the desired outcome. The only available option is actually to test possible solutions by trial-and-error experiments until the preset goal is perhaps attained. Rational design and empirical approaches in HIV vaccine research should thus not be opposed as alternative options since empirical testing is an integral part of a so-called design strategy...|$|R
40|$|In the {{expatriate}} management literature, {{studies have}} rarely moved beyond examining maladjustment {{as a primary}} reason for expatriate failure. This thesis proposes that an expatriate’s idiosyncratic and subjective belief of the employer’s failure to fulfill {{one or more of}} its perceived obligations, referred to as psychological contract breach (PCB), has significant bearing on expatriate failure. Although there is a plethora of studies on the attitudinal and behavioural aftermath of an employee’s perception of PCB, {{there are a number of}} shortcomings in this body of research and limited knowledge of how expatriate employees, in particular, respond to a perception of PCB. As such, this thesis set out with the aim of exploring the underlying theoretical process through which perceived PCB affects expatriates’ job performance and turnover intentions, which are the key constituents of expatriate failure examined in this study. The goal was to develop and empirically examine a model that clarifies the process of the effects of expatriate-perceived PCB. To achieve this goal, a mixed methods research was undertaken, with two studies carried out sequentially to investigate the proposed conceptual model and research hypotheses. The initial qualitative study explored the experiences of and varying reactions to PCB through semi-structured interviews with 18 expatriate employees based in Malaysia. The data revealed many of the hypothesised reactions captured in the conceptual model as well as new ones that had not been previously anticipated, such as the sensemaking cue of attribution of intentionality and the behavioural outcomes of professional performance and counterproductive work behaviour. Furthermore, the data provided interesting insights regarding expatriates’ tendency to withdraw professional performance and engage in counterproductive work behaviour, rather than neglect task performance, in response to PCB. Different work motivations – intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, and external regulation – emerged from the data as <b>protective</b> buffers of <b>task</b> performance against PCB. The subsequent quantitative study used the information from the qualitative inquiry to revise the conceptual model, which was then tested in a cross-sectional survey of 253 expatriates in Asia. While conventional understanding is that PCB is typically reciprocated negatively by employees, the current research showed that PCB and ensuing feelings of psychological contract violation were both positively and negatively related to expatriates’ work engagement, task performance, professional performance, counterproductive work behaviour, and turnover intention. The direction of these relationships largely depended on expatriates’ perceptions of PCB as uncommon versus the norm. Positive conative and behavioural consequences existed when PCB was strongly perceived as common, typical, or expected. Negative conative and behavioural outcomes ensued when PCB was believed to uncommon, unexpected, or surprising. These findings imply that PCB may not always result in detrimental expatriate behaviour, in contrast to what has been suggested in the extant PCB literature on employees working on home soil. Together, contextual factors in sensemaking, especially ‘the perceived norm of breach’, and motivational states play a critical role in shaping positive or negative expatriate behaviour, following PCB. The contributions to research and implications for practice are discussed against the backdrop of the study’s limitations...|$|R

This report also presents additional information regarding the recommended community interventions, briefly describes how the reviews were conducted, provides resources for further information, and provides information that can help in applying the interventions locally. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force conducted a systematic review of counseling by primary care clinicians to prevent skin cancer (CDC.

MMWR 2003; 52 [No. RR- 15]: 13 - 17), which is also included in this issue, the first jointly released findings from the Task Force on Community Preventive Services and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. Counseling to prevent skin cancer : recommendations and rationale of the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. This statement summarizes the current U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on counseling to prevent skin cancer and the supporting scientific evidence, and updates the 1996 recommendation contained in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, Second Edition (U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. Screening for skin cancer. In: Guide to clinical preventive services, 2 nd ed. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996 : 141 - 52). The USPSTF finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine counseling by primary care clinicians to prevent skin cancer. Although counseling parents may increase children's use of sunscreen, the USPSTF found little evidence {{to determine the effects of}} counseling on the sun protection behaviors of adults. These behaviors include wearing protective clothing, reducing excessive sun exposure, avoiding sun lamps and tanning beds, or practicing skin self-examination. The USPSTF, an independent panel of private sector experts in primary care and prevention, systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness of a wide range of clinical preventive services, including screening tests, counseling, and chemoprevention.
