40|$|The hemodynamic and neurohumoral {{effects of}} cummulative {{intravenous}} doses of <b>piroximone</b> (MDL 19205), a noncatecholamine, nonglycoside, imidazole derivative with positive inotropic and vasodilating properties, were studied in eight patients with severe congestive heart failure. A dose of 1. 25 mg/kg in seven patients and 1. 75 mg/kg in one patient increased cardiac index by 75 % from 1. 96 to 3. 41 liters/min per m 2 and decreased systemic vascular resistance (− 41 %), right atrial (− 66 %) and pulmonary wedge pressure (− 35 %) (all p < 0. 005). Mean arterial pressure was slightly reduced from 78 to 71 mm Hg (p < 0. 05) and forearm blood flow increased by 42 %. Plasma norepinephrine decreased from 830 to 542 pg/ml (p < 0. 05) and plasma renin activity tended to increase. In four patients, dobutamine (15 μg/kg per min) produced a comparable increase in cardiac index (+ 100 %), but less decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (− 21 versus − 41 %, p < 0. 05 versus <b>piroximone)</b> and, unlike <b>piroximone,</b> significantly increased heart rate (+ 22 %, p < 0. 05 versus <b>piroximone)</b> and heart rate-blood pressure product (+ 30 %, p < 0. 01 versus <b>piroximone).</b> In four other patients, a single intravenous dose of <b>piroximone</b> (1 mg/kg) {{resulted in a}} 35 % increase in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) from 796 to 1, 068 mm Hg/s (p < 0. 01). Thus, <b>piroximone</b> is a potent inotropic agent with an acute hemodynamic profile {{that may be more}} favorable than that of dobutamine. Because the drug is orally absorbed, clinical trials of chronic efficacy are indicated...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} utility of <b>piroximone</b> (MDL- 19, 205), an investigational inotrope-vasodilator agent, in severe heart failure, 15 patients with severe left ventricular failure refractory to conventional agents {{were enrolled in}} an acute hemodynamic study. After incremental intravenous dosing (mean total dose 1. 8 ± 0. 4 mg/kg body weight), cardiac index increased (1. 7 ± 0. 3 to 2. 6 ± 0. 6 liters/min per m 2; p < 0. 001) and left ventricular filling pressure decreased (25 ± 7 to 19 ± 7 mm Hg; p < 0. 001). Also decreasing significantly were right atrial pressure (13 ± 6 to 7 ± 5 mm Hg; p < 0. 005) and systemic vascular resistance (1, 633 ± 394 to 1, 183 ± 278 dynes-s-cm− 5; p < 0. 001). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure did not change, whereas stroke work index increased significantly (13. 3 ± 4. 3 to 21. 6 ± 7. 3 g-hi/m 2; p < 0. 005). The increase in stroke work index with a concomitant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure indicates an improvement in systolic performance after treatment with <b>piroximone.</b> Similar responses were obtained after incremental doses of <b>piroximone</b> in oral solution. After oral doses of <b>piroximone</b> tablets, cardiac index also increased significantly (2. 1 ± 0. 6 to 2. 4 ± 0. 5 liters/min per m 2; p < 0. 05), although this magnitude of increase was comparatively low. In a subgroup of 10 patients who underwent equilibrium gated radionuclide blood pool scintigraphy before and after intravenous <b>piroximone,</b> end-diastolic volume index tended to increase (106 ± 42 to 132 ± 60 ml/m 2; p = 0. 07), whereas left ventricular filling pressure decreased significantly (26 ± 8 to 19 ± 9 mm Hg; p < 0. 01). This suggests an improvement in overall left ventricular distensibility after <b>piroximone</b> treatment. Of the original 15 patients, 9 died within 2 months of the hemodynamic study; 3 had therapy discontinued after 1 to 14 months because of side effects or lack of clinical improvement; and 3 are still alive and receiving oral <b>piroximone</b> after 24 to 27 months of follow-up. Thus, <b>piroximone</b> produces acute hemodynamic improvement even in patients with severe heart failure, but their prognosis remains poor...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{milrinone}} and <b>piroximone</b> {{were compared to}} those of isoprenaline, dibutyryl adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, increased extracellular calcium [(Ca 2 +]o) and caffeine in ferret right ventricular papillary muscles that were loaded intracellularly with aequorin, a bioluminescent calcium indicator that emits light when it combines with calcium. The positive inotropic action of each drug, except caffeine, was associated {{with an increase in}} the peak amplitude of the aequorin light signal (i. e. intracellular Ca 2 + transient) reflecting an increased amount of calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling; the positive inotropic effect of caffeine appears to occur by other mechanisms. The time courses of the aequorin light signal and corresponding tension response were shortened by isoprenaline, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, milrinone and piroximone; unchanged by increased [Ca 2 +]o and prolonged by caffeine, suggesting that the rates of Ca 2 + release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum were respectively increased, unchanged or decreased by these groups of drugs. Relative to changes in [Ca 2 +]o, the ratio of the peak of the aequorin light signal to the peak of the tension response was increased by isoprenaline, milrinone and <b>piroximone,</b> and decreased by caffeine, indicating that the Ca 2 +-sensitivity of the myofilaments was respectively decreased, and increased by these drugs. The effects of milrinone and <b>piroximone</b> on the amplitude and time course of the aequorin light signal, as they relate to changes in uptake and release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to changes in the sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca 2 +, are consistent with the findings that positive inotropic doses of these agents act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP. Higher doses of milrinone and <b>piroximone</b> produced negative inotropic effects that were characterized by diminution of developed tension but no change or an increase in the amplitude of the aequorin light signal, suggesting a decrease in the sensitivity of the contractile elements to Ca 2 +. Toxic doses of milrinone, <b>piroximone</b> and isoprenaline were associated with development of a Ca 2 +-overload state characterized by the presence of after-glimmers, after-contractions and dysrhythmias, and by decreased amplitude of both the aequorin light signal and tension response. The negative inotropic and toxic effects of milrinone and <b>piroximone</b> can be explained only in part by increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP; we suggest that these drugs may have other cardiac actions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} effects of <b>piroximone</b> (MDL 19, 205), a new inotropic agent, with {{dobutamine}} in dogs with congestnie heart failure. With dobutamine, (1 5 g/kg/min) left ventricular (LV) dp/dtincreasedfrom 2220 ± 215 (mean ± S. E. M.) to 2815 ± 280 mm Hg/sec and cardiac index increased from 2. 9 ± 0. 2 to 3. 7 ± 0. 4 liters/min/m, whereas LV filling pressure was essentially unchanged (18. 7 ± 2. 6 - 16. 3 ± 2. 4 mm Hg). The hemodynarnic effects of <b>piroximone</b> (50 g/kg/min) were more pronounced. LV dp/dt increased from 2615 ± 260 to 3760 ± 410 mm Hg 1 sec and cardiac index from 3. 0 ± 0. 1 to 4. 4 ± 0. 6 liters/mm/rn, whereas LV filling pressure decreased from 15. 6 ± 2. 4 to 6. 4 ± 1. 8 mm Hg (all P <. 05).

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>piroximone</b> (PI) {{were determined}} {{in patients with}} renal failure (inulin clearance less than 50 ml min- 1 per 1. 73 m 2) using two protocols: (a) 10 patients received a single i. v. infusion of 0. 5 mg kg- 1 PI and the data were compared with those from seven healthy subjects receiving the same regimen; (b), a single oral dose of either 25 or 50 mg PI was given to 20 patients. PI concentrations were assayed by h. p. l. c. in plasma and urine over 48 h. After i. v. administration to healthy subjects PI was distributed rapidly and eliminated with a mean half-life of 1. 3 +/- 0. 2 h. The urinary recovery of unchanged PI was 64 % of the dose. In the patients the extent of renal elimination of PI was decreased (- 78 %) {{in relation to the}} degree of renal insufficiency as assessed by inulin clearance (r = 0. 97, P < 0. 0001). Mean Cmax, AUC and t 1 / 2,z values after i. v. infusion were increased by 47 %, 127 % and 77 %, respectively, in comparison with healthy subjects. Similar results were obtained after oral administration. Until chronic dosing studies are undertaken, PI dosage should be adapted in relation to renal function...|$|E
