The results confirmed the strong SOS inducing activity of 2 -aminoanthracene and benzo[a]pyrene with metabolic activation and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C and 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide without metabolic activation. A weaker response {{in the absence of}} microsomal enzymes was observed with hydroxyurea (only at high doses) and the soluble Cr(VI) compounds potassium chromate and potassium dichromate. No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, <b>chromium</b> chloride, <b>chromium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate. Among the Cr(III) compounds only chromium acetate produced a low but significant increase of SOS inducing activity. Solubilization by nitrilotriacetate of genotoxic Cr(VI) from insoluble lead chromate was observed, whereas no interaction occurred between nitrilotriacetate and the soluble Cr(VI) and Cr(III) compounds. Using urinary XAD- 2 extracts, we found the SOS Chromotest poorly sensitive to the mutagens present in urine from tobacco smokers which, on the other hand, were detected by the gene mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). A urine sample obtained from a psoriatic patient, therapeutically treated with mineral coal tar, had a significant SOS inducing activity with and even without metabolic activation, whereas in the Ames test it was active only in the presence of metabolic activation. These results indicate that the SOS Chromotest, although poorly sensitive to urinary mutagens, could detect genotoxic compounds different from those detected by the Salmonella/microsome assay...|$|R

Material and Methods The experiment was performed on 40 male Wistar rats which received, by gavage, during 90 days, a <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in either a daily dose of 400, 600 or 800 µg/kg BW. At the end of experiment, the rats were scanned using the densitometry method (DXA) to determine the bone mineral density, bone mineral content of total skeleton and vertebral column (L 2 -L 4) and parameters of body composition (Lean Mass and Fat Mass). The isolated femora were scanned using peripheral a quantitative computed tomography method (pQCT) for a separate analysis of the trabecular and cortical bone tissue. The ultimate strength, work to ultimate and the Young modulus of femora was also investigated by the three-point bending test. Results The negative impact of chromium was observed in relation to bone tissue. All doses significantly decreased total skeleton density and mineral content, and also had impact upon the isolated femora and vertebral column. Trabecular volumetric bone mineral density and trabecular bone mineral content measured by pQCT in distal femur metaphysis were significantly lower in the experimental groups than in the control. Higher doses of chromium also significantly decreased values of ultimate strength and Young modulus in the investigated femora. Conclusions The results of the experiment demonstrate that <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is dose dependent, and exerts a disadvantageous effect on the skeleton, as it decreases bone density and resistance...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was concerned with}} the concentration of residual chromium tanning liquor by evaporative techniques and the re-use of this concentrated chromium liquor for tannage after adjustment with a makeup of basic <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> powder. Twelve samples of the residual chromium liquors were collected randomly from ALNASR and the White Nile Tanneries. They were analysed mainly for Cr 2 o 3 content, concentration of neutral salts (0 Be) and (PH). The average quantity of chromium oxide "Cr 2 o 3 " for both tanneries which discharged as waste to the drain {{was found to be}} 5. 58 g/L. This quantity is equivalent to 32 % of the chromic oxide added {{at the beginning of the}} tannage. This mean, that more or less one third of the basic <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> used in tannage is lost as waste. Then two Evaporation experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery laboratory by direct heating to determine the optimum evaporation level for maximum chromium oxide recovery. This level of evaporation was found to be about 27 % of the water, can be evaporated without much loss of chromium oxide. Then Eight tanning Experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery pilot plant in the following manner:- A residual chrome liquor (R 1) was taken from the White Nile tannery and it was evaporated to the required level (C 1). Then the chromium oxide in (C 1) was determined and was adjusted with fresh chromium powder to maintain the tanning percentage to 7 %. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. The residual liquor(R 2) from (C 1) was again evaporated to (C 2). Then the chromium oxide in (C 2) was determined and adjusted to the required level with fresh chromium powder. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. This process was repeated eight times untill (C 8) and (R 9). The average quantity of basic <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> required to be added as a make-up was found to be 4. 9 %. That means 2. 1 % of basic <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is saved all through the year, in addition to the following savings:- 1) 4 % in the sodium chloride 2) 60 - 70 % in the water 3) 0. 1 - 0. 2 % in the sulphuric Acid Then four pelts tanned with (C 8), (C 7), (C 6) plus one side from the White Nile Tannery were retanned as usual and they were paste- Dried. Then they were tested for their physical and chemical properties and the results obtained were found to be within the accepted international limits. The economical evaluation of the project was found to be feasible. The annual profit was found to be 33767 US$ and the pay-back period was found to be about 1. 3 year.

For the establishment of sorption isotherms, solutions were prepared at 1 : 10 in volume. Air dried samples of 5. 0 cm 3 of each class of soil were placed in triplicates in beakers of 250. 0 cm 3. A solution containing 50. 0 cm 3 of the potentially toxic metal was added to solution. The solutions were prepared in CaCl 2. (2 H 2 O) (0. 01 mol. L- 1) as electrolyte support and employing the basic <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a source of metal. Adjustments were made to the polynomial regression between the concentrations of potentially toxic levels of metal contaminants in the solution depending on the concentration of metal in the filtered solution after equilibrium. The Quartzipsamment showed lower retention compared to other classes of soils. Therefore it is more vulnerable to groundwater contamination if industrial wastes containing trivalent chromium are used as fertilizer...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A {{component is}} connected as a cathode and immersed in a catholyte comprising chromium (III) salt(s) and compound(s) stabilizing chromium (II) ions. An anolyte comprising a Bronsted acid is separated from the catholyte by an anion-selective membrane. Measuring device(s) is used for continuously monitoring the deviation in pH from a preset value, and controller(s) is used for adjusting the pH to the preset value by automated addition of acid or base. Chromium layers are deposited using the above-mentioned arrangement. The chromium (III) salt is ammonium <b>chromium</b> alum, <b>potassium</b> <b>chromium</b> alum, chromium chloride, and/or chromium sulfate. The stabilizing compound is amino acid, urea, aliphatic, aromatic-aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic amine and/or amide. Boric acid/borate, citric acid/citrate, aluminum 3 +/aluminum sulfate, oxalic acid/oxalate, and/or tartaric acid/tartarate are added as buffer substance to the catholyte for buffering the pH of catholyte. Anionic and/or neutral surfactants chosen from sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyethylene glycol, diisohexyl sulfosuccinate, 2 -ethylhexyl sulfate, diisobutyl sulfosuccinate, diisoamyl sulfosuccinate, and isodecyl sulfosuccinate are added as wetting agent to the catholyte. The anolyte contains sulfuric acid. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for electroplating bath. USE - Deposition of chromium layers for protection against wear/corrosion, or for use as decorative chrome plating, is used for producing hard-chrome surfaces (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method forms chrome surfaces having high hardness. Mixing of anolyte with catholyte is prevented by anion exchange membrane...|$|R

The behaviour of dissolution of mineral elements into different tinctures and aqueous extracts obtained from Solidaginis herba was investigated in connection with their quercetin glycoside and organic acid amount. Commonly applied aqueous and alcoholic extracts were analysed for Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Ti, V and Zn content. The concentrations of the minerals examined were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Determination of the flavonoids in solidaginis herba and extracts was carried out by a spectrophotometric method, as required by the German Pharmacopoea. For the study of the flavonoid composition of crude drug, the HPLC technique was applied. To determine the relative nutrient contribution of these pharmaceuticals to the diet, data obtained were combined with flavonoid content particulars, then a comparison with U. S Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) was made. For evaluation of the phytotherapeutic relevance, k/Na ratio was also calculated. It has been found that the pharmaceuticals examined are important sources of <b>potassium,</b> <b>chromium,</b> manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and lower sources of iron and zinc, assuming a daily intake of 1 - 2 l aqueous extracts as recommended for urological diseases. Flavonoid content of the different Solidaginis herba extracts ranged from 62. 4 mg l- 1 to 305. 2 mg l- 1...|$|R
