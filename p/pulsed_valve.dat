30|$|We {{emphasize}} that our findings do not qualify or disqualify <b>pulsed</b> <b>valves</b> {{not used in}} this study. The experiments presented here {{do not include the}} latest developed piezo activated valves [44] or solenoid valves, for instance. Ultimately, optimally engineered <b>pulsed</b> <b>valves</b> should basically all give the same results: the beam is determined by the very fast opening and closing of the orifice, through which the gas should flow into vacuum unrestrictedly. This requires a fast actuator, that displaces sufficiently far to ensure unrestricted flow. In this respect, the movement of a very light strip with the strong Lorentz force, as used in an NPV, meets this requirement at low levels of power dissipation.|$|R

40|$|The {{quadrupole}} {{ion trap}} is commonly operated with a constant background pressure of an inert, {{low molecular weight}} buffer gas. This inclusion of a buffer gas {{has been shown to}} increase the sensitivity and mass resolution of the instrument. Research to gain an understanding of these effects, both experimental and through simulations, has typically assumed that it is optimal to maintain a constant buffer gas pressure throughout the entire experiment This article describes the effects of the pulsed introduction of buffer gas at strategic points within the analytical scan and evaluates those events during which the presence of buffer gas is critical. By incorporating a <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> within the ion trap manifold, both the presence and pressure of the buffer gas can be controlled and varied during the individual steps of the scan. The presence of helium buffer gas just before the ion ejection and detection event showed a greater increase in intensity of the ion signal {{than at any other time}} in the analytical scan. In addition, this increase in intensity upon pulsed introduction of buffer gas prior to detection is constant over a wide range of <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> open times (i. e., pressures), whereas the signal enhancement upon pulsed introduction of the buffer gas before ionization is observed only over a narrow range of <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> open times.

30|$|A Stark or Zeeman {{decelerator}} {{selects a}} portion of the initial molecular beam pulse, and transfers this portion to the desired final velocity keeping the phase-space density in the selected bunch constant [28]. In this respect, the decelerator acts as a filter, in principle leaving the part of the beam that is not selected to propagate freely. The quality of the bunch of molecules exiting the decelerator therefore critically depends on the parameters of the initial molecular beam pulse and the <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> used. Several molecular beam sources are used in laboratories around the world {{as a starting point for}} deceleration experiments. Some of them are home-built, others are commercially available. Frequently used valves include the piezo activated valve [29], General Valve, Jordan Valve, Even-Lavie Valve [30], and more recently the Nijmegen <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Valve</b> [31]. Their opening mechanisms and technical sophistication are equally diverse as their performance, availability and purchasing cost.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLaser desorption/ionization {{combined}} with Fourier transform ion cylcotron resonance mass spectrometry (LD/FT/ICR/MS) is a proven technique {{for the analysis}} of nonvolatile materials. Unfortunately, LD tends to produce a large excess of neutral species compared to ions. Laser desorption followed by chemical ionization (LD/CI) by use of a reagent gas is a selective and sensitive means of control in the analysis of nonvolatile compounds. In this article we demonstrate the technique of ammonia LD/CI by addition of a small amount of ammonium bromide (NH 4 Br) to an involatile sample, i. e., the ammonium salt is used in place of ammonia reagent gas. For various aromatic hydrocarbons, abundant (M + H) + ions are produced as a result of CI. A primary advantage of this method in FT/ICR/MS is that selective LD/CI experiments may be conducted at low pressure as in <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> CI (but without the need for <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> operation), thereby providing the potential for obtaining high-resolution FT/ICR mass spectra...|$|E

30|$|Because {{the goal}} of this fairly {{complicated}} experiment is to obtain highly detailed information on complex (chemical) processes it is crucial to carefully select and design the individual components of the apparatus. The key components in this type of setup are the beam sources, the atom/molecule guides, and the detection method. Our goal when developing the merged beam method was to find a way that would allow us to obtain fundamental information on molecular scattering dynamics and to study astrochemically relevant reactions. Of the relevant molecules in interstellar space many are paramagnetic and/or polar. Incidentally, these are the properties that are also required for the guiding of molecules using electric or magnetic fields. Our plan thus became to produce supersonic expansions of the reactants, using <b>pulsed</b> <b>valves</b> and discharge sources, and bend the resulting beams onto a given axis, using magnetic and electric guides. Because we expected the discharge sources to be rather messy and possibly not very selective, we decided to use two guides which would simplify the purification of the beams prior to the collision studies.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{experimental}} method {{has been developed}} to probe ion/molecule reactions at gas pressures up to 0. 1 torr. A Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer has been constructed to trap ions within the trapped ion cell at these pressures for time intervals up to several hundred milliseconds, allowing the ions to undergo several million collisions. Multiple <b>pulsed</b> <b>valves</b> inject the gaseous reagents in brief, high pressure bursts. A unique, high conductance vacuum chamber rapidly reduces the gas pressure from as high as 0. 01 torr to near background pressures in 2 – 5 s for optimum operation of the FTICR for identifying the ionic products. A pressure of 0. 1 torr is attainable but results in slower gas evacuation. High pressure operation of this instrument is demonstrated for ion chemistry in silane, argon, and silicon tetrafluoride. Pressures are sufficiently high to allow termolecular formation of adducts with the trapped ion cell. Negative ion formation in silane has greatly improved efficiency due to the high pressure ionization.

YCH 2 + H 2, has been measured in crossed molecular beam scattering. Under isoenergetic conditions where the sum of available vibrational and translational energy is held constant, the vibrationally excited state is at least 2. 2 times more reactive than the ground state. The mid-infrared light source used to excite the methane is an Nd:YAGpumped pulsed optical parametric oscillator/amplifier seeded with a continuous wave laser diode in the near infrared. The OPO/OPA system has an overall quantum efficiency of greater than 0. 25 when using 350 mJ/pulse of pump light. The light source also includes a self-drilled vacuum spatial filter for the pump beam, enabling it {{to be used with}} pump lasers exhibiting structured beam profiles.

30|$|These {{limitations}} were overcome when pulsed gas sources {{became available}} [10 – 16]. If the gas pulse is short enough (shorter than a typical molecular reflection {{time from the}} walls of the vacuum chamber), and if the repetition rate is low enough to so that the mean gas pressure is less than 10 − 5 mbars in the source chamber, then the gas expands without hindrance, and no structured shock waves interfere with the jet propagation. Much smaller turbo-molecular pumps (300 – 500  l/sec) can now be used for low repetition rate experiments (10 - 50 Hz), while bigger pumps (3000  l/sec) are still required for higher repetition rates (1 – 5 KHz) <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve</b> systems.

40|$|Gas-phase {{molecular}} physics and physical chemistry experiments commonly use supersonic expansions through <b>pulsed</b> <b>valves</b> {{for the production}} of cold molecular beams. However, these beams often contain multiple conformers and clusters, even at low rotational temperatures. We present an experimental methodology that allows the spatial separation of these constituent parts of a molecular beam expansion. Using an electric deflector the beam is separated by its mass-to-dipole moment ratio, analogous to a bender or an electric sector mass spectrometer spatially dispersing charged molecules {{on the basis of their}} mass-to-charge ratio. This deflector exploits the Stark effect in an inhomogeneous electric field and allows the separation of individual species of polar neutral molecules and clusters. It furthermore allows the selection of the coldest part of a molecular beam, as low-energy rotational quantum states generally experience the largest deflection. Different structural isomers (conformers) of a species can be separated due to the different arrangement of functional groups, which leads to distinct dipole moments. These are exploited by the electrostatic deflector {{for the production of}} a conformationally pure sample from a molecular beam. Similarly, specific cluster stoichiometries can be selected, as the mass and dipole moment of a given cluster depends on the degree of solvation around the parent molecule. This allows experiments on specific cluster sizes and structures, enabling the systematic study of solvation of neutral molecules. ...|$|R

Common wisdom in molecular beam production methods may not automatically apply to Stark deceleration experiments. The use of your favorite <b>pulsed</b> <b>valve,</b> although performing well in other molecular beam environments, should be carefully considered. For instance, in most deceleration experiments the carrier gases Kr and Xe must be used to reduce the initial speed of the beam. Under specific conditions, however, these gases are known to produce clusters in the supersonic expansion, and some valves may perform poorly with these carrier gases.

40|$|THE {{inductive}} pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) is an electrodeless space propulsion device where {{a capacitor}} is charged to an initial voltage and then discharged producing a high current pulse through a coil. The field produced by this pulse ionizes propellant, inductively driving current in a plasma {{located near the}} face of the coil. Once the plasma is formed it can be accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity by the electromagnetic Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the induced plasma current and the magnetic field produced by the current in the coil. In the present work, we present a summary of the IPPT research and development conducted at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). As a higher-power, still relatively low readiness level system, there are many issues associated with the eventual deployment and use of the IPPT as a primary propulsion system on spacecraft that remain to be addressed.

Previous cell experiments conducted up to 900 K in a binary H 2 -H 2 O mixture show that for the hydrogen Q-branch lines there exists significant broadening and its dependence on temperature and rotational quantum number [3, 4]. In order to obtain line-broadening data for higher temperatures and densities we propose to use a high pressure pulsed H 2 -O 2 burner.
