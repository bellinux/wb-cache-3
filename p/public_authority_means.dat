40|$|Social {{accountability}} in public organizations has significantly {{evolved in the}} last 20 years. In Italy, the Government and institutional bodies fostered this process by publishing social accountability standards and guidelines for local governments. However, further research is still needed to understand if and how these administrations are using such tools to disseminate their social performances’ results. Are social reports actually used by Italian <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> as <b>means</b> to deliver social accountability? This paper is aimed at highlighting the evolution and current social reporting practices within the Italian public sector. The analysis focuses on a sample of 51 Italian local governments over a 15 -year time span. The sample includes municipalities with more than 100 thousand inhabitants and regional capital cities. The empirical analysis reveals that social reporting practices differ significantly in terms of formal structure, content and communication strength. Also, it seems that many local governments are unaware {{of the importance of}} social reporting, which is performed only on an occasional basis and differs from criteria set for public accountability...|$|R

40|$|At present, the {{elaboration}} of budgets at any level {{is a real problem}} especially due to the need of respecting the budget balance principle, since the need for financial resources is greater than the existing funds necessary for a good development of the economic activites. Consequently, by this work, the authors deal with aspects concerning the general framework and procedures of creation, administration, commission and use of the local public funds, and the responsibilities of the local <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> and of the public institutions involved in the domain of local public finances. The paper deals, on the level of an administrative-territorial unit with a number of about 20. 000 inhabitants, with the aggregate budget revenues and expenses that make up the general budget of the respective unit, after consolidation, by the elimination of the transfers of sums between budgets, reflecting the dimension of the public financial effort, on the level of the year 2016 and its state of balance or imbalance. To analyze the data, the authors realized a case study regarding the evolution of the local budget revenues and expenses, at a public entity of Hunedoara County, the results obtained being analyzed and interpreted under the economic and social aspect. The overall objective of this study refers to the possibility of strengthening the operational and financial autonomy of the administrative-territorial unit and the local budget. Although at the national level, the laws necessary for the budget system operation were elaborated on the principle of local autonomy, however, at the level of administrative units we cannot yet speak of the existence of a real local autonomy, whereas the revenues of the local budgets are not sufficient to cover the expense level. The paper ends with the authors’ conclusions related to the need to increase the financial resources mobilized available to the local <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> by <b>means</b> of the local budgets, in order to realize the local autonomy - an essential objective of the reform in local public administration...|$|R

The policy implication is that the current greater resort to contracts in which the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> retains all demand risk may not be optimal in terms of allocative efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The current {{document}} {{provides the}} final {{guidelines for the}} Contribution of Social Media in Crisis Management (COSMIC) project. The guidelines aim to enhance the safety and security of citizens by supporting both citizens, and <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> {{in their use of}} social media to complement their crisis management efforts. The increased use of social media, in both day-to-day situations and during crisis situations has led to new opportunities with regard to crisis management. Within the current guidelines we refer to social media applications including: social networking sites, crowdsourcing applications, web-based tools and mobile applications where social media related techniques are incorporated. Advances in the use of these tools have led to barriers and challenges for the ‘better use’ of these tools by citizens and public organisations alike. Consequently, the COSMIC project has sought to support the ‘best use’ of social media during crises in a responsible and effective manner. To do so, COSMIC has developed a set of key principles, what we refer to as ‘AID’, to be followed: 	Acknowledging the fact that civil society can be trusted; 	Increasing the ability of civil society to take responsibility for further guarding its own well-being; 	Developing the capacities of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> for adapting to social media use by civil society. In accordance with the AID principles the COSMIC guidelines are split into two sets of tips and tricks for <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> and for members of the <b>public.</b> By <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> we <b>mean</b> those governmental organizations that carry a prime responsibility for crisis management as well as those organisations that do not focus on crisis management, but that have a responsibility for crisis management in their own domain (e. g., Civil Society Organisations). Although not within the focus of this first set of tips and tricks, other organizations that find themselves involved in crisis management activities {{will be able to use}} these tips and tricks as well. The second set of tips and tricks applies to civil society; citizens. The central starting point for the tips and tricks for <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> is that they should adapt to existing social media use in civil society. Furthermore, they should be aware of avoiding the temptation to ‘reinvent the wheel’. The following structure is used to present the tips and tricks: Pre-Crisis - Develop a social media policy and strategy. Crisis - Monitor and adapt to emergent initiatives on social media. Post-Crisis - Direct people to aftercare initiatives and seek feedback. The central starting point for the tips and tricks for citizens is the fact that civil society can be trusted during crises. Past crises have shown that citizens are self-resilient and undertake different kind of activities to aid themselves and others in crisis situations. The COSMIC tips and tricks are formulated to encompass these findings so that citizens can gain insight in how to use social media during crises in a responsible and effective way. The following structure is used to present the tips and tricks for citizens in the different roles they can have: Preparing - Participate in disaster education and training programmes Seeking aid - Ask for help and disclose your location. Seeking information - Verify information and ensure information is trustworthy. Providing aid - Participate in the flow of information and the sense making of data. Mobilizing - Create and stimulate networks. Recording and sharing - Ensure a broad scope and consider your communication venue. The guidelines are based on information and knowledge collected and presented throughout the COSMIC project. The data on crises, and the use of social media therein, has been collected through a combination of methods such as desk-based research, content analysis, literature reviews, case studies and surveys. Furthermore various stakeholders, such as emergency response crews, law enforcement representatives, citizen journalists, and social activists have been engaged with throughout the COSMIC project to provide their feedback on the (working) documents, providing a review of the content and the relevance of the results...|$|R

50|$|New York {{state public}} benefit {{corporations}} and authorities operate like quasi-private corporations, with {{boards of directors}} appointed by elected officials, overseeing both publicly operated and privately operated systems. <b>Public</b> <b>authorities</b> share characteristics with government agencies, but they are exempt from many state and local regulations. Of particular importance, they can issue their own debt, allowing them to bypass limits on state debt contained in the New York State Constitution. This allows <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without directly putting the credit of New York State or its municipalities on the line. As a result, <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> have become widely used for financing public works, and they are now responsible for more than 90% of the state's debt. The growing influence of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> over state and local financing, coupled with their ability to avoid regulations applicable to government agencies, has led to calls for reform.

40|$|This paper uses a {{systematic}} literature review {{to suggest that}} three emerging critical approaches {{to the production of}} <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are identifiable within the contemporary literature on conflict-affected and transitioning regions. The authors term these approaches the ‘public authority from below perspective’, the ‘hybrid political orders lens’, and ‘political settlements analysis’. Although hailing from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, the paper argues that these approaches share important traits. First, they suggest that to understand better the nature of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in transitioning and conflict-affected regions it is necessary to uncover how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> actually works rather than departing from a theory of the state. This includes accounting for how power is legitimated and practiced within each context, and how claims to <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are connected to the provision of public goods such as security and justice. Second, they view competition, conflict and contestation as enduring features of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in such contexts, and call for empirical examinations of these processes to inform understandings of social change. Third, these approaches argue that <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is an emergent property, always in production and never definitively formed. This implies that neat dichotomies such as formal/informal, private/public, and modern/traditional should be applied with caution by analysts seeking to understand <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from the perspective of people living with insecurity and change. Despite these similarities, the paper's conclusion suggests that these approaches should be unpacked and their normative assumptions challenged. Each can then be drawn upon to arrive at empirical understandings of how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is produced and exercised, and how it relates to the provision of public goods in conflict-affected and transitioning regions...|$|R
