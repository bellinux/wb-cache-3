5|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> on the GCR {{was never}} heavy {{because it was}} the last main line to be built and had {{difficulty}} competing against longer-established rivals (especially the Midland Railway from its terminal at St Pancras) for the lucrative intercity passenger business. Low <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> meant Marylebone was the quietest and most pleasant of London's termini. The GCR was unhappy about having to use part of the Metropolitan Railway's route to reach Marylebone, and opened a new line to High Wycombe on 2 April 1906. The additional suburban services generated traffic for the station, which had previously been so empty on occasion that the staff outnumbered passengers. While <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> remained relatively sparse, the line was heavily used for freight, especially coal; in 1914, 67% of traffic was goods-related. Trains ran from the north and East Midlands to the freight depot adjoining the station, which was marginally the largest in London.|$|E
5|$|The planned railway had two tracks {{each for}} freight and <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic.</b> Having taken similar {{projects}} in London and New York City into consideration, <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> received priority over freight trains. Furthermore, the new railway line {{was not only}} {{to serve as a}} connection between the mainline terminii in Berlin, but would also offer connections to the Berlin Ringbahn and the suburban rail lines.|$|E

5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> {{remained}} relatively {{strong in the}} 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, several {{companies}} started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and that price dumping was occurring {{along the route}} from Sandnes to Ålgård. In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated, after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955. This is the line with the most frequent <b>passenger</b> <b>traffic</b> in Norway to have been closed.|$|E
