25|$|The end of {{adolescence}} {{and the beginning}} of adulthood varies by country and by function. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered (chronologically and legally) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to <b>preadolescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lauren Cassidy, {{played by}} Karle Warren: She is Amy's daughter, {{six years old}} {{at the start of the}} series. A mostly well-adjusted girl, she is going through the pains of {{childhood}} and <b>preadolescence</b> with divorced parents, but a loving family. She struggles over her father's relationship with Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home with her long straight hair cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted. When Amy becomes pregnant with David's child, Lauren reveals what a total blow to her social life this will be and is furious. She later becomes accepting and supporting of her mother after she miscarries. Toward the end of the series, Lauren begins to hang out with a group of friends who embrace the straight edge culture, which puts her at odds with her mother.|$|E

Next, positive and negative behaviour were assessed. The extent to which students were bothered by negative behaviour targeted at them by others in their groups was also assessed. Structural group properties were also examined, including: group leadership or status hierarchy, group permeability, and group conformity.|$|E

50|$|Adolescence {{is usually}} {{determined}} by the onset of puberty, usually 12 for girls and 13 for boys. However, puberty may also begin in <b>preadolescence.</b> Adolescence is biological distinct from childhood, but it is accepted by some cultures {{as a part of}} social childhood, because most of them are minors. The onset of adolescence brings about various physical, psychological and behavioral changes.

5000|$|Childhood {{is the age}} span {{ranging from}} birth to adolescence. According to Piagets theory of {{cognitive}} development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage.

5000|$|Preadolescent {{children}} {{continue to}} exhibit certain growth spurts in executive functions, {{suggesting that this}} development does not necessarily occur in a linear manner, along with the preliminary maturing of particular functions as well.

Additionally, {{between the ages of}} 8 to 10, cognitive flexibility in particular begins to match adult levels. [...] However, similar to patterns in childhood development, executive functioning in preadolescents is limited because they do not reliably apply these executive functions across multiple contexts as a result of ongoing development of inhibitory control.|$|E
