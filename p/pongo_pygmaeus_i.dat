40|$|Vertical climbing, {{defined as}} ascent on {{substrates}} angled {{at more than}} 45 ° to the horizontal (Hunt et al., 1996), is a key locomotor behaviour in large arboreal primates. Not only does it allow access to food resources situated high in the canopy but it also enables large primates to easily change levels vertically in order to exploit larger, safer substrates for horizontal travel, thus {{reducing the risk of}} substrate breakage or falls (Thorpe et al., submitted). However, these benefits are achieved at some cost for animals of large body mass, due to the energy expenditure required to oppose gravity during climbing. Vertical climbing has also {{played an important role in}} theories about the evolution of locomotor specialisations of hominoid primates and it has been proposed as being preadaptive for the acquisition of habitual bipedalism in early hominids (e. g. Fleagle et al., 1981; Prost, 1980). Nevertheless, until recently (Isler, 2002 a,b, 2003), the kinematic details of climbing in hominoids have never been adequately evaluated. In the present study, spatio-temporal gait parameters of vertical climbing in Sumatran orang-utans (<b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus</b> abelii) are reported, with the aim of elucidating the characteristics of climbing in animals of different body size, but of geometrically similar body build, living in different habitats. Orang-utans are the only extant great apes in Asia. They live in Sumatran and Bornean rainforests and are seriously threatened by extinction through habitat destruction.

Biodiversitas 12 : 164 - 170. Conversion of forests into non-forests areas {{particularly for the}} development of timber industry and oil palm plantation in Ketapang district, West Kalimantan province was drastically increased recently. We have conducted an assessmment for the density of Bornean orangutans <b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus</b> wurmbii L. in degraded forests of the boundary of Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan in 2004 and 2005. We used line-transects nest-count to survey 39, 6 km length at 13 sites including 7 in side the park and the other 6 situated out side the park which holds a difference status of forest management. The differences of nest density between degraded forests habitat was calculated. The old degraded forest which has been logged for 5 years or more, were containing more new nests in a cluster compared to the recently as well as currently logged. The highest number of orangutan’s nests could be found in the old degraded forest in side the park, whereas the lowest one was obtained in the currently logged protection forest with the density of 3. 70 ind/km 2 and 0. 06 ind/km 2 respectively.

Daily behavioral observations of orangutans (<b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus)</b> was carried out by collecting data on the resting behavior such as sleeping, sitting idle and laying down. Second posture of the locomotion such as quadrupedally, bipedally and brachiation. Third postures was on the playing behaviors based on playing alone, with tool and with other animal. The last posture was about the feeding behaviors which divided into tolerance, intolerance and sharing. The observation data was collected from 0700 until 1900 the time when the orangutan wake up and sleep. The method used for this study was the focal time sampling of behavioral observation. The results of this study indicates a significant difference of behavioral pattern of orangutans in their semi natural habitat with orangutans in captive condition.

40|$|The {{divergent}} molar {{characteristics of}} Pongo troglodytes and <b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus</b> provide an instructive paradigm for examining the adaptive form-function relationship between molar enamel thickness and food hardness. Although both species exhibit a categorical preference for ripe fruit over other food objects, the thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molar teeth predict {{a diet that}} is more resistant to deformation (hard) and fracture (tough) than the diet of Pan. We confirm these predictions with behavioral observations of Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and <b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus</b> wurmbii in the wild and describe the mechanical properties of foods utilized during periods when preferred foods are scarce. Such fallback foods may have exerted a selective pressure on tooth evolution. particularly molar enamel thinness, which is interpreted as a functional adaptation to seasonal folivory and a derived character trait within the hominoid clade. The thick enamel and crenulated occlusal surface of Pongo molars is interpreted as a functional adaptation to the routine consumption of relatively tough and hard foods. We discuss {{the implications of these}} interpretations for inferring the diet of hominin species, which possessed varying degrees of thick molar enamel. These data, which are among the first reported for hominoid primates. fill an important empirical void for evaluating the mechanical plausibility of putative hominin food objects...|$|R
40|$|The orang utan (<b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus),</b> as {{currently}} recognized, includes two geographically separated subspecies: <b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus</b> pygmaeus, which resides on Borneo, and P. p. abelii, which inhabits Sumatra. At present, {{there is no}} known route of gene flow between the two populations except through captive individuals which have been released back into the wild {{over the last several}} decades. The two subspecies are differentiated by morphological and behavioral characters, and they can be distinguished by a subspecies specific pericentric chromosomal inversion. Nei-genetic distances were estimated between orang utan subspecies, gorilla, chimpanzee and humans using 44 isozyme loci and using 458 soluble fibroblast proteins which were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Phenetic analysis of both data sets supports the following conclusions: the orang utan subspecies distances are approximately 10 times closer to each other than they are to the African apes, and the orang utan subspecies are approximately as divergent as are the two chimpanzee species. Comparison of the genetic distances to genetic distance estimates done in the same laboratory under identical conditions reveals that the distance between Bornean vs. Sumatran orang utans is 5 – 10 times the distance measured between several pairs of subspecies including lions, cheetahs, and tigers. Near species level molecular genetic distances between orang utan subspecies would support the separate management of Bornean and Sumatran orang utans as evolutionary significant units (Ryder 1987). Evolutionary topologies were constructed from the distance data using both cladistic and phenetic methods. The majority of resulting trees affirmed previous molecular evolutionary studies that indicated that man and chimpanzee diverged from a common ancestor subsequent to the divergence of gorilla from the common ancestor...|$|R

50|$|A hybrid {{orangutan}} or cocktail orangutan is a usually captive-born orangutan {{derived from}} interbreeding between Bornean (<b>Pongo</b> <b>pygmaeus)</b> and Sumatran (<b>Pongo</b> abelii) orangutans. The topic of orangutan speciation was poorly understood until the 1980s, when genetics revealed that orangutans actually comprise these two genetically distinct species. Before this was known, orangutans from differing species were paired in captivity, {{and in some}} cases produced hybrid offspring. Subsequently, the government of Indonesia and the organization that oversees zoo programs in the United States suggested to stop interbreeding of Sumatran and Bornean orangutans and called for disallowing hybrids to reproduce.|$|R

The comparison has shown these two species diverged around 400,000 years ago, more recently than was previously thought. The orangutan genome also has fewer rearrangements than the chimpanzee/human lineage. The full sequence and annotation can be viewed on the Ensembl Genome Browser.|$|R
