50|$|Eiwa Station has two opposed side <b>platforms,</b> <b>with</b> <b>platform</b> 1 {{adjacent}} to the station building. The platforms are connected by an uncovered overpass.

5|$|Southeast Plaza Structure 1 is a {{rectangular}} <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> {{at least two}} levels. It has been dated to the Late Classic Period.|$|E
5|$|Structure 2 is {{a pyramid}} on the {{northwest}} side of the sunken Plaza 8. It is largely unrestored. Structure 3 lies across the plaza to the southeast. It is a <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> a twin stairway facing northwest onto the plaza.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> the ground floor raised to first floor level and the {{basement}} becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
50|$|The station {{originally}} had two side <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> the tracks in between. It was reconstructed in 1959 {{and now has}} two island <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> tracks {{on either side of}} each.|$|R

5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, a new {{station in}} the Tomorrowland section was built for the DRR. Tomorrowland Station, {{consisting}} of a covered <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> no station building, was constructed in April 1958 with a futuristic theme, which was updated in 1998 {{as part of a}} redevelopment of the Tomorrowland section.|$|E
5|$|It {{shares a}} similar right-wing policy <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> UKIP, with Nattrass stating as such amid the party's launch. Key {{policies}} include withdrawing the UK from the European Union (EU), prioritising {{relations with the}} Commonwealth of Nations and introducing more stringent measures on immigration. It further supports widespread use of referenda, promoting English devolution and abolishing the National Assembly for Wales. Nattrass places his party {{to the left of}} UKIP, however, due to both the party's general opposition to privatisation and its proposed nationalisation of targeted infrastructure and amenities.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons. An example {{is a series of}} four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> {{at least two of the}} four (Altar12 and Monument23) dating to the Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|Platform A4 {{divides the}} Group A plaza in two. It was a later {{addition}} to Group A during the reorganisation {{of the group}} that involved the destruction of the earlier building under Platform A5. When excavated it was very poorly reserved but was able to be reliably restored. There was no earlier version of the structure; it consists of a <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A. The upper level is topped with a cornice and access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we give a {{detailed}} review on Stewart Gough (SG) <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> self-motions {{and the related}} Borel Bricard problem. Moreover, we report about recent results achieved by the author on this topic (SG <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> type II DM self-motions). In context of these results, we also present two new theorems, which open the way for addressed future work. Finally, we give some remarks on planar SG <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> type I DM self-motions and formulate a central conjecture...|$|R
50|$|The station {{consisted}} of five tracks and three island <b>platforms,</b> <b>with</b> Track 2 sharing <b>platforms</b> <b>with</b> both Tracks 1 and 3. The repair {{of the platform}} serving Tracks 2 and 3 was completed and the trains of the Nishi-Osaka Line left from Track 3.|$|R

5|$|Platforms 5 and 6 {{formed the}} main, wide island <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> {{a full set}} of {{buildings}} along its centre. The platforms were used mainly for West Coast Main Line services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two bay platforms, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of more radical Expressionism and Modernism {{can be seen}} in buildings such as Basil Spence's Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964–67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced blockwork and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, Bathgate (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture. The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{rapid transit}} station was {{designed}} by architects Jensen & Skodvin Architects, and is visually and structurally {{very similar to the}} Sinsen Station, also one of their projects. It features a center <b>platform</b> <b>with</b> a roof, and uses wood, steel and concrete. The station is located just outside the tunnel that runs {{all the way to the}} connection with the Sognsvann Line. South of Storo, the metro tracks run parallel with the Gjøvik Line. The station is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1874 by the Great Western and Midland Railways {{as part of}} the Clifton Extension Railway, {{designed}} to connect the port of Avonmouth to the national rail network. The station had a large gothic revival building on the Bristol-bound <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> smaller passenger facilities on the opposite platform and a goods yard beyond. Between 1903 and 1930 the station employed an average of 22 staff. Excursion trains were a regular sight, bringing people to nearby Bristol Zoo.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{full-length}} mezzanine allows crossover {{from any}} of the station's four staircases from each <b>platform,</b> <b>with</b> a total of eight staircases from the mezzanine to platform level. There is no direct indoor access to the Queens Center Mall's entrance at the northwest corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue from the mezzanine.|$|E
