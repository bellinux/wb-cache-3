5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or <b>propionic</b> <b>acid,</b> and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, <b>propionic</b> <b>acid,</b> and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

In a mixture of the fatty acids, utilization of nonanoic acid was depressed by acetic and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids,</b> and vice versa. The PHA accumulation from the {{volatile fatty acids}} was decreased from 53 % (w/w) of dry cell mass to 23 % due to the nonanoic acid.

40|$|The {{effect of}} some food preservatives, such as sorbic (SA) and <b>propionic</b> (PA) <b>acids,</b> on {{aflatoxin}} production in synthetic media or in moistened (20 %) wheat seeds, was investigated. The preservatives tested, added to synthetic media at sublethal concentrations {{both at the}} inoculum and after 5 days of incubation, stimulated aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus. Sorbic and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids</b> are metabolized by the fungus in vivo and in vitro. Lower concentrations of PA and SA (0. 05 to 0. 1 % w/w) in wheat seeds are ineffective against both fungal growth and aflatoxin production, whilst the combined use of butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT), and PA or SA was more effective in controlling aflatoxin production than their use as single components...|$|R

A second sulfur contraction (cyanoethyl phosphine/ trifluoroacetic acid/sulfolane) yielded cyanocorrigenolide 57 with the <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> ester group of ring C also racemised. Due to the steric bulk of both reactants this contraction was the only successful method. The oxygen atoms in the lactam and the lactone group were replaced by sulfur (phosphorus pentasulfide/4-methylpyridine) in dithiocyanocorrigenolide 58 and the S-methyl derivate 59 was formed by reaction with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate. Dimethylamine addition opened the thiolactone ring with an exocyclic alkene group in 60 by elimination of the sulfide anion from the methyl group.

Body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broiler chicks were significantly (P < 0. 001) improved by CFP supplementation at 21 days of age regardless of nutrient density (ND). However, at 35 days of age CFP addition significantly (P < 0. 001) increased BWG and FCR. Proventriculus weight was also significantly affected by the dietary treatments. Ileal viscosity was significantly (P < 0. 05) affected by ND which was associated with wheat and barley contents, whereas feed viscosity was significantly (P < 0. 05) affected by CFP supplementation. Villus height was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by the CFP supplementation. In the case of villus width, an interaction effect was observed: there was a significant (P < 0. 05) decrease in the group fed the standard ND diet, but only a numerical decrease in the group fed the LND diet compared to control group.

40|$|Ozone was {{evaluated}} {{for the removal}} of phenolic compounds in wastewater from the Merisol Plant. Oxidation was conducted under both acidic (pH = 4. 70) and basic (pH = 10. 45) conditions. Phenol and acetic acid (as well as traces of formic, butyric and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids)</b> were identified as major components in the Merisol effluent. The results from the study have indicated that the phenol concentrations in the Merisol effluent were reduced from an average of 355 mg/L to below detectable levels within 60 min of oxidation period under both acidic and basic conditions. Furthermore, the effluent COD concentration was reduced from approximately 1200 mg/L to: 678 mg/L at 40 ppm O 3; 590 mg/L at 80 ppm O 3; and to 579 mg/L at 120 ppm O 3 under acidic conditions. Under basic conditions, the effluent COD concentration was reduced to: 656 mg/L at 40 ppm O 3; 510 mg/L at 80 ppm O 3; and 397 mg/L at 120 ppm. These results were well below the required 1000 mg/L COD specification level. Moreover, the results also indicated that oxidation of the Merisol effluent sample under basic conditions yielded better results when compared to oxidation under the normal pH of the effluent (acidic). The degradation products of phenol ozone oxidation were identified as formic, butyric and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids.</b> These acids occurred in various proportions during the oxidation and were also removed during the process. In conclusion, ozone oxidation technology has proven to capably treat the Merisol effluent to the required specifications.

Desulfurisation took place with Raney nickel and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane.

After tweaking the structure and testing different substitution at the 4-position of the phthaloyl ring and at the carboxyl acid the researchers finally landed at a molecule that potently inhibits PDE4 and TNF-α, which they later named apremilast (Figure 4). The S-enantiomer of apremilast was chosen since it was the more active enantiomer.

Using organic acids {{is one of the}} most important interventions for controlling the microbiological safety and quality of food and has been widely used. An increase of bacterial acid resistant species gave the motivation to find an alternative way to control foodborne pathogens in meat. Limited experimental studies have investigated the antibacterial activity of organic acids and an aqueous lime-peel extract combination on chicken meat against foodborne pathogens. The inhibitory effects of citric, propionic, acetic and lactic acid in combination with an aqueous lime-peel extract (Citrus aurantifolia) against foodborne pathogens and on the organoleptic properties of chicken meat were examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an aqueous lime-peel extract was investigated using spectrophotometer (TECAN) at 30 °C. The MIC of an aqueous lime-peel extract with lactic, citric, acetic and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids</b> in nutrient broth individually against Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 were 2 % w/v, 8 mmol/l, 5. 5 mmol/l, 5 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l respectively, while against E. coli K 12 were 1. 5 % w/v, 7 mmol/l, 4 mmol/l, 4 mmol/l and 4 mmol/l respectively at 30 °C. MIC of lactic acid combined with citric or acetic or <b>propionic</b> <b>acids</b> against Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 were 8 mmol/l - 4. 5 mmol/l, 7 mmol/l - 4. 5 mmol/l and 7. 5 mmol/l - 4 mmol/l respectively.

Immersion treatment (10 minutes) of lactic acid combined with acetic acid (208 mmol/l - 96 mmol/l) was used against Salmonella on chicken meat showed a negligible effect at 30 °C. A combination of an aqueous lime-peel extract and acetic acid (41. 6 % w/v – 1. 12 mmol/l) including 1 % NaCl on chicken meat was able to significantly inhibit the growth of Salmonella after 9 hours. Applying a sensory evaluation experiment revealed that treating raw chicken meat with lime added a citrusy flavour and made chicken more palatable after cooking. In spite of the induction of virulence and acid tolerance genes of salmonellae which were grow in nutrient broth (pH 2. 25) after been treated with an aqueous lime-peel extract and acetic acid combination, salmonellae did not survive more than 2. 5 hours at pH 2. 5.
