Additionally, a relationship was revealed between (chilling) stress and variation in photosynthesis. Chilling treatments (5 degrees C and 10 degrees C) were performed for different durations (1 - 7 d) under a moderate irradiance (120 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)). The individual leaves were divided into a shaded <b>zone</b> and two <b>illuminated,</b> chilled <b>zones.</b> The leaf tip and sometimes the leaf base were not chilled. Measurements of the dark-adapted F-v/F-m were made on the different leaf zones {{at the end of the}} chilling treatment, and then for several days thereafter to monitor recovery. Chilling up to 7 d in the dark did not affect PSII efficiency and visual appearance, whereas chilling in the light caused severe photoinhibition, sometimes followed by leaf necrosis. Photoinhibition increased with the duration of the chilling period, whereas, remarkably, chilling temperature had no effect. In the unchilled leaf tip, photoinhibition also occurred, whereas in the unchilled leaf base it did not. Whatever the leaf zone, photoinhibition became permanent if the mean value dropped below 0. 4, although chlorosis and necrosis were associated solely with chilled illuminated tissue. Starch accumulated in the unchilled leaf tip, in contrast to the adjacent chilled irradiated zone. This suggests that photoinhibition was due to a secondary effect in the unchilled leaf tip (sink limitation), whereas it was a direct effect of chilling and irradiance in the chilled <b>illuminated</b> <b>zones.</b> The PSII efficiency and its coefficient of variation showed a unique negative linearity across all leaf zones and different tissue types. The slope of this curve was steeper for chilled leaves than it was for healthy, non-stressed leaves, suggesting that the coefficient of variation may be an important tool for assessing stress in leaves...|$|R

40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{external and}} internal illumination method is proposed for cylindrical airlift photobioreactors in this paper, in which multiple light sources are placed around the downcomer region, to achieve a more homogeneous light distribution. Internal light sources are mounted near {{the wall of the}} draft tube and external light sources near the wall of the photobioreactor. The light distribution in an airlift photobioreactor under simultaneous {{external and internal}} illumination (APER-SEII) with various biomass concentrations and radii is investigated using the two-flux model. This model is able to obtain reasonable prediction compared with the simulation of more rigorous DO models, and is suitable for real-time control of microalgae cultivation in photobioreactors. Light attenuation profiles are compared with those of only externally illuminated airlift photobioreactors (APER-EI), showing that the new illumination method can increase the size of the <b>illuminated</b> <b>zone</b> in photobioreactors and enable a more uniform light distribution in the downcomer region. The calculation results also show that the annular distance of the downcomer region (Delta R) is more critical than the radius of the photobioreactor (R) to light distribution and therefore the design of photobioreactors. Asymmetry of light distribution in an airlift photobioreactor with the same radiation flux on the two walls is pronounced for low biomass concentrations and small radii. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimizing event detection and location in such regions {{is all the}} more crucial because these areas tend to host a higher density of sensitive infrastructures. The meth- odology proposed consists of reprocessing existing data recorded by a permanent net-work and boosting the final catalog resolution by temporarily deploying portable sparse mini-arrays in the target area. Sonogram analysis is applied on both existing and new datasets to detect waveforms barely emerging from the background noise. A visual interactive event analysis module is used to test for phase picking, event asso- ciation, waveform cross correlation, and location ambiguities. It also estimates back azimuth and slowness when sparse array data are available. The method is applied to a low-seismicity region in the western Swiss Molasse basin where two sparse mini- arrays were temporarily deployed. The detection of earthquakes is improved by a fac- tor of 9 when reprocessing four yrs (2009 – 2013) of available data recorded by two accelerometers and one broadband station in a 2500 km 2 target area.

The energy generated via accretion is dissipated partially {{in the cold}} disc {{as well as in}} the X-ray source. We study the differences between the case where the X-ray source is in the form of a lamp post above the accretion disc and the case of a heavy corona. We consider radiative heating via Comptonization together with heating via photo-absorption on numerous heavy elements as carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron. The transfer in lines is precisely calculated. A better description of the heating/cooling through the inclusion of line transfer, a correct description of the temperature in the deeper layers, a correct description of the entire disc vertical structure, as well as the study of the possible coronal pressure effect, constitute an improvement in comparison to previous works. We show that exact calculations of hydrostatic equilibrium and determination of the disc thickness has a crucial impact on the optical depth of the hot <b>illuminated</b> <b>zone.</b> We assume a moderate illumination where the viscous flux equals the X-ray radiation flux. A highly ionized skin is created in the lamp post model, with the outgoing spectrum containing many emission lines and ionization edges in emission or absorption in the soft X-ray domain, as well as an iron line at ∼ 7 keV consisting of a blend of low ionization line from the deepest layers and hydrogen and helium like resonance line from the upper layers, and almost no absorption edge, contrary to the case of a slab of constant density. A full heavy corona completely suppresses the highly ionized zone on the top of the accretion disc and in such case the spectrum is featureless.

40|$|The {{measurements}} {{described in}} this paper were made {{in order to find}} out how the net photochemical action of light falling on a cell of circular cross-section may be greater in the half of the cell farther from the source of light. It is known that in air the cylindrical, fightsensitive sporangiophore of Phycomyces bends toward a single source of light, and that the bending is due to a difference in the rates of growth or extension of the ceil wall {{on opposite sides of the}} growing zone. With symmetrical illumination of the growing zone there is no bending, but a temporary acceleration of growth, the light growth response. The conclusion is therefore unavoidable that when parallel light strikes the sporangiophore from one side, the bending which ensues is caused by relatively more growth, and hence relatively greater photochemical action, on the side farthest from the source of light. Since absorption certainly occurs as light passes through the sporangiophore, how is this possible? Blaauw (1914) regarded the sporangiophore as a cylindrical lens which, because of its relative transparency, concentrated light on the back wall of the ceil in a zone of relatively high intensity. Blaauw and more recently Nuernbergk (1927) were forced to conclude that the brightly <b>illuminated</b> <b>zone</b> on the back wall, even though flanked on both sides by large areas of relative shadow (cf. Fig. 1 A), served to call forth a greater growth acceleration than was produced at the cell wall nearest to the light.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{influence}} of UV light on the drainage flows of foams and thin-liquid films stabilized by photoswitchable azobenzene surfactants, whose shape and hydrophobicity can be modified using UV illumination. This model system, the dynamics of which was well characterized in a previous study, enables us to trigger a controlled variation of the surface excess and surface tension. In both geometries we observe light-induced flows which are able to suppress the drainage flow induced by gravity. However, we show that the physical origin of the flows is different in both geometries. At the scale of a few films in the so-called 'two-bubble' experiment the comparisons of the physical length scales, i. e. the radius of the meniscus and the film thickness, to the chemical "reservoir length" (Γ/c) show that the flux of the surfactant at the interface {{in the presence of}} UV light is different in the films and in the meniscus, inducing a Marangoni flow from the meniscus to the film, which is stronger than gravity and capillary suction. The velocity of this flow can be tuned by the light intensity and the surfactant concentration. In the real foams, however, we show that the above mechanism is not relevant because the radii of curvature of the Plateau borders are orders of magnitude lower than in the two-bubble experiment, thus the capillary suction prevents such transfer between the films and the Plateau borders. Instead, the decrease of the drainage velocity is shown to be due to a gradient of the surface tension in the <b>illuminated</b> <b>zone</b> hence to a local variation of the capillary pressure. This study underlines the importance of characterizing the radius of the Plateau borders for the understanding of foams, as this key parameter sets the order of magnitude of capillary pressure, film thickness and amount of available surfactant.

To alleviate these problems, we propose a least-squares GIMI framework in which we formulate the first two steps as a linearized inversion problem when imaging first-order internal multiples. Tests on synthetic datasets demonstrate the ability to localize subsurface scatterers in their true positions, and delineate a vertical fault plane using the proposed method.

A cone shaped region of high ionization gas aligned with the radio axis and emanating from the nucleus is seen clearly in an interference filter image (Pogge 1988 a). It is now widely accepted that the gas is photoionized by nuclear radiation which only <b>illuminates</b> the conical <b>zone...</b>|$|R

In the <b>illuminated</b> euphotic <b>zone</b> where Prochlorococcus grows, reactive oxygen species are continuously generated via photochemical reactions with dissolved organic matter. However, Prochlorococcus genomes lack catalase and additional protective mechanisms common in other aerobes, and this genus is highly susceptible to oxidative damage from hydrogen peroxide (HOOH). In this study we showed that the extant microbial community plays a vital, previously unrecognized role in cross-protecting Prochlorococcus from oxidative damage in the surface mixed layer of the oligotrophic ocean. Microbes are the primary HOOH sink in marine systems, {{and in the absence}} of the microbial community, surface waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean accumulated HOOH to concentrations that were lethal for Prochlorococcus cultures. In laboratory experiments with the marine heterotroph Alteromonas sp., serving as a proxy for the natural community of HOOH-degrading microbes, bacterial depletion of HOOH from the extracellular milieu prevented oxidative damage to the cell envelope and photosystems of cocultured Prochlorococcus, and facilitated the growth of Prochlorococcus at ecologically-relevant cell concentrations. Curiously, the more recently evolved lineages of Prochlorococcus that exploit the surface mixed layer niche were also the most sensitive to HOOH. The genomic streamlining of these evolved lineages during adaptation to the high-light expose...|$|R
