50|$|Several {{mechanisms}} of this superhydrophilicity {{have been proposed}} by researchers. One is the change of the surface structure to a metastable structure, and another is cleaning the surface by the <b>photodecomposition</b> of dirt such as organic compounds adsorbed on the surface, after either of which water molecules can adsorb to the surface. The mechanism is still controversial, and {{it is too soon}} to decide which suggestion is correct. To decide, atomic scale measurements and other studies will be necessary.|$|E
50|$|For example, mercury absorbs {{radiation}} at 1849 and 2537 angstroms, and {{the source}} is often high-intensity mercury lamps. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with ethylene, and the compound is irradiated with a mercury lamp, this results in the <b>photodecomposition</b> of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state.|$|E

The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through <b>photodecomposition</b> and/or volatility. The herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone. Volatile herbicides have to {{be incorporated into the}} soil before planting the pasture. Agricultural crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes, corn, soybeans and strawberries. Soil fumigants like metam-sodium and dazomet are in use as preplant herbicides.|$|E
50|$|Photodissociation, photolysis, or <b>photodecomposition</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction in which {{a chemical}} compound is broken down by photons. It {{is defined as the}} interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. Photodissociation is not limited to visible light. Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound. Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher, such as ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions.|$|E
50|$|AzM is {{very stable}} when {{dissolved}} in acidic, neutral or slightly alkaline water but above pH11 it is rapidly hydrolyzed to anthranilic acid, benzamide, and other chemicals. In natural water-rich environments microorganisms and sunlight cause AzM {{to break down}} faster, the half-life is highly variable depending on the condition, from several days to several months. Under the normal conditions, biodegradation and evaporation are the main routes of disappearance, after evaporation AzM has more exposure to UV-light, which causes <b>photodecomposition.</b> With little bioactivity and no exposure to UV light, it can reach half-lives of roughly a year.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, distortions {{arise from}} the sample as well. Therefore, {{some aspects of the}} sample {{must be taken into account}} too. Firstly, <b>photodecomposition</b> may decrease the intensity of fluorescence over time. Scattering of light must also be taken into account. The most significant types of scattering in this context are Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Light scattered by Rayleigh scattering has the same wavelength as the incident light, whereas in Raman scattering the scattered light changes wavelength usually to longer wavelengths. Raman scattering is the result of a virtual electronic state induced by the excitation light. From this virtual state, the molecules may relax back to a vibrational level other than the vibrational ground state. In fluorescence spectra, it is always seen at a constant wavenumber difference relative to the excitation wavenumber e.g. the peak appears at a wavenumber 3600 cm−1 [...] lower than the excitation light in water.|$|E

The influence of the process parameters (i. e., curcumin concentration {{and the amount of}} TiO 2) on the <b>photodecomposition</b> process was also investigated. The results showed that the curcumin was decomposed along with the solar light irradiation time. During the solar eclipse, the <b>photodecomposition</b> rate is suddenly down.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling {{study was conducted}} to assess the atmospheric impacts of chloropicrin emissions. Chloropicrin absorption cross-sections were measured in the ~ 270 - 390 nm wavelength region, and its overall <b>photodecomposition</b> quantum yield under simulated sunlight conditions was found to be 0. 870. 26. In environmental chamber experiments, chloropicrin significantly enhanced rates of NO oxidation, O 3 formation, and consumptions of alkanes and other organic reactants. This is attributed to the formation of Cl atoms and NO x in its <b>photodecomposition.</b> A previously developed atmospheric chemical mechanism was expanded to include chloropicrin and Cl atom reactions. It gave reasonably good simulations of the chamber experiments. This mechanism predicted that when emitted into polluted urban atmospheres, chloropicrin would have between 0. 4 and 1. 5 times the ozone impact of the average of emitted VOCs on a mass emitted basis. This value varied depending on environmental conditions and assumptions made concerning the <b>photodecomposition</b> mechanism. The data obtained in this study were inconsistent with a previous study of chloropicrin's <b>photodecomposition</b> in air, probably due to differences in the light sources employed.

Nine vegetable oils were compared to assess the <b>photodecomposition</b> of sethoxydim on wild oat leaf surface under simulated light conditions. The experiment was conducted as completely randomized factorial design with three replications at the College of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2013. Each herbicidal solution (with and without vegetable oil) was exposed to simulated light at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 240 MAS (min after spray), for 30 min. The performance of sethoxydim {{in the presence of}} turnip, olive, soybean, corn, sunflower, canola, sesame, castor and cotton seed oils, compared to non-vegetable oil solution, increased up to 4. 02 -, 3. 44 -, 3. 22 -, 3. 08 -, 2. 86 -, 2. 09 -, 1. 96 -, 1. 77 - and 1. 25 - fold. All vegetable oils significantly improved the resistance of sethoxydim to light treatment. The effect of vegetable oils on the resistance to <b>photodecomposition</b> of sethoxydim was significant different at less than 60 MAS, while no significant differences were noted among vegetable oils when light treatment occurred at 120 and 240 MAS. Data from the light treatments have confirmed that when vegetable oils were added to sethoxydim, light adverse effect was lower, which is presumably due to disturbance of the cuticule and the rapid absorption of sethoxydim by wild oat leaves.

The existing <b>photodecomposition</b> rate has been successfully improved to a factor of 22. 0 times through refluxing process in excessive pyridine where the surface capping ligand (oleic acid) is removed from the 2 D ZnO nanopellets. On the other hand, the refluxed photocatalyst (0. 04 g) in this study was found to exhibit excellent recyclability up to three cycles. Furthermore, X-ray powder diffraction spectrums for the refluxed photocatatalyst, respectively, before and after three cycles of photocatalytic reactions, has generated the same patterns showing that the photocatalyst is stable and feasible to be used as an efficient photocatalyst material.
