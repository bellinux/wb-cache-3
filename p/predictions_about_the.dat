25|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{faced in}} determining {{a theory of}} anaphora that properly encompasses bound variable pronouns is properly determining the definition of bound. As previously stated, a bound variable pronoun {{is said to be}} bound if it is c-commanded by its antecedent. In many cases, this definition makes correct <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> availability of bound variable interpretations. However, as in the example below, this requirement does not always seem to work.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German {{doctor who}} {{publicly}} predicted his early {{death on the}} basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.

25|$|The {{researchers}} found {{the results of}} this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same event.|$|E

25|$|Theorems in {{mathematics}} and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute {{is that it is}} falsifiable, that is, it makes <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{conjecture}} {{is called}} a hypothesis when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on {{the truth of this}} conjecture. These are called conditional proofs: the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the problem}} in this debate {{revolved}} around the high level of abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E

But a theory of lineup memory would make a specific <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first latent variable (the distribution of memory signals) without necessarily making any <b>prediction</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> second (criterion variability). In parametric ROC analysis, the effects of those latent variables are purposefully conflated because the only goal is to obtain a “best guess” as to the likely empirical trajectory of the ROC curve (had those empirical ROC data been collected). To test the predictions of a theory of memory, a statistical model like that must {{give way to a}} model of memory signals that can measure the latent variables of interest. We turn to that issue next.|$|R

At best, {{it can make}} <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> K-alpha and some L-alpha X-ray {{emission}} spectra for larger atoms, if two additional ad hoc assumptions are made (see Moseley's law above). Emission spectra for atoms with a single outer-shell electron (atoms in the lithium group) can also be approximately predicted. Also, if the empiric electron–nuclear screening factors for many atoms are known, many other spectral lines can be deduced from the information, in similar atoms of differing elements, via the Ritz–Rydberg combination principles (see Rydberg formula). All these techniques essentially make use of Bohr's Newtonian energy-potential picture of the atom.|$|E
25|$|The murder {{investigation}} became a media sensation with {{the involvement of}} self-proclaimed psychic Peter Hurkos, who visited the gravesite of the Jacksons in Falls Church, Virginia and handled their possessions, allegedly using his powers to accurately describe the murders and the positions in which their bodies were found. Hurkos visited {{the site of the}} Margaret Harold murder, and told investigators that the same killer had murdered the Jacksons. He also made various <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the case, saying that it would be solved within two weeks and that the killer would ultimately be indicted for nine murders. Hurkos reportedly led investigators to the house of one of their main suspects, a trash collector who confessed to the murders; with the later apprehension of Rees, however, Hurkos and his claims about the case were ridiculed by The Washington Post.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to <b>predictions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E
