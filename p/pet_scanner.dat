25|$|A <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> is a {{commonly}} used medical device which scans the whole human body for detecting diseases such cancer. The <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> {{was invented in}} 1972 by Edward J. Hoffman and fellow scientist Michael Phelps.|$|E
25|$|The uptake of 18F-FDG by tissues is {{a marker}} for the tissue uptake of glucose, {{which in turn}} is closely {{correlated}} with certain types of tissue metabolism. After 18F-FDG is injected into a patient, a <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> can form two-dimensional or three-dimensional images of the distribution of 18F-FDG within the body.|$|E
25|$|In vivo {{ligand binding}} and {{receptor}} distribution {{can be studied}} using Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which works by induction of a radionuclide into a ligand, which is then released {{into the body of}} a studied organism. The radiolabeled ligands are spatially located by a <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> to reveal areas in the organism with high concentrations of receptors.|$|E
50|$|Gamma rays, emitted {{indirectly}} by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), are {{detected in}} {{positron emission tomography}} (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanners</b> used in hospitals. <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> create detailed three-dimensional images of metabolic activity within the human body.|$|R

30|$|The J-Hart study {{examined}} whether a vendor-neutral software could harmonize SUV across 12 <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> from various manufacturers. We obtained an appropriate FWHM of GF for harmonization {{by comparing the}} SUVmax of 12 <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> at nine institutions with both the JSNM reference range and the DRO 10 mm. Harmonization significantly improved the reproducibility and repeatability of the SUVmax.|$|R
25|$|The {{raw data}} {{collected}} by a <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons {{by a pair of}} detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred (i.e., the line of response (LOR)).|$|E
25|$|PET imaging is best {{performed}} using {{a dedicated}} <b>PET</b> <b>scanner.</b> However, {{it is possible}} to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head gamma camera fitted with a coincidence detector. The quality of gamma-camera PET is considerably lower, and acquisition is slower. However, for institutions with low demand for PET, this may allow on-site imaging, instead of referring patients to another centre or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner.|$|E
25|$|Marshall also {{announced}} that a new hospital {{to be built in}} Corner Brook would provide cancer treatment. The government had previously said the population of the region did not warrant radiation therapy or a Positron emission tomography (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanner.</b> Following Marshall's announcement that both would be part of the new hospital he shuffled Susan Sullivan out of the Health portfolio. Sullivan, who had defended the decision to not offer the services, was replaced by Paul Davis.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{methodology}} for calculating the need for positron emission tomography (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanners</b> in a country and illustrate this methodology for Belgium. Methods: First, levels of evidence were assigned to PET in different indications according to a standard hierarchical classification system. The level reached depends on whether there is evidence on diagnostic accuracy, impact on diagnostic thinking, therapeutic impact, impact on patient outcomes, or cost-effectiveness. Second, the number of patients eligible for PET for each indication was derived from a registry of PET. Third, the number of <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> needed in Belgium was estimated for different baseline hypotheses about maximum annual capacity of a scanner and the minimally required level of evidence. Results: The number of <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> needed crucially depends on the level of evidence considered acceptable for the implementation of PET: the higher the level of evidence required, the lower the number of <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> needed. Belgium needs at least three and at most ten <b>PET</b> <b>scanners.</b> This contrasts with the thirteen currently approved. Conclusions: Scientific evidence and information on the eligible population for a specific procedure are crucial elements for policy makers who wish to make evidence-based decisions about programming and planning of heavy medical equipment. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} {{is concerned with}} studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a <b>PET</b> <b>scanner.</b> Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, {{as evidenced by the}} emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} imaging {{involves the}} administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer. The {{most commonly used}} tracers are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, gallium-67, indium-111, thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose (18F) (18F-FDG). The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, brain, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiological function. The excretory function of the kidneys, iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid, blood flow to heart muscle, etc. can be measured. The principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the <b>PET</b> <b>Scanner,</b> which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer {{in the body and}} display it as an image. With computer processing, the information can be displayed as axial, coronal and sagittal images (single-photon emission computed tomography - SPECT or Positron-emission tomography - PET). In the most modern devices, nuclear medicine images can be fused with a CT scan taken quasisimultaneously, so the physiological information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy.|$|E
25|$|In body-scanning {{applications}} {{in searching for}} tumor or metastatic disease, a dose of 18F-FDG in solution (typically 5 to 10 millicuries or 200 to 400 MBq) is typically injected rapidly into a saline drip running into a vein, in a patient who has been fasting for at least 6 hours, and who has a suitably low blood sugar. (This {{is a problem for}} some diabetics; usually PET scanning centers will not administer the isotope to patients with blood glucose levels over about 180mg/dL = 10mmol/L, and such patients must be rescheduled). The patient must then wait about an hour for the sugar to distribute and be taken up into organs which use glucose – a time during which physical activity must be kept to a minimum, in order to minimize uptake of the radioactive sugar into muscles (this causes unwanted artifacts in the scan, interfering with reading especially when the organs of interest are inside the body vs. inside the skull). Then, the patient is placed in the <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> for a series of one or more scans which may take from 20 minutes to as long as an hour (often, only about one quarter of the body length may be imaged at a time).|$|E

30|$|Harmonization of the SUV {{improved}} the CVrepro of SUVmax across 12 scanners {{in the present}} study. Takahashi et al. reported a maximum difference of 45.7 % in the SUVmax with a 27 -mm sphere across five different <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> [32]. Such a substantial variation {{is a problem for}} reproducibility. Quak et al. evaluated harmonization across three <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> using EQ.PET for 1380 FDG-avid tumours [23]. They reported that the mean ratio with and without PSF of the SUVmax for 1380 tumour lesions was 1.46 (95 %CI 0.86 – 2.06) before and 1.02 (95 %CI 0.88 – 1.16) after harmonization. Because the mean value, +[*] 1.96 [*]×[*]SD, was the upper limit of the CI, the SD before harmonization was 0.31, thus yielding a CV of 21 %. The SD after harmonization was 0.07, thus yielding a CV of 7 %. The present study found that GI-PET {{improved the}} range of CVrepro across 12 <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> from 3.83 – 15.3 % to 2.30 – 10.7 %, suggesting that inter-scanner variability was improved equally well by GI-PET and EQ.PET. Harmonization is thought to decrease differences in variations among acquisition protocols (2 D, 3 D, TOF, etc.), machine specificities (such as type of crystal) and other elements (clock synchronisation, activity preparation and injection). However, their study included 517 patients with tumours who were examined using three <b>PET</b> <b>scanners,</b> whereas we examined a NEMA IEC body phantom using 12 <b>PET</b> <b>scanners.</b> The difference may also be affected by the biological features of tumours and patients. Patients should ideally be clinically assessed using the same scanner. However, patients often undergo PET evaluations with different scanners within the same institution. Multicentre studies usually have different scanners, and thus, therapeutic effects can be assessed using various scanners, and patients are often transferred to other hospitals for advanced specialist care.|$|R

However, given the low cost of a gamma camera and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated <b>PET</b> <b>scanner,</b> this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> cannot be justified.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} very few studies {{correlating}} orgasm and brain activity in real time. One study examined 12 healthy women using a positron emission tomography (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanner</b> while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. Differences were reported in the brains {{of men and women}} during stimulation. However, changes in brain activity were observed in both sexes in which the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear and anxiety shut down. Regarding these changes, Gert Holstege {{said in an interview with}} The Times, [...] "What this means is that deactivation, letting go of all fear and anxiety, might be the most important thing, even necessary, to have an orgasm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) measures emissions from radioactively labeled metabolically active chemicals {{that have been}} injected into the bloodstream. The emission data are computer-processed to produce 2- or 3-dimensional images {{of the distribution of}} the chemicals throughout the brain. The positron emitting radioisotopes used are produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labeled with these radioactive atoms. The labeled compound, called a radiotracer, is injected into the bloodstream and eventually makes its way to the brain. [...] Sensors in the <b>PET</b> <b>scanner</b> detect the radioactivity as the compound accumulates in various regions of the brain. [...] A computer uses the data gathered by the sensors to create multicolored 2- or 3-dimensional images that show where the compound acts in the brain. Especially useful are a wide array of ligands used to map different aspects of neurotransmitter activity, with by far the most commonly used PET tracer being a labeled form of glucose (see Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG)).|$|E
30|$|Quak et al. {{validated}} {{a proprietary}} software tool (EQ.PET) to harmonize SUV across three PET systems {{independently of the}} applied reconstruction algorithm [23]. They reported that all RC of SUVmax fell within EANM curve after applying the EQ.PET filter. The present study confirmed that vendor-neutral GI-PET software could harmonize the SUVmax across 12 <b>PET</b> <b>scanners.</b> As a result, all SUVmax fell within in the JSNM reference range on GI-PET after adding a GF. Therefore, we consider that GI-PET and EQ.PET are equally useful for harmonization. The post-harmonization SUVmax of various <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> became comparable {{based on the same}} standard, which is relevant to multicentre and follow-up studies that use various <b>PET</b> <b>scanners.</b> E Q.PET is a proprietary software that can only be installed on its own dedicated workstation with PET system. In contrast, GI-PET is a vendor-neutral software that can be applied at any institution using only a personal computer, regardless of the PET system. Although the present study used the JSNM reference range of SUVmax, the EANM reference range can be used in vendor-neutral software.|$|R

30|$|Many of the PET radioisotopes {{suitable}} for immunoPET and theranostics emit positron with long positron range. This implies a blurring {{of the source}} distribution and a consequent loss of spatial resolution [17 – 19]. The loss of spatial resolution, compared to short-range positron emitter such as 18 F, has been measured in high-resolution <b>PET</b> <b>scanners</b> for brain imaging and animal PET [20, 21]. For the present generation of commercial whole-body <b>PET</b> <b>scanners,</b> with spatial resolution of about 4  mm, the blurring due to positron range is barely measurable [22]. Nevertheless, in the future, even whole-body PET, with improved spatial resolution, might require a mechanism to recover the loss of resolution associated with long positron range.|$|R
