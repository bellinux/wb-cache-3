The objective of balancing is to reduce rotor vibration to a practical minimum. Reducing rotor vibrations generally increases the service life of the rotating machinery. The fundamental difference between a centrifugal sewage <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> and those of its clear water cousins {{is its ability to}} pass solid materials that would normally clod later. Due to the unbalance in the impeller, vibration occurs and leads to decrease in fluid velocity and local pressure which may cause an undesirable turbulence and possible cavitation. Hence, to remove the unbalance in rotor is necessary.
