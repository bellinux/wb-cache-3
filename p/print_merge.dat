5000|$|IBM Notes and Domino add-ons, {{tools and}} {{extensions}} are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language {{that are designed}} specifically to integrate with IBM Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, IBM Notes databases {{may be used for}} configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core IBM Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products (e.g. Spam Sentinel), server administration and monitoring tools (e.g. RPRWyatt's VitalSigns, ACL Dominator, GSX Monitor), messaging and storage management products (e.g. AttachZIP, TOTAL Recall, Archive Mailbox Reverter, ReduceMail Pro Suite), policy-based tools (e.g. Crossware Mail Signature), data synchronization tools (e.g. <b>Print</b> <b>Merge</b> Reporter, Integra For Notes) and developer tools (e.g. NotesMail.com IBM Notes tools, Teamstudio tools, Ytria Lotus Notes Tools, NotesTracker).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Eyelids, eyelashes {{and shadows}} are three major {{challenges}} for effective iris segmentation, {{which have not}} been adequately addressed in the current literature. In this paper, we present a novel method for Iris recognition (IR) based on color images. Firstly; extracting of the color values from Iris images using RGB color space, which is represented as vectors {{in the form of}} 3 D-RGB color space. Secondly; determine the center pupil and external contour of iris circle. Thirdly; taking a sub Iris image to extracted the iris <b>print,</b> then <b>merge</b> the three sub image in one array to make the aggregation. Then, a smart prediction model is established to determine an appropriate threshold for eyelash and (eyelid or shadow) detection. Finally; Fourier Fast Transform (FFT) is used to recognize the Iris print. Our proposed method has been applied on 100 Iris images which obtained from CASIA iris images database. Experimental results on the challenging CASIA-iris image database demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed, where the overall accuracy results of the recognition rate and error rate are equal to 98. 82 %, 1. 18 % respectively...|$|R

Working within a tradition of cutting with only one pattern piece, established by French costume designer Genevieve Sevin-Doering, the project developed out of a selection Rickard's pattern archive. Instead of seeing print design and pattern cutting as two separated activities the cutting pattern becomes the print, which then becomes the cutting template. A printed line replaces the cutting line and no fabric is cut away {{in the making of}} the garments. The printed patterns are exhibited in there own right alongside with the garments made out of them.

40|$|Although Walter Benjamin argues printed {{materials}} are without traditional art authority or aura, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg’s work {{exists in the}} tradition of high art despite their use of mass-produced materials. Johns and Rauschenberg rely on the distracted attention of the viewer in the age of reproduction to engender reassessment of materials in their works. They use objects that contribute to the new distracted audience but create works that force the viewer toward intense contemplation; their works also combat trends Benjamin identifies to stake their claim as artists of original works while remaining relevant to the modern era. Johns <b>merges</b> <b>print,</b> mechanized reproduction, painting, and sculpture to subvert and reaffirm his place as the artist of an auratic object.

50|$|The {{publishing}} {{section was}} established in 1948 to invigorate the organization’s publishing activities. S. S. Shleymovich {{was the first to}} head it. In 1968, as the amount of publications by the USSR AS Karelian Branch grew substantially, the publishing section was transformed into the Editorial and Publishing Department (EPD). In 1971 the EPD became authorized to publish the journal of proceedings of the Karelian Branch. In 1973 the instant printing shop was set up to publish collected volumes and monographic books without having to engage external book publishers. The number of limited circulation editions (express publication of research results, pre-prints of conference papers and abstracts, etc.) increased remarkably. In 1992 the Editorial and Publishing Department and the instant <b>printing</b> shop were <b>merged</b> into one unit to promote the efficiency of their operation. The time period from manuscript submission to final product became much shorter, the entire publishing process was optimized. A new phase in EPD development started in the 1990s with the onset of the computer era. Technical facilities of the editorial group were updated. Layout and design were computerized. Through renovation of the publishing process the quality of the printed products was notably improved, their volumes enlarged and the preparation and production cycle shortened. The EPD now implements the entire book publishing cycle. The principal concern for the EPD is to produce its editions so that they meet all modern standards.|$|R
40|$|For my thesis, I have {{developed}} a sales promotional package utilizing print and interactive media. Because technology is rapidly changing, I utilized multimedia and <b>print</b> media, by <b>merging</b> them into one project. For this interactive/print project, I created a marketing sales package that markets handcrafted jewelry to wholesale buyers. The two media interact as a buying source that is easily and inexpensively sent to the buyers. This service is very unique, and also provides buyers with alternatives to buying and viewing at the annual shows. The user can purchase wholesale handcrafted jewelry from their office or home without having to travel. In addition, BEYOND TRADITIONS, {{the name of the}} company, provides the crafters with a broader base market to sell their jewelry collections. The package contains a publication made up of portraits of different artists, along with a brief summary of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s background and jewelry samples. It will be used as a reference tool for the buyer. A computer flop py disk is enclosed, and contains an animation as an introduction, along with sections to display each artist 2 ̆ 7 s jewelry collection, prices for the craft goods and an ordering form that can be printed out and faxed back to BEYOND TRADITIONS. By reviewing the information in the interactive catalog, in combination with the brochure, the wholesale buyer will have a total reference of the finished artist 2 ̆ 7 s work. This service is provided by BEYOND TRADITIONS, who will develop the brochure and interactive catalog on a quarterly basis. Both artists and wholesalers can subscribe to this service, and benefit from its circulation.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{we all share}} their importance: We {{processes}} of memory formation, transformation and de-formation through time from a neuro-psychological, philosophical and design point of view. The findings reveal the influence of memory in relation to time and emotion not only on everyday life, identity and heritage but also on emotional product attachment. Memorizing {{is a process of}} sensory and emotional stimulation, recording and recalling. autobiographic memories are complex structures of emotionally loaded fragments that are constantly in the process of rearranging, fading and transforming. although memories are highly individual, they are nevertheless formed, reproduced, discussed and remembered together with the other human beings, and indulge in nostalgia and struggle with memory loss. Memory has the ability to move us, gives us stability in our flux environment and connects us with it. The entire human identity builds around the preservation of individual and collective memory, in narratives, archives, photo collections, backup hard-drives and artefacts. This theoretical background contributes to the practise- driven research that concludes in a practical womenswear fashion collection. The collection is analysed along the concepts of memory, time and emotion due to its practical aspects of colour, material, silhouette and cut. The materials used — particularly animal materials such as wool, silk, mohair, and leather — carry traditional and historical associations. Textural surfaces directly affect the emotional experience of wearing the clothes through sensory stimulation. The colours of the collection range from navy blue to turquoise, burgundy, and bright orange and stand for the expressive emotional dimension of memory, as they are emotive and stimulating, especially in combination and in contrast with each other. The blue and orange tones of the collection merge in a digital <b>print,</b> like memories <b>merge</b> and diffuse through and with time. The watercolour-themed print plays with pseudo- organic shapes in order to provoke associations through faint resemblance to familiar objects. The silhouettes of the collection are fairly sculptural, suggesting stability and continuity, while combining soft and origami-like drapes as an allegory of complexity and movement, as well as ‘missing pieces’ of dress referring to lost memories. Together with other details of cut, such as transformable and dysfunctional components as well as sharp collars and tailored elements, the collection combines familiarity and alienation, repetition and development, tradition and futurism. The completed collection was analyzed on two different levels, the conceptual and the empirical: it simultaneously functions as an artistic artefact created through the designer’s own interpretations as well as a future experienced and worn design product due to its intrinsic function of clothing. These two perspectives are discussed in the scope of past and future, sympathetic and empathic design, and individuality and conformity...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is an emerging technology {{which can lead to}} an eruptive change of lifestyle and medication of population against the traditional medical laboratory. Since living organisms are intrinsically flexible and malleable, the flexible substrate is a necessity for successful integration of electronics in biological systems that do not cause discomfort during prolonged use. Isotropic conductive adhesives (ICAs) are attractive to wearable POCT devices because ICAs are environmentally friendly and allow a lower processing temperature than soldering which protects heat-sensitive components. Vertical interconnections and optical interconnections are considered as the technologies to realise the miniaturised high-performance devices for the future applications. This thesis focused on the multifunctional integration to enable both electrical and optical vertical interconnections through one via hole that can be fabricated in flexible substrates. The functional properties of the via and their response to the external loadings which are likely encountered in the POCT devices are the primary concerns of this PhD project. In this thesis, the research of curing effect on via performance was first conducted by studying the relationship between curing conditions and material properties. Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis results, two-parameter autocatalytic model (Sestak-Berggren model) was established as the most suitable curing process description of our typical ICA composed of epoxy-based binders and Ag filler particles. A link between curing conditions and the mechanical properties of ICAs was established based on the DMA experiments. A series of test vehicles containing vias filled with ICAs were cured under varying conditions. The electrical resistance of the ICA filled vias were measured before testing and in real time during thermal cycling tests, damp heat tests and bending tests. A simplified model was derived to represent rivet-shaped vias in the flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) based on the assumption of homogenous ICAs. An equation was thus proposed to evaluate the resistance of the model. Vias with different cap sizes were also tested, and the equation was validated. Those samples were divided into three groups for thermal cycling test, damp heat ageing test and bending test. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to aid better understanding of the electrical conduction mechanisms. Based on theoretical equation and simulation model, the fistula-shape ICA via was fabricated in flexible PCB. Its hollow nature provides the space for integrations of optical or fluidic circuits. Resistance measurements and reliability tests proved that carefully designed and manufactured small bores in vias did not comprise the performance. Test vehicles with optoelectrical vias were made through two different approaches to prove the feasibility of multifunctional vertical interconnections in flexible substrates. A case study was carried out on reflection Photoplethysmography (rPPG) sensors manufacturing, using a specially designed optoelectronic system. ICA-based low-temperature manufacture processes were developed to enable the integration of these flexible but delicate substrates and components. In the manufacturing routes, a modified stencil <b>printing</b> setup, which <b>merges</b> two printing-curing steps (vias forming and components bonding) into one step, was developed to save both time and energy. The assembled probes showed the outstanding performance in functional and physiological tests. The results from this thesis are anticipated to facilitate the understanding of ICA via conduction mechanism and provide an applicable tool to optimise the design and manufacturing of optoelectrical vias...|$|R
