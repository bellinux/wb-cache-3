40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{work has been done}} to explore the hormetic {{potential}} of various herbicides to enhance crop growth and yield. However, the growth stimulatory potential of plant-released <b>phytotoxins</b> at low rates to enhance crop yield has not yet been realized, as most of the research has focused on the herbicidal potential of these <b>phytotoxins.</b> However, hormesis of plant-released <b>phytotoxins</b> is a more practical aspect, as these are present at low concentrations in field conditions. These <b>phytotoxins</b> are biodegradable and safe for the environment, and have the potential for crop enhancement both under controlled and field conditions. Low doses of plant-released <b>phytotoxins</b> have been reported to enhance crop growth by up to 50 % under controlled conditions, and crop yield by up to 42 % under field conditions. In this review, we have discussed hormesis of plant-released <b>phytotoxins</b> with examples. In addition, we discuss the potential for crop enhancement, the influence of different factors on the expression of hormesis, as well as the potential for both undesirable (in weeds) and desirable hormesis (in crop plants). The use of plant-released <b>phytotoxins</b> as growth regulators is also discussed, focusing on sustainable crop production. In future, <b>phytotoxins</b> may be utilized as a crop stimulator to enhance crop yield, especially in organic crop production systems...|$|R

Nontoxigenic fungi also produce bioactive metabolites with potential fungicide and insecticide activity, and could be applied for crop protection.
