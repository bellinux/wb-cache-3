50|$|Carbohydrates not digested in {{the small}} intestine, {{including}} resistant starch foods such as <b>potato,</b> <b>bean,</b> oat, wheat flour, and several monosaccharide oligosaccharides and starch, are digested in a variable when they reach the large intestine. The bacterial flora metabolize these compounds anaerobically {{in the absence of}} oxygen. This produces gases (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) and short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate). The gases are absorbed and excreted by breathing or through the anus (flatulence). Fatty acids are rapidly metabolized. Butyrate is used mainly by cells in the colon and acetate is absorbed into the blood and taken up by the liver, muscle and other tissue. Propionate is an important precursor of glucose in some animals, but not humans.|$|E

Its vine can grow to 1-6 m long, with pinnate leaves 8-15 cm long with 5-7 leaflets. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or red-brown, and are produced in dense racemes 7.5-13 cm in length. The fruit is a legume (pod) 5-13 cm long. Botanically speaking, the tubers are rhizomatous stems, not roots. Its natural range is from Southern Canada (including Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick) down through Florida and West as far as the border of Colorado.|$|E

40|$|The {{insoluble}} extensin {{matrix of}} dicot cell wails {{has been studied}} most fruitfully by examining the salt-extractable precursors to this matrix. Multiple extensin-like hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) have been isolated, or their existence inferred, from tomato, <b>potato,</b> <b>bean,</b> soybean, melon, carrot, and other plants. We and others previously have studied a carrot extensin which we call extensin- 1. Here {{we report on the}} properties of extensin- 2, a second salt-extractable hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein from carrot. Like extensin- 1, extensin- 2 contains large amounts of hydroxyproline, serine, histidine, and lysine. In contrast, its tyrosine content is only about one-third that of extensin-l. Arabinose and alactose are the most abundant neutral sugars in both proteins, and nearly identical buoyant densities in CsCI suggest a similar proportion of carbohydrate in each. The size of extensin- 2 is about half the size of extensin- 1 based on: (a) the measured lengths of shadowed molecules (about 40 versus 84 nanometers); (b) the migrtion of extensin- 2 in acidurea gels relative to monomers, dimers, and trimers of extensin-l; and (c) the Stokes' radii of these molecules as determined by gel filtration chromatography. Electron microscopy of shadowed extensin- 2 molecules indicates that they contain kinks, which may indicate the presence of intramolecular isodityrosine cross-links, but intermolecular cross-links, either with other extensin- 2 molecules or extensin- 1 molecules, are observed rarely if ever...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} survey of 820 Boro (winter rice), <b>potato,</b> <b>bean,</b> eggplant, cabbage, sugarcane, and mango farmers in Bangladesh, over 47 percent of farmers were found to be overusing pesticides. With only 4 percent of farmers {{formally}} trained in pesticide use or handling, and over 87 percent openly admitting to using little or no protective measures while applying pesticides, overuse is potentially a threatening problem to farmer health as well as the environment. To model pesticide overuse, the authors used a 3 -equation, trivariate probit framework, with health effects and misperception of pesticide risk as endogenous dummy variables. Health effects (the first equation) were found to be strictly a function of the amount of pesticides used in production, while misperception of pesticide risk (the second equation) was determined by health impairments from pesticides and the toxicity of chemicals used. Pesticide overuse (the third equation) was significantly determined by variation in income, farm ownership, the toxicity of chemicals used, crop composition, and geographical location. The results highlight the necessity for policymakers to design effective and targeted outreach programs that deal specifically with pesticide risk, safe handling, and averting behavior. Ideally, the approach would be participatory in nature to address key informational gaps, as well as increasing a farmers'awareness retention. The results also point to specific crops and locations experiencing a higher prevalence of overuse-bean and eggplant in general-and overall production in the districts of Chapainawabganj, Chittagong, Comilla, Jessore, Narshingdi, Rajshahi, and Rangpur. Focusing efforts in these crop and geographical areas may have the most measurable effects on pesticide overuse.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State UniversitySmallholder {{farmers in}} southeastern Africa are {{constrained}} by poor rainwater-use efficiency, soil degradation, and limited financial resources. Conservation agriculture (CA), {{based on the}} principles of minimal soil disturbance, year-round ground cover, and diverse crop rotations, is being promoted to sustainably improve crop production, food security, and smallholder farm income. Adoption of CA principles in the region has predominately been limited to eliminating tillage and retaining residues, with little adoption of crop rotations. In this study, three cropping systems [...] continuous no-till maize, CA rotation, and conventional tillage rotation [...] were established on smallholder farms in the Nkhotakota and Dowa districts, two distinct agro-ecological zones in Malawi. Three-year crop rotations of cassava, cowpea, and maize and cassava, soybean, maize were implemented in CA and conventional tillage, respectively, in Nkhotakota. In Dowa, a 3 -year rotation of sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>bean,</b> and maize was implemented in both CA and conventional tillage. Cropping systems were analyzed for their impacts on crop production, soil-water relations, soil quality, and financial returns from 2011 to 2014. No-till maize and CA improved infiltration and the soil water balance compared to conventional tillage in Nkhotakota but did not affect soil-water relations in Dowa. No-till maize and CA increased exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and reduced soil erosion compared to conventional tillage. In no-till maize, retention of low quality residue resulted in N immobilization. Conservation agriculture improved plant available N and nutrient cycling compared to no-till maize, but less residue cover increased bulk density compared to no-till maize and conventional tillage. Soils in conventional tillage had the most plant available N, which could lead to N leaching and reduced fertilizer-use efficiency. Tillage and residue management did not affect yields of cassava, sweet potato, cowpea, soybean, or bean. Crop rotation, regardless of tillage practice, increased maize yields compared to no-till maize. Net revenue was highest in no-till maize and labor productivity and gross margins were higher in no-till and conventional tillage than in CA rotation. Before widespread adoption of CA can occur, {{further research is needed to}} improve alternative crop production under CA management and identify the most appropriate agroecological zones for successful CA.
