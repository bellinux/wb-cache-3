40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the process of retronasal olfaction, flavor release from skimmed milk and full fat milk (containing 3. 75 % fat) was {{investigated}} using a model mouth system with a screw plunger. Large differences were determined in the quantity of flavor released using two different methods: with screw plunger movement, which represents "retronasal" flavor release, and without the screw plunger, which represents "orthonasal" flavor release. The screw <b>plunger</b> <b>motion</b> accelerated the release of diacetyl and 2 -heptanone in both skimmed and full fat milk. The amount of diacetyl released was not influenced by the fat content of the milk in either case (with or without screw plunger operation), while the amount of 2 -heptanone released was lower in full fat milk both with and without screw <b>plunger</b> <b>motion.</b> The influence of fat content {{on the amount of}} flavor released was explained by the lipophilicity of the flavor components, and mass transfer also contributed to release of the hydrophilic flavor compoun...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} flow of molten metal in the shot sleeve of horizontal high-pressure die-casting machines during the injection process. The analysis of the wave of molten metal created by <b>plunger</b> <b>motion</b> can be of help in reducing porosity in manufactured parts caused by entrapment in the molten metal of a certain amount of the initial air in the die cavity and in the shot sleeve. The amount of trapped air can be reduced by selecting appropriate operating conditions during the injection process, which are mainly determined by the law of <b>plunger</b> <b>motion,</b> the initial shot sleeve filling fraction, and the geometrical characteristics of the shot sleeve. The proposed model, which considers the problem as two-dimensional, is based on the conservation equations of mass and momentum, and treats the free surface using a capturing method (Scalar Equation Method). Surface tension and solidification effects are neglected. Different approaches are considered to simulate <b>plunger</b> <b>motion,</b> in which either the plunger surface or the end wall of the sleeve moves and contracts a Cartesian grid. In the second case, a horizontal body force per unit mass is introduced and the plunger is assumed to be at rest. When numerical results for the wave profile were compared with those obtained using an analytical model based on the shallow-water approximation, and also with numerical results obtained from a CFD code specifically designed for free-surface flow modeling, a good degree of agreement was found.

40|$|The Distromet {{disdrometer}} model RD- 80 and NovaLynx {{tipping bucket}} rain gauge model 260 - 2500 E- 12 are two devices deployed {{a few meters}} apart to measure the character and amount of liquid precipitation. The main purpose of the disdrometer is to measure drop size distribution, which it does over 20 size classes from 0. 3 mm to 5. 4 mm. The data from both instruments can be used to determine rain rate. The disdrometer results {{can also be used to}} infer several properties including drop number density, radar reflectivity, liquid water content, and energy flux. Two coefficients, N 0 and Λ, from an exponential fit between drop diameter and drop number density, are routinely calculated. Data are collected once a minute. The instruments make completely different kinds of measurements. Rain that falls on the disdrometer sensor moves a plunger on a vertical axis. The disdrometer transforms the <b>plunger</b> <b>motion</b> into electrical impulses whose strength is proportional to drop diameter. The rain gauge is the conventional tipping bucket type. Each tip collects an amount equivalent to 0. 01 in. of water, and each tip is counted by a data acquisition system anchored by a Campbell CR 1000 data logger...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{new type}} of {{alternative}} fuel direct injection injector actuated by a permanent magnet (PM) <b>plunger</b> bi-directional <b>motion</b> actuator has been developed and investigated. The project composes of the development of the novel PM <b>plunger</b> bi-directional <b>motion</b> actuator, with mathematical modeling and physical analysis, including the system nonlinear magnetic characteristics. The research demonstrated that this new type of PM plunger actuator could implement bi-directional motion when a properly defined bi-directional voltage is applied to the solenoid. The simulation results and experimental results matched well and validated that the mathematical model of the PM <b>plunger</b> bi-directional <b>motion</b> actuator is appropriate, which can be used as an aid for future design purposes. Moreover, the simulation results show that the injector employing the bi-directional motion actuator can significantly improve the injector closing speed and reduce post-injectio...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop a specific modelling approach capable of reducing the size of the fuel injector solenoid device while improving its response time and attraction force. Several developed modelling and simulation procedures have focused on various aspects of solenoid component modifications in order to develop an evolution process of miniaturising a fuel injector solenoid, using the latest finite element method (FEM) tool software. The specific factors that influenced the optimum operation of the fuel injector solenoid were the geometrical shape of individual solenoid components, material properties, air-gap constraints, boundary conditions, current source conditions, mass constants, and damping coefficients of the plunger. The attraction force distribution in the main air-gap was directly influenced by the taper angle of the 2 D and 3 D plunger pole faces, plunger length and the permanent magnetism. The precise definition of the electro-mechanical <b>motion</b> of <b>plunger</b> was of enormous importance in reducing the fuel injector solenoid response time, closely related to stroke and mass of the <b>plunger,</b> spring characteristics, <b>motion</b> and rebound of the plunger. Using the developed approach, the initial size of the fuel injector has been reduced by 35 %, the attraction force increased by 26 % and the response time reduced by 76 %. However, by frequently repeating the design trials and conducting a thorough experimental investigation, the final minimum response time was achieved by the virtual rebound delay model. The reduction in response time from the &# 039;optimal&# 039; experimental to virtual model was by 35 %. The simplicity and effectiveness of the developed methods, allowed for quick and accurate evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} need {{of improving}} quality in high-pressure die casting (HPDC) has been boosting {{the development of}} models to predict the final outcome and to optimize the process. It is hence promising the use of simplified behavioural models, denoted metamodels, which are abstract descriptions of HPDC. These models represent the relation between some influential process parameters and the final quality, with algebraic explicit equations obtained through least-square regression. The recent researches {{carried out by the}} Authors have identified these influential parameters, which represent the physical phenomena responsible for the casting quality. In contrast with the literature, these parameters employ physical quantities that are not instantaneous values of directly measured variables, but rather exploit signal processing and have an integral nature. These results solve the crux in the synthesis of metamodels, i. e. the definition of the correct independent parameters, which is here solved by transforming those adopted for the design of experiment (DOE), through nonlinear relations based on physical considerations. Besides showing some experimental results, the paper outlines a novel paradigm to HPDC optimization. The most influential parameters related to the <b>plunger</b> <b>motion</b> are, in turn, represented through analytical models. Then, once that these parameters are properly chosen, process control can be performed through the injection machine controller and process can be optimized by selecting in advance the best parameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-pressure}} die casting, the <b>plunger</b> <b>motion</b> profile plays {{a prominent}} role in determining the quality of components and the speed is often adopted to estimate the mechanical strength. However, the investigation of just the effect of the instantaneous maximum speed during the die cavity filling is not exhaustive to obtain reliable correlations between the process and the quality of castings. As a matter of fact, the final quality is affected by the whole process or at least by some meaningful parts having finite durations. To this purpose, this paper accounts for the effect of the plunger speed through a prediction metamodel based on the estimation of the energy associated to the flow forces over the whole cycle. Additionally, the analytical computation of such a parameter is proposed, to be used also in the a priori process optimization and to show how the proposed parameter is related to those usually adopted in literature and by practitioners. The resulting metamodelling approach differs from the typical ones adopted and allows for the development of effective models with low-order response surface. The model proposed has been then validated through a wide experimental campaign. The quality of the castings obtained has been evaluated by measuring the tensile properties. Moreover, some metallographic and fractographic analyses have been carried out in order to investigate the microstructural features of selected castings. The experimental evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of the analytical model proposed and of the energy associated to the flow forces as an influential factor...|$|E
