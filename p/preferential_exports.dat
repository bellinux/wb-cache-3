40|$|Options {{for reform}} of the EU sugar regime were {{reported}} by the UK Sugar Traders website on March 25 th 2003 following receipt {{of the first of}} two studies. These studies are intended to lay the basis for Commission proposals in July 2003 for {{reform of the}} EU Sugar regime. This first report raises doubts about the data used {{as the basis for the}} modelling exercises undertaken within the framework of the study, including doubts about whether the model used gives an accurate guide to the likely impact on sugar-sector reform on ACP countries and EBA sugar beneficiaries. The EC's own review, looking at four options for the future of the sugar regime, can be accessed via the Sugar Traders website. The first option considered is the 'status quo' option involving extending the current regulatory framework beyond June 30 th 2006. In the context of the EBA, WTO limits on export refunds and a successful challenge to the EU's 'C' exports, the report suggests that sugar production in Europe would be gradually abandoned if the 'status quo' is maintained. The second option considered is a 'liberalisation' option, involving 'abolishing domestic price support for sugar and beet, as well as ending production quotas and quantitative and tariff restrictions on trade'. It concludes that 'in the absence of any protection, domestic sugar prices would fall into line with world market prices. At that price level the European market would remain attractive to the most competitive exporters, such as Brazil. Their exports would come to replace the majority of <b>preferential</b> <b>exports</b> from ACP countries, India and LDCs, whose production costs are considerably higher'. It is concluded that the 'liberalisation' option would 'lead to a reduction in sources of supply, which would expose the European and world markets more directly to the consequences of a single large exporter country's climatic, economic and political risks. ' If EU sugar farmers were to be compensated in line with CAP reform in other sectors then the budgetary costs would prove to be very high given the scale of the price reductions which would occur. In addition the report points out 'it would be necessary to examine the need for measures to alleviate the effects of the drastic fall in income derived from preferential imports at guaranteed prices by ACP countries and LDCs'. The report points out that 'if liberalisation were implemented gradually, with a sufficiently long transitional period, the accompanying measures could be more limited; in particular, it would be possible for them not to include financial compensation'. In terms of down-stream linkages, European manufacturers would find their profitability severely jeopardised, with closure of isolated production units leading to a complete cessation of beet cultivation in some areas. A third option considered is that of returning to a system of 'fixed quotas'. This would require going back on commitments made under the EBA. According to the report 'returning to fixed quotas would entail considerably lower production quotas than at present. Preferential imports would also be subjected to quotas again. The quotas to be negotiated would without doubt have to consolidate the highest export levels attained while taking into account the investment entered into by a number of partners with a view to accessing the European market from 2009 onwards'. Under a return to the 'fixed quotas' option continued tariff protection would be required and, domestic prices would remain lucratively high, which would be good news for some ACP countries. However, it could allow for 'a moderate and gradual fall in guaranteed prices'. Indeed, 'if the reduction in prices were linked to the introduction of direct income subsidies, the option could bring the regulatory system for sugar gradually into line with the support arrangements provided for by the reformed CAP'. A fourth option considered is the 'fall in price' option, modelled on the current rice-sector reform. In this option the Commission points out that 'reducing the domestic price would make it possible to satisfy the external constraints while exerting less pressure on the production level. Depending on the price-level chosen, the European market would become less attractive for quite a large proportion of exporters with high production costs - including a significant proportion of ACP countries'. Under this option the guaranteed price for beet would be abolished. Prices would be determined by negotiations between farmers and millers. To compensate farmers, direct support de-coupled from production would be introduced. However it is recognised that some form of production-linked payments would probably be needed to maintain refineries in certain areas (giving rise to a partial decoupled system). Under this option it is argued that 'in the interests of fairness and to reduce its budgetary cost, direct aid could be modulated and fall rapidly beyond a certain size of holding or amount of direct payment'. In addition 'production quotas would be abolished gradually once the levels of imports and production had stabilised, or could be abolished immediately if part of the compensation per hectare remained linked to the introduction of a maximum area. ' Again this option would have to include compensation to ACP sugar suppliers. Comment: Any option allowing the regulatory system for sugar to be brought into line with that applied to arable crops would be consistent with the Commission's desire to bring sugar into the single decoupled farm payment scheme. Some decline in EU sugar prices does appear to be inevitable regardless of the actual option pursued by the European Commission. Options for reform of the EU sugar regime were reported by the UK Sugar Traders [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Fast {{excitatory}} neurotransmission in the mammalian {{central nervous}} system is mainly mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype (AMPARs). AMPARs are protein complexes of the pore-lining alpha-subunits GluA 1 - 4 and auxiliary beta-subunits modulating their trafficking and gating. By a proteomic approach, two homologues of the cargo exporter cornichon, CNIH- 2 and CNIH- 3, have recently been identified as constituents of native AMPARs in mammalian brain. In heterologous reconstitution experiments, CNIH- 2 promotes surface expression of GluAs and modulates their biophysical properties. However, its relevance in native AMPAR physiology remains controversial. Here, we have studied the role of CNIH- 2 in GluA processing both in heterologous cells and primary rat neurons. Our data demonstrate that CNIH- 2 serves an evolutionarily conserved role as a cargo exporter from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CNIH- 2 cycles continuously between ER and Golgi complex to pick up cargo protein in the ER and then to mediate its <b>preferential</b> <b>export</b> in a coat protein complex (COP) II dependent manner. Interaction with GluA subunits breaks with this ancestral role of CNIH- 2 confined to the early secretory pathway.

Thus, mammalian AMPARs commandeer CNIH- 2 {{for use as a}} bona fide auxiliary subunit that is able to modify receptor signaling...|$|R

Sinking fluxes of {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) and indicator pigments were calculated from 234 Th– 238 U disequilibria and, during two cruises, measured by sediment trap at Ocean Station Papa. POC fluxes at 100 m ranged from 0. 65 – 7. 95 mmol m - 2 d- 1, similar in magnitude to previous results at Line P. Microplankton pigments dominate indicator pigment fluxes (averaging 69 ± 19 % of total pigment flux), while nanoplankton pigments comprised the majority of pigment standing stocks (averaging 64 ± 23 % of total pigment standing stock). Indicator pigment loss rates (the ratio of pigment export flux to pigment standing stock) point to <b>preferential</b> <b>export</b> of larger microplankton relative to smaller nano- and picoplankton.

Rainfall events can lead to erosion of this organic matter form deposited on the soil surface. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify horizontal as well as vertical BC transport during a rainfall simulation experiment with sandy soil in northern Senegal. The conceptual approach consisted of artificial burning of harvested residues, which were subsequently exposed to two different rainfall regimes: with and without occurrence of splash. After the rainfall simulation experiment, we quantified the total amount of carbon added to the soil and chemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC) (1) exported from the plots, (2) infiltated into the soil and (3) remaining on the soil surface. Transport processes affected around 40 - 60 % of the total carbon and BC added. Our results showed that 30 % of the total carbon added by the fire was exported from the site, whereas another 15 % were vertically transported into the soil. BC, which represented about 40 % of the total carbon added, was transported in higher proportions compared to total C (horizontally as well as vertically) when the splash erosion was allowed to occurr. The <b>preferential</b> <b>export</b> of BC was strongly dependent on the rainfall regime: when splash erosion was suppressed, BC export was greatly reduced, whereas BC infiltration increased compared to rainfall with splash occurring.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the link between terrestrial and aquatic phosphorus (P) speciation in the soils and sediments of a subtropical catchment. Specifically, the study aimed to identify {{the relative importance of}} P speciation in source soils, erosion and transport processes upstream, and aquatic transformation processes as determinants of P speciation in lake sediments (Lake Wivenhoe). Using a sequential extraction technique, NH 4 Cl extractable P (NH 4 Cl-P; exchangeable P), bicarbonate-dithionite extractable P (BD-P; reductant soluble P), NaOH extractable P (NaOH-rP; Al/Fe oxide P), HCl extractable P (HCl-P; apatite-P), and residual-P (Res-P; organic and residual inorganic P) fractions were compared in different soil/sediment compartments of the upper Brisbane River (UBR) catchment, Queensland, Australia. Multidimensional scaling identified two distinct groups of samples, one consisting of lake sediments and suspended sediments, and another consisting of riverbed sediments and soils. The riverbed sediments and soils had significantly higher HCl-P and lower NaOH-rP and Res-P relative to the lake and suspended sediments (P < 0. 05). Analysis of the enrichment factors (EFs) of soils and riverbed sediments showed that fine grained particles (< 63 孩 were enriched in all but the HCl-P fraction. This indicated that as finer particles are eroded from the soil surface and transported downstream there is a <b>preferential</b> <b>export</b> of non-apatite P (NaOH-rP, NaOH-nrP, BD-P and Res-P). Therefore, due to the preferential erosion and transport of fine sediments, the lake sediments contained a higher proportion of more labile forms of inorganic-P relative to the broader soil/sediment system. Our results suggest that a greater focus on the effect of selective erosion and transport on sediment P speciation in lakes and reservoirs is needed to better target management strategies aimed at reducing P availability, particularly in P-limited water bodies impacted by soil erosion.

The ATP content in illuminated chloroplasts decreased when the PO 43 - {{concentration in the}} medium was low. The ATP content increased when the PO 43 - concentration was increased. A higher PO 43 -. concentration in the medium was needed to increase the ATP at 5 °C than at 25 °C. This would suggest that PO 43 - deficiency occurs more readily at low than at high temperatures. More 14 C was incorporated into photosynthetic metabolites within the chloroplasts at 5 °C than at 25 °C, indicating decreased assimilate export when the temperature was low. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate was preferentially exported when the PO 43 - concentration enabled {{a high rate of}} photosynthesis at 25 °C.

40|$|International audienceAlthough Ni {{isotopes}} {{have been}} shown to be significantly fractionated in terrestrial samples, their use in continental environmental studies has not yet been evaluated. The present study focuses on an ultramafic (UM) massif (Barro Alto, Goias, Brazil) because such areas are naturally rich in Ni. We present developed lateritic weathering profiles. The goal of the study is to evaluate the potential of using Ni isotopes in environmental continental studies by combining its isotopic signature with mineralogy, in order to better understand the geochemical cycling of Ni in UM settings during weathering. As such, Ni isotope values were measured in samples from the Barro Alto UM complex in the main stages of the lateritic weathering profile of UM rocks, including bedrock, ores (saprolitic and lateritic samples) and soil. The mineralogical composition of the samples, with a focus on the different Ni-bearing minerals, was also determined to decipher the potential links between isotopic fractionation and weathering dynamics. Isotopic signatures (delta Ni- 60) from the natural Ni geochemical cycle include: bedrock samples (delta Ni- 60 = 0. 28 +/- 0. 08 %), ore samples (saprolitic and lateritic, delta Ni- 60 from - 0. 60 to 0. 30 %) and soil samples (delta Ni- 60 from - 0. 19 to - 0. 02 %). An overall trend of heavier isotope depletion was observed in the solid phase during weathering (Delta Ni- 60 (Soil-Bedrock) = - 0. 47 %). The mineralogical results were consistent with the literature and showed that the mineralogy of the lateritic part and soil was dominated by Fe-oxides, whereas clay minerals were the primary Ni phase scavengers in the saprolitic part of the profile. Thus, the formation of Ni-bearing clay minerals and Fe-oxides appeared to lead to depletion in heavier isotopes, which indicates <b>preferential</b> <b>export</b> of heavy isotopes in the dissolved phase. This result is consistent with isotopic signatures measured in the exchangeable pool of the solid phase (Delta Ni- 60 (exch-total) up to 0. 47 %), and Ni isotopes appear to be a promising tracer to better understand the biogeochemical Ni cycling on the Earth's surface...|$|R

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{mammalian}} Golgi apparatus can form de novo from the ER or whether it requires a preassembled Golgi matrix. As a test, we assayed Golgi reassembly after forced redistribution of Golgi matrix proteins into the ER. Two conditions were used. In one, ER redistribution was achieved {{using a combination of}} brefeldin A (BFA) to cause Golgi collapse and H 89 to block ER export. Unlike brefeldin A alone, which leaves matrix proteins in relatively large remnant structures outside the ER, the addition of H 89 to BFA-treated cells caused ER accumulation of all Golgi markers tested. In the other, clofibrate treatment induced ER redistribution of matrix and nonmatrix proteins. Significantly, Golgi reassembly after either treatment was robust, implying that the Golgi has the capacity to form de novo from the ER. Furthermore, matrix proteins reemerged from the ER with faster ER exit rates. This, together with the sensitivity of BFA remnants to ER export blockade, suggests that presence of matrix proteins in BFA remnants is due to cycling via the ER and <b>preferential</b> ER <b>export</b> rather than their stable assembly in a matrix outside the ER.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an update on}} the main elements of the reform agenda concerning the CEMAC trade regime as well as a tentative quantitative assessment of selected effects on tariff revenues and trade patterns. Notwithstanding data limitations, the key messages from the analysis are as follows. First, {{there is a need for}} a renewed political commitment to regional integration. In addition, key measures for improving compliance with the requirements for a customs union need to be introduced, including limiting tariff exemptions, phasing out remaining surcharges, strengthening the determination of products'' country origin, and enhancing customs administration. There is also a need to improve transportation infrastructure and organization. Finally, there is a strong case for tariff reduction, with or without an EPA.

It highlights structural constraints that are believed to have affected output growth, along with potential sources of increases in output in future years. The paper analyzes trends in the main production sectors, and presents an assessment of the underlying determinants of growth and poverty reduction. It also explores the key elements of the authorities’ strategy to raise GDP per capita growth as set out in the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy.

40|$|The EU grants {{preferential}} {{access to its}} imports from developing countries under several trade agreements. The widest arrangement, in terms of country and product coverage, is the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) through which, since 1971, virtually all developing countries have received <b>preferential</b> treatment when <b>exporting</b> to world markets. This paper evaluates the impact of GSP in enhancing developing countries’ exports to EU markets. It {{is based on the}} estimation of a gravity model for a sample of 769 products exported from 169 countries to EU over the period 2001 - 2004. While, from an econometric point of view, the estimation methods take into account unobservable country heterogeneity as well as the potential selection bias which zero-trade values pose, the empirical setting considers an explicit measure of trade preferences, the margin of preferences. The analysis offers new empirical evidence that the impact of GSP on developing countries’ agricultural exports to the EU is positive. ...|$|R

Results indicate that a large number of EU's RTAs support the agricultural exports of developing countries to the EU market. Thus, RTAs are generally an attractive alternative for countries wishing to speed up the move towards multilateral free trade in agriculture.

5000|$|Beyond {{military}} measures, {{the official}} Portuguese {{response to the}} [...] "winds of change" [...] in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, {{and the creation of}} a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's <b>exports</b> <b>preferential</b> access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed.|$|R

Overall, there is broad compliance with the streamlined and moderate rates, but with significant deviations from the harmonized paths in several countries. WAMZ countries, except Ghana, need to undertake major reforms in order to align their external tariff structures {{with that of the}} WAEMU as planned for 2007. To promote full compliance with the harmonized external tariff policies, the paper suggests, measures need to be taken, including the creation of financial incentives, at the regional and country levels.

40|$|Fuelled by low {{labour costs}} and <b>preferential</b> trade agreements, <b>exports</b> of textile {{products}} originating from Sub-Saharan countries have grown {{dramatically in the}} last decades. This paper analyses some of the implications that export growth in the textile and apparel sector have for social welfare and poverty reduction in Madagascar. The paper proposes a simulation exercise utilising household level data and a methodology that combines the wage premium literature with matching methods. The results point to a large variation {{in the distribution of}} the benefits from export growth, with skilled workers and urban areas benefiting most. From a gender perspective, women are found to benefit substantially less than men. Although total welfare effects are significant, the benefits are largely reaped by non-poor households. From a poverty perspective, export-led growth in the textile and apparel sector is expected to have only a small effect on overall poverty. Copyright 2008 The author 2008.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of sunk costs to <b>exporting,</b> <b>preferential</b> tariff liberalization may have a prolonged, dynamic effect on the pattern of a beneficiary country's <b>exports.</b> In particular, <b>preferential</b> tariff liberalization might trigger a geographic spread of exports to third markets outside the preferential trading area. I test this hypothesis for the pattern of Mexican exports after the inception of NAFTA to several Latin American trading partners. After controlling for product specific shocks and the overall trend in export growth, the evidence {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that initial exports to the United States further prompted exports to third markets. The results suggest a significant impact on exports to large or geographically proximate countries (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama). The stunning growth in the extensive margin as a count measure owes much to rather simple goods, while more sophisticated goods exert a substantial impact on the value of Mexican exports. The findings also document the existence of considerable tariff-induced trade diversion for goods with little skill or technology content.

40|$|The changes {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} EU Common Market Organization for sugar will interact with preferential imports from developing countries and least developed countries that enjoy <b>preferential</b> treatment for <b>exports</b> to the EU, {{as well as by}} trade and adjustment costs. This paper focuses on the impact of the EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Least Developed Countries. Simulations are run with an empirical model structure comprising a partial equilibrium model for the world sugar market and a gravity model to replicate least developed countries bilateral trade with Europe. Particularly, the gravity approach is employed to model the abolition of import tariffs for sugar originating in least developed countries, subject to trade costs, while the partial equilibrium approach is employed to assess the effects of EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on world markets. Results suggest that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will experience significant reduction in their export revenue, whilst the initial impact on least developed countries may be limited but increasing in the medium run.
