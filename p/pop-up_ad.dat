40|$|Abstract—Social media {{platforms}} such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Linkedln, and Youtube {{have attracted}} {{substantial number of}} users, many of whom spend several hours daily on these platforms. These platforms have therefore become fertile grounds for marketers/advertisers to target different types of customers. However, {{the impact of these}} ads has become more and more pervasive. The study therefore explores the influence of online advertising, especially <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> on the purchase behavior of social media users. A sample of social media users who are familiar with these online ads were drawn from a public university in Ghana. The findings reveal that social media users perceive online <b>ads,</b> especially <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> as intrusive and ineffective. Also the study establishes that <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> have little impact on the purchase behavior of social media users since a negative attitude has been formed towards <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads.</b> Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended, among other things, that advertisers should design <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> that are user friendly and less intrusive.

Some lifetime subscribers were upset that they had already paid for a service based upon their previous ad-free experience, while others argued that they had purchased the service for the specific purpose of dodging advertisements.

5000|$|Pop-under ads {{are similar}} to <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads,</b> but the ad window appears hidden behind the main browser window rather than {{superimposed}} in front of it. As <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> became widespread and took up whole computer screens, many users learned to immediately close the popup ads that appeared over a site without looking at them. Pop-under ads do not immediately impede the view of content, but remain unnoticed until the user closes or minimizes the main browser window.|$|R

The article earned him $1,500 and feedback from developers, which together acted as seed money and motivation for establishing the FusionCharts concept.|$|E

50|$|Pop-up {{advertising}} provides {{derivative works}} {{that can be}} transformative, in that they provide the public with new functionality not previously offered — they may provide comparative price information, for example. Yet, pop-ups may also impair interests of the proprietors of Web pages subjected to them. For example, the Half.com <b>pop-up</b> <b>ad</b> shown above left informs the public as to price competition between Half.com and Amazon.com. But the derivative-work version of Amazon's web page partially covers up Amazon's advertising (at least temporarily) and adversely affects Amazon's investment interest in the preparation and maintenance of its web page. This may present a more difficult case of balancing interests than that which the court faced in Arriba Soft or Perfect 10.|$|E
40|$|Faced with an {{abundance}} of advertising messages, Internet users allocate only minimal cognitive resources to advertising. What are the effects of <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> for a new brand viewed at low-level attention, and then measured when the Internet users have forgotten having seen them? In the theoretical context of processing fluency and implicit memory, the experiment (n = 398) studied the effects of repeated brief exposure to different types of content (words/image) in <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> 7 days and 3 months after exposure. The results show the overall positive effects of the pop-ups, the superiority of the image over words for effects on attitude toward the brand and the purchase intentions; but the words produce more semantic effects than the image...|$|R

This software was often bundled with freeware which the user intentionally installed; since permission {{to install the}} 180solutions adware was typically hidden in an EULA, most users were unaware they were installing adware. In some cases 180solutions' software was installed as a standalone install. Using this method, an ActiveX prompt simply asked the user to install the software {{so that they could}} receive [...] "comparison shopping advertisements." [...] 180solutions contended that the value of the bundled software or the advertisements made up for the inconvenience of the <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads.</b> The value of this trade-off was contested by critics of the adware business model.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{way that}} Personal Antivirus {{installs}} itself {{on a computer}} is through a malicious <b>pop-up</b> <b>ad</b> (though {{it may also be}} installed as part of a malicious video codec package). When a user visits a website hosting a Personal Antivirus ad, a pop-up window appears, claiming to be scanning the computer for virus infections. This [...] "scan" [...] inevitably finds a number of virus infections. Afterward, the user is told that they need to buy Personal Antivirus to clean these infections, and is directed to a site that accepts payments. If the user decides to buy and install the program, Personal Antivirus claims to have repaired the infections, but also regularly advertises additional programs or demands more money at regular intervals.|$|E

Since internet advertising is a rapidly growing industry in transitional economies like Vietnam, there is an emerging call for further study about the effectiveness of advertising on news portal websites, which are usually top accessed web pages. Data were gathered from an online survey of 200 respondents to compare attitudinal forms towards traditional banner ads, in-line <b>ads</b> and <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads.</b> The research applies the attitudinal dimensions of information, irritation and entertainment. Findings indicate a somewhat positive attitude towards traditional banner ads with high informative value and negative attitude towards <b>pop-up</b> <b>ads</b> with irritating attitude. Besides, entertainment is not evaluated as a significant attitudinal form of web advertising...|$|R
