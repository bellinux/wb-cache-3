Circulation water, condensed water, pulp press water {{and others are}} used in technological processes. Water plays the main role in physical, chemical, thermotechnical processes of beet processing and sugar production. As a consequence of accession of Russia to the WTO the technical requirements for production processes are changing. The enforcements of ecological services to balance scheme of water consumption and water disposal increased. The reduction of fresh <b>water</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{is one of the}} main tasks in economy of sugar industry. The substantial role in fresh <b>water</b> <b>expenditure</b> is played by efficiency of cooling and aeration processes of conditionally clean waters of the 1 st category.

The proposed method includes an investigation of the <b>water</b> <b>expenditure</b> and an evaluation of the particularities of each building. The investigation was accomplished in thirty buildings and the collected data allowed a classification of the buildings and a measurement of the water consumption rate. The water consumption in buildings with individualized and collective water measurement systems was analyzed. Furthermore, a comparative study was done between the water consumption in buildings that have at least one pool and buildings without any pools. Some buildings in the sample have an alternative water supply system; however there is no measurement of the water consumption in none of the cases analyzed in this study. The per capita consumption was 224 liters per person per day. The buildings with individualized water measurement had smaller consumption per capita than the buildings with collective measurement, showing a reduction of about 34 %. The buildings with pools had consumption per capita nearly 48 % more than the per capita consumption in buildings without pools...|$|R

25|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{affordability}} of water and sewer bills in Latin America. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) analyzed multi-purpose household surveys conducted between 1995 and 1999 in 10 countries to assess the share of household income spent on water supply services. These data show that the <b>expenditures</b> on <b>water</b> vary between 0.4% of total expenditures in rural Panama to 3.0% in Kingston, Jamaica. For the households in the poorest income decile <b>expenditures</b> on <b>water</b> are higher, varying from 0.6% in rural Panama to 6.5% in Kingston, Jamaica. However, these figures have to be interpreted with caution. First, {{it is not clear}} how <b>water</b> <b>expenditures</b> were defined in the surveys. It seems that in some cases expenditures to buy bottled water and water from tankers were included, while in other cases they were excluded. Second, the sample includes both households with and without access to piped water systems. Therefore, especially in rural areas where coverage tends to be low, the shares are only a poor indication on the affordability of water bills. Third, it is not explicit if sewer bills are included in the analysis, although this is most likely the case, since sewer bills are always a surcharge on the water bill and are thus perceived by most households as part of their <b>water</b> <b>expenditures.</b>|$|R

25|$|Combined {{water and}} sewer bills amount, on average, to less than 0.5% of total {{household}} expenditures and are thus quite affordable. The intermittent supply leads many to rely on bottled or tanked water, which is about 8 to 10 times higher than piped water, so that total household expenditures are often {{much higher than the}} utility bill. Prices paid to water vendors are 4 to 8 JD per m3. In 2007 it was estimated that an average poor household with 6 members in the Middle Governorates spends 31-39 JD per year on its {{water and sewer}} bill at a consumption of 70 liter/capita/day, corresponding to only 0.4% of household expenditures. However, if other items are added the picture changes substantially: it costs 35 JD per year to depreciate the cost of a 2 m3 rooftop storage tank over 10 years; 160 JD per year to buy 2 liters/capita/day of bottled water at a price of 0.04 JD per liter (0.80 JD per canister of 5 gallons); and 153 JD per year to buy the equivalent of 28 liters/capita/day at a price of 2.50 JD/m3 from water vendors. This amounts to 374 JD per year and household, corresponding to 6.3% of expenditures. In addition, for households not connected to the sewer network the cost of emptying septic tanks at a cost between 21 and 40 JD per load needs to be added to calculate total <b>water</b> and sanitation <b>expenditures.</b> In conclusion, the cost of the water bill thus is only a fraction of total <b>water</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and household <b>water</b> <b>expenditures</b> could be lowered significantly if a sufficient quantity of good quality water was supplied on a reliable basis.|$|R

Fifteen options of connection were calculated. In the assessment of water resources the runoff in basins of Shu and Talas rivers was calculated for the period since 1930 and earlier, however the reliable series of <b>water</b> <b>expenditure</b> for many observation stations were not obtained, therefore we limited ourselves to the period from 1950 to 2002.|$|R

25|$|According to data {{collected}} by the Pan-American Health Organization based on multi-purpose household surveys, the share of <b>water</b> <b>expenditures</b> in household expenditures in urban areas of Paraguay was the lowest among 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in the late 1990s. The share was on average 1.4% and 1.7% for urban households in the poorest income decile, showing an unusually low difference between the average and poor households. These shares are actually the same or even higher in rural areas, reflecting the unusual high levels of cost recovery in rural areas in Paraguay. Rural households spend on average 1.2% on water, and households in the poorest decile in rural areas spend 2.3% on water. Therefore, despite high levels of cost recovery, tariffs apparently remain affordable.|$|R

Elasticities vary significantly between individual groups, with values ranging from 0. 523 to 0. 716. Furthermore, a large number of technical and socio-demographic factors are significant in determining energy use.

Measures of non-health related water quality (taste, odor, and appearance) are incorporated into the model to account for joint production of utility and health. The model examines the choice between bottled, filtered tap, and unfiltered tap water. Results of the estimation indicated that perceived risk from tap water, concern about water quality (taste, odor, and appearance of tap water), race, and age {{are the most important}} determinants of bottled water selection. Information regarding current or prior problems with tap water, perceived risk from tap water, and income are the most important determinants of water filter selection. Adjusting for quality differences between tap and bottled water, we show that averting costs estimates using bottled <b>water</b> <b>expenditures</b> would lead to an overstatement of avoidance costs by about 12 %.
