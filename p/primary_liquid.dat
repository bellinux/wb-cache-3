Such an experimental {{result is a}} necessary conse-quence of any paradigm in which erupted basalts derive from single-batch <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> that equilibrate with a mantle residue and undergo no subsequent magma mixing before differentiation and eruption.

40|$|Energy {{production}} from fossil fuels results in significant carbon dioxide emission, {{which is a}} key contributor to global warming and the problems related to climate change. Biomass is recognized as {{an important part of}} any strategy to address the environmental issues related to fossil fuels usage for sustainable development. The carbohydrates in lignocellulosic biomass mainly exist as cellulose and hemicellulose. These materials must be broken down through hydrolysis for the production of desired biomass extracts (e. g. sugar products), which can then be converted into ethanol. Developing efficient hydrolysis processes is essential to producing biomass extracts of desired properties. Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, hot compressed water (HCW) may be utilized as both solvent and reactant simultaneously in various applications including hydrolysis. So far, there has been a lack of fundamental understanding of biomass and cellulose hydrolysis in HCW. The present study aims to characterize the formation of glucose oligomers in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products, and to bring some new insights into the reaction mechanisms of cellulose hydrolysis in HCW. The specific objectives of this research include {{the development of a new}} sampling and analytical method to characterise the glucose oligomers in the liquid products, to investigate the formation of precipitate from fresh liquid products, to understand the primary reactions on the surface of reacting cellulose particle during hydrolysis in HCW at various temperatures, to study the significant differences in hydrolysis behavior of amorphous and crystalline portions within microcrystalline cellulose, to investigate the evolution of <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products with conversion, and to study the effect of ball milling on the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in HCW. To accomplish these objectives, a semicontinuous reactor system was developed and set up to carry out the experiments of the hydrolysis of various cellulose samples in HCW. The liquid samples were characterised by a number of analytical instruments, including the introduction of a new technique to analyse the glucose oligomers in the liquid sample. First of all, this study shows the presence of a wide range of glucose oligomers with the degree of polymerizations (DPs) up to 30 and their derivatives in the fresh liquid products, which is produced from cellulose hydrolysis in HCW using a semicontinuous reactor system at 280 °C and 20 MPa, by a high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). None of those oligomers can be detected by a high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD) that however can detect glucose oligomers with DPs up to 6 after the liquid solutions are concentrated by 25 times via vacuum evaporation at 40 °C, during which a large amount of precipitate was formed. While quantitative analysis of the glucose oligomers with DPs > 5 cannot be done due to the lack of standards, that of the glucose oligomers from glucose (DP = 1) to cellopentaose (DP = 5) using both HPAEC-PAD and HPLC-ELSD are in good agreement, suggesting that these low- DP glucose oligomers do not contribute to the precipitate formation. Secondly, the study of a set of purposely-designed precipitation experiments indicates that the precipitation starts as the fresh liquid sample is collected and is fast during the initial 8 hours, levels off as the precipitation time increases further and completes after 120 hours (5 days). Based on a new approach developed for the quantification of glucose oligomers retention during the precipitation process, it is found that the contribution of glucose oligomers to precipitate formation increases with DP. The higher the DP is, the lower the solubility of the glucose oligomer is. The glucose oligomers from glucose to cellopentaose and their derivatives (DPs = 1 - 5) contribute little to the precipitate formation, which explains why HPLC-ELSD can correctly analyze these glucose oligomers in the concentrated solutions prepared by vacuum evaporation. The glucose oligomers and their derivatives with DPs > 5, which are soluble in HCW but become supersaturated in the solutions under ambient conditions, are responsible for precipitate formation. Most (but not all) of the glucose oligomers and their derivatives with DPs > 16 contribute to the precipitate formation as tiny peaks of these glucose oligomers are still shown in the chromatograms, suggesting that these glucose oligomers have very low (but non-zero) solubilities in ambient water. The retentions of glucose oligomers and their derivatives increase substantially with the DP decreasing from 16 to 6, indicating that less of these lower-DP oligomers contribute to the precipitate formation. To avoid the effect of precipitation on oligomer analysis, the fresh liquid products must be analyzed immediately after sample collection. Thirdly, this study reports the experimental results on the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products from the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in HCW at 10 MPa and 230 - 270 °C using a semicontinuous reactor system under optimised reaction conditions. The <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products contain glucose oligomers and their derivatives with a wide range of degrees of polymerization (DPs) from 1 to a maximal DP, which increases with temperature from 23 at 230 °C, to 25 at 250 °C then to 28 at 270 °C. Temperature also has a significant influence on the distribution of glucose oligomers in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products. The results suggest that the hydrolysis reactions proceed on the surface of reacting cellulose particles via the cleavage of the accessible glycosidic bonds within the structure of microcrystalline cellulose in a manner with randomness. Thermal cleavage of glycosidic bonds seems also to occur on the accessible surface of the reacting cellulose particles in a similar manner. The randomness of these reactions seems to be temperature dependent and is likely related to the change in the accessibility of glycosidic bonds as results of the cleavage of hydrogen bonds in the structure of microcrystalline cellulose. The hydrolysis reactions seem also to be accompanied by other parallel reactions (e. g. cross-linking reactions), which may affect the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products as well, particularly at high temperatures. The post hydrolysis of <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products has a high glucose yield of ~ 80 % on a carbon basis, suggesting that combining HCW and enzymatic hydrolysis may be a promising technology for sugar recovery from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Fourthly, this study finds that the reactivity of microcrystalline cellulose exhibits a considerable reduction in the initial stage during hydrolysis in HCW, due to the presence of amorphous structure in microcrystalline cellulose. Further analysis of the liquid products obtained at various temperatures suggests that amorphous portion within microcrystalline cellulose contains some short glucose chain segments hinged with crystalline cellulose via weak bonds (e. g. hydrogen bonds). These short chain segments are reactive components responsible for the formation of C 4 -C 13 in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products during hydrolysis in HCW at temperatures as low as 100 °C. The minimal temperature for breaking the glycosidic bonds in those short chain segments to form glucose monomer from amorphous portion within microcrystalline cellulose is ~ 150 °C. However, the minimal temperature at which glucose monomer starts to be produced from the crystalline portion within microcrystalline cellulose is around 180 °C, apparently due to the limited accessibility of the glycosidic bonds in the crystalline portion to HCW as results of the strong intra- and inter-molecule hydrogen bonding networks. The differences of chain length and hydrogen bonding pattern between amorphous and crystalline cellulose also greatly affects the distribution of glucose oligomers in their liquid products during hydrolysis in HCW. Generally, amorphous cellulose produces more glucose mono- and oligomers at the same hydrolysis temperature, but the selectivity ratios of glucose oligomers in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products from amorphous and crystalline portions do not show a monotonic trend with DP, at least partly resulting from the presence of shorter glucose chain segments in amorphous portion within the microcrystalline cellulose. Fifthly, this study demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the specific reactivity and <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products with conversion during the hydrolysis of both amorphous and crystalline cellulose in HCW. The results suggest the dynamic changes in cellulose structure occur during conversion, and strongly depend on reaction temperature. Results from a set of purposely-designed two-step experiments further confirm at least two mechanisms which may be responsible for such structural changes. One is the selective consumption of the reactive components within the intrinsically heterogeneous cellulose at early conversions. This mechanism dominates during the hydrolysis of at low temperatures, e. g. 180 - 200 °C for amorphous cellulose and 230 °C for microcrystalline cellulose. The other is the combined effects of various parallel reactions during hydrolysis in HCW, including cleavage of hydrogen bonds, degradation reactions and cross-linking reactions. Enhanced hydrogen bond cleavage increases the production of glucose oligomers. However, parallel degradation reactions and cross-linking reactions decrease the selectivities of glucose oligomers. The effect of cross-linking increases significantly with temperature and becomes dominant at high temperature, leading to a structural condensation hence a reduction in the specific reactivity of cellulose and the selectivities of glucose oligomers in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products. Sixthly, this study investigates the effect of ball milling as a pretreatment method on microcrystalline cellulose hydrolysis in HCW. Ball milling leads to a considerable reduction in cellulose particle size and crystallinity therefore a significant increase in the specific reactivity during hydrolysis in HCW. It is found that crystallinity is the dominant factor in determining the hydrolysis reactivity of cellulose in HCW while particle size only plays a minor role. Ball milling also significantly influences the distribution of glucose oligomers in the <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products of hydrolysis. Ball milling increases the selectivities of glucose oligomers at low conversions. At high conversions, the reduction in chain length plays an important role in glucose oligomer formation since cellulose samples become more crystalline. An extensive ball milling completely converts the crystalline cellulose into amorphous cellulose, leading to a significant increase in the formation of high-DP glucose oligomers. It seems that ball milling is a good strategy for improving cellulose hydrolysis reactivity in HCW. Overall, the present research has provided valuable information for the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of cellulose hydrolysis in HCW. The development of a sampling and analytical method makes it possible to characterise the glucose oligomers in the liquid products and understand the formation of precipitate in the liquid products. The <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> products of cellulose hydrolysis in HCW, which were firstly reported in this field, are of great importance to elucidate the primary hydrolysis reactions of cellulose hydrolysis in HCW.

All of these basalts display compositions {{similar to that of}} normal mid-ocean ridge (MOR) tholeiites, and despite the age differences, they seem to be differentiation products of an initial tholeiitic melt of essentially the same composition. According to the suggested petrologic scheme, this initial liquid is derived from dry melting of mantle lherzolite at 10 kb and temperatures about 1270 °C. Basalts of Hole 447 A were formed after a rapid magma injection to shallow depths and cotectic olivine-plagioclase crystallization at 1 atm, whereas Parece Vela basalts were derived from anchieutectic clinopyroxene-plagioclase-olivine crystallization at intermediate pressures (from 5 kb- 1 atm).

Formulations containing lactose were agglomerated using 5 different amounts of the PEG binder solution, giving rise to a PEG content in the range of 6 % to 43 % (wt/wt). The process outcome was characterized according to adhesion, yield, and water requirement, and the prepared granules were characterized according to size, size distribution, and flow properties as well as tableting properties. The agglomeration of all mixtures resulted in high yields of free-flowing agglomerates and gave rise to good reproducibility of the investigated agglomerate characteristics.

40|$|The {{shape of}} a liquid jet is {{strongly}} influenced by primary breakup close to the nozzle. Especially for microscale and highly turbulent engine sprays this atomization process is still hardly understood. One reason for this circumstance is the poor optical accessibility of the phenomenon. Visual examinations are always limited by diffraction effects, motion blur and multiple scattering of light, as atomization results in {{a very large number}} of tiny <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> structures, moving at high speed. For this reason, spray characterization is often made on the basis of macroscopic parameters. This work also starts with a macroscopic characterization using high-speed visualization. A parameter variation is done based on a wide range of fluids and material properties. Different empirical cone angle correlations are derived and evaluated in an existing analytical spray model. Based on these findings, the atomization close to the nozzle is analyzed in a second step. To meet the requirements for such a study, a novel microscopic method is developed and applied in this work, the so-called “Double Pulsed Transmitted Light Microscopy“. This method allows a visual determination of sizes, shapes and velocities of <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> structures with high spatial and temporal resolution for engine-related injection conditions and ambient pressures. The method is combined with the “Laser Correlation Velocimetry“, which allows the measurement of radial profiles of axial velocity. Based on both methods a detailed characterization of inner jet core, film structures, ligaments and droplets is done for atmospheric conditions as well as for engine-related ambient gas densities. These investigations form the basis for an interpretation of the influence of shear effects, damping effects and the outlet conditions on atomization of an engine-relevant jet...|$|E
50|$|The <b>primary</b> waste <b>liquids</b> {{cleaning}} and purification {{action in a}} drain field is performed by a biofilm in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates {{down to the water}} table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the aquifer. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.|$|R
40|$|The layered {{series of}} the Muskox Intrusion {{can be divided into}} four megacyclic units on the basis of field mapping, each {{beginning}} with a thick olivine cumulate and succeeded up section by a variety of pyroxenitic and gabbroic cumulates. A systematic change in the order of appearance of orthopyroxene in the pyroxenite units of the layered series is correlated with a decrease in Mg no. (Mg/Mg + $ Sigma$Fe in cation units) at which clinopyroxene joins olivine on the liquidus, and spike-like increases in LIL/HFS ratios, which require that the composition of the magma of the Muskox Intrusion changed through time across the layered series. Mixing of residual <b>liquid</b> with <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> replenishing the chamber can explain the upsection decrease in the Mg no. of clinopyroxene at the base of successive pyroxenite units, but this mechanism cannot account for increased ratios of LIL to HFS incompatible elements observed in the olwebsterite of Megacycle # 3 and the first websterite of Megacycle # 4, because these ratios are not significantly fractionated by closed-system crystal fractionation. Contamination of the parental magma with melts from the paragneiss country rocks can reproduce the observed increase in the ratios of K/Ti and K/Zr. The gabbroic layers of Megacycle # 1, # 2, and # 3 are especially enriched in LIL/HFS ratios, indicating the presence of a highly contaminated magma layer above the uncontaminated magma which crystallized much of the ultramafic series. The spike-like enrichment in LIL/HFS ratios in the pyroxenites suggests that episodic events of mixing occurred between an evolving uncontaminated magma and a highly contaminated magma, accumulated at the roof of the magma chamber...|$|R
40|$|New major, minor, {{and trace}} element {{data for the}} Chakhla- Delakari sill and three nearby lava flows in the {{proximal}} area of Tamia are presented. Based on abundances of trace elements, it is inferred that the sill was the feeder of the two uppermost lava flows which tapped magmas from a LREE-, Rb-enriched source. The oldest (lowermost) flow shows greater affinity with the western Deccan lavas. The association of the feeder sill with a large network of parallel trending sills and dikes, and the elongate Satpura Dome, is taken to infer that a major locus of eruption of the Deccan Trap lavas existed {{in the eastern part}} of the province. A model is presented for the evolution of the magma source of the sill and the two uppermost flows in a chamber beneath the Satpura Dome in the easternmost Deccan Traps. Results of equilibrium crystallization experiments at 6. 35 kbars conducted on two compositions which represent probable near <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> are presented. One of these starting compositions has 9. 5 % MgO and the other 13 % MgO. The sequence of crystallization in both starting liquids at 6. 35 kbars is as follows: olivine; olivine + Ca- clinopyroxene; ol + Ca-clinopyroxene + Ca-poor clinopyroxene; olivine + Ca-clinopyroxene + Ca-poor clinopyroxene + plagioclase. Based on the present experimental data, it is inferred that typical Deccan magmas (MgO 5 - 9 %) are produced by early fractionation of olivine, pyroxene (Ca-augite and pigeonite), and late fractionation of plagioclase. Deccan basalts with MgO 9 - 10 % appear to have crystallized from melts lower in Ti 02 than the starting materials of this study which fractionated olivine and plagioclase. Basalts with MgO 2 source which has fractionated olivine and plagioclase will produce of the bulk of Deccan basalts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Experiments were {{conducted}} in a liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed with different viscous liquids and particles to study the hydrodynamics, average solid hold up and solid circulation rate. The effects of operating parameters, i. e., <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> flow rate in the riser, auxiliary liquid flow rate, total liquid flow rate and viscosity of the liquid were studied for solids of different density and particle size. Results show that the circulating fluidization regime starts earlier for more viscous solutions because of the decrease in critical transitional velocity. The onset of solid holdup increases {{with an increase in}} liquid viscosity for sand and for glass beads. The solid circulation rate increases with an increase in total velocity and auxiliary velocity, and also increases with increasing viscosity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an updated review on fast pyrolysis of biomass for {{production of a}} liquid usually referred to as bio-oil. The technology of fast pyrolysis is described including the major reaction systems. The <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> product is characterised by reference to the many properties that impact on its use. These properties have caused increasingly extensive research to be undertaken to address properties that need modification and this area is reviewed in terms of physical, catalytic and chemical upgrading. Of particular note is the increasing diversity of methods and catalysts and particularly the complexity and sophistication of multi-functional catalyst systems.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} had two aims: (1) to study responses of dopamine neurons to stimuli with attentional and motivationai significance during several steps of learning a behavioral task, and (2) {{to study the}} activity of dopamine neurons during the performance of cognitive tasks known to be impaired after lesions of these neurons. Monkeys that had previously learned a simple reaction time task were trained to perform a spatial delayed response task via two intermediate tasks. During the learning of each new task, a total of 25 % of 76 dopamine neurons showed phasic responses to the delivery of <b>primary</b> <b>liquid</b> reward, whereas only 9 % of 163 neurons responded to this event once task performance was established. This produced an average population response during but not after learning of each task. Reward responses during learning were significantl...|$|E
40|$|RAFFINAGE+JST:CLO:CGECoal liquids from Direct Coal Liquefaction (DCL) {{are one of}} the {{possible}} substitutes of conventional hydrocarbons resources. However the <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> obtained from DCL (i. e. outflow liquids of the first reactor in a two stages liquefaction process) do not meet the product specifications and need to be upgraded via downstream catalytic hydrotreatment processes. The in depth knowledge of the feed of this upgrading step is of key importance to design better catalysts. In this study, we applied new cutting-edge techniques to improve the characterization of a coal derived liquid obtained from a liquefaction step starting from Scottish bituminous coal. For this purpose, bidimensional chromatography (GC xGC), and C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to analyze four cuts of the coal liquid with the following boiling points intervals: heavy naphtha (initial boiling point: IBP- 215 degrees C), gas oil (215 - 343 degrees C), vacuum gas oil (343 - 524 degrees C) and vacuum residue (524 (+) degrees C). The analyses showed high aromaticity of all four cuts. The weight content of aromatics in the gas oil fraction, was 75 %, with a majority of two rings aromatics and the remainder consisting mostly of normal paraffins. In the vacuum gas oil cut, which contains mostly four aromatic rings, we found 11 wt% of asphaltenes (compounds in n-heptane), an unexpected high amount comparing to petroleum VGO fractions. The amount of heptane-insoluble (asphaltenes, pre-asphaltenes and sediments) is as high as 80 % in the vacuum residue fraction (524 (+) degrees C). Aromaticity given by C- 13 NMR in this cut is as high as the level observed in petroleum asphaltenes (C-aro = 53 wt%). High content of heteroelements, which highly increase the polarity of the molecules, in the coal liquid and especially in the vacuum residue can explain the enhanced amount of n-heptane-insoluble compounds.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to produce a synthetic crude from coal at a cost lower than $ 30. 00 per barrel (Task A). A second objective, reflecting a recent change in direction in the synthetic fuels effort of DOE, is to produce a fuel which is low in aromatics, yet of sufficiently high octane number {{for use in the}} gasoline- burning transportation vehicles of today. To meet this second objective, research was proposed, and funding awarded, for conversion of the highly-aromatic liquid product from coal conversion to a product high in isoparaffins, which compounds in the gasoline range exhibit a high octane number (Task B). Experimental coal liquefaction studies conducted in a batch microreactor in our laboratory have demonstrated potential for high conversions of coal to liquids with low yields of hydrocarbon (HC) gases, hence small consumption of hydrogen in the primary liquefaction step. Ratios of liquids/HC gases as high as 30 / 1, at liquid yields as high as 82 % of the coal by weight, have been achieved. The principal {{objective of}} this work is to examine how nearly we may approach these results in a continuous- flow system, at a size sufficient to evaluate the process concept for production of transportation fuels from coal. A continuous system has been constructed and operated, with a one-half inch inside diameter (ID) tube as the reaction vessel. As the work in this project proceeded toward its conclusion, an unexpected benefit was discovered. As the residence times were decreased to values of 10 seconds or less, ratios of liquids/HC gases of 20 / 1 or higher were achieved. But very importantly, it was discovered that the chemical reactions which produce the <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> can be carried to high conversions at pressures much lower than reported, and indeed required, in the processes at longer times...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} liquids on {{intrinsic}} interfacial sliding {{have been studied}} in NaCl crystals. The <b>primary</b> <b>liquids</b> {{in the study were}} water, methanol, and mixtures thereof. Sliding experiments were performed using a simple geometry in which a shear and normal compressive component of force were exerted on the interface. The geometry consisted of two single crystals joined at a boundary whose normal was inclined at an angle, θ, to an axis along which a compressive load, P, was applied. The specimens were found to deform in two distinct ways: (1) by sliding along the interface, and (2) by indenting into one another in a direction normal to the interface. The introduction of liquids into the interface through channel-like defects was found to increase both the rate of sliding and indentation, with the increases being much greater for liquids with high water contents. It was found that the overall rate of displacement along the axis of the specimen was effectively independent of P but increased in roughly a linear fashion with θ. A model for the process is developed in which displacement is produced primarily by interfacial sliding, with the liquid acting to promote the rate by undercutting the boundary and reducing the effective area of contact. The area of contact is determined by adaptations of friction theory, which lead to the observed P and θ dependence of the displacement rate. In addition, results of other experiments are presented which describe how grain boundaries in NaCl and KCl bicrystals are penetrated by water and methanol. Water is found to penetrate at much greater rates. This is discussed in terms of the differences in wetting and solubility exhibited by the two liquids. Both the sliding and penetration experiments are important in the understanding of liquid enhanced creep...|$|R
