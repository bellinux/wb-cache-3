40|$|BRAC {{initiated}} {{an innovative}} programme known as Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) in 2002 {{to address the}} extreme poverty in Bangladesh. Impact assessment studies on {{the first phase of}} CFPR (2002 - 06) have shown that the programme had significant positive impacts on the livelihoods of the participant households. However, whether this impact on livelihoods is sustainable or not remained the key research question. Based on panel data from three rounds of survey (2002, 2005 and 2008), this study explores sustainability of livelihood impacts of the first phase of CFPR. The findings show that programme impacts on income, employment, food security and asset holding were mostly sustainable in the long-run. Magnitude of impact on per capita income was found to be increased over time. Livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>holding</b> increased substantially among the programme participants due to mainly transfer of these assets by the programme and the increase sustained in the long-run. The findings of this study also show that although the programme did not have significant impact on education in the short-run, in the long-run it had a modest positive impact on boys’ primary enrolment. Qualitative exploration reveals that determination, confidence, social network, asset management skill, and hard work of the participant women are the key factors for effectively using the supports provided by the CFPR programme.

40|$|Background: To {{provide an}} {{increased}} understanding of avian influenza A(H 7 N 9) activity in live-poultry market {{in space and}} time and hence improve H 7 N 9 epidemic control, an ongoing environmental sampling program in multiple live-poultry markets across Guangdong, China was conducted during March 2013 –June 2014. Methods: A total of 625 live-poultry markets throughout 21 prefecture areas took part in the study. A total of 10 environmental sites in markets for sampling were identified to represent 4 different poultry-related activity areas. At least 10 environmental samples were collected from each market every month. The real time RT-PCR was performed to detect the avian influenza A(H 7 N 9) virus. Field survey was conducted to investigate the sanitation status of live-poultry markets. Results: There were 109 human infections with H 7 N 9 avian influenza in Guangdong, of which 37 (34 %) died. A total of 18741 environmental swabs were collected and subjected to real-time RT-PCR test, of which 905 (4. 83 %) were found positive for H 7 N 9 virus. There were 201 (32. 16 %) markets affected by H 7 N 9 in 16 prefecture areas. The detection of H 7 N 9 virus in markets spiked in winter months. 63. 33 % markets (38 / 60) had no physical segregation for <b>poultry</b> <b>holding,</b> slaughter or sale zones.

40|$|Since 2005, H 5 N 1 highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus (HPAIV) has severely impacted {{the economy and}} public health in the Middle East (ME) with Egypt as the most affected country. Understanding the high-risk areas and spatiotemporal distribution of the H 5 N 1 HPAIV in poultry is prerequisite for establishing risk-based surveillance activities at a regional level in the ME. Here, we aimed to predict the geographic range of H 5 N 1 HPAIV outbreaks in poultry in the ME using a set of environmental variables and to investigate the spatiotemporal clustering of outbreaks in the region. Data from the ME for the period 2005 - 14 were analyzed using maximum entropy ecological niche modeling and the permutation model of the scan statistics. The predicted range of high-risk areas (P > 0. 60) for H 5 N 1 HPAIV in poultry included parts of the ME northeastern countries, whereas the Egyptian Nile delta and valley were estimated {{to be the most}} suitable locations for occurrence of H 5 N 1 HPAIV outbreaks. The most important environmental predictor that contributed to risk for H 5 N 1 HPAIV was the precipitation of the warmest quarter (47. 2 %), followed by the type of global livestock production system (18. 1 %). Most significant spatiotemporal clusters (P < 0. 001) were detected in Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. Results suggest that more information related to <b>poultry</b> <b>holding</b> demographics is needed to further improve prediction of risk for H 5 N 1 HPAIV in the ME, whereas the methodology presented here may be useful in guiding the design of surveillance programs and in identifying areas in which underreporting may have occurred...|$|E
40|$|A virologic {{surveillance}} {{program for}} A(H 7 N 9) virus was conducted from April 15, 2013 to February 14, 2014 in Guangzhou, aiming {{to clarify the}} geographical distribution of A(H 7 N 9) viruses among live poultry markets (LPMs) and poultry farms in Guangzhou. Virological and serological surveys of poultry workers were also conducted to evaluate the risk of poultry-to-human transmission of the A(H 7 N 9) virus. 36 retail LPMs, 6 wholesale LPMs and 8 poultry farms were involved in our surveillance program. About 20 live poultry and environmental samples were obtained from each surveillance site at every sampling time. Different environmental samples were collected to represent different poultry-related work activities. RT-PCR and virus culture were performed to identify the A(H 7 N 9) virus. Hemagglutinin inhibition assay and RT-PCR were conducted to detect possible A(H 7 N 9) infection among poultry workers. A total of 8900 live poultry and environmental samples were collected, of which 131 (1. 5 %) were tested positive for A(H 7 N 9) virus. 44. 4 % (16 / 36) of retail LPMs and 50. 0 % (3 / 6) of wholesale LPMs were confirmed to be contaminated. No positive samples was detected from poultry farms. A significant higher positive sample rate was found in environmental samples related to poultry selling (2. 6 %) and slaughtering (2. 4 %), compared to <b>poultry</b> <b>holding</b> (0. 9 %). Correspondingly, A(H 7 N 9) viruses were isolated most frequently from slaughter zone. In addition, 316 poultry workers associated with the 19 contaminated-LPMs were recruited and a low seroprevalence (1. 6 %) of antibody against A(H 7 N 9) virus was detected. An asymptomatic A(H 7 N 9) infection was also identified by RT-PCR. Our study {{highlights the importance of}} conducting effective surveillance for A(H 7 N 9) virus and provides evidence to support the assumption that slaughtering is the key process for the propagation of A(H 7 N 9) virus in retail LPMs. Moreover, the ability of A(H 7 N 9) virus to cross species barrier is proved to be still limited...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs) are {{a diverse}} group of viruses that are a major global threat to the poultry industry. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes of avian influenza have been observed in birds. Most of these subtypes cause no or only mild disease in poultry and are therefore classified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs). However, as a result of mutations, LPAIVs belonging to the H 5 or H 7 subtypes (LPNAIVs) may evolve into a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) when they are circulating in poultry. Since these HPAIVs cause severe sickness and mortality in poultry and are able to spread rapidly, such an outbreak can wreak havoc among poultry holdings in a large region. In order to prevent the emergence of a HPAIV, it is important that LPNAI outbreaks in poultry are detected as soon as possible and that control measures can be applied before the virus has the opportunity to become widespread. In order to achieve this, active surveillance programs directed towards an early detection of LPNAIV in poultry holdings are established. It is believed that focusing the current active surveillance programs on those sectors of the poultry industry that are more susceptible to a LPNAIV infection, would lead to an earlier detection of LPNAIV. To this end, it is necessary that those factors that determine whether a <b>poultry</b> <b>holding</b> is at increased risk for infection with LPNAIV are identified. In this thesis, transmission experiments were designed to identify and study some putative risk factors for LPNAIV infection in poultry holdings. In a first series of transmission experiments (Chapter 3), the transmission of three LPNAIVs between SPF chickens was studied. A H 5 N 2 LPAIV, which had been isolated from chickens and a H 7 N 1 LPAIV which had also been isolated from chickens, were found to be highly infectious and transmissible to SPF chickens. In contrary, a H 5 N 3 LPAIV that had been isolated from wild ducks proved to be low infectious to SPF chickens and was not transmitted between them. It was additionally examined whether keeping chickens in cage or barn housing could influence the transmission of LPNAIV. To achieve this, differences in virus transmission were studied between SPF chickens housed on a grid (to simulate housing in enriched cages) and SPF chickens housed on a floor covered with wood shavings (to simulate floor-based housing). The obtained results suggest that the transmission of LPNAIVs may be slightly enhanced by the accumulation of fecal matter as it occurs in floor-based housing systems. However, no large impact was observed. In order to decide whether this factor should be regarded as a risk factor and be included in the active LPNAI surveillance programs, further investigation should be conducted. This could be realized by conducting additional transmission experiments or by conducting an epidemiological study looking for a relationship between LPNAI outbreaks and the type of housing system. A second set of transmission experiments (Chapter 4) was dedicated to the investigation of the transmission of LPNAIVs between ducks and chickens. In these experiments, the transmission of the duck originated H 5 N 3 LPAIV that was also used in chapter 3 was investigated between pekin ducks and SPF chickens. Despite this virus was previously found to be low infectious to SPF chickens, it was found to be efficiently transmitted from pekin ducks to SPF chickens, suggesting that this virus can be efficiently introduced in chicken farms if contact with wild waterfowl is possible. Additionally, from experiments with a special setting, it was suggested that drinking water that is fecally contaminated by visiting waterfowl {{may be one of the}} most important fomites by which LPNAIVs are introduced to poultry holdings. From these results, it can be suggested that the risk of a wild bird originated LPNAIV becoming established in poultry is only realistic if the virus itself has a high infectious potential to poultry. Indeed, our results suggest that, despite the fact that they can be relatively easily introduced, a LPNAIV with a low infectious potential to chickens has a significant risk of dying out spontaneously when it is introduced in an all-chicken population. On the other hand, in mixed poultry farms where contact between domestic waterfowl and gallinaceous poultry is possible, these low infectious LPNAIVs may be of a bigger problem; It is possible that such a LPNAIV can circulate among the holding’s waterfowl and can then be repeatedly passed on to the chickens. This would theoretically enable the virus to adapt to chickens, which means that these mixed poultry holdings can act as a bridge for the virus to cross the species barrier from its natural host to gallinaceous poultry. In a third study (Chapter 5); it was evaluated if transmission of the H 5 N 2 and H 7 N 1 LPAIVs used in chapter 3 still occurs when a more natural infection pressure is used. Indeed, it is often assumed that the inoculation of animals, as carried out in standard transmission experiments, may lead to a higher infectivity and thus to an artificially enhanced transmission. Extended transmission experiments in which susceptible SPF chickens were exposed to naturally infected SPF chickens were carried out. For the H 5 N 2 LPAIV, it was observed that the reproduction ratio was similar to the one obtained in chapter 3. This suggests a similar infectivity for naturally infected SPF chickens as for inoculated SPF chickens, at least for this virus. Unfortunately, for the H 7 N 1 LPAIV, no conclusions could be drawn; naturally infected SPF chickens could not be obtained, most likely due to problems in the design of the experiment. In a final study (Chapter 6), the multispecies NP-ELISA kit that was used throughout the thesis for the determination of infection was compared with other commercially available multispecies NP-ELISA kits. A selection of chicken and duck sera from the transmission experiments (chapter 3 and 4) were analyzed and results were compared. As these kits are also widely used in the active surveillance of LPNAIV in wild waterfowl, some additional field sera from wild geese, swans and ducks were included. The results suggest that the currently available commercial multispecies NP-ELISA kits perform equivalent for the analysis of chicken sera, and that they are most probably more sensitive than the current standard, the HI test. For wild bird sera however, a high degree of inconsistency between the different kits was observed. This indicates that, whilst the currently available commercial multispecies NP-ELISA kits are reliable for the active LPNAI surveillance in chickens, they can give unreliable results for wild bird sera. Hence, either these kits need to be better calibrated for the use in these species, or more reliable alternatives need to be investigated...|$|E

However {{little attention has been}} paid to the link between the level of intensification of poultry production and the risk of outbreak. This study revised H 5 N 1 risk mapping in Central and Western Thailand during the second wave of the 2004 epidemic. Production structure was quantified using a disaggregation methodology based on the number of <b>poultry</b> per <b>holding.</b> Population densities of extensively- and intensively-raised ducks and chickens were derived both at the sub-district and at the village levels. LandSat images were used to derive another previously neglected potential predictor of HPAI H 5 N 1 risk: the proportion of water in the landscape resulting from floods. We used Monte Carlo simulation of Boosted Regression Trees models of predictor variables to characterize the risk of HPAI H 5 N 1. Maps of mean risk and uncertainty were derived both at the sub-district and the village levels. The overall accuracy of Boosted Regression Trees models was comparable to that of logistic regression approaches. The proportion of area flooded made the highest contribution to predicting the risk of outbreak, followed by the densities of intensively-raised ducks, extensively-raised ducks and human population. Our results showed that as little as 15 % of flooded land in villages is sufficient to reach the maximum level of risk associated with this variable.

Therefore, Madagascar is seeking concrete, achievable and sustainable methods for the surveillance and the control of Newcastle disease. In this paper, we present and analyze {{the results of a}} field study conducted in Madagascar between December 2009 and December 2010. The study area was the Lac Alaotra region, a landlocked area in the north-eastern part of the country's center. Poultry trading is suspected of playing {{a major role in the}} spread of avian diseases, especially in developing countries characterized by many live-bird markets and middlemen. Therefore, the goals of our study were to: (i) describe and analyze smallholders' poultry trading network in the Lake Alaotra region using social network analysis; (ii) assess the role of the network in the spread of Newcastle disease; and (iii) propose the implementation of a targeted disease surveillance based on the characteristics of the poultry trading network. We focused our field study on the harvesting of two data sets. The first is a complete description of the poultry trading network in the landlocked area of Lac Alaotra, including a description of the poultry movements between groups of villages. The second set of data measures the occurrence of outbreaks in the same area by combining a participatory approach with an event-based surveillance method. These data were used to determine the attributes of the network, and to statistically assess the association between the position of nodes and the occurrence of outbreaks. By using social network analysis techniques combined with a classification method and a logistic model, we finally identified 3 nodes (set of villages), of the 387 in the initial network, to focus on for surveillance and control in the Lac Alaotra area. This result is of primary importance in the ongoing efforts to effectively improve the wellbeing of people in the region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} virus-infected poultry can {{release a}} large amount of virus-contaminated droppings that serve as sources of infection for susceptible birds. Much research so far has focused on virus spread within flocks. However, as fecal material or manure is a major constituent of airborne poultry dust, virus-contaminated particulate matter from infected flocks may be dispersed into the environment. We collected samples of suspended particulate matter, or the inhalable dust fraction, inside, upwind and downwind of buildings <b>holding</b> <b>poultry</b> infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza virus, and tested them for the presence of endotoxins and influenza virus to characterize the potential impact of airborne influenza virus transmission during outbreaks at commercial poultry farms. Influenza viruses were detected by RT-PCR in filter-rinse fluids collected up to 60 meters downwind from the barns, but virus isolation did not yield any isolates. Viral loads in the air samples were low and beyond the limit of RT-PCR quantification except for one in-barn measurement showing a virus concentration of 8. 48 x 10 (4) genome copies/m(3). Air samples taken outside poultry barns had endotoxin concentrations of ~ 50 EU/m(3) that declined with increasing distance from the barn. Atmospheric dispersion modeling of particulate matter, using location-specific meteorological data for the sampling days, demonstrated a positive correlation between endotoxin measurements and modeled particulate matter concentrations, with an R(2) varying from 0. 59 to 0. 88.
