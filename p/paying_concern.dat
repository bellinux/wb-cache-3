60|$|In all {{the sights}} {{to be seen}} about the world there is no sight {{in which there is}} less to be seen than in a gold-mine. The two young men were made to follow their {{conductor}} along a very dirty underground gallery for {{about a quarter of a}} mile, and then they came to four men working with picks in a rough sort of chamber, and four others driving holes in the walls. They were simply picking down the rock, in doing which they were assisted by gunpowder. With keen eyes Crinkett searched along the roof and sides, and at last showed to his companions one or two little specks which he pronounced to be gold. 'When it shows itself like that all about, you may guess whether it's a <b>paying</b> <b>concern!</b> Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' As Dick and Caldigate hitherto knew nothing about ounces and tons in reference to gold, and as they had heard of nuggets, and lumps of gold nearly as big as their fist, they were not much exalted by what they saw down the 'Old Stick-in-the-Mud.' Nor did they like the darkness and dampness and dirt and dreariness of the place. They had both resolved to work, as they had often said, with their own hands;--but in thinking over it their imagination had not pictured to them so uncomfortable a workshop as this. When they had returned to the light, the owner of the place took them through the crushing-mill attached, showed them the stone or mulloch, as it was thrust into the jaws of the devouring animal, and then brought them in triumph round to the place where the gold was eliminated from the débris of mud and water. The gold did not seem to them to be very much; but still there it was. 'Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' said Crinkett, as he brought them back to his house. 'You'll find that a 10s. share'll give you about 6d. a month. That's about 60 per cent, I guess. You can have your money monthly. What comes out of that there mine in a March, you can have in a April, and so on. There ain't nothing like it anywhere else,--not as I knows on. And instead of working your hearts out, you can be just amusing yourselves about the country. Don't go to Ahalala;--unless it is for dropping your money. If that's what you want, I won't say but Ahalala is as good a place as you'll find in the colony.' Then he brought a bottle of whisky out of a cupboard, and treated them to a glass of grog apiece. Beyond that his hospitality did not go.|$|E

Again ignoring official injunctions against constructing a railroad, the CEMC's engineer Claude W. Kinder first insisted on constructing the tramway at standard gauge and then jury rigged a locomotive from material around the mine. This proved more economical than the mules and the canal's tendency to freeze in the winterand the coal's strategic importance for the viceroy's Beiyang Fleeteventually allowed the line's expansion first down the length of the canal and then to major cities like Tianjin. Over two decades, the Kaiping Tramway thus expanded into the China Railway Company, which again was purchased by the Qing government but this time kept on as a <b>paying</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1871, Lawson {{initiated}} the final {{part of his}} experimental programme. He had long desired to extend his festival lectures into something more permanent and regular; and as such he promoted a series of Sunday Lectures on an array of ‘peculiar’ and ‘controversial’ subjects including Witchcraft, Geology, Atheism and Evolution. After he submitted the list of proposed lectures to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the custodian of the only suitable meeting room in Aspatria, his brother rejected the request {{for a variety of}} reasons. Undeterred Lawson proposed the erection of a new Public Hall. He first suggested purchasing land in the centre of the town and conceived plans to erect a handsome building capable of seating 550 people, with shops and houses below. Although the scheme failed to attract the required backing, it encouraged an influential body of residents to proceed to form a company to build a market house and assembly room on the old Market Square. However, arguments erupted after Lawson demanded that every shareholder should have only one vote regardless of the number of shares owned. The meeting was extremely rowdy. Lawson led an opposition labelled ‘communists’ by their opponents; and from this turmoil came a race to establish two rival Public Halls to serve this small community.Lawson purchased a parcel of land for £220 and immediately offered it free of charge with an additional sum of £100, to any group of people willing to build a Public Hall. However, the specification demanded that the room be capable of seating 500 people with an air capacity of [...] He also gave a written undertaking that if they could obtain a stated number of shareholders by a certain date he would take all the remaining unallotted shares. His only proviso demanded the use, free of charge on Sundays and Christmas days for thirty years.He laid the foundation stone in April 1872 and formally opened the building twelve months later. The name Noble Temple may confound contemporary residents. While touring America, Lawson noted that local inhabitants referred to public buildings as Temples; and since the chosen site stood on Noble Fields, close to Noble Bridge, hence the name Noble Temple. [...] The elected committee sponsored the well-attended lectures every alternate Sunday. These continued until 1885 and the necessary expenditure primarily came from the ‘Public Good’ business. The lectures featured both religious and secular subjects. It was generally found that the lectures that were the least orthodox and the least given to religious intolerance were the most instructive and the most appreciated. As a <b>paying</b> <b>concern,</b> the Noble Temple always paid a minimum dividend of 5 per cent per annum to the shareholders. After Lawson left for America, he sold most of his shares by auction at considerably below the purchased price. It is rather ironic that the building is now the headquarters of the Aspatria lodge of Freemasons. Would Lawson have approved? ...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{management}} is a growing problem in urban areas of Nepal where municipalities are severely constrained by budget to manage it effectively. Collecting fees from the public can aid finance for improving waste management service.

Majority of households (61 %) are willing to pay an average amount of NRs. 73. 38 (0. 72 US$) per month.
