40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine a location for the <b>ripcord</b> <b>handle</b> in <b>parachutes,</b> most compatible with human capabilities. Seven different locations were tested for the <b>ripcord</b> <b>handle.</b> Maximum voluntary forces were measured with the subjects pulling the <b>ripcord</b> <b>handle</b> using their right, left, and both hands at all seven locations. A comparison of single-handed versus both-handed pulls was made. Results indicated that with the handle located at the left or right thigh the subjects were able to exert more force than any other locations. Also the use of two hands yielded the largest force.

5000|$|A patent {{was filed}} on July 27, 1918 and issued May 18, 1920 for his parachute. The {{assignee}} was the Floyd Smith Aerial Equipment Company of San Diego, California. Floyd with Leslie Leroy Irvin, developed a 28-foot backpack parachute. On April 28, 1919, Irvin jumped from a de Havilland biplane traveling at 100 {{miles per hour}} {{at an altitude of}} 1,500 feet. After Irvin bailed out of the airplane and falling free, he manually reached the <b>ripcord</b> <b>handle</b> and pulled it, and the parachute fully deployed at 1,000 feet. Irvin became the first American to jump from an airplane and manually open a parachute in midair. Floyd's original 1919 <b>ripcord</b> <b>parachute</b> is on display at the Air Force Museum at Dayton, Ohio. http://www.libraries.wright.edu/find/gov/patent/miamivalleyinventors.html ...|$|R

During this process he had unbuckled his parachute and was never able to put it back on properly. Finally able to free himself he launched himself from the airplane, up and out the normally facing downward hatch and pulled his <b>parachute's</b> <b>ripcord.</b>|$|R
50|$|Langar {{airfield}} {{was originally}} a World War II bomber base, {{home to the}} RAF 207 Squadron between 1942 and 1943, but is now operating solely as a civilian drop zone. British Parachute Schools has been based at the airfield since 1977. British Parachute Schools {{was set up by}} Tom Sawyer and he encouraged use by universities. One of the first was Loughborough University who moved from Peterborough Parachute Centre after a chance meeting between Tom and Ian Parker, chairman of the university club. Parker's final year project was an analysis of <b>parachute</b> <b>ripcord</b> pull forces after a stiff pull on his first free fall.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was decided}} the third {{parachute}} would {{be attached to}} the risers of his main parachute (risers are the webbing which connects a parachute's suspension lines to a jumper's harness and are exposed on a jumper's shoulders while the actual canopy fabric and lines are packed securely in the container on the jumpers back). In sport parachuting, a jumper typically has just two handles on his chest (in addition to a third handle which deploys the main parachute and is located elsewhere). Usually on one's right side is the main parachute release handle (or [...] "cut-away"). On the left is the reserve <b>parachute</b> <b>ripcord,</b> which deploys the emergency parachute. Due to the special nature of Harris' jump, a second release handle was attached to his harness near the usual one. Harris was to jump and immediately deploy the third parachute, and then be filmed releasing that parachute, entering freefall, and deploying his normal main parachute (completing his skydive in the usual manner).|$|R

50|$|As the U.S. Army {{prepared}} {{itself for}} World War II, staff realized that to effectively drop paratroopers {{from a low}} altitude required a parachute that was opened by a static line, which would automatically open the parachute upon exiting the plane. At the time, though, the Army {{did not have a}} parachute that opened that way. All of its standard <b>parachutes</b> used a <b>ripcord</b> that a parachutist had to pull. To quickly address the need, the Army turned to the World War I-era Broadwick parachutes it had acquired. The Army added a reserve chute and some other modifications to produce its first standard parachute for paratroopers. Static line parachutes are still used by paratroops today.|$|R

Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but {{we were not able to}} attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty - as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft - I managed to get my hand on the ejection seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so I pulled on the <b>parachute</b> <b>ripcord</b> ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.I looked down. The cloud was now much closer - perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first - will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers." ...|$|R
