In this study, we focused on honeydew producers and diversity of host tree species which are involved in honeydew production in Turkey. A total of 24 honeydew producers by host tree species are identified in Turkey. Of these, 13 coniferous trees and 11 deciduous trees. The main honeydew <b>producer</b> <b>in</b> <b>Turkey</b> is a scale insect, Marchalina hellenica Gennadius (Hemiptera: Margarodidae) living mainly on pines (Turkish red pine, Aleppo pine, and rarely on stone pine, Anatolian black pine and Scots pine).

In addition, this study attempts to examine the empirical findings of the PSE in the light of CAP reforms and EU enlargements during the period 1986 - 2003. The expected contribution {{of this study is to}} determine which support instruments, such as countervailing levies or direct payments (based on limited or unlimited area) against export subsidies, voluntary or compulsory set-aside measures and price interventions, are more appropriate for the CAP in reducing destabilizing effects on trade with selected products between the EU and Turkey with respect to distribution effects (how income is distributed between different groups involved in the production operation process). Does the current PSS of the CAP have positive effects on agricultural <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Turkey</b> as a non-member country? The major finding of this dissertation is the evaluation of benefits and costs of common agricultural policies of the EU on fair trade.

40|$|In 1995 / 96, the {{government}} of Turkey imposed an export tax of 20 cents/kg on Aegean cotton and an ad-valorem import duty of one percent on non-aegean cotton. The simulation results for the Aegean market indicate that consumers gained $ 44. 5 million in consumer surplus because the export tax reduced the purchase price of Aegean cotton. The Turkish government extracted export tax revenue equal to $ 11. 6 million, but provided water, fertilizer, and credit subsidies equal to $ 22. 2 million. Producers lost $ 35 million <b>in</b> <b>producer</b> surplus due to the lower domestic price caused by the export tax. However, while these numbers represent large transfers from producers to consumers, the net inefficiency due to government distortions amount to only $ 1. 14 million in the Aegean market. Adding this number to the dead-weight loss of only $ 790, 000 obtained from the non-Aegean market simulation, the net inefficiency caused by government intervention in Turkish raw cotton markets was only $ 1. 93 million in 1995 / 96.

Results show that the pass-through of both external factors into producer prices is higher {{than it is for}} consumer prices. In addition, the degree of pass-through is significantly lower in the inflation targeting period compared to the previous period. The cumulative exchange rate and import price pass-through coefficients into consumer prices for the recent period are found similar to each other while import price shocks are reflected much faster. For the producer prices, import price shocks are found to be reflected more than the exchange rate shocks. An exercise based on these estimation results shows that during 2007 - 2009 external factors were influential on consumer prices. Furthermore simultaneous counter movements of exchange rate and import prices at that period limited and sometimes offset the impact of each other on consumer prices. JEL E 3...|$|R

40|$|The Keban mine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} lead and zinc <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Turkey.</b> It is located 54 km NW of Elazig County, Eastern Turkey. The Keban metamorphic massif consists of calc-schists, dolomite marble, phyllite and marble. It forms part of the eastern Taurid belt, a prolongation of the Alpine orogenic belt. The principal structural feature of the area is the northern extension of the Malatya-Keban anticline, a major recumbent fold with a NE-SW axis. Later movements acting in different directions gave rise to N-S, E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW directed folding and faulting over the previous anticline. Small bodies of quartz-syenite porphyry, of paleocene age, intrude the metasediments. Detailed study by chemistry, petrography and x-ray techniques on sanidine accounts for a composition range between Or 65 Ab 35 and Or 99 Ab 1. The ratio of Or to Ab tends to increase outwards from the central parts of the igneous body. Skarn zones have developed in association with the intrusion of quartz-syenite porphyry. These are located mainly within the metasediments. The magnatite deposit of Zereyandere, the scheelite deposit of Kebandere and the main sulphide deposit were formed as part of the process of skarn formation. Minor amounts of some manganese minerals and the minerals vanadinite and descloizite derived from the main sulphide deposit, are also found in the district. The main sulphide deposit of economic importance chiefly incudes sphalerite, galena, iron and copper sulphides and several sulfo-salts in subordinate amounts. Of the by-products, silver comes from galena, polybasite and tennantite. Arsenopyrite in addition to chalcopyrite contains trace concentrations of gold. All the evidence suggests that the quartz- syenite porphyry is the source of mineralization. The location of ore minerals is controlled by certain rock types and by major and minor structural elements. Variation of vapour fugacity and temperature during mineralization are indicated by more than one stage of formation for certain ore minerals. The presence of different gangue minerals marks the fluctuating nature of the ore forming fluids whose last stage is believed to be alkaline rather than acidic. The main sulphide deposit is accepted as a semi-metasomatic contact deposit, while the magnetite and scheelite deposits are classified as being metamorphic. Using various methods, a temperature range of formation between 620 ° and 78 °C is estimated for the ore minerals of the main sulphide deposit. For the ore minerals of the magnetite and scheelite deposits the range is from 743 °C down to 225 °C...|$|R
