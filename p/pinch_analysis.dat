The “Power-to-Fuel” technology is an approach to produce synthetic jet fuels from renewable energy (solar, wind). The German Aerospace Center investigates and evaluates the technical and economic performance of production processes based on these renewable energies and CO 2. One process concept comprises the generation of H 2 by water electrolysis from fluctuating renewable power sources. CO 2 – e. g. sequestrated from industrial resources – reacts with H 2 by the reverse water-gas-shift reaction to form syngas. Syngas is than synthesized to long chained hydrocarbons by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The downstream product separation and upgrading section allows the production of gasoline, kerosene and diesel.

40|$|Consider an {{axisymmetric}} equilibrium in a configuration {{where the}} current density j has only r and z components, and the magnetic field, accordingly, has only the {var_phi} component.

Both can be, in principle, imploded by conducting shells to create a plasma with fusion-grade parameters. To be of interest for fusion, these configurations have to provide MHD equilibria acceptable {{from the viewpoint of}} confinement requirements. In the present note the authors analyze possible equilibria and show that only equilibria where the plasma pressure is a function of a radial coordinate (no axial dependence) are possible. A framework for such an analysis is outlined, e. g., in Shafranov's survey in ``Reviews of Plasma Physics''. In an arbitrary geometry the analysis may be quite cumbersome.

5000|$|... 2. <b>Pinch</b> <b>analysis,</b> a {{technique}} for designing {{a process to}} minimise energy consumption and maximise heat recovery, also known as heat integration, energy integration or pinch technology. The technique calculates thermodynamically attainable energy targets for a given process and identifies how to achieve them. A key insight is the pinch temperature, {{which is the most}} constrained point in the process. The most detailed explanation of the techniques is by Linnhoff et al. (1982), Shenoy (1995) and Kemp (2006). This definition reflects the fact that the first major success for process integration was the thermal <b>pinch</b> <b>analysis</b> addressing energy problems and pioneered by Linnhoff and co-workers. Later, other pinch analyses were developed for several applications such as mass-exchange networks (El-Halwagi and Manousiouthakis, 1989), water minimization (Wang and Smith, 1994), and material recycle (El-Halwagi et al., 2003). A very successful extension was [...] "Hydrogen Pinch", which was applied to refinery hydrogen management (Nick Hallale et al., 2002 and 2003). This allowed refiners to minimise the capital and operating costs of hydrogen supply to meet ever stricter environmental regulations and also increase hydrotreater yields.|$|E

The changing temperature of the zeotropic working fluid can be matched to that of the fluid being heated or cooled to save waste heat because the mixture's evaporation process occurs at a temperature glide (see <b>Pinch</b> <b>Analysis).</b>|$|E
40|$|Engineers at the Savannah River Technology Center have designed, built, and {{installed}} a fully automated small field-of-view, lens-coupled, digital radiography imaging system. The system is installed {{in one of}} the Savannah River Site''s production facilities to be used for the evaluation of production components. Custom software routines developed for the system automatically acquire, enhance, and diagnostically evaluate critical geometric features of various components that have been captured radiographically. Resolution of the digital radiograms and accuracy of the acquired measurements approaches 0. 001 inches. To date, there has been zero deviation in measurement repeatability. The automated image acquisition methodology will be discussed, unique enhancement algorithms will be explained, and the automated routines for measuring the critical component features will be presented. An additional feature discussed is the independent nature of the modular software components, which allows images to be automatically acquired, processed, and evaluated by the computer in the background, while the operator reviews other images on the monitor. System components were also a key in gaining the required image resolution. System factors such as scintillator selection, x-ray source energy, optical components and layout, as well as geometric unsharpness issues are considered in the paper.

40|$|Development of {{air-cooled}} absorption cycles {{appropriate for}} residential applications has been problematic. This study examines an ammonia-water triple effect cycle {{known as the}} kangaroo cycle, and investigates its limitations when used as an air-cooled space air conditioner. The triple effect absorption processes were modeled and a methodology for optimizing the design was developed. The arrangement and relative sizes of the heat exchangers thermally coupling {{the upper and lower}} loops were studied. The thermal coupling involves the upper rectifier, condenser, and absorber rejecting heat to the lower generator. Contrary to other triple effect studies, internal generator heat exchangers were incorporated in both the upper and lower generators and their optimum relative positions were studied. Also, errors of up to 150 percent were shown to result from conventional LMTD and <b>pinch</b> point <b>analysis</b> due to the highly non-linear temperature-enthalpy relationship in the upper condenser. Three configurations for the upper heat exchangers coupling the upper loop to the lower generator were analyzed, and their relative sizes were optimized. The cycle’s performance was shown to depend on the exit temperature of the lower loop generator, and the COP optimization was demonstrated with respect to this design variable. Operation at air-cooled ambient conditions was investigated. At lower ambient temperatures that are heavily weighted in air conditioning rating standards, the efficiency is very favorable.

50|$|Most process {{integration}} techniques employ <b>Pinch</b> <b>analysis</b> or Pinch Tools {{to evaluate}} several processes {{as a whole}} system. Therefore, strictly speaking, both concepts are not the same, even if in certain contexts they are used interchangeably. The review by Nick Hallale (2001) explains that in the future, several trends {{are to be expected}} in the field. In the future, it seems probable that the boundary between targets and design will be blurred and that these will be based on more structural information regarding the process network. Second, it is likely that we will see a much wider range of applications of process integration. There is still much work to be carried out in the area of separation, not only in complex distillation systems, but also in mixed types of separation systems. This includes processes involving solids, such as flotation and crystallization. The use of process integration techniques for reactor design has seen rapid progress, but is still in its early stages. Third, a new generation of software tools is expected. The emergence of commercial software for process integration is fundamental to its wider application in process design.|$|E
50|$|The {{process data}} is {{represented}} {{as a set of}} energy flows, or streams, as a function of heat load (kW) against temperature (deg C). These data are combined for all the streams in the plant to give composite curves, one for all hot streams (releasing heat) and one for all cold streams (requiring heat). The point of closest approach between the hot and cold composite curves is the pinch point (or just pinch) with a hot stream pinch temperature and a cold stream pinch temperature. This is where the design is most constrained. Hence, by finding this point and starting the design there, the energy targets can be achieved using heat exchangers to recover heat between hot and cold streams in two separate systems, one for temperatures above pinch temperatures and one for temperatures below pinch temperatures. In practice, during the <b>pinch</b> <b>analysis</b> of an existing design, often cross-pinch exchanges of heat are found between a hot stream with its temperature above the pinch and a cold stream below the pinch. Removal of those exchangers by alternative matching makes the process reach its energy target.|$|E

Research of the S-CO 2 cycles is ongoing at the Czech Technical University (CTU) as well. Research on CTU {{is focused on the}} <b>pinch</b> point <b>analysis.</b> This point affects the entire loop and causes problems during the design of individual components. Therefore it is necessary to find the location of this point during the cycle design, for specific conditions (temperature, pressure). For known pressures and temperatures the pinch point can be found in several ways by using heat capacity profiles. If this point occurs in the heat exchanger, it causes complications in designs. Due to the pinch point, heat exchangers have a large size and a low efficiency. The pinch point can be removed with the addition of small amounts of another gas. The critical point of this other gas is at a different temperature and pressure. For the mixture of CO 2 and another gas the pinch point location will be altered, thereby allowing the removal of this point from the heat exchangers. However, adding other gases has affects the behavior of other components in the loop and the subsequent change in the cycle efficiency of the loop.
