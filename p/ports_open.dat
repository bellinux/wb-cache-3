25|$|The {{state-owned}} {{shipping company}} Arctia Shipping Oy and its predecessors have been heavily criticized {{over the years}} for the financial losses from the offshore business. Due to design compromises the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are unable to compete with purpose-built platform supply vessels — the open-water performance of the spoon-shaped bow is very poor due to slamming. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent {{long periods of time}} in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the <b>ports</b> <b>open.</b> However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration, the offshore business, while not profitable, has covered {{at least some of the}} expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 March 1945, Blumentritt briefly assumed {{command of}} the {{increasingly}} demoralized 1st Parachute Army and then, from 8 April commanded [...] "Army Group Blumentritt"—an ad-hoc collection of depleted units on the Weser river from Hameln to the Baltic Sea—up {{to the end of}} the war. He was tasked to delay the Anglo-Canadian advance into northern Germany and he attempted to keep the Baltic sea <b>ports</b> <b>open</b> as long as possible so that German refugees could escape from the Russian advance in the east. On 2 May, after the death of Hitler on 30 April, Blumentritt ordered his men to give no further resistance to the allies and to fall back gradually. In early May, Blumentritt acted as a first emissary to General Montgomery for the surrender of the German forces in the North-West.|$|E
2500|$|Northern leaders {{agreed that}} victory would {{require more than}} the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate {{nationalism}} had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing {{support for the war}} goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its <b>ports</b> <b>open</b> and its rivers clear. The North kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General Robert E. Lee proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman in 1864–65, The Reconstruction Era (1863–77) began with the Emancipation proclamation in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and the vote for the Southern blacks. [...] It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|A noise-canceling {{microphone}} is {{a highly}} directional design intended for noisy environments. [...] One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source {{and the second is}} positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by <b>ports</b> <b>open</b> to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. A few noise-canceling microphones are throat microphones.|$|E
2500|$|In 1891 [...] "Goldthwaite's Geographical Magazine, Volumes 1-2" [...] said [...] "FOUR months ago, {{a band of}} 500 pirates {{attacked}} the French residency at Chobo, in 'l‘onkin. They beheaded the French resident, ransacked and burned the town, and killed many of the people." [...] In 1906 the [...] "Decennial Reports on the Trade, Navigation, Industries, Etc., of the <b>Ports</b> <b>Open</b> to Foreign Commerce in China and Corea, and on the Condition and Development of the Treaty Port Provinces ..., Volume 2" [...] said [...] "Piracy on the Tonkin border was very prevalent {{in the early years}} of the decade. Fortified frontier posts were established in 1893 by the Tonkin Customs at the most dangerous passes into China, for the purpose of repressing contraband, the importation of arms and ammunition, and specially the illicit traflic of women, children, and cattle, which the pirates raided in Tonkin and carried beyond the Chinese mountains with impunity. These posts were eventually handed over to the military authorities." [...] In 1894 [...] "Around Tonkin and Siam" [...] said [...] "This, in my view, is too pessimist an estimate of the situation, a remark which also applies to the objection that these new roads facilitate the circulation of pirates. Defective as they may be, these roads must, it seems to me, be of service to cultivation and trade, and, therefore, in the long run to the pacification of the country." [...] In 1893 [...] "The Medical World, Volume 11" [...] said [...] "Captain Hugot, of the Zouaves, was inclose pursuit of the fnmous Thuyet, one of the most redoubtable, ferocious, and cunning of the Black Flag (Annamite pirates) leaders, the man who prepared and executed the ambuscade at Hue. The captain was just about to seize the person of the young pretender Ham-Nghi, whom the Black Flags had recently proclaimed sovereign of Armani, when he was struck by reveral ar rows, discharged by the body-guard of HamNghi. The wounds were all light, scarcely more than scratches, and no evil effect was feared at the time. After a few days, however, in spite of every care, the captain grew weaker, and it became apparent that he was suffering from the effects of arrow poison. He was removed as quickly and as tenderly as possible to Tanh-Hoa, where he died in horrible agony a few days later, in spite of the most scientific treatment and the most assiduous attention."— National Druggist. The 1892 [...] "The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Oriental and Colonial Record" [...] said [...] "The French port of Yen Long was surprised by Chinese and Annamite pirates and the troops driven out with loss." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{citizens}} of those towns are greatly divided in their opinions," [...] the captain said. [...] "Many would gladly rise {{if they had}} the chance, but they lie too close to the Spanish power to venture to do so. Still they are friendly enough to us; and as they have need of our goods and we of theirs, no one hinders traffic or interferes with those who come and go. Most of these towns have but small Spanish garrisons, and these concern themselves not with anything that goes on beyond maintaining the place for Spain. It is the Catholic magistrates appointed by Alva who manage the affairs of the towns, and as these are themselves mostly merchants and traders their interests lie in keeping the <b>ports</b> <b>open</b> and encouraging trade, so we come and go unquestioned. The Spaniards have enough on their hands already without causing discontent by restricting trade. Besides, the duke. affects to consider the rising in Holland and Zeeland as a trifling rebellion which he can suppress without difficulty, and it would be giving too much importance to the movement were he to close all the ports and forbid communication." ...|$|E

Except in the morning and the evening I never kept a {{look-out}} even--the blaze was so infernal. I didn't see a sail after the first three days, and those I saw took no notice of me. About the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a mile away from me, with all its lights ablaze and its <b>ports</b> <b>open,</b> looking like a big firefly. There was music aboard. I stood up and shouted and screamed at it. The second day I broached one of the AEpyornis eggs, scraped the shell away at the end bit by bit, and tried it, and I was glad to find it was good enough to eat. A bit flavoury--not bad, I mean--but with something of the taste of a duck's egg. There was a kind of circular patch, about six inches across, {{on one side of the}} yoke, and with streaks of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it that I thought queer, but I did not understand what this meant at the time, and I wasn't inclined to be particular. The egg lasted me three days, with biscuits and a drink of water. I chewed coffee berries too--invigorating stuff. The second egg I opened about the eighth day, and it scared me." ...|$|E
