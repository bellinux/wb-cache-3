25|$|In New Zealand, Anzac Day saw a {{surge in}} {{popularity}} immediately after World War II. However this was short-lived, and by the 1950s many New Zealanders had become antagonistic or indifferent towards the day. Much of this {{was linked to the}} legal ban on commerce on Anzac Day, and the banning by many local authorities of sports events and other entertainment on the day. Annoyance was particularly pronounced in 1953 and 1959, when Anzac Day fell on a Saturday. There was widespread public debate on the issue, with some <b>people</b> <b>calling</b> for the public holiday to be moved to the nearest Sunday or abolished altogether. In 1966 a new Anzac Day Act was passed, allowing sport and entertainment in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} few months of the campaign, a few attacks against the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Strabane, Dungannon, and Belfast, {{resulted}} in the death of two RUC constables and the wounding of two others.

A petition signed by around two hundred thousand <b>people</b> <b>calling</b> for mercy was gathered by those calling for a reprieve, and several days before the date of the executions, all but one was commuted.

In early 2011 the library was one of ten marked down by Libraries NI for closure who claimed that the library {{was one of the}} least used in Northern Ireland and that the roof of the building required repair at a significant cost. A public consultation meeting in Fintona Golf Club on 3 March that year saw a strong local turn out of at least 245 <b>people</b> <b>calling</b> for the retention of the library.

The following day the Ministry of the Interior issued a statement that Rajab had been arrested for [...] "committing a number of crimes".

500|$|The film is loosely {{connected}} to Cat People (1942) {{by the appearance}} of Tom Conway as Dr. Louis Judd, who had roles in both films. Judd recounts to a poet that he once knew a mysterious woman who was in fact a [...] "raving lunatic" [...] (referencing Irena Dubrovna, the protagonist of Cat People). In memos and early drafts of the script, Conway's character was referred to as [...] "Mr. Siegfried"; film scholars believe that the character's name was changed to provide continuity between the two films and to capitalize on Cat Peoples success. The Judd character, however, had died in Cat <b>People,</b> <b>calling</b> into question the relation of the two fictional narratives. Val Lewton historian Edmund Bansak notes that the films are also linked thematically through a preoccupation with nihilism.|$|E

[...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention.

500|$|After {{taking part}} in the {{unsuccessful}} protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied. Although the Chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerilla warfare. With the involvement of the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats, the ANC planned a Congress of the <b>People,</b> <b>calling</b> on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling {{for the creation of a}} democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. The charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in Kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended the event, which was forcibly closed down by police. The tenets of the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956 he described it as [...] "an inspiration to the people of South Africa".|$|E

[...] As a result, several businesses consider pulling their sponsorships from the Harvest Festival. Leslie decides to use her upcoming interview on [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] with Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) to perform damage control. During the interview, Joan asks very biased questions about the festival and Ben's past. Annoyed, Leslie brings Ben on stage to give him a final opportunity to explain himself. Ben again begins to freeze up at the questions from <b>people</b> <b>calling</b> in, but he finally gets over it and vigorously defends himself.
