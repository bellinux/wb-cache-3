The witness Niven took out a policy {{three months before the}} fire, and sent in his claim straight off to me. The company declined to meet it until this case was settled. Am I quite certain, or can I offer any explanation? Well, here's our <b>premium</b> <b>receipt</b> foil and record of the policy. Can't suggest any explanation, except that somebody is lying." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reinsurance <b>premium</b> <b>receipts</b> from {{overseas}} countries to firms domiciled in the United States increased 207 % {{during the years}} 1987 to 1999. It {{is important to understand}} the characteristics of countries that exhibit a rapid increase in imports of U. S. reinsurance services. This study found that U. S. reinsurance exports take place to countries with large markets and a higher per capita income and insurance prices, wherein there exists bilateral trade, and where local firms operate internationally. Contrary to expectations, the cultural distance between the U. S. and the host country was not found to have significant influence on U. S. reinsurance operations. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{special report}} {{is based on}} the Legal Study of Florida’s Sales Tax on Services {{prepared}} by Professor Hellerstein, Prentiss Wilson, Jr., and Morrison 2 ̆ 6 Foerster for the Florida Department of Revenue. This special report deals with the issues arising from Florida’s extension of the sales tax to cover services. The report first discusses the issue of pyramiding of taxes and explores the question of how that issue should be treated in the context of sales services in light of the pre-existing treatment of the issue in the context of sales of tangible personal property. Next, the problem of defining a taxable service is considered and a justification for excluding interest, insurance <b>premiums,</b> and <b>receipts</b> from other intangibles from the service definition is given. For services performed partly inside and partly outside Florida, the report discusses the decision to adopt an all-or-nothing approach to taxability rather than adopting a rule of apportionment for such sales of services. The report also examines the concept of a use tax on services and analyzes the constitutional objections that may be leveled against such a tax. The report concludes that the Legal Study should be viewed as an initial attempt {{to come to grips with}} the critical questions raised by Florida’s sales tax on services and should serve as a vehicle for further consideration of these issues...|$|R
