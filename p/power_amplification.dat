25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave <b>power</b> <b>amplification.</b> It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E

2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A passive {{crossover}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, {{passive crossover}}s have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil [...] An active crossover is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before <b>power</b> <b>amplification,</b> thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before <b>power</b> <b>amplification,</b> but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E
2500|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an electronic device which uses electrical power and circuitry to boost a low-voltage level signal (e.g., the signal from a vocalist's mic) and provides enough electrical power {{to drive a}} loudspeaker and produce sound. [...] All speakers, including headphones, require <b>power</b> <b>amplification.</b> [...] Most professional audio amplifiers also provide protection from clipped (overloaded) signals, as a {{power amplifier}} pushed into clipping can damage or destroy speakers. Amplifiers also typically provide protection against short circuits across the output, and excessive temperature (e.g., overheating). [...] A limiter {{is often used to}} protect loudspeakers and amplifiers from power amp clipping.|$|E
2500|$|The {{negative}} {{electrostatic field}} {{created by the}} grid {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode would inhibit passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volt difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and <b>power</b> <b>amplification.</b> In 1908, De Forest was granted a patent (...) for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{exoskeleton}} is {{an external}} structural mechanism with joints and links corresponding {{to those of}} the human body. Worn by the human, the exoskeleton transmits torques from proximally located actuators through rigid exoskeletal links to the human joints. This paper presents the development of an anthropometric seven degree-of-freedom powered exoskeleton for the upper limb. The design was based on a database defining the kinematics and the dynamics of the upper limb during daily living activities, as well as workspace analyses, joint ranges of motion, and joint physiological and upper limb anatomical considerations. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of pulley reductions were incorporated into the design of a cable-driven wearable robotic arm. This design led to low inertias, high-stiffness links, and back-drivable transmissions with zero backlash. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include use as: (1) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, (2) an assistive (orthotic) device for human <b>power</b> <b>amplifications,</b> (3) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and (4) a master device for teleoperation. *.

2500|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} multiplexer. [...] The terminal multiplexer {{contains a}} wavelength-converting transponder for each data signal, an optical multiplexer and where necessary an optical amplifier (EDFA). Each wavelength-converting transponder receives an optical data {{signal from the}} client-layer, such as Synchronous optical networking [...] or another type of data signal, converts this signal into the electrical domain and re-transmits the signal at a specific wavelength using a 1,550nm band laser. These data signals are then combined together into a multi-wavelength optical signal using an optical multiplexer, for transmission over a single fiber (e.g., SMF-28 fiber). The terminal multiplexer {{may or may not}} also include a local transmit EDFA for <b>power</b> <b>amplification</b> of the multi-wavelength optical signal.

2500|$|The {{assignment}} {{of the group}} was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers. [...] Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments mysteriously failed every time {{in all sorts of}} configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states, and they met almost daily to discuss the work. [...] The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged. By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to Physical Review. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments.

40|$|Explosive {{movements}} {{are necessary for}} many animals to capture prey or escape predators. The movements often require quick bursts of energy that cannot be supplied by muscles alone. Some animals, especially insects, store energy in their tendons by restraining motion with a physical catch, stretching the tendon by flexing the muscle and releasing the energy through the tendon. Since the tendon can release energy faster than the muscle, the peak powers can be much higher. This study asks whether an opposing muscle {{could be used as}} the catch in this scenario to restrain the motion. Using a novel apparatus developed in the MIT media lab, a model of this system was simulated using live muscle tissue. It was shown that for loads below 30 % of the maximum force of the muscle, using an antagonist muscle as a catch could produce beneficial <b>power</b> <b>amplifications.</b> These amplifications increase as the load and muscle release rates decrease. by Peter J.
