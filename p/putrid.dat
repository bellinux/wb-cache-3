5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a {{gigantic}} evil sea serpent of Orcadian folklore, capable of contaminating plants and destroying {{animals and humans}} with its <b>putrid</b> breath. It is probably an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent, or world serpent, and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and <b>putrid</b> odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by <b>putrid</b> fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his <b>putrid</b> carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

25|$|Protruding tonsilloliths {{may feel}} like foreign objects {{lodged in the}} tonsil crypt. They may be a {{nuisance}} and difficult to remove, but are usually not harmful. They {{are one of the}} causes of halitosis (bad breath) and always give off a <b>putrid</b> smell.|$|E
25|$|The {{flesh is}} whitish, though may be yellow to pale ochre when young. It slowly turns a faded blue colour when broken or bruised, {{although}} the stem bruises red. The smell is weak when the mushroom is young, but becomes <b>putrid</b> in older specimens, reminiscent of carrion. Young specimens reportedly have a pleasant nutty taste.|$|E
25|$|In the1820s, Swarcliffe and Stanks {{were part}} of the Barwick-in-Elmet parish. The name Stanks derives from a French word meaning ponds or pools of <b>putrid</b> water. Before the Swarcliffe Estate was built, the area {{contained}} Winmore Lodge (renamed Winn Moor Lodge in 1893), Penwell House, Hill Top, Spikeland Nook, Swarcliffe Farm, and a parochial school on Stanks Lane South/Barwick Road, which was replaced by Windsor Terrace before 1892.|$|E
25|$|During the {{surrender}} of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the Mestizos and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down {{by the number of}} bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so <b>putrid</b> with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water in their mouths, and frogs {{are known to be}} able to smell it. However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or <b>putrid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pepé Le Pew storylines {{typically}} involve Pepé {{in pursuit}} of a female black cat, whom Pepé mistakes for a skunk ("la belle femme skunk fatale"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted down her back, usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a fence with wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to get away from him because of his <b>putrid</b> odour, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pepé hops after her at a leisurely pace.|$|E
25|$|Max Jaffe was a {{distinguished}} 19th-century German biochemist, pathologist, pharmacologist, and professor. He {{was born on}} July 25, 1841, in what was formerly Grünberg, Silesia and is now Zielona Góra, Poland. While attending medical school at the University of Berlin, he studied under Ludwig Traube and Wilhelm Kühne. Afterward, he worked as an assistant in a medical clinic in Königsberg. There, he co-authored a paper on <b>putrid</b> sputum with Ernst Viktor von Leyden {{that led to the}} discovery of certain characteristic <b>putrid</b> processes in the lungs. After earning his degree in internal medicine, he served in the Franco-Prussian War and was decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class. The title of Extraordinary Professor of Medicinal Chemistry was awarded to him in 1872 and the following year he became the first Ordinary Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Königsberg. He was promoted to director of the Laboratory for Medical Chemistry and Experimental Pharmacology in 1878 and {{became a member of the}} Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina in 1882. Aside from studying creatinine, he is also known for discovering urobilin and urobilinogen in urine and found that these compounds originated in bile. He died on October 26, 1911 in Berlin and is buried in the Weißensee Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Satan's bolete is poisonous, {{especially}} when eaten raw, but also when cooked. The symptoms, which are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, include violent vomiting, which can {{last up to}} six hours. However, English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported in 1953 that it is consumed in parts of Italy and the former Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, some in the San Francisco Bay Area report having eaten it regularly without ill effects. However, all agree it must always be cooked. Ramsbottom speculated {{that there may be}} a regional variation in the toxicity, and concedes it may not be as poisonous as widely reported. This has been echoed by some contemporary mycologists; Rubroboletus satanas is rarely sampled casually due to its <b>putrid</b> smell and blue bruising.|$|E
25|$|Over fifty dead horses {{greeted them}} with their <b>putrid</b> smell. Forsyth’s command {{had been out of}} rations and forced to survive on the {{decaying}} horse flesh. Forsyth's 2nd in command, Lt. Fredrick H. Beecher, had been killed during the battle. Forsyth {{had been shot in the}} thigh, fracturing his leg, and wounded in the forehead. He was not expected to survive another day. The air around him was completely filled with a great stench and was swarming with black flies feasting on the rotting defensive line of dead horses. The square sandy hole, where Forsyth was lying was half encircled by dead mounts and would have become his grave if help had not arrived when it did. Other gun pits, interconnected, contained the living and the dead of his unit.|$|E
25|$|PMI {{estimation}} is used {{to figure}} out how much time has elapsed since a person died by using insects to help estimate this interval. It depends on the species of insect, as some are attracted to fresh corpses while others are only attracted to the <b>putrid</b> and advanced stages of decomposition. This means the insects go through waves of succession. Using this information as well as the lifecycle of the insect in question can help to estimate the PMI. The judgment depends on what stage of development the insect is in, as well as the weather in recent months among other factors. Specifically with C. cadaverina, they tend to be attracted to fairly advanced stages of decomposition, while rarely being found on fresh carrion. They also tend to be in the second wave of succession, usually showing up after Lucilia spp. and Calliphora spp.|$|E
25|$|His {{persecution}} of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, {{there were a}} significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ghagra cholis and entertain the court as nautch girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of negroes, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes. During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the Mestizos and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so <b>putrid</b> with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.|$|E
25|$|Sheep are {{sometimes}} eaten in considerable numbers, {{especially in the}} Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland (25.9% and 26.8% of nest remains respectively). Differentiating whether a lamb has been caught and killed while alive or scavenged as a carcass is possible if the remains are in good condition. In one examination of 10 such remains in nests in Scotland, {{it was found that}} 3 lambs had been taken alive and 7 after they had died. This suggests the majority of lambs are taken as carrion, which is reinforced by the fact that much ungulate carrion found around active nest sites in Scotland is already in a malodorous and <b>putrid</b> state. Domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) are occasionally predated as well. Goats slightly outnumbered sheep in the diet of eagles breeding on Corsica, with both domesticated animals making up 20.5% of the diet there and being the most important food source. In North America, lambs and goats were found to comprise less than 1.4% of all prey items. In Montana, it was found that most predation on lambs by golden eagles was committed by juvenile eagles or eagles that failed to breed (which have no need to carry prey to a nest). There {{it was found that the}} hunting of domestic stock peaks during wet, cold springs that seemed to adversely effect the local abundance of jackrabbits. Pigs (including feral and domestic varieties) are occasionally taken, especially in insular populations. Studies showed pigs (most certainly taken as carrion) made up to 13.3% of the diet in Corsica and 43.1% on Santa Cruz Island, California. Few wild pigs co-exist with golden eagles but wild boar (Sus scrofa) (likely only as piglets or carrion) have been taken in Bulgaria.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the odor}} of P.hadriani has been {{described}} by some authors as faint and pleasant or like violets, others describe the smell as [...] or <b>putrid.</b> The gleba is known to attract insects, including flies, bees, and beetles, some of which consume the spore-containing slime. It is thought that long-distance spore dispersal is facilitated by these insects, who may deposit in their feces intact spores that survive the passage through the digestive tract.|$|E

Conditions at Gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in the fly population. Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and <b>putrid.</b> The precarious Allied lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems.

Giant sea swells and earthquakes were attributed to the beast yawning, a sign it wanted to be fed rather than of fatigue. Islanders were terrified of the serpent; it was described by Traill Dennison, who transcribed its story, as [...] "the worst of the nine fearful curses that plague mankind". A further tale recorded by Traill Dennison gives a brief mention of another stoor worm, described as the progeny of the Orcadian monster, which is killed when it is severed in two by an oversized mythical ship.|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians {{are unable}} to chew and need to swallow food whole, so prey that is too large to swallow is torn into pieces. They {{may be unable to}} deal with a large animal with a thick hide, and may wait until it becomes <b>putrid</b> and comes apart more easily. To tear a chunk of tissue from a large carcass, a crocodilian spins its body {{continuously}} while holding on with its jaws, a manoeuvre known as the [...] "death roll". During cooperative feeding, some individuals may hold on to the prey, while others perform the roll. The animals do not fight, and each retires with a piece of flesh and awaits its next feeding turn. Food is typically consumed by crocodilians with their heads above water. The food is held with the tips of the jaws, tossed towards the back of the mouth by an upward jerk of the head and then gulped down. Nile crocodiles may store carcasses underwater for later consumption.|$|E
500|$|A {{considerable}} {{variation in}} height {{has been reported}} for the receptacle, ranging from [...] tall. The base of the fruit bodies {{are attached to the}} substrate by rhizomorphs (thickened cords of mycelia). The dark olive-green to olive-brown, foul-smelling sticky gleba covers the inner surface of the receptacle, except near the base. The odor—described as resembling rotting meat—attracts flies, other insects, and, in one report, a scarab beetle (Scarabaeus sacer) that help disperse the spores. The <b>putrid</b> odor—and people's reaction to it—have been well documented. In 1862 Mordecai Cubitt Cooke wrote [...] "it is recorded of a botanist who gathered one for the purpose of drying it for his herbarium, that he was compelled by the stench to rise during the night and cast the offender out the window." [...] American mycologist David Arora called the odor [...] "the vilest of any stinkhorn". The receptacle collapses about 24 hours after its initial eruption from the egg.|$|E
500|$|Supply {{distribution}} centers {{were established}} in Ormoc, providing residents with food, water, and materials, by November11. People were given a can of sardines and 1kg (2.2lb) of rice at these centers. These centers were only able to operate in daylight though {{due to a lack}} of fuel and transportation. Water was supplied in limited quantities from Cebu. Medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province, with many coming from surrounding areas. Residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks. Officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the Ormoc region. Many were found in the coastal barangays of Linao, Camp Downes, and Bantigue as well as the Ormoc pier. In order to prevent the spread of disease, mass graves were dug, with 700bodies buried on November8. Dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible. As decomposition set in, residents stated that [...] " [...] <b>putrid</b> smell was unbearable." [...] Even months after the storm, bodies were occasionally discovered, some found in drainage systems. By November10, four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near Ormoc for bodies; 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay. Roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by November12; however, electricity remained out. With the deployment of medical teams from Japan, hospitals in the region returned to full capacity. By November22, electricity and water had been 70percent and 60percent restored, respectively. The emergency phase of assistance ended on November29 and coordination of disaster relief was returned to the Philippines. By that time, national aid to Ormoc reached $1.1million, with more than half coming from a presidential grant.|$|E

The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most <b>putrid</b> picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in."
