5000|$|The lever {{escapement}} {{was invented by}} British clockmaker Thomas Mudge around 1755, and improved by Abraham-Louis Breguet (1787), Peter Litherland (1791), Edward Massey (1800), and its modern ("table roller") form was developed by George Savage in the early 1800s. [...] Since about 1900 virtually every mechanical watch, alarm clock and other <b>portable</b> <b>timepiece</b> has used the {{lever escapement}}.|$|E
5000|$|Another Egyptian shadow clock or sundial, {{possibly}} the first <b>portable</b> <b>timepiece,</b> came into use around 1500 BCE. This device divided a sunlit day into 10 parts plus two [...] "twilight hours" [...] {{in the morning}} and evening. When the long stem with 5 variably spaced marks was oriented east and west in the morning, an elevated crossbar on the east end cast a moving shadow over the marks. At noon, the device was turned in the opposite direction to measure the afternoon [...] "hours." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{braille watch}} is a <b>portable</b> <b>timepiece</b> {{used by the}} blind or {{visually}} impaired to tell time. It is used by touching the dial and noticing the embossments. Both analog and digital versions are available. The analog versions have a protective glass or crystal cover that is flipped open when time needs to be read and the clock-hands are constructed to not be susceptible to movement at the mere touch of the finger that a blind person uses to observe their positions. In the digital form, the dots (like braille script) keep changing position as time changes. In this case, one must understand the Braille alphabet to read the watch.|$|E
50|$|Pendulum clocks must be {{stationary}} to operate; any motion or accelerations {{will affect}} {{the motion of the}} pendulum, causing inaccuracies, so other mechanisms must be used in <b>portable</b> <b>timepieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{doubtful}} whether adding jewels {{in addition to}} the ones listed above is really useful in a watch. It does not increase accuracy, since the only wheels which {{have an effect on the}} balance wheel, those in the going train, are already jeweled. Marine chronometers, the most accurate <b>portable</b> <b>timepieces,</b> often have only 7 jewels. Nor does jeweling additional wheel bearings increase the useful life of the movement; as mentioned above most of the other wheels do not get enough wear to need them.|$|R
2500|$|Harrison {{solved the}} {{precision}} {{problems with his}} much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the £20,000 longitude prize. [...] His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring. [...] These features remained in use until stable electronic oscillators allowed very accurate <b>portable</b> <b>timepieces</b> to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of his work in The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper.|$|R
5000|$|In 1660, Hooke {{discovered}} {{the law of}} elasticity which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. He first described this discovery in the anagram [...] "ceiiinosssttuv", whose solution he published in 1678 as [...] "Ut tensio, sic vis" [...] meaning [...] "As the extension, so the force." [...] Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the balance spring or hairspring, which {{for the first time}} enabled a <b>portable</b> <b>timepiece</b> - a watch - to keep time with reasonable accuracy. A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see External links below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.It is interesting from a twentieth-century vantage point that Hooke first announced his law of elasticity as an anagram. This was a method sometimes used by scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, Galileo, and others, to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of the balance spring to the balance wheel around 1657 by Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens greatly increased the accuracy of <b>portable</b> <b>timepieces,</b> transforming early pocketwatches from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers. Improvements to the balance spring are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time. Modern balance springs are made of special low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the mainspring runs down. Before the 1980s, balance wheels and balance springs were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic quartz timekeeping technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of balance springs is in mechanical watches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} watches began in 16th century Europe, where watches evolved from {{portable}} spring-driven clocks, which {{first appeared in}} the 15th century. <b>Portable</b> <b>timepieces</b> were made possible by the invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century. Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1485-1542) is often credited as the inventor of the watch. [...] He {{was one of the first}} German craftsman who made [...] "clock-watches" [...] (taschenuhr), ornamental timepieces worn as pendants, which were the first timepieces to be worn on the body. His fame is based on a passage by Johann Cochläus in 1511:Peter Hele, still a young man, fashions works which even the most learned mathematicians admire. He shapes many-wheeled clocks out of small bits of iron, which run and chime the hours without weights for forty hours, whether carried at the breast or in a handbagHowever, other German clockmakers were creating miniature timepieces during this period, and there is no evidence Henlein was the first.|$|R
50|$|A highly {{important}} breakthrough for {{the accurate}} determination of longitude {{came with the}} invention of the marine chronometer. The 1714 longitude prize offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea.Harrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12 cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the £20,000 longitude prize. His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring. These features remained in use until stable electronic oscillators allowed very accurate <b>portable</b> <b>timepieces</b> to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of his work in The Principles of Mr. Harrisons time-keeper.|$|R
