5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a <b>preamplifier</b> module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
25|$|The first {{amplifier}} stage is a <b>preamplifier.</b> It amplifies the audio signal {{to a level}} that can drive the power stage.

25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} <b>preamplifier</b> and the earth, and shunted the <b>preamplifier</b> when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not leak to the output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the <b>preamplifier</b> had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 Deagan {{introduced}} a model, the Electravibe, that dispensed with resonator tubes entirely {{and took a}} signal directly off the bars, adding a tremolo in a <b>preamplifier.</b> This improved the portability of the instrument as well as solving the problem of miking the bars evenly that is inherent in all the tuned mallet instruments.|$|E
25|$|Fiber optic {{microphones}} are robust, {{resistant to}} environmental changes in heat and moisture, {{and can be}} produced for any directionality or impedance matching. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photo detector may be up to several kilometers without need for any <b>preamplifier</b> or other electrical device, making fiber optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.|$|E
25|$|NASA Langley has {{designed}} and developed an infrasonic detection {{system that can}} be used to make useful infrasound measurements at a location where it was not possible previously. The system comprises an electret condenser microphone PCB Model 377M06, having a 3-inch membrane diameter, and a small, compact windscreen. Electret-based technology offers the lowest possible background noise, because Johnson noise generated in the supporting electronics (<b>preamplifier)</b> is minimized.|$|E
50|$|Electrodes {{made with}} certain {{materials}} tend to perform better by increasing {{surface area of}} the electrodes. For instance, Indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have less surface area than those made with other materials, like titanium nitride. More surface area results in reducing impedance of electrode, then neurons signals are obtained easier. ITO electrodes tend to be flat with a relatively small surface area, and are often electroplated with platinum to increase surface area and improve signal-to-area ratio. Digital amplifiers and filters are produced small enough nowadays to be combined with electrodes, serving as <b>preamplifiers.</b> The need for <b>preamplifiers</b> is clear in thatthe signals that neurons (or any other organs) produce are weak. Therefore, <b>preamplifiers</b> preferably are to be placed near {{the source of the}} signals, where the electrodes are adjacent to. Another advantage for having <b>preamplifiers</b> close to the signal source is that the long wires lead to significant interference or noise. Therefore, it is best to have the wires as short as possible.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} play DVD-Audio, a <b>preamplifier</b> or {{surround}} controller with six analog inputs was originally required. Whereas DVD-Video audio formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS {{can be sent}} via the player's digital output to a receiver for conversion to analog form and distribution to speakers, DVD-Audio {{is not allowed to}} be delivered via unencrypted digital audio link at sample rates higher than 48kHz (i.e., ordinary DVD-Video quality) due to concerns about digital copying.|$|E
25|$|The {{microphone}} {{features a}} high membrane compliance {{with a large}} backchamber volume, a prepolarized backplane and a high impedance <b>preamplifier</b> located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low acoustic impedance and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability. Close-cell polyurethane foam {{has been found to}} serve the purpose well. In the proposed test, test parameters will be sensitivity, background noise, signal fidelity (harmonic distortion), and temporal stability.|$|E
25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising <b>preamplifier</b> results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E

500|$|Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new {{technique}} at the time which Corsaro believed {{was going to be}} the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two-track for the 12-bit mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's [...] "R room". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone <b>preamplifier</b> and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: [...] "Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left".|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} latest {{results of a}} {{research}} work started in 1986 in Milano, aiming at the optimisation of GaAs MESFETs and circuits for cryogenic readout of particle detectors used in experiment of high energy physics. For bolometric detectors we {{have been looking for}} low l/f noise and good dynamic performance at 4 K. We want also fast speed with low white noise and high radiation resistance for the readout of liquid Argon calorimeters. An ion-implanted MESFET process was selected for the realisation of FETs and monolithic <b>preamplifiers</b> for the mentioned applications.

500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone <b>preamplifier,</b> increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|E
