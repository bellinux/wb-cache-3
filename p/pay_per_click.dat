Soon afterward, Microsoft created the CodePlex collaborative development site for hosting open source projects. Activity grew quickly as developers from around the world began to participate, and by early 2007 commercial open source companies, such as Aras Corp,. began to offer enterprise open source software exclusively on the Microsoft platform.|$|E

An increasing number of merchants engaged in <b>pay</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|E

The utility that each agent derives from consumption of the item is private information to that agent, and prior to consumption, may be unknown to that agent. We describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational, asymptotically Bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante efficient. Our mechanism {{can be interpreted as}} a Cost-Per-Action or Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) charging scheme in online advertising.

In this scheme, instead of <b>paying</b> <b>per</b> <b>click,</b> the advertisers <b>pay</b> {{only when a}} user takes a specific action (e. g. fills out a form) or completes a transaction on their websites. We focus on designing efficient and incentive compatible mechanisms that use this charging scheme. We describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational, asymptotically Bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante efficient. In particular, we demonstrate our mechanism for the case where the utility functions of the advertisers are independent and identically-distributed random variables {{as well as the}} case where they evolve like independent reflected Brownian motions...|$|R

Those methods include organic search engine optimization (SEO), paid {{search engine marketing}} (PPC – <b>Pay</b> <b>Per</b> <b>Click),</b> e-mail marketing, content marketing and in some sense display advertising.

However, content sharing and creating has been the primary online activity of general social media users and that has forever changed online marketing. In the book Advanced Social media Marketing, the author gives an example of how a New York wedding planner might identify his audience when marketing on Facebook. Some of these categories may include: (1) who live in the United States; (2) Who live within 50 miles of New York; (3) Age 21 and older; (4) engaged female. No matter you choose to <b>pay</b> cost <b>per</b> <b>click</b> or cost <b>per</b> impressions/views [...] "the cost of Facebook Marketplace ads and Sponsored Stories is set by your maximum bid and the competition for the same audiences". The cost of clicks is usually $0.5-1.5 each.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{sponsored}} search auctions advertisers typically pay {{a fixed amount}} <b>per</b> <b>click</b> {{that their}} advertisements receive. In particular, the advertiser and the publisher {{enter into a contract}} (e. g., the publisher displays the ad; the advertiser pays the publisher 10 cents <b>per</b> <b>click),</b> and each party’s subjective value for such a contract depends on their estimated click-through rates (CTR) for the ad. Starting from this motivating example, we define and analyze a class of contract auctions that generalize the classical second price auction. As an application, we introduce impression-plus-click pricing for sponsored search, in which advertisers pay a fixed amount per impression plus an additional amount if their ad is clicked. Of note, when the advertiser’s estimated CTR is higher than the publisher’s estimated CTR, both parties find negative click payments advantageous, where the advertiser pays the publisher a premium for the impression but the publisher then <b>pays</b> the advertiser <b>per</b> <b>click.</b> ...|$|R
