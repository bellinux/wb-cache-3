40|$|Parking cost is an {{important}} and sensitive factor in understanding travel behavior and is typically utilized in the mode choice model of regional demand forecasting models. There are various socio-economics variables that can affect the value of parking cost by employment type, time periods, and trip purposes. In this study, a set of parking cost forecasting models are developed using survey data and local socio-economic data {{with the objective of}} identifying parking cost patterns and forecasting future parking costs. This study first summarizes methods applied in previous parking cost forecasting models. Two categories of models were estimated. The first category does not consider parking space supply as a factor in forecasting TAZ parking; the second category considers both parking space supply and parking demand as explanatory variables. For each category, using current off-street parking cost survey data, linear regression models are built for hourly, daily and monthly pricing for SCAG Tier 2 Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ) using R and Matlab. Daily <b>parking</b> <b>rates</b> are set as the base rates to generate the hourly and monthly parking cost models. The consideration of parking demand is a major contribution of this study, with demand generated based on home-based-work trip attractions for commuters by income groups in all models. This study found that daily <b>parking</b> <b>rates</b> can be explained by total employment, the proportion of office to total jobs, and the proportion of multiple to total households. Hourly parking cost can be explained based on daily <b>parking</b> <b>rates</b> and travel behavior associated with education, hospital, finance, entertainment and other employment types. The monthly parking cost model is built base on both daily and hourly <b>parking</b> <b>rates</b> as independent variables.

This paper describes an optimal structure of parking rates in terms of parking locations and time of day. A two-level parking model based on game theory is established using parking survey data collected in Beijing in 2014. The model was estimated based on Stackelberg game and the Nash equilibrium. Using the two-level parking model, the optimal structure of parking rates for inside/outside business zones and during peak/off-peak hours was calculated.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bandarjo Market {{is located}} in Gatot Subroto street Ungaran. It {{is one of the}} biggest {{traditional}} markets in Semarang regency. Gatot Subroto street is an alternative primary way to Semarang – Solo. Strategic location makes Bandarjo Market Ungaran has a lot of customers from the origin people or the people from out of town. Bandarjo Market which {{is located in}} the centre of business area in Ungaran has 16, 362 m 2, it is devided into 14, 588. 5 m 2 as a building and 1, 773. 5 m 2 as a parking lot in the market area. While for the land road which is used as the parking lot is located around the both building that is 1, 396. 5 m 2. The land road which is used as the parking lot involves : Tunggorono street, Raya Tunggorono street and Telomoyo street. That phenomena is caused by enough parking facility for vehicles that visit Bandarjo market and the lowly realization of the market visitors or the users. So it causes traffic disturbence the traffic this… in Jalan Gatot Subroto and the street around market. This matter can be seen from disorganized traffic in Bandarjo market either for those who are going to enter, look for the parking lot or for those who are going to leave from that area so, one of the problems caused is the traffic jam and uncomfortable feeling. From that analysis, it can make a hypotesis as follow : 1. The vehicle owners who visit there tend to choose the easy and the fast parking lot as on follow street. 2. The undiciplined road users and the mixed of public transportations which are entered in the system (in the lane around the market), and the limited of parking lot comparing with the height of parking volume, and a bad parking management become the caused of disorganization and the traffic jam around the market. The survey method in this research is using a primary data collection toward the parking demand (come, wait and leave from the system) by market visitors to analyse the arrival rate (λ) and <b>parking</b> <b>rate</b> (μ). A secondary data is used to predict the demand of parking involves : the population, PDRB, vehicle ownership and the amount of parking it self. In 2004, the amount of car peraday where parked in Bandarjo market is 1. 051 for car and 2. 081 for motorcycle. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the optimal parking capacity is 152 for cars and 296 for motorcycles. While the parking lot that is provided is only 103 for cars and 140 for motorcycles, so existing parking lot is not enough. From the prediction, the amount of vehicles that sure parked in Bandarjo market per day in 2014 is 4. 275 for cars and 5. 481 for motorcycles, with the necessity of parking lot as 618 for cars and 779 for motorcycles. From the calculation of Total Cost Programs it can get that the optimal <b>parking</b> <b>rate</b> is Rp. 4. 500, 00 for car and Rp. 1. 100, 00 for motorcycle. Based on the respondens survey, it shows that the <b>parking</b> <b>rate</b> wanted by the people are Rp. 300, 00 – Rp. 600, 00, so it is needed a policy subsidy from the government...|$|E

40|$|Parking is an {{important}} and {{integral part of the}} transportation system in a metropolitan area. The provision of parking is expensive. The parking rates required for parking at developments should be sufficient, but care should also be taken not to provide too much parking. Insufficient parking, on the other hand, can result in overflow or queuing on the street network and illegal parking on the sidewalks and in the road reserve. A parking policy and parking provision requirements are essential element of any urban transport plan. Surveys were undertaken by the former Centurion Town Council (CTC) and on an ad hoc basis by the former City Council of Pretoria (CCP). This information was combined and recommended rates were determined for different land uses. The approach followed was not to obtain statistically reliable data (as it is impossible with the available data), but to: < obtain a reasonable indication of the parking rates of existing land uses, and < compare between the parking rates determined with new surveys and the parking rates required in previous studies (some were done several years ago), which are included in the existing documentation.

30|$|Of {{interest}} to {{this research is}} the state of practice on parking policies for commercial vehicles. For more than a decade, studies have been developed with respect to parking management of commercial vehicles. On-street parking facilities for trucks were incorporated in an experimental study with truck drivers in Japan to understand the attitudes towards the implementation of these regulations [36]. Solutions to commercial vehicle parking have been related to land use management, public infrastructure, access conditions, traffic management, enforcement and promotion, as discussed in [37]. An example of strict parking enforcement as a way of regulating freight traffic is the NYC Department of Transportation, that implemented a number of parking restrictions, including standing time limits (no more than three hours parking) and requiring commercial vehicles to park close to the curb so as to not occupy more than 10  ft. of roadway space from nearest curb. These restrictions were applied between 7  am and 7  pm, Mondays through Saturdays for commercial vehicles in Midtown Manhattan [38]. The Park Smart Project, also in New York City, has also been implemented to make parking easier, where they provided an escalating <b>parking</b> <b>rate</b> structure. Other innovative transportation demand management policies were suggested by Holguin-Veras and others [39], which aimed to solve the freight traffic issues in New York City. One of these solutions, the Off-hour Delivery (OHD) Program was analyzed as a way of mitigating the parking problem in the city [3]. In Washington D.C., other examples of innovative solutions were discussed for the use of downtown curbsides for freight delivery [40]. In San Francisco, the shared spaces approach was used to optimize the parking slot allocation, where pedestrians and delivery trucks shared platforms, such as the on-street loading bays. As cited by the authorities, “more than half of the curbside spaces in the downtown core are reserved for commercial loading activities [41]”. A more recent classification of specific parking related solutions were discussed in [4, 42].|$|E

Develop of ringroad as alternative way. All alternatives policy will be analysis by 3 component of respondent, there is key persons, citizen’s around Teuku Umar street and the users of Teuku Umar street. The result of this research indicated that according to the whole alternatives of every aspect by each respondent choose policy to reduce traffic congestion with providing mass public transport like BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) with inconsistency ratio about < 0, 1 it means that this analysis is consisten and could be accepted. Providing BRT is a higher priority policy. Providing BRT has an effectiveness to reduce traffic congestion because with the exisctence of BRT is expected could change the perception of the citizens to change from using their private vehicle to using mass transport like in the advance country.

40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, <b>parking</b> <b>rate</b> and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of transportation engineering and planning has employed trip and <b>parking</b> generation <b>rates</b> {{to determine the}} number of trips generated and attracted by developments, as well as the required number of parking spaces for facilities. Trip generation serves as an input to modeling transportation requirements and traffic flows influenced by the development. For example, a residential condominium may directly impact traffic within a 10 km radius. Meanwhile, a shopping mall can impact an area of over 50 km in radius. Thus, it is expected that most trips generated or attracted by the development would be captured within these influence areas.
