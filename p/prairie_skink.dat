5000|$|Southern <b>prairie</b> <b>skink,</b> P. s. obtusirostris (Bocourt, 1879), {{originally}} {{described as}} Eumeces obtusirostris.|$|E

50|$|<b>Prairie</b> <b>skinks</b> {{are good}} burrowers; they {{hibernate}} in burrows they dig themselves below the frost line. They are very secretive and are rarely {{seen in the}} open except during their breeding season in spring.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prairie</b> <b>skinks</b> {{hibernate}} {{from about}} September to late April. In spring, when they emerge, the males start developing a bright orange coloring on the jaws and throat: the breeding season has begun. The female lays {{eight to ten}} eggs after a gestation time of about 40 days. The eggs hatch in August; hatchlings are about 5 cm long. They reach sexual maturity in their third year.|$|R
50|$|Nine snake {{species are}} found in this arid environment, the plains hog-nosed snake, western coachwhip, bullsnake, longnose snake, plains {{blackhead}} snake, blackneck garter snake, plains garter snake, lined snake, and prairie rattlesnake. The broad-headed <b>skink,</b> <b>prairie</b> racerunner, red-lipped plateau lizard, northern earless lizard, eastern collared lizard, and Texas horned lizard are also indigenous to the area. Two types of turtle, the ornate box turtle and the yellow mud turtle {{have been found in}} the Black Mesa preserve. Only one frog is found in this desert habitat, the American bullfrog, but there are six other species of amphibians; the Great Plains narrowmouth toad, New Mexico spadefoot, plains spadefoot, Woodhouse's toad, red-spotted toad, and the western green toad, all toads.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Baird in 1859. Two subspecies are generally recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> {{lives in}} sandy habitat or open grasslands with loose soil, preferably with some rocks {{providing}} shelter and places {{to bask in}} the sun, and close to a water source.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon septentrionalis) is {{a species}} of skink endemic to the prairies east of the Rocky Mountains in North America. It {{is one of only}} five species of lizards that occur in Canada.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> {{is a small}} lizard, {{reaching}} a total length (body + tail) of about 13 to 22 cm (5 to nearly 9 inches). Adult prairie skinks are brown or tan {{on the back and}} darker on the sides and have several thin lighter stripes along the sides and the back. Juveniles have bright blue tails, the color of which fades when they mature.|$|E
50|$|The {{ranges of}} the two {{subspecies}} are disjunct. The range of the northern subspecies extends from eastern North Dakota and Minnesota south to central Kansas. A small isolated population lives in southwestern Manitoba in Canada—it is the only lizard in Manitoba {{and is one of}} only five lizard species to occur in Canada; the northern <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> is protected in Canada. The southern subspecies occurs in Oklahoma and Texas.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with all}} tetrapods, lizards rely on {{internal}} fertilisation and copulation involves the male inserting {{one of his}} hemipenes into the female's cloaca. The majority of species are oviparous (egg laying). The female deposits the eggs in a protective structure like a nest or crevice or simply on the ground. Depending on the species, clutch size can vary from 4-5 percent of the females body weight to 40-50 percent and clutches range from {{one or a few}} large eggs to dozens of small ones. In most lizards, the eggs have leathery shells to allow for the exchange of water, although more arid-living species have calcified shells to retain water. Inside the eggs, the embryos use nutrients from the yolk. Parental care is uncommon and the female usually abandons the eggs after laying them. Brooding and protection of eggs does occur in some species. The female <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> uses respiratory water loss to maintain the humidity of the eggs which facilitates embryonic development. In lace monitors, the young hatch close to 300 days and the female returns to help them escape the termite mound were the eggs were laid.|$|E
40|$|From 1996 – 1998 I {{estimated}} {{the density of}} prairie skinks (Eumeces septentrionalis) in old fields and evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on density. I estimated <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density from a trapping grid using a mark-recapture method in seven old fields. For each field I estimated arthropod density, percent plant cover and recorded field age and if the field had been burned in the last 5 y. Arthropod density was highly variable among years and fields. Percent plant cover did not explain this variation, as it varied little among fields and years. <b>Prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density ranged from 58 – 206 adults per ha among fields and was significantly correlated with field age, arthropod abundance and burn treatment. Because of {{the small number of}} replicated sampling units, however, I was unable to determine the independent effects of each factor. <b>Prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density increased with successional age but the mechanisms responsible for this pattern remain unclear...|$|E
40|$|Alloparental care, or one {{individual}} {{caring for the}} eggs or young of another, ha s been documented {{for a variety of}} verte brate organism s (Coyne 2 ̆ 6 Sohn 1978; Frame et a 1. 1983; Gowaty 2 ̆ 6 Karlin 1984).

40|$|On 8 June 1984, at the {{intersection}} of California Street and the Union Pacific RR tracks, just west of Saddle Creek Road in Omaha, a Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscala) was seen flying approximately 2 m above the observer, with a large adult <b>prairie</b> <b>skink,</b> (Eumeces septentrionalis) (Reptilia; Sauria) in its bill. The Grackle had difficulty flying, since the skink was somewhat heavy and struggling violently, The Grackle dropped to the ground about 7 m away and released the lizard. The skink lay on its back, twitching slightly. The distal half of its tail was missing. The lack of male breeding colors and presence of a relatively stout abdomen during this season indicated that it was a gravid female. When I approached to within 3 m of the Grackle, it immediately grabbed the skink and flew away. This observation occurred at 1315. It is not known if the lizard was eventually ingested...|$|E
40|$|Of the 60 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} and reptiles presently known from Nebraska, 27 {{are found in the}} Sand Hills and one more is marginal to the east. Fourteen species of the 60 are essentially state wide in distribution, including the Sand Hills, and eight species of reptiles are strongly influenced by the Sand Hills (Lynch, 1985). Of 12 species that occur widely over the moister eastern part of the state, only four extend into the Sand Hills, and one occurs only under the wet conditions along the rivers of the eastern Sand Hills.
