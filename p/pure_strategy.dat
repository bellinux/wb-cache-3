Clubs are endowed with initial players but at a cost clubs are able to sell their initial players and buy new players. The results are that: if the quality of players is one-dimensional, then equilibria in <b>pure</b> <b>strategies</b> exist, and; if the quality of players is multi-dimensional, then there need not exist equilibria in <b>pure</b> <b>strategies,</b> but equilibria in mixed strategies exist.

25|$|In this formulation, {{the first}} {{condition}} specifies that {{the strategy is}} a Nash equilibrium, and the second specifies that Maynard Smith's second condition is met. Note that the two definitions are not precisely equivalent: for example, each <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> in the coordination game below is an ESS by the first definition but not the second.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit mixed {{strategies}} (where a <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%,100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player is (50%, 50%).|$|E
25|$|A second interpretation, that Nash {{referred}} to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: ``t is unnecessary {{to assume that the}} participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. What is assumed {{is that there is a}} population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> is employed by the ``average member of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

The first m constraints require the probabilities to benon-negative, and the other n constraints require each of the n <b>pure</b> <b>strategies</b> ofplayer 2 to have an expected payoff of at most 1.P2 has a similar meaning, reversing {{the roles of the}} players.|$|R
25|$|A play {{is thus a}} {{path through}} the tree from the root to a {{terminal}} node. At any given non-terminal node belonging to Chance, an outgoing branch is chosen according to the probability distribution. At any rational player's node, the player must choose one of the equivalence classes for the edges, which determines precisely one outgoing edge except (in general) the player doesn't know which one is being followed. (An outside observer knowing every other player's choices up to that point, and the realization of Nature's moves, can determine the edge precisely.) A <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> for a player thus consists of a selectionchoosing precisely one class of outgoing edges for every information set (of his). In a game of perfect information, the information sets are singletons. It's less evident how payoffs should be interpreted in games with Chance nodes. It is assumed that each player has a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function defined for every game outcome; this assumption entails that every rational player will evaluate an a priori random outcome by its expected utility.|$|E
2500|$|Even if a {{game has}} <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> Nash equilibria, {{it might be}} that none of those pure {{strategies}} are ESS. Consider the Game of chicken. [...] There are two <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> Nash equilibria in this game (Swerve, Stay) and (Stay, Swerve). However, {{in the absence of an}} uncorrelated asymmetry, neither Swerve nor Stay are ESSes. There is a third Nash equilibrium, a mixed strategy which is an ESS for this game (see Hawk-dove game and Best response for explanation).|$|E

[...] In the {{centipede}} game, a <b>Pure</b> <b>strategy</b> consists {{of a set of}} actions (one for each choice point in the game, even though some of these choice points may never be reached) and a Mixed strategy is a probability distribution over the possible pure strategies. [...] There are several <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> Nash equilibria of the centipede game and infinitely many mixed strategy Nash equilibria. [...] However, there is only one subgame perfect equilibrium (a popular refinement to the Nash equilibrium concept).|$|E

2500|$|... "Integer pricing" [...] as {{explored}} by Huw Dixon. Rather than treat price {{as a continuous}} variable, it is treated as a discrete variable. [...] This means that firms cannot undercut each other by an arbitrarily small amount, one of the necessary ingredients giving rise to the non-existence of a <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> equilibrium. This can give rise to multiple pure-strategy equilibria, {{some of which may}} be distant from the competitive equilibrium price. More recently, Prabal Roy Chowdhury has combined the notion of discrete pricing with the idea that firms choose prices and the quantities they want to sell at that price as in Allen–Hellwig.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of best {{response}} correspondences, {{some models}} use smoothed best response functions.

The difference is illustrated in Figure 8, where black represents the best response correspondence and the other colors each represent different smoothed best response functions. In standard best response correspondences, even the slightest benefit to one action will result in the individual playing that action with probability 1. In smoothed best response as the difference between two actions decreases the individual's play approaches 50:50.|$|E

An extension of Rath's (1992) proof to the case of limited anonymity is proposed: the behavior of the population as a whole, is shown sufficient to get equilibrium existence in <b>pure</b> <b>strategies.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{structure}} of the set of equilibria for two person multicriteria games is analysed. It turns out that the classical result for the set of equilibria for bimatrix games, that it is a finite union of polytopes, is only valid for multicriteria games if one of the players only has two <b>pure</b> <b>strategies.</b> A full polyhedral description of these polytopes can be derived when the player with an arbitrary number of <b>pure</b> <b>strategies</b> has one criterion. ...|$|R
2500|$|Because {{the loss}} of {{swerving}} is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy {{would seem to be}} to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that he will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying {{there is more than one}} Nash equilibrium, which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing his own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A logit equilibrium, the Gibbs measure from {{statistical}} mechanics, {{was shown}} to be the equilibrium of a finite-player potential game, where players {{are assumed to be}} bounded-rational in one of two ways. [...] Dynamically, players follow the gradient of the potential on <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> space, perturbed by a random variable (motivated by the inherent behavior strategy randomness used to justify a classical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium). Alternately, a static notion of equilibrium can be used, based on agents arbitraging information out of the system to adapt and improve, as gauged by (Shannon) information entropy. [...] The dynamics are a variation of those that result in a quantal response equilibrium, the difference being instantaneous utility functions are used instead of expected values of utilities to accommodate markets with repeatedly interacting agents. [...] Specifically, the quantal response equilibrium is a mean-field version of the Gibbs measure.|$|E
2500|$|In the one {{population}} model, {{the only}} stable {{state is the}} mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

[...] (This occurs because the only ESS is the mixed strategy equilibrium.) [...] In the two population model, this mixed point becomes unstable. [...] In fact, the only stable states in the two population model correspond to the <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> equilibria, where one population is composed of all Hawks and the other of all Doves. [...] In this model one population becomes the aggressive population while the other becomes passive. [...] This model is illustrated by the vector field pictured in Figure 7a.

Two axioms are considered. The first says that a player is irrational if she chooses a particular strategy while believing that another strategy is better. We show that common belief of this weak notion of rationality characterizes the iterated deletion of <b>pure</b> <b>strategies</b> that are strictly dominated by <b>pure</b> <b>strategies.</b> The second axiom says that a player is irrational if she chooses a particular strategy while believing that a different strategy {{is at least as}} good and she considers it possible that this alternative strategy is actually better than the chosen one.

2500|$|The {{existence}} of <b>pure</b> <b>strategy</b> Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in potential games, and multiple Nash equilibria may exist. Learning algorithms such as [...] "best response" [...] and [...] "better response" [...] can only {{guarantee that the}} iterative learning process can converge {{to one of the}} Nash equilibria (if multiple). Equilibrium selective learning algorithms aim to design a strategy where convergence to the best Nash equilibrium, with respect to the potential function, is guaranteed. In, the authors propose an equilibrium selective algorithm named MaxLogit, which provably converges to the best Nash equilibrium at the fastest speed in its class, using mixing rate analysis of induced Markovian chains. In a special case where every player shares the same objective function (hence the potential function), and possibly the same action set, the problem is equivalent to distributed combinatorial optimization which arises in many engineering applications. Equilibrium selective learning algorithms such as MaxLogit can be used in such combinatorial optimizations, even in a distributed fashion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{evolutionary}} approaches have established that when {{played in a}} large population, players might fail to play the payoff dominant equilibrium strategy and instead {{end up in the}} payoff dominated, risk dominant equilibrium. Two separate evolutionary models both support the idea that the risk dominant equilibrium is more likely to occur. [...] The first model, based on replicator dynamics, predicts that a population is more likely to adopt the risk dominant equilibrium than the payoff dominant equilibrium. The second model, based on best response strategy revision and mutation, predicts that the risk dominant state is the only stochastically stable equilibrium. Both models assume that multiple two-player games are played in a population of N players. The players are matched randomly with opponents, with each player having equal likelihoods of drawing any of the N1 other players. The players start with a <b>pure</b> <b>strategy,</b> G or H, and play this strategy against their opponent. In replicator dynamics, the population game is repeated in sequential generations where subpopulations change based on the success of their chosen strategies. In best response, players update their strategies to improve expected payoffs in the subsequent generations. The recognition of Kandori, Mailath & Rob (1993) and Young (1993) was that if the rule to update one's strategy allows for mutation, and the probability of mutation vanishes, i.e. asymptotically reaches zero over time, the likelihood that the risk dominant equilibrium is reached goes to one, even if it is payoff dominated.|$|E
