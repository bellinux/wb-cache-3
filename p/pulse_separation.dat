50|$|Recent {{developments}} in LIBS {{have seen the}} introduction of double-pulsed laser systems. For double-pulse LIBS one distinguishes between orthogonal and perpendicular configuration. In perpendicular configuration the laser fires twice on the same spot on the specimen with a <b>pulse</b> <b>separation</b> {{in the order of}} one to a couple of tens of microseconds. Depending on <b>pulse</b> <b>separation,</b> the second pulse is more or less absorbed by the plasma plume caused by the previous pulse, resulting in a reheating of the laser plasma leading to signal enhancement.In orthogonal configuration a laser pulse is fired parallel to the sample surface either before or after the perpendicular pulse hits the specimen. The laser plasma ignited in the surrounding medium above the surface by a first pulse causes (by its shock wave) an area of reduced pressure above the specimen into which the actual plasma from the sample can expand. This has similar positive effects on sensitivity like LIBS performed at reduced pressures.If the orthogonal laser pulse is delayed with respect to the perpendicular one, the effects are similar as in the perpendicular configuration. Timing electronics such as digital delay generators can precisely control the timing of both pulses. In recent, fully 3D simulation/modeling captured the shockwave movement and interactions with wall.|$|E

Various techniques have extended the dynamic range, however flows with a wide velocity range (e. g., impinging jets) still challenge PIV algorithms.

The multiple <b>pulse</b> <b>separation</b> (MPS) technique (i) records series of double-frame exposures with different pulse separations, (ii) processes the fields using conventional multi-grid algorithms, and (iii) yields a composite velocity field with a locally optimized <b>pulse</b> <b>separation.</b> A robust criterion determines the local optimum <b>pulse</b> <b>separation,</b> accounting for correlation strength and measurement uncertainty. Validation experiments are performed in an impinging jet flow, using laser-Doppler velocimetry as reference measurement.

Structures have been proposed for implementing rake receivers to enhance their capabilities by reducing the bit error probability (Pe), thereby providing better performances by indoor and outdoor multipath receivers. As a result, several rake structures have been proposed {{in the past to}} reduce the number of resolvable paths that must be estimated and combined. To achieve this aim, we suggest two maximal ratio combiners based on the <b>pulse</b> sign <b>separation</b> technique, such as the <b>pulse</b> sign <b>separation</b> selective combiner (PSS-SC) and the <b>pulse</b> sign <b>separation</b> partial combiner (PSS-PC) to reduce complexity with fewer fingers and to improve the system performance.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{interaction}} of two temporally separated soliton pulses in a two-core optical fiber by solving numerically a pair of linearly coupled nonlinear wave equations. In the absence of coupling coefficient dispersion, two soliton pulses launched into one core of the fiber coalesce after propagating a distance along the fiber. This coalescence distance increases with the initial <b>pulse</b> <b>separation</b> and is insensitive to the coupling coefficient of the fiber, namely, the physical separation of the two fiber cores. Beyond the initial coalescence distance, the pulses may undergo periodic separation and coalescence along the fiber with a spatial period depending on the initial <b>pulse</b> <b>separation</b> and the coupling coefficient of the fiber. In the presence of coupling coefficient dispersion, the pulse evolution dynamics becomes asymmetrical and complicated. Significant pulse break-up effects can be observed. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Stick-slip, {{manifest}} as intermittent tangential motion {{between two}} solids, {{is a well-known}} friction instability that occurs {{in a number of}} natural and engineering systems. In the context of adhesive polymer interfaces, this phenomenon has often been solely associated with Schallamach waves, which are termed slow waves due to their low propagation speeds. We study the dynamics of a model polymer interface using coupled force measurements and high speed in situ imaging, to explore the occurrence of stick-slip linked to other slow wave phenomena. Two new waves [...] -slip <b>pulse</b> and <b>separation</b> <b>pulse</b> [...] -both distinct from Schallamach waves, are described. The slip pulse is a sharp stress front that propagates {{in the same direction as}} the Schallamach wave, while the <b>separation</b> <b>pulse</b> involves local interface detachment and travels in the opposite direction. Transitions between these stick-slip modes are easily effected by changing the sliding velocity or normal load. The properties of these three waves, and their relation to stick-slip is elucidated.

As an example, we choose SO_ 2 and investigate the alignment dynamics induced by two different sequences, each consisting of four identical laser pulses. Each sequence differs only in the time delay between the pulses. Equally spaced pulses matching the alignment revival of the symmetrized SO_ 2 rotor model are exploited in the first sequence. The <b>pulse</b> <b>separations</b> in the second sequence are short compared to the rotation dynamics of the molecule and monotonically increase the degree of alignment until the maximum alignment is reached. We point out the {{significant differences between the}} alignment dynamics of SO_ 2 treated as an asymmetric-top and a symmetric-top rotor, respectively. We also explain why the fast sequence of laser pulses creates considerably stronger one-dimensional molecular alignment for asymmetric-top molecules. In addition, we show that multiple-pulse trains with elliptically polarized pulses do not enhance one-dimensional alignment or create three-dimensional alignment. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{nonlinear}} optical loop mirror (NOLM) is reported in this Master Thesis. NOLM {{has become one of}} the most promising devices for high bit rates demultiplexing and for this, a lot of efforts have been put on its improvement in the last years. This work tries to find the keys for the optimization of the demultiplexing of an OTDM signal at 160 Gbit/s. First, the nonlinear response of the fibers is studied theoretically, accompanied by some simulations that demonstrate the effects the fibers introduce in an optical pulse propagating through them. The operation of the NOLM is going to rely on those effects and on some other concepts analyzed afterwards. The dependence of parameters of the NOLM such as the phase shift, the output power and the switching window are studied not only in a theoretical way but also by the performance of simulations as a function of the control signal and fiber characteristics. From those simulations, some important conclusions that allow an optimized demultiplexing of the OTDM signal are taken.

We find evidence for systematic trends having {{the character of a}} pattern of reverberations following an initial disturbance. The initial pulses have brightness increases of order 20 % and pulse widths of 50 days, and the reverberations have typical amplitudes of 12 % with longer mean pulse widths of order 80 days and <b>pulse</b> <b>separations</b> of order 90 days. The repeat pattern occurs over the same time scales whether the initial disturbance is a brightening or fading. The lags of the pulse trains are comparable to the lags seen previously in reverberation of the broad blue-shifted emission lines following brightness disturbances in Seyfert galaxies, when allowance is made for the mass of the central object. In addition to the burst pulse trains, we find evidence for a semi-periodicity with a time scale of 2 years. These strong patterns of brightness fluctuations suggest a method of discovering quasars from photometric monitoring alone, with data of the quality expected from large brightness monitoring programs like Pann-Stars and LSST.

40|$|Optimal control induced {{processes}} of fragmentative and non-fragmentative wave packet dynamics are investigated in model systems of small alkali metal clusters. In {{order to find}} fs pulse forms optimal for specific photoinduced processes a setup for optimal control experiments was developed. In a self learning feedback loop the fs pulse shaper was controlled by an optimization algorithm. The optimal pulse forms were found by maximizing the product yield. The pulse shaper consists of a liquid crystal modulator with 128 pixels situated in the fourier plane of a zero dispersion compressor. Independent computer control of spectral phase and amplitude allowed for the generation of arbitrarily predefined pulse shapes. Free optimization of 128 phase parameters was possible even under the presence of noise by applying non-deterministic evolutionary strategies. The capabilities of the algorithm could be tested by adaptive recompression of dispersively broadened fs-pulses. Full characterization of the optimized pulse forms including the determination of chirp and phase was achieved by cross correlation and XFROG techniques. Small alkali clusters were produced in a molecular beam and mass selectively detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. As a model system for fragmentation the mixed trimer Na 2 K was optimized to dissociate into NaK by maximizing the NaK+ yield. Since NaK {{was also in the}} beam first the optimization of the transient three photon ionization of NaK was studied. It could be shown {{for the first time that}} the optimized pulse forms can carry dynamical properties of the controlled molecular system. Pulse trains consisting of three pulses were found with <b>pulse</b> <b>separations</b> that matched half and full oscillation periods of the wave packet in the excited A 1 S+ state of NaK. The relative intensities uniquely corresponded to the one and two-photon transitions of the Franck-Condon-windows. On this basis sequential pump-probe/pump-probe processes could be identified. The effectiveness of positively chirped pulse form elements for population transfer into the ion state could be demonstrated as well. The optimized selective fragmentation process into the NaK channel could be identified as a dump-pump process according to a double pulse structure being additional to ionization optimization results. The larger the dissociative clusters the more pulses with higher complexity appeared, giving rise to sequential fragmentation into intermediate masses. The parameterization of the phase function lead to a decrease of the optimization time. By reducing the dimensionality of the search space the contribution of single pulse form properties on the optimized processes could be measured. In the case of the potassium dimer a three parameter optimization using sinusoidal spectral phase modulation lead to triple pulse sequences with <b>pulse</b> <b>separations</b> of half the wave packet oscillation period. In general an increase of system complexity gave more complex pulse form structures and higher product yields: free optimization of e. g. multi photon processes in the trimer Na 2 K found partly non-intuitive pulse forms where a comparison with the theory is needed for total identification of the underlying effective processes...|$|R

Conventional, range resolved, DIAL measurements require laser pulse widths that are significantly shorter than the desired spatial resolution and necessitate using pulses whose temporal spacing is such that scattered returns from only a single pulse are observed by the receiver at any one time (for the PBL <b>pulse</b> <b>separations</b> must be greater than approximately 20 microseconds).

This increases the counts received by approximately two orders of magnitude. Our approach involves employing two distributed feedback lasers (DFB), each modulated by a different RPZN code, whose outputs are then amplified by a CW fiber amplifier.
