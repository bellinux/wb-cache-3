30|$|Certificate chains {{have been}} used in the {{literature}} to support degrees of accountability of authorisation [16]–[18]. The micro-billing scheme [16] uses KeyNote to help determine whether a micro-check (a KeyNote credential, signed by a customer) should be trusted and accepted as payment by a merchant. In [17], delegation credentials are used to manage the transfer of micropayment contracts between public keys; delegation chains provide evidence of contract transfer and ensure accountability for double-spending. The mechanisms that underly these schemes are similar to our service-reselling example in that there can be misinterpretation as to which principal (bank) originates the permission (authority for payment). These systems are also vulnerable to delegation subterfuge (leading to a breakdown in accountability) if care is not taken to properly identify the permissions indicating the <b>payment</b> <b>authorizations</b> when multiple banks and/or provisioning agents are possible.|$|R

The design process is {{organized around the}} authentication tests, a method for protocol verification based on the strand space theory. The authentication tests dictate how randomly generated values such as nonces may be combined with encryption to achieve authentication and freshness. ATSPECT offers functionality and security guarantees akin to the purchase request, <b>payment</b> <b>authorization,</b> and payment capture phases of SET, the secure electronic transaction standard created by the major credit card firms. In previous work [10, 12, 8], we have developed a method—called the “authentication test ” method—that {{can be used by}} hand to verify cryptographic protocols. We also pointed out that the same ideas can be used to guide the protocol development process, quickly leading to new protocols; proofs of correctness for these protocols then follow from the development process. In [10, 12] we illustrated the point by “reinventing ” preexisting protocols. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use it to create a completely new protocol with highly non-trivial functionality. We call our new protocol ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions. It is intended to achieve the essential security goals of the existing Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) purchase request, <b>payment</b> <b>authorization,</b> and payment capture phases, as we understand them. The Secure Electronic Transaction protocol [15] was a major effort undertaken by a consortium of credit card companies and banks in the mid- 90 s.

Contrary to WebSOS, we use Graphic Turing Tests (GTTs) to prevent malicious code, such as a worm, from using a users' micropayment wallet.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design of a fare engine which {{operates}} within the constraints of using contactless bankcards as a fare instrument, while satisfying the complex current and future fare requirements of Transport for London (TfL). A fare engine is a system which transforms user transactions at fare gates and validators into chargeable fares. Contactless bankcard fare payment differs from current fare smartcard systems by requiring a centralized fare engine. The proposed fare engine utilizes a data structure which maintains each user's journey history in three successive tiers of linked objects. This structure enables transactions to be correctly sequenced without a guarantee of in-order arrival of gate and validator transactions. A cleanup routine prevents the data structure from growing without bound as journey history accumulates. A dynamic journey linking mechanism allows the effect of inserted transactions to be propagated throughout the data structure and reflected in the affected journeys with near-constant time complexity. This ensures scalability while providing real-time feedback for customer service and <b>payment</b> <b>authorization</b> needs...|$|E
40|$|A {{need for}} secure payment methods in the mobile access {{channels}} has arisen {{as a result}} of the increase of on-line commerce. Most of the current payment methods that can be used in conducting transactions e. g. on the Internet have major drawbacks either in terms of functionality, usability, costs or security. The only widely accepted way of securely and reliably authorizing electronic payment transactions is through the use of digital signatures in a PKI framework. Organizations like the WAP Forum and MeT Initiative have made efforts to introduce industry standards for bringing PKI capabilities to mobile phones. The WAP version 1. 2. 1 compliant handsets already come with support for making digital signatures using the wireless identity module WIM. These new capabilities readily lend themselves to implementing mobile payment systems.

40|$|Executive Summary: Today {{the risks}} {{associated}} with PC downloads are all too familiar. A music, video, or other file, which has been pulled via unicast over the Internet into a standard PC, can be instantaneously copied, and redistributed, at will. Companies have responded to this piracy by introducing various digital rights management (DRM) schemes, and by streaming content rather than downloading entire files, attempting to make unauthorized copying harder than the current “point-and-click ” scenario. The problem is that the commonly used DRM mechanisms are software-only solutions and, as some pundits have said, “software security is an oxymoron. ” Most of the current security mechanisms have already been hacked, and streamed content also remains insecure. While the security of downloads is a valid concern, {{it is important to recognize}} that the security of content is defined by the means used to protect it, not where the content is located. Content on an insecure server is vulnerable to attack by programs commonly available on the Internet. Content securely cached on the hard drive can be made virtually impossible to obtain without proper <b>payment</b> and <b>authorization.</b> This paper details the security of a content distribution/storage model in which content i...|$|R

50|$|The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an industry-wide set of {{guidelines}} that must be met by any organization that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data, mandates that credit card data must be protected when stored. Tokenization, as applied to payment card data, is often implemented to meet this mandate, replacing credit card and ACH numbers in some systems with a random value or string of characters. Tokens can be formatted {{in a variety of}} ways. Some token service providers or tokenization products generate the surrogate values {{in such a way as}} to match the format of the original sensitive data. In the case of payment card data, a token might be the same length as a Primary Account Number (bank card number) and contain elements of the original data such as the last four digits of the card number. When a <b>payment</b> card <b>authorization</b> request is made to verify the legitimacy of a transaction, a token might be returned to the merchant instead of the card number, along with the authorization code for the transaction. The token is stored in the receiving system while the actual cardholder data is mapped to the token in a secure tokenization system. Storage of tokens and payment card data must comply with current PCI standards, including the use of strong cryptography.|$|R

In this paper we describe an initiative to deal with big data applications for continuous streams of events. In many emerging applications, the volume of data being streamed is so large that the traditional ‘store-then-process’ paradigm is either not suitable or too inefficient. Moreover, soft-real time requirements might severely limit the engineering solutions. Many scenarios fit this description. In network security for cloud data centres, for instance, very high volumes of IP packets and events from sensors at firewalls, network switches and routers and servers need to be analyzed and should detect attacks in minimal time, in order to limit the effect of the malicious activity over the IT infrastructure. Similarly, in the fraud department of a credit card company, payment requests should be processed online and need to be processed as quickly as possible in order to provide meaningful results in real-time. An ideal system would detect fraud during the authorization process that lasts hundreds of milliseconds and deny the <b>payment</b> <b>authorization,</b> minimizing the damage to the user and the credit card company...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn July 1, 1995, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service fielded the On-line Prevalidation System for processing vendor payment requests. Its {{purpose was to}} prevent new Negative Unliquidated Obligation and Unmatched Disbursements records by comparing disbursement requests to obligations prior to payment. The Objectives of this thesis were to determine the causes of rejected payment requests by analyzing sample data drawn from Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic's Operations and Maintenance appropriation and to recommend {{ways to improve the}} prevalidation process so that obligation validation is more efficient and effective. Research included an investigation into the background of the prevalidation system and an analysis of UMDs and NULOs before and after the implementation of the OPV System. Seven causes of rejected payment requests were identified, along with the penalty interest charged as a result of document numbers remaining on the Rejected <b>Payment</b> <b>Authorization</b> Request Report. It was observed that the formation of new UMDs and NULOs has decreased as a result of OPV's implementation. While the disbursements that are prevalidated generally do not result in problem disbursements, only a portion of all disbursements is prevalidated. Lowering thresholds at which disbursements must be prevalidated and expanding the types of payments that are subject to prevalidation will improve the credibility of DoD financial management and further decrease problem disbursement levels.

About 4, 500 households are approached, randomly divided in three experimental treatments, distinguished by the possibility for respondents to pay with cash, by debit card, or both. The study answers three related questions. First, does the acceptance of the debit instrument increase the number of households that participate in the fund-raise? Second, does, conditional on participation, the average amount given change? Third, does the availability of the debit terminals increase payment efficiency {{in terms of the number}} of coins and notes involved in the transaction? I find that adding the option to pay electronically does not increase participation nor the amount raised. Compared with the treatments where cash is accepted, participation rates and gross proceeds are significantly lower in the debit-only treatment, although debit card use increases in the latter treatment relative to the combined treatment where almost none of the respondents uses the terminal. Young people are somewhat more likely to switch to electronic donations. Conditional on contributing, average donations of households that use their debit card are about twice as high as those of donors that pay cash. With regard to payment efficiency, I surprisingly find that the mere presence of the debit terminal induces small cash donors to donate more efficiently...|$|E
