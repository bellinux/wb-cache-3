Bacterial colony arrays with a density of 100 colonies/cm 2 were obtained by directly ejecting Escherichia coli (E. coli) onto agar-coated sub-strates at a rapid arraying speed of 880 spots per second. Adjusting the concentration of bacterial suspensions allowed single colonies of viable bacteria to be obtained. In addition, complex patterns of viable bacteria as well as bacteria density gradients were constructed using desktop <b>printers</b> <b>controlled</b> by a simple software program. B 200...|$|R

Most commonly, a metal blade controls the amount of ink transferred from the ink trough to the fountain roller. By adjusting the screws, the operator alters {{the gap between the}} blade and the fountain roller, increasing or decreasing the amount of ink applied to the roller in certain areas. This consequently modifies the density of the colour in the respective area of the image. On older machines one adjusts the screws manually, but on modern machines the screw keys are operated electronically by the <b>printer</b> <b>controlling</b> the machine, enabling a much more precise result.|$|R
