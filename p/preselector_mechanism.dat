5000|$|The SWC design {{featured}} many technological innovations. The 86-horsepower straight-six Continental {{engine and}} its transaxle was mounted on rubber bushings, {{as was the}} rear suspension. The unique powertrain and front-drive, three-speed transaxle mounted {{in front of the}} engine, could rotate independently of the body. Constant velocity universal joint transmitted the power to the front wheels. Cooling for the engine came from a complicated latent heat exchange, eliminating a cooling fan. The novel suspension had limited suspension travel with low-pressure tires taking up road shocks. The SWC used drum brakes that were cooled through openings in the drums and wheelcovers. Although a conventional shift lever was first used, a Bendix [...] "Finger-Tip Control" [...] electrical <b>preselector</b> <b>mechanism</b> similar to that used by Cord and Hudson automobiles, was substituted. Included in the full instrumentation, a clock was mounted {{in the center of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
