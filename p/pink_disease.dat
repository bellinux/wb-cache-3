Results Herein we characterize a novel splice variant of PINK 1 (svPINK 1) that is homologous to the C-terminus regulatory domain of the protein kinase. Naturally occurring non-coding antisense provides sophisticated mechanisms for diversifying genomes and we describe a human specific non-coding antisense expressed at the PINK 1 locus (naPINK 1). We further demonstrate that PINK 1 varies in vivo when human skeletal muscle mitochondrial content is enhanced, supporting the idea that PINK 1 has a physiological role in mitochondrion. The observation of concordant regulation of svPINK 1 and naPINK 1 during in vivo mitochondrial biogenesis was confirmed using RNAi, where selective targeting of naPINK 1 results in loss of the PINK 1 splice variant in neuronal cell lines. Conclusion Our data presents the first direct observation that a mammalian non-coding antisense molecule can positively influence the abundance of a cis -transcribed mRNA under physiological abundance conditions. While our analysis implies a possible human specific and dsRNA-mediated mechanism for stabilizing the expression of svPINK 1, it also points to a broader genomic strategy for regulating a human disease locus and increases the complexity through which alterations in the regulation of the PINK 1 locus could occur. </p...|$|R

Eleven onion lines were planted in eastern and western Oregon to determine whether the relative resistance to pink root among them would vary during the growing season and with different climatic conditions. Varietal resistance remained generally stable among the different lines. Ten onion lines were grown in mucky peat and silty clay loam soils in the greenhouse to determine the influence of soil moisture and soil type on severity of pink root. Onions grown in soil held at field capacity had less pink root than those in dryer soils. Pink root ratings were similar among onions grown in both soils. Lanstan, Vorlex, Telone, Pictel, Morton Soil Drench, SD 345, chloropicrin, Mumfume, Phaltan, E. P. 230, and E. P. 201 were tested in the field for their effect on pink root. In some fields Vorlex, chloropicrin, Mumfume, E. P. 230, and E. P. 201 increased onion yields from 30 to 75 percent. None of these fumigants noticeably reduced pink root, however. Telone controlled stubby root nematode infection but did not reduce pink root. On malt extract-yeast extract agar P. terrestris grew fastest at a temperature of 30 C, with the greatest increase in growth rate between 15 and 20 C. There was no growth at 5 C. Continuous light, alternating darkness and light, and brief exposures to germicidal ultraviolet light (2, 500 A[superscript °]) did not noticeably affect the growth rate of the fungus.

However, it remains unclear whether Parkin phosphorylation is involved in mitochondrial maintenance and activity of dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Here, we {{examined the effects of}} Parkin phosphorylation in Drosophila, in which the phosphorylation residue is conserved at Ser 94. Morphological changes of mitochondria caused by the ectopic expression of wild-type Parkin in muscle tissue and brain dopaminergic neurons disappeared in the absence of PINK 1. In contrast, phosphomimetic Parkin accelerated mitochondrial fragmentation or aggregation and the degradation of mitochondrial proteins regardless of PINK 1 activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Parkin boosts its ubiquitin-ligase activity. A non-phosphorylated form of Parkin fully rescued the muscular mitochondrial degeneration due to the loss of PINK 1 activity, whereas the introduction of the non-phosphorylated Parkin mutant in Parkin-null flies led to the emergence of abnormally fused mitochondria in the muscle tissue. Manipulating the Parkin phosphorylation status affected spontaneous dopamine release in the nerve terminals of dopaminergic neurons, the survivability of dopaminergic neurons and flight activity.

Interestingly, knockdown of Mfn or opa 1 or overexpression of drp 1, rescues the phenotypes of muscle degeneration, cell death, and mitochondrial abnormalities in pink 1 or parkin mutants. In the male germline, we also observe genetic interactions between pink 1 and the testes-specific mfn homologue fuzzy onion, and between pink 1 and drp 1. Our {{data suggest that the}} pink 1 /parkin pathway promotes mitochondrial fission and/or inhibits fusion by negatively regulating mfn and opa 1 function, and/or positively regulating drp 1. However, pink 1 and parkin mutant flies show distinct mitochondrial phenotypes from drp 1 mutant flies, and flies carrying a heterozygous mutation in drp 1 enhance the pink 1 -null phenotype, resulting in lethality. These results suggest that pink 1 and parkin are likely not core components of the drp 1 -mediated mitochondrial fission machinery. Modification of fusion and fission may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease...|$|R

The cultivars were 5 hybrids, 6 American, 4 Indian, and 5 local ones. They differed {{in the number}} of days to maturity. The Indian and local cultivars were of early (160 days) maturity. The cultivars varied significantly in their yields. The highest yielding cultivars included three hybrids (Savannah Sweet F 1, Hybrid Granex, and White Granex F 1), two American cultivars (Yellow Texas Grano and Texas Grano 502) and an Indian cultivar (Red Bombay Ringo), with yields ranging between 24 and 34 tons per hectare. All of them were characterized by large and heavy bulbs. The other Indian and local cultivars came next in their yields (12 - 22 t/ha) and were characterized by medium size and intermediate bulb weights. Within the local cultivars, Falatia was the best yielder (20 t/ha) followed by Kamleen (15. 1 t/ha) with no significant difference between them. A significant negative correlation was obtained between average bulb size and weight and between dry matter content and total soluble solids (TSS) of bulbs. The cultivars differed significantly in the percentages of bolters, doubles, defectives, and infected bulbs with <b>pink</b> root rot <b>disease.</b> The simple index numbers system was used to compare the cultivars for yield and quality parameters. Based on the total index scores, the Indian and local cultivars had the best yield and quality performance. The top six cultivars were Red Bombay Ringo (996 total index scores), Nasik Red (972), Kamleen (920), NU- 53 (894), Saggai Red (887), and Nasi (885). Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
