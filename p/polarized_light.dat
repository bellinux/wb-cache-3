40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for calculating the diffraction efficiency kinetics of the grating recorded by two parallel circular polarized recording beams was proposed, based on Jones-matrix and photochromic two-state theory. The diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating {{was measured by}} system of four-wave coupled light path. The theoreical analysis and the experimental results show that, in the condition of adding linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet <b>light,</b> when linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction <b>light</b> parallel with linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet <b>light,</b> the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is maximum; when linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction <b>light</b> perpendicular to linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet <b>light,</b> the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is minimum. The angle between linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction <b>light</b> and linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet <b>light</b> produces a cosine modulation on the kinetics of the diffraction efficiency. It indicates that parallel circular polarization recorded grating in bacteriorhodopsin induced by <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light</b> became <b>polarizing</b> grating. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light.</b> These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
40|$|The {{human eye}} is {{insensitive}} to the angular direction of the light e-vector, but several animal species {{have the ability to}} discriminate differently <b>polarized</b> <b>lights.</b> How the polarization is detected is often unclear, however. Egg-laying Papilio butterflies have been shown to see false colours when presented with differently <b>polarized</b> <b>lights.</b> Here we asked whether this also holds in foraging butterflies. After training individuals to feed on nectar in front of an unpolarized spectral light, we carried out three dual-choice tests, where the discrimination of (i) the spectral content, (ii) the light intensity, and (iii) the e-vector orientation were investigated. In the first test, the butterflies selected the trained spectrum irrespective of its intensity, and in the second test they chose the light with the higher intensity. The result of the e-vector discrimination test was very {{similar to that of the}} second test, suggesting that foraging butterflies discriminate differently <b>polarized</b> <b>lights</b> as differing in brightness rather than as differing in colour. Papilio butterflies are clearly able to use at least two modes of polarization vision depending on the behavioural context...|$|R

40|$|Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is {{the most}} common major and minor salivary gland tumor, {{involving}} mainly the parotid gland. Microscopically, PA presents a large spectrum of histologic features, with epithelial cells arranged in ductal structures, nests and sheets. PA usually is rich in myxoid, hyaline and chondroid tissues. Occasionally, bone and adipose tissue are also observed. 1 Similar to normal cartilage, collagen constitutes up to 40 % of the matrix of chondroid tissue present in PA, and the phenotype of the lacunar cells {{is similar to that of}} mature hypertrophic chondrocytes of true cartilage. In addition, cartilage- derived morphogenic protein 1 also is expressed by the neoplastic myoepithelial cells around the chondroid areas of PA. 2 Due to its collagen content, chondroid tissue shows birefringence under <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> microscopy. 3 Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a useful tool for the diagnosis of salivary gland tumors, particularly PA. 4 In FNAB, the use of <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> microscopy as an auxiliary tool to detect cartilaginous tissue in PA has not been reported.

5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see <b>polarized</b> <b>light.</b> Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in <b>polarized</b> <b>light,</b> and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E

40|$|When a grating is {{recorded}} in a bacteriorhodopsin film by two linear parallel polarized beams together with anauxiliary violet light, the diffraction efficiency has a {{dependence on the}} polarization orientation of the violet light {{as well as its}} intensity. A method for calculating the diffraction efficiency of gratings in bacteriorhodopsin is proposed based on the two-state photochromic model, considering the saturation effect and the polarization status of all the involved lights. It is found that the polarization orientation of the violet light produces an approximate-cosine and an approximate-sine modulation on the steady-state diffraction efficiency separately at low and high intensities, respectively. The parallel <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light</b> can improve the steady-state diffraction efficiency to a larger degree than the perpendicularly <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light</b> when both are at their optimal intensities. The optimal intensity for the parallel <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light</b> is lower than that of the perpendicular polarized one. Thus, the improvement of the steady-state diffraction efficiency is less sensitive to the intensity of perpendicular <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light</b> than to that of parallel <b>polarized</b> violet <b>light.</b> (C) 2008 Optical Society of America...|$|R

5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect <b>polarized</b> <b>light,</b> while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> into linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light.</b> It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light.</b> In the illustration, the left-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> would have been transformed into linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E
25|$|Circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> can be {{converted}} into linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> by passing it through a quarter-wave plate.

25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> also passes that same handedness of <b>polarized</b> <b>light.</b> First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} or retarder is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light,</b> and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> into circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{major problem}} with the {{practical}} use of PDM over fiber-optic transmission systems are the drifts in polarization state that occur continuously over time due to physical changes in the fibre environment. Over a long-distance system, these drifts accumulate progressively without limit, resulting in rapid and erratic rotation of the <b>polarized</b> <b>light's</b> Jones vector over the entire Poincaré sphere. Polarization mode dispersion, polarization-dependent loss. and cross-polarization modulation are other phenomena that can cause problems in PDM systems.|$|R
