40|$|Decision {{support systems}} for {{planning}} today’s high capacity networks, {{like those in}} telecommunications, must include features that model “survivability”. This property assures that traffic is protected from the potential damages associated with some disruption, like a break in a network link. When a network provides “ 100 % survivability”, the property is fairly well defined: all of the traffic is protected against any network failure. However, if a planner is willing to accept some smaller percentage of survivability, e. g., to {{lower the cost of}} the network, then some ambiguities arise. There are a variety of ways that partial survivability can be interpreted, measured, and provided. Currently available decision support systems for network planning are limited in their ability to model these different options. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>some</b> features that could be added as enhancements to a DSS, so that it can better satisfy a planner’s needs regarding survivability. We describe features to model the alternative schemes available to measure partial survivability. These would give the planner the opportunity to articulate more meaningful objectives regarding network survivability. The enhanced DSS could then invoke the appropriate models and algorithms to help the planner identify what sh...|$|R

They have always been treated as bottleneck due to their effects are explicit for human perception. However, as qualities of synthetic speech increase for syllables, words or phrase, {{there is also an}} increasing need to improve the various components of the text processing. One of these desired improvements for Mandarin speech synthesis is the accuracy of character-to-sound(CTS) process. From the viewpoint of application, the purpose of speech synthesis should be aimed at making the synthetic speech understandable by human and minimize the misunderstanding between them. It thus is very important {{to increase}} the accuracy of CTS process. Such process is designed to predict phonetic pronunciations from a coarse surface text input and the difficulty mainly result from ambiguous homograph characters.
