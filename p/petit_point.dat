500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, canvaswork in tent or <b>petit</b> <b>point</b> stitch again became popular. [...] The new fashion, using printed {{patterns}} and coloured tapestry wools imported from Berlin, was called Berlin wool work. Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831. Berlin work was stitched to hand-coloured or charted patterns, leaving {{little room for}} individual expression, and was so popular that [...] "Berlin work" [...] became synonymous with [...] "canvaswork". [...] Its chief characteristic was intricate three-dimensional looks created by careful shading. [...] By mid-century, Berlin work was executed in bright colours {{made possible by the}} new synthetic dyes. [...] Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers, cushions, bags, and slippers as well as for embroidered [...] "copies" [...] of popular paintings. The craze for Berlin work peaked around 1850 and died out in the 1870s, under the influence of a competing aesthetic that would become known as art needlework.|$|E
6000|$|We {{left our}} young {{stranger}} in France situated more comfortably {{than he had}} found himself since entering the territories of the ancient Gauls. The breakfast, as we hinted in {{the conclusion of the}} last chapter, was admirable. There was a pate de Perigord, over which a gastronome would have wished to live and die, like Homer's lotus eaters [see the Odyssey, chap. ix, where Odysseus arrives at the land of the Lotus eaters: [...] "whosoever of them ate the lotus's honeyed fruit resolved to bring tidings back no more and never to leave the place, but with the Lotus eaters there desired to stay, to feed on lotus and forget his going home." [...] Palmer's Translation.], forgetful of kin, native country, and all social obligations whatever. Its vast walls of magnificent crust seemed raised like the bulwarks of some rich metropolitan city, an emblem of the wealth which they are designed to protect. There was a delicate ragout, with just that <b>petit</b> <b>point</b> de l'ail [a little flavor of garlic. The French is ungrammatical.] which Gascons love, and Scottishmen do not hate. There was, besides, a delicate ham, which had once supported a noble wild boar in the neighbouring wood of Mountrichart. There was the most exquisite white bread, made into little round loaves called boules (whence the bakers took their French name of boulangers), of which the crust was so inviting, that, even with water alone, {{it would have been a}} delicacy. But the water was not alone, for there was a flask of leather called bottrine, which contained about a quart of exquisite Vin de Beaulne. So many good things might have created appetite under the ribs of death. What effect, then, must they have produced upon a youngster of scarce twenty, who (for the truth must be told) had eaten little for the two last days, save the scarcely ripe fruit which chance afforded him an opportunity of plucking, and a very moderate portion of barley bread? He threw himself upon the ragout, and the plate was presently vacant--he attacked the mighty pasty, marched deep into the bowels of the land, and seasoning his enormous meal with an occasional cup of wine, returned to the charge again and again, to the astonishment of mine host, and the amusement of Maitre Pierre.|$|E

50|$|Two {{specialties}} of Zuni jewelers are needlepoint and <b>petit</b> <b>point.</b> In making needlepoint, small, slightly oval-shaped stones with pointed ends are set {{in silver}} bezels, close {{to one another and}} side by side to create a pattern. The technique is normally used with turquoise, sometimes with coral and occasionally with other stones in creating necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings. <b>Petit</b> <b>point</b> is made in the same fashion as needlepoint, except that one end of each stone is pointed, and the other end is rounded.|$|E

50|$|Canvas {{work is a}} type of {{embroidery}} {{in which}} yarn is stitched through a canvas or other foundation fabric. Canvas work is a form of counted-thread embroidery. Common types of canvas work include needlepoint, <b>petit</b> <b>point,</b> and bargello.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} detail in {{needlepoint}} {{depends on the}} thread count of the underlying mesh fabric. Needlepoint worked on fine canvas is known as <b>petit</b> <b>point.</b> Due to the inherent stiffness of needlepoint, common uses include eyeglass cases, holiday ornaments, pillows, purses, upholstery, and wall hangings.|$|E

50|$|Windswept is a {{historic}} summer cottage at 421 <b>Petit</b> Manan <b>Point</b> Road in Steuben, Maine. Built sometime between 1928 and 1934, it was from 1941 until 1955 the summer home of Mary Ellen Chase (1887-1973), one of Maine's most important regional writers of the period. It was the inspiration for her bestselling work, Windswept. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.|$|R

The freshwater wetlands on <b>Petit</b> Manan <b>Point</b> are used by thousands of migratory waterfowl during the fall months.|$|R
50|$|Windswept {{was built}} {{sometime}} between 1928 and 1934 by G.

Mary Ellen Chase, a Maine native who was then a professor at Smith College and already a well-known regional writer, rented the cottage in 1940, and purchased it the following year. In 1941 her novel Windswept was published, and was an immediate success. Chase's biographers claim that some of her best writing took place here in the following years.|$|R

50|$|Windswept {{is located}} in {{southern}} Steuben, a coastal community of Down East Maine. It is {{on the west side}} of <b>Petit</b> Manan <b>Point</b> near its southern end, set on 5 acre at Yellow Birch Point. The main house is a single story wood frame structure, consisting of two equal-sized gabled sections set parallel to each other and joined by a cross-gabled hyphen. The structure is oriented facing southwest, about 100 ft from the shore, with views over grasses and low blueberry bushes to the Gulf of Maine and the Schoodic Peninsula. A low picket fence creates a courtyard between the wings east of the hyphen, and a wide deck extends across the western facade. The window shutters have pine tree cutouts, and the building exhibits restrained Colonial Revival symmetry. To the northeast of the house is a small barn with attached shed, both of uncertain date. The complex is sheltered to the east by a small copse of trees, through which its access drive passes.|$|R

500|$|Famitsu {{was less}} {{positive}} about the story, saying that the mix of different elements made it [...] "a bit hard to follow." [...] Parish positively noted connections to the second game, but finding the later story developments either confusing or weak, and disliked the way returning supporting characters had been changed. Petit said that those who wanted a straightforward story would be disappointed, and positively noted its exploration of existence, identity, and memory. Her main criticism was with the dialogue, which she referred to as [...] "stilted". Kolan also faulted the voice acting and localization, especially when compared to games such as [...] Gonzalez cited the story as intriguing, with [...] "plenty of plot twists". Parish and Petit were both highly critical of Aya's portrayal: Parish disliked both her outfit, which seemed to conform too much female stereotypes in video games, and the clothes-tearing mechanic, {{which seemed to be}} included merely to flaunt her sexuality. <b>Petit</b> shared many <b>points</b> of criticism with Parish, also noting that Aya's portrayal of [...] "one-part action hero, one-part submissive sex object" [...] was wrong for a lead character, and that Aya's in-combat vocals were not suited to the game's situations. Reed referred to Aya as [...] " [...] sighing, whimpering lead character".|$|R

40|$|Dr. Catherine Harper reviews Narelle Jubelin's Constance Howard Memorial Lecture at Goldsmiths College, University of London, November 2001. She {{discusses}} Jubelin's {{deliberate and}} seductive {{use of the}} traditions of <b>petit</b> <b>point</b> embroidery in relation to her examination of colonialism, consumption, and identity. Textile means {{have been used by}} a range of female visual practitioners to examine, for example, women's historical and contemporary oppression within the domestic or industrial economy; within specific cultures and geographies; within fashion; within medical practices; as well as to make contemporary pictorial and design representations of non-traditional subject matter. Narelle Jubelin requires in her practice that we consider the construction of exclusive national identities, contemporary manifestations of historical colonialism, the politics of geographical exploration, systems of commerce, imperialism and global trade, and the relational exchanges of art and culture. And she makes these huge abstract issues unavoidable for us by rendering them small, intimate, engaging, and via the apparently innocuous craft of <b>petit</b> <b>point</b> embroidery. She makes us take heed of that which we may not wish to encounter, that which might make us uncomfortable, that which might implicate us in systems of desire and economy less savory than we might hope...|$|E

40|$|Narelle Jubelin's {{international}} practice {{relies heavily}} on the genteel craft of <b>petit</b> <b>point</b> rendered in tiny scale in finest thread on finest fabric. She knows that the time invested {{in the creation of}} such delicate and exquisite works demands reciprocal time from a viewer. She knows the emotive value of the painstaking labour apparent in her stitched pictures. She knows that, having seduced her viewer with the delicate materiality of her work, she can deliver more robust fare. Note then that her miniscule stitches are not always conventionally ordered in the same direction, but rather move in one direction and then against that grain, though always against the rectilinear order of the base fabric. Use this a clue that, in Jubelin’s work, textile convention (the ordered warp and weft of fabric) is matched against textile ‘un-convention’ or even self-conscious ‘poor craft’. Note that a frame may be overwhelmingly heavy or oppressive or dark. Consider the implications of this for the focus of ‘the work’ or the relation of the textile to the mechanism which constrains it. Note that the subject-matter is, for example, the Centennial Tree where Australia was proclaimed part of the British Empire, but see that the mood is studious rather than celebratory. Note that the staging of her works, always in groups, operational like linguistic signs (dots, brackets, phrases), ‘speaks’ a complex narrative of difference and misfit. Check one’s sense then of unease and discomfort and question why something as seemingly innocuous as an embroidery can be so affective...|$|E
