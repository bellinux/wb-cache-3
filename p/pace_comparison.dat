40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the long-term functional and hemodynamic effects of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) <b>pacing</b> by <b>comparison</b> with right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing. BackgroundAcute {{studies have suggested}} that RVOT pacing could significantly improve cardiac performance in <b>comparison</b> with RVA <b>pacing</b> but no data are available in chronically implanted patients. MethodsSixteen patients with chronic atrial tachyarrhythmia and complete AV block were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was ≥ 40 % in ten and < 40 % in six. Patients were implanted with a standard DDDR pacemaker connected to two ventricular leads. A screw-in lead was placed at the RVOT and connected to the atrial port. A second lead was positioned at the RVA and connected to the ventricular port. Right ventricular outflow tract and RVA pacing was achieved by programming either the AAIR or the VVIR mode respectively. Four months later patients were randomized so as to undergo either RVOT or RVA pacing for three months according to a blind crossover protocol. Apart from the pacing mode, programming remained unchanged throughout the study. At the end of each period, NYHA class, LVEF, exercise time and maximal oxygen uptake were assessed. ResultsNo significant difference was observed between the two modes for all the parameters analyzed. These identical results were observed in all patients globally, in patients with LVEF ≥ 40 % as in those with LVEF < 40 %. ConclusionsWithin the limits of this study, no symptomatic improvement or hemodynamic benefit was noted after three months of RVOT <b>pacing,</b> by <b>comparison</b> with RVA <b>pacing...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest {{in the concept of}} wellbeing in the academic literature. Likewise, Government strategies are increasingly being aligned with the promotion of positive mental health, as opposed to merely the treatment of illness. Experiencing wellbeing in later life has, however, been labelled by some as a ‘paradox’, as the conditions of older age are assumed to be negative and thus at odds with those which sustain wellbeing. On the whole, the notion of wellbeing as applied to older adults has been defined by ‘experts’, and the small number of studies that have examined this from the perspective of older adults have often reduced this to the life domains which support or undermine quality of life. Therefore, in order to gain a richer understanding of this topic, the aim {{of this study was to}} further explore older adults’ perceptions and experience of wellbeing. In this qualitative study, a combination of narrative inquiry and photographic methods were used to elicit wellbeing stories from older adults. Thirteen participants aged 56 – 82 years took photographs of the factors they associated with their wellbeing, which they discussed in narrative interviews. Analysis of these data revealed that there were six ‘narrative types’ present in the stories told by participants; namely Continuity, Proactivity, Opportunity, Recovery, Acceptance and Disruption. These findings were considered in relation to the narrative elements of tone, plot, agency, temporality and <b>pace.</b> <b>Comparisons</b> were made between the six ‘narrative types’ and the ‘narrative of decline’ which is assumed to shape the stories told by older adults. It emerged that, on the whole, the narratives which were present in my study were positive in tone, had plots of stability or progression, displayed high levels of agency in the storytellers, were placed in the present and within a coherent life story, and revealed a busy pace of life. The ‘narrative of decline’ was found to have little influence over the stories which were told. In addition, it seemed that there may be a new ‘wellbeing’ narrative which is more pertinent to those in younger-old age. Thus my findings suggest that wellbeing can be experienced in later life and that the ‘narrative of decline’ should no longer be automatically cited as the one which shapes the stories older adults can tell about their lives...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: The IPR collected prospectively main epidemiological, clinical, and electrocardiographic data of patients treated by pacemaker (PM) in Italy {{on the basis of}} European PM Card. The number of reported PMs in Italy was 30, 820 in 2003, 32, 047 in 2004, 31, 870 in 2005, 31, 813 in 2006, and 31, 146 in 2007, respectively. The median age was 79 years in all 5 years. Among the atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction defects, third-degree AV block was the most common occurrence. Of the sick sinus syndrome (SSS), sinus node dysfunction involved the majority of cases followed by bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. Year-over-year percentages among the different indications remained stable. Syncope and dizzy spells were by far the most common symptoms. Dual-chamber pacing showed an increasing utilization in all the examined years. CONCLUSION: Italian PM Registry data for the study period reveal a stable pattern of PM utilization and indications.

40|$|The {{ease with}} which humans are able to perform {{symmetric}} movements of both hands has traditionally been attributed to the preference of the motor system to activate homologous muscles. Recently, we have shown in right-handers, however, that bimanual index finger adduction and abduction movements in incongruous hand orientations (one palm down/other up) preferentially engaged parietal perception-associated brain areas. Here, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to investigate the influence of hand orientation in left-handers on cerebral activation during bimanual index finger movements. Performance in incongruous orientation of either hand yielded activations involving right and left motor cortex, supplementary motor area in right superior frontal gyrus (SMA and pre-SMA), bilateral premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, bilateral somatosensory cortex and anterior parietal cortex along the intraparietal sulcus.

50|$|In galactosemic cataracts, osmotic {{swelling}} of the lens epithelial cells (LEC) occurs. Osmosis is the movement of water from areas of low particle concentration to areas of high particle concentration, to establish equilibrium. Researchers concluded that this osmotic swelling must {{be the result of}} an accumulation of abnormal metabolites or electrolytes in the lens. Ruth Van Heyningen was the first to discover that the lens's retention of dulcitol, synonymous for galactitol, induces this osmotic swelling in the galactosemic cataract. However, galactose concentration must be fairly high before the enzyme, aldose reductase, will convert significant amounts of the sugar to its galactitol form. As it turns out, the lens is a favorable site for galactose accumulation. The lens phosphorylates galactose at a relatively slow <b>pace</b> in <b>comparison</b> to other tissues. This factor, in combination with the low activity of galactose-metabolizing enzymes in galactosemic patients, allows for the accumulation of galactose in the lens. Aldose reductase is able to dip into this galactose reservoir and synthesize significant amounts of galactitol. As is mentioned above, galactitol is not a suitable substrate for the enzyme, polyol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes {{the next step in the}} carbohydrate metabolic cycle. Thus, the sugar alcohol idly begins to accumulate in the lens.|$|R

30|$|We {{conclude}} that the wide adoption of PACS has {{paved the way for}} teleradiology in Europe. The ease of transmitting radiology images has led to the adoption of teleradiology as a viable and sustainable form of telemedicine in several European countries. Despite these developments, which mainly occur in countries with a high concentration of networked PACS, the growth in usage of teleradiology outsourcing in Europe in general is at a much slower <b>pace</b> in <b>comparison</b> to the United States. Currently the legal complexity regarding delivery of cross-border services on a European level is an important factor contributing to this delay; more clarity is expected in the near future. Several issues related to processing of health data, language (semantic interoperability), reimbursement and standardisation of training remain to be solved. For a European collaborative teleradiology model to succeed, the most crucial challenges are: implementation of a solid quality assurance system, seamless integration with electronic patient records, solutions to assure the quality and increase the value of radiology reports and solutions to improve communication with (locally) referring clinicians. It needs to be emphasised that acceptance and approval of teleradiology is not only required from the radiology community but also from referring physicians and their patients who are ultimately the consumers of the radiology community’s productivity [36]. The most crucial question that needs to be asked is: “What will the patient think about this?”.|$|R

However, {{increasing number of}} patients suffered new congestive heart failure (CHF) and aggravated CHF after pacing therapy. We used blood B type nutriuretic peptide (BNP) to predict the occurrence of CHF in patients with different types of pacemakers. To assess single N-terminal brain nutriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) as a predictor tool for ventricular dysfunction in different cardiac pacing mode. Methods: Out of 480 consecutive patients with pacemaker more than 6 months, 79 patients with average age of 65 ± 13, and more than 90 % ventricular pacing participated in the present study. Those with CHF prior to pacemaker insertion were excluded. The patients underwent medical history and examination, echocardiography (M-mode, Doppler, and Tissue imaging) and blood sampling for pro-BNP. Twenty five, 12, and 42 patients had Dual chamber (DDDR), single chamber pacing with dual chamber sensing (VDDR), and Single chamber (VVIR) pacemakers respectivelyResults: Single pro-BNP level in patient with DDDR and VDDR pacing was lower than in those with VVIR pacing (P< 0. 0001) but in Echocardiography left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was not lower in DDDR than VDDR and VVIR pacing patients (P= 0. 190).

In pacing-induced CHF rabbits, blood flow in the carotid artery was reduced by 36. 4 ± 5. 2 % after 3 weeks of <b>pacing.</b> For <b>comparison,</b> a similar level of blood flow reduction was induced by carotid artery occlusion (CAO) over a similar 3 week time course without pacing.

In CAO CB compared to sham, neural nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS) expression and NO levels were suppressed, and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT 1 -R) protein expression and Ang II concentration were elevated; these changes were similar to those seen in the CB from CHF rabbits.

40|$|In {{lightweight}} structural systems {{there is}} increasing evidence {{that the presence of}} humans influences the dynamics characteristics of the system. In the past, most effort on determining the footfall-induced vertical force to the walking surface has been conducted using rigid or non-flexible surfaces such as treadmills. However, should the walking surface be vibrating, the characteristics of human walking could change to maximize comfort. This interaction between the structure and human may account for the discrepancy between the levels of vibration predicted by theory and those observed in practice. Indeed, many design rules can be seen to be conservative, perhaps partly because knowledge of this human-structure interaction is limited. This work aims to address this problem by quantifying the magnitude of human-structure interaction through a comprehensive experimental programme. Novel experimental techniques are used to measure the human-imparted force on the walking surface. Both rigid and flexible (vibrating) surfaces are used, and we measure the imparted vibration response on a lively footbridge (the Warwick Bridge) which acts as the flexible surface. A range of test subjects is considered, walking at a range of <b>pacing</b> frequencies. <b>Comparison</b> is made between a notional vibration response from the footfall force imparted to the rigid surface and the actual vibration response caused by the footfall force imparted to the flexible surface. Key aspects of the experimental regime are also explained. Finally, some comparisons are made using footfall force models from the literature.

40|$|Introduction: Several {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that left ventricular (LV) lead placement at an optimal pacing site is an important determinant of short- and long-term outcome. This study investigated the effect of pacing mode (atrioventricular [AV] or ventricular) and site (LV apical or lateral) outside the ischemic region on the LV hemodynamic, torsional and strain indices in the ischemic myocardium. Methods: Experiments were conducted in anesthetized open-chest pigs (n =  15) 30  min after LAD ligation to investigate the hemodynamic effects of temporary epicardial AV and ventricular LV pacing at the LV apical (outside the ischemic region) or lateral wall. LV hemodynamic data were recorded (ejection fraction, stroke volume, dP/dtmax, systolic pressure, cardiac output and e/e΄ ratio) and torsional (twist, rotation), as well as deformation (radial and circumferential strain), indices of LV function were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging. Results: The LV function was highly dependent on the pacing mode and site. LV dP/dtmax, systolic pressure and twist decreased significantly during LV <b>pacing</b> in <b>comparison</b> to sinus rhythm (p =  0. 004, p< 0. 001, p =  0. 002, respectively). Torsion in sinus rhythm decreased significantly during AV-pacing at the lateral wall (0. 11 ± 0. 04 °/mm vs. 0. 06 ± 0. 02 °/mm, p =  0. 005) but did not change significantly during AV-pacing at the apex (0. 07 ± 0. 05 °/mm). Conclusions: LV pacing at the apical or lateral wall, in the ischemic myocardium, leads to a suboptimal response in comparison to sinus rhythm. LV pacing at the apex outside the ischemic area exhibits a better response than pacing at the lateral wall, possibly because pacing from this site leads to a more physiological propagation of electrical conduction...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to {{accurately}} assess exercise energy expenditure (EEE) in athletic populations that {{may be at risk}} for health disorders because of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. The Actiheart combines heart rate and uniaxial accelerometry to estimate energy expenditure above rest. The authors' purpose was to determine the utility of the Actiheart for predicting EEE in female adolescent runners (N = 39, age 15. 7 +/- 1. 1 yr). EEE was measured by indirect calorimetry and predicted by the Actiheart during three 8 -min stages of treadmill running at individualized velocities corresponding to each runner's training, including recovery, tempo, and 5 -km-race pace. Repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons across the 3 running stages indicated that the Actiheart was sensitive to changes in intensity (p <. 01), but accelerometer output tended to plateau at race <b>pace.</b> Pairwise <b>comparisons</b> of the mean difference between Actiheart- and criterion-measured EEE yielded values of 0. 0436, 0. 0539, and 0. 0753 kcal. kg(- 1) min(- 1) during recovery, tempo, and race pace, respectively (p <. 0001). Bland Altman plots indicated that the Actiheart consistently underestimated EEE except in 1 runner's recovery bout. A linear mixed-model regression analysis with height as a covariate provided an improved EEE prediction model, with the overall standard error of the estimate for the 3 speeds reduced to 0. 0101 kcal. kg(- 1). min(- 1). Using the manufacturer's equation that combines heart rate and uniaxial motion, the Actiheart may have limited use in accurately assessing EEE, and therefore energy availability, in young, female competitive runners. 2. 230 JCR (2010) Q 2, 33 / 70 Nutrition & dietetics, 20 / 80 Sport scienc...|$|R

40|$|While {{verapamil}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a treatment for}} reducing electrophysiological remodeling due to atrial fibrillation and atrial tachyarrhythmias, no previous study has tested its effects in brady-tachy patients implanted with a dual-chamber pacemaker. Fourteen patients with frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation (> or = 2 episodes/month) in the setting of brady-tachy syndrome, implanted with a DDDR pacing system with extensive monitor function (Selection 900, Vitatron) were enrolled. Four months after implantation, they were randomly allocated to a 2 -month period of treatment with verapamil (240 mg/day) or to no treatment, followed by a crossover. The burden of atrial tachyarrhythmias, the total number of hours spent in atrial tachyarrhythmia and the mean number of hours per day spent in atrial tachyarrhythmia were retrieved from diagnostic devices. The accuracy of atrial tachyarrhythmias detection was confirmed independently by two observers. The main results showed that treatment with verapamil was associated with a trend towards an higher percentage of atrial <b>pacing</b> in <b>comparison</b> with control (mean value+/-S. D. = 63. 2 +/- 29. 9 % vs. 57. 3 +/- 30. 6 %, median value 53 % vs. 49 %, P value at Wilcoxon signed rank test= 0. 069), but without any significant reduction in atrial tachyarrhythmia burden (4. 5 +/- 11. 8 vs. 3. 3 +/- 9. 1 %) or total hours spent in atrial tachyarrhythmia (65 +/- 161 vs. 48 +/- 131 h). Palpitation episodes were not significantly reduced by verapamil treatment in comparison with control (10. 3 +/- 7. 8 vs. 6. 1 +/- 6. 5). In conclusion, verapamil does not exert any beneficial effect on documented episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia in patients with brady-tachy syndrome implanted with a DDDR device. Moreover, this drug was ineffective in reducing the number of palpitation episodes reported by the patient...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{potential}} acute benefit of multisite cardiac pacing with optimized atrioventricular synchrony and simultaneous biventricular pacing in patients with drug-refractory congestive heart failure (CHF). Background. Prognosis and quality of life in severe CHF are poor. Various nonpharmacological therapies have been evaluated but are restricted in their effectiveness and applications. In the early 1990 s, dual chamber pacing (DDD) pacing was proposed as primary treatment of refractory CHF but results were controversial. Recently, tests to evaluate the effect of simultaneous pacing of both ventricles have elicited a significant improvement of cardiac performance. Methods. Acute hemodynamic study was conducted in 18 patients with severe CHF (New York Heart Association class III and IV) and major intraventricular conduction block (IVCB) (QRS duration = 170 ± 37 ms). Using a Swan-Ganz catheter, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) were measured in different pacing configurations: atrial pacing (AAI) mode, used as reference, single-site right ventricular DDD pacing and biventricular pacing with the right ventricular lead placed either at the apex or at the outflow tract. Results. The CI was significantly increased by biventricular <b>pacing</b> in <b>comparison</b> with AAI or right ventricular (RV). DDD pacing (2. 7 ± 0. 7 vs. 2 ± 0. 5 and 2. 4 ± 0. 6 l/min/m 2, p < 0. 001). The PCWP also decreased significantly during biventricular pacing, compared with AAI (22 ± 8 vs. 27 ± 9 mm Hg; p < 0. 001). Conclusions. This acute hemodynamic study demonstrated that biventricular DDD pacing may significantly improve cardiac performance in patients with IVCB and with severe heart failure, in comparison with intrinsic conduction and single-site RV DDD pacing...|$|R
