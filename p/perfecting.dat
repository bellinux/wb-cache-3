50|$|Another {{conjecture}} of Berge, proved in 1972 by László Lovász, is {{that the}} complement of every <b>perfect</b> graph is also <b>perfect.</b> This {{became known as the}} <b>perfect</b> graph theorem, or (to distinguish it from the strong <b>perfect</b> graph conjecture/theorem) the weak <b>perfect</b> graph theorem. Because Berge's forbidden graph characterization is self-complementary, the weak <b>perfect</b> graph theorem follows immediately from the strong <b>perfect</b> graph theorem.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{revised version of}} the <b>perfect</b> Bayesian {{equilibrium}} in general multi-period games with observed actions.

In general games that allow a continuum of types and strategies, however, <b>perfect</b> Bayesian equilibria might not satisfy these criteria of rational solution concepts. To solve this problem, we revise {{the definition of the}} <b>perfect</b> Bayesian equilibrium by replacing Bayes' rule with a regular conditional probability. We call this revised solution concept a <b>perfect</b> regular equilibrium. <b>Perfect</b> regular equilibria are always weakly consistent and subgame <b>perfect</b> Nash equilibria in general games.

50|$|It {{is common}} to regard English <b>perfect</b> forms as {{combinations}} of <b>perfect</b> aspect with absolute tense. One {{reason for this is}} that, particularly with the present <b>perfect,</b> the use of such forms does not merely place the action in past time, but also implies relevance to the time under consideration. Thus the present <b>perfect</b> is taken to combine present tense with <b>perfect</b> aspect; the pluperfect (now usually called the past <b>perfect</b> in the case of English) is taken to combine past tense with <b>perfect</b> aspect; and the future <b>perfect</b> is taken to combine future tense with <b>perfect</b> aspect.|$|R
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) {{with the aim of}} <b>perfecting</b> their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E

On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule. Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop.

5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to <b>perfecting</b> the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA graph is <b>perfect</b> if {{for each}} of its induced subgraphs H, the {{chromatic}} number of H {{is equal to the}} maximum number of mutually adjacent vertices in it. A graph is ‘strongly perfect’ if each of its induced subgraphs H contains an independent set which meets all the cliques (maximal complete subgraphs) in it. Every strongly <b>perfect</b> graph is <b>perfect</b> but the converse is generally not valid. For example, the complement of an even cycle of length at least 6 is not strongly <b>perfect</b> though it is <b>perfect.</b> The strongly <b>perfect</b> graphs form an interesting class of <b>perfect</b> graphs, because the complement of a strongly <b>perfect</b> graph is not necessarily strongly <b>perfect,</b> unlike the case with the <b>perfect</b> graphs and their relevance to the famous Berge's strong <b>perfect</b> graph conjecture which has been eluding a solution for more than three decades. Meyniel graphs, line graphs that are free from some graphs, comparability graphs, costrongly <b>perfect</b> graphs {{are some of the most}} important classes of strongly <b>perfect</b> graphs. Here, we summarize the results concerning strongly <b>perfect</b> graphs...|$|R
50|$|The <b>perfect</b> {{aspect is}} {{expressed}} with {{a form of}} the auxiliary have together with the past participle of the verb.

The <b>perfect</b> can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present <b>perfect</b> progressive (continuous) have/has been writing and the past <b>perfect</b> progressive (continuous) had been writing. There is a <b>perfect</b> infinitive (to) have written and a <b>perfect</b> progressive infinitive (to) have been writing, and corresponding present participle/gerund forms having written and having been writing. A <b>perfect</b> subjunctive (have written) is also sometimes used. Future and conditional <b>perfect</b> forms are given below.|$|R

5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of <b>perfecting</b> the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still <b>perfecting</b> their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and <b>perfecting</b> an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E
