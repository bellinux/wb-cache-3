5|$|Berkshire {{appears to}} have <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf's reign. The Welsh are {{recorded}} to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf's successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf's death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their overlord. Charters from Beorthwulf's reign show a strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.|$|E

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} {{there was an}} {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it {{for much of the}} New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E
5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others <b>passed.</b> <b>From</b> the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008 the London Borough of Greenwich gave TfL {{notice that}} it would cease {{operating}} the service from 30 September 2008. On 12 September TfL announced that the outsourcing group Serco would take over {{the operation of the}} service from 1 October 2008; the contract ran initially until 31 March 2010. In December 2012 control of the crossing <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> Serco to Briggs Marine, which was expanding into public passenger services. The company was awarded a £50 million seven-year contract, which began in April 2013.|$|E

5|$|In the aftermath, the Finns <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> Russian {{government}} to the German power sphere {{with a plan to}} establish German-led Finnish monarchy. The outline was aborted by the defeat of Germany in World War I. Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The civil war divided the nation for decades – Finnish society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion, the outcome of World War I and the postwar economic recovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the castle became {{increasingly}} unfashionable {{and fell into}} decline. By the mid-16th century, it was in ruins and unsuitable for royal use. Stone {{was taken from the}} castle to build houses and other buildings in the town. The castle was almost destroyed during the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s. As a result, it became the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from Parliament. In 1930, the castle <b>passed</b> <b>from</b> the Duchy of Cornwall to the government's control. It is maintained as a tourist attraction by English Heritage.|$|E
