40|$|This article investigates how spatial layout, {{the display}} of goods, body {{movement}} and gaze work alongside verbalised linguistic codes in creating a Translanguaging Space, using data from a linguistic ethnography project in a family retail shop in East London. We argue that while positioning itself as a “Polski Sklep” (<b>Polish</b> <b>shop)</b> in London, the shop is a Translanguaging Space – a space created by Translanguaging practices and for Translanguaging practices – and Translanguaging involves the deployment and orchestration of various sense-making repertories beyond linguistic ones. We are particularly interested in showing how physical boundaries are played out and emphasised, together with multimodal resources, to mark the place as a <b>Polish</b> <b>shop</b> in London. We use the notion of communicative zones to analyse the connectivities whereby participants communicate with and involve each other in encounters, and examine how multimodal resources are orchestrated in communicative zones of service encounters, mobilised to interweave communicative zones and assembled {{in tune with the}} depth of involvement. We show a Translanguaging Space in the making in which participants, including the shop owners and the customers, orchestrate a variety of multilingual and multimodal resources without any a priori hierarchy to create a <b>Polish</b> <b>shop</b> in London, a space to experience <b>Polish</b> <b>shopping</b> in the diaspora...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{expansion}} of the EU in 2004, Torquay underwent a significant demographic shift, with large numbers of Eastern European migrant workers settling in the region. Prominent amongst this wave of newcomers are workers from Poland and the Czech Republic, with estimates in 2005 suggesting as many as 5,000 Poles in the region. Some such workers return to their native country after a period of work, while others settle in Britain. Reflecting this shift in population, the local newspaper The Herald Express started publishing a weekly Polish column (Polak dla Polakow), and a <b>Polish</b> <b>shop</b> (Polski Sklep) opened on Lucius Street.|$|R

Made in atmosphere of terror, attacks on members of Polish minority, and demolishing of <b>Polish</b> <b>shops</b> and libraries, the census resulted in many Poles living in Germany giving their nationality as German out of fear of losing life or well-being of their families.|$|R

A number of the houses were converted to flats and {{a new wave of}} more affluent young middle class professionals began to move in, taking advantage of the fact that, despite rapidly appreciating property prices, Harringay was one of the relatively more affordable areas within easy access of central London to buy or rent a home.

30|$|A {{total of}} 34 {{interviews}} were conducted between March and June 2014 : 22 with migrants in Oxfordshire (mostly Oxford city) and 12 interviewees facilitated a follow-up interview with a close contact in Poland. Interviewees were recruited through a range of different channels (incl. <b>Polish</b> <b>shops,</b> <b>Polish</b> job sites, social media, Polish Saturday school, local Catholic churches, workplaces with Polish employees, such as hotels, restaurants, construction sites, a car plant, and word of mouth) to maximize variation (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) and avoid obvious biases, such as a too similar socio-economic background, a similar length of stay, or membership in particular organizations. The age range of the interviewees is 26 – 57 years of age, with a majority clustered in the lower age bracket (25 – 35 years). About half originate in Poland’s big cities (Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, Gdansk etc.); the other half comes mostly from small towns (though many have studied or worked in bigger cities {{before coming to the}} UK). There is an even gender balance among the interviewees and a roughly even distribution of singles and married migrants/migrants with a partner (about a third have children in the UK).|$|R

500|$|This [...] "New Development Strategy", {{based on}} import-led growth, {{depended}} on the present global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices. The effects of the 1973–74 oil crisis produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, {{which resulted in a}} sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly coal. Poland's foreign debt, absent at the time of Gomułka's departure, rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from <b>Polish</b> <b>shops.</b> The new factories built by Gierek's regime also proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market demand and cost effectiveness were often ignored.

40|$|In 2015, {{there were}} 916, 000 Poles {{living in the}} UK, making them {{the largest group of}} non-UK {{nationals}} at 16. 5 percent of the population. Though increasingly research has focused on the consequences of this migration for both migrants themselves and the receiving country, little research has looked at food habits. This paper will explore the role of food in the Polish migrant adjustment journey. A qualitative approach was adopted, involving semi-structured interviews with nine Polish migrants. In this study, Polish migrants described the move to a new culture as a time of stress and loneliness. Due to a lack of money, they were forced to eat local food, which exacerbated their unease, as they found it to be tasteless and unhealthy. As soon as their financial situation improved, they reverted to a Polish diet, relying on ingredients brought from home, from London, or more recently, purchased from local <b>Polish</b> <b>shops.</b> This gave them comfort, and all participants acknowledged the vital role of food in their adjustment to life in a new culture...|$|R
