50|$|The <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> {{may appear}} in learning, when {{students}} experience a dwindling (less steady) benefit from their learning effort. Studies {{of elementary school}} students have found there is a <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> in reading level during the upper elementary years. This effect {{is shown in the}} forgetting curve developed by Hermann Ebbinghaus, who established the hypothesis of the exponential nature of forgetting. Ebbinghaus hypothesized that the use of the ancient mnemonic device, Method of Loci, and spaced repetition can help overcome the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

The book mentions the three stages that lead up to [...] "The Plateau Effect"; {{the theory of the}} threes stages was created by Fitts and Posner. These men base the stages on the theory created by K. Anders Ericcson. The first stage of the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> is the cognitive stage which means “You’re intellectualizing the task and discovering new strategies to accomplish it more proficiently.” The second stage is the associative stage which means “You’re concentrating less, making fewer major errors, and generally becoming more efficient.” The last and final stage is autonomous stage (aka the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect)</b> which means as “When you figure that you’ve gotten as good as you need to get at the task and you’re basically running on autopilot.” Reaching the final stage of the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> starts the mental exercises to keep the mind guessing.|$|E

40|$|In {{cell culture}} systems with aqueous buffers, concentration-re-sponse curves to {{lipophilic}} inhibitors {{are difficult to}} establish be-cause <b>plateau</b> <b>effects</b> (Imax) are often not reached because of limited drug solubility. Consequently, the inhibitory potency of a compound will not be definable using IC 50 values (concentration exerting 50 % of Imax). Since alternative potency measures f 2 val-ues, the concentrations required to double baseline signals have been proposed. Using both methods, we reevaluated the concen-tration-response curves of calcein assays with 78 compounds in three different cell culture systems and found a close correlation between both methods (rs 0. 93 – 0. 99, p < 0. 0028).

40|$|We study {{generalization}} in {{a simple}} framework of feedforward linear networks with n inputs and n outputs, trained from examples by gradient descent on the usual quadratic error function. We derive analytical results {{on the behavior of}} the validation function corresponding to the LMS error function calculated on a set of validation patterns. We show that the behavior of the validation function depends critically on the initial conditions and on the characteristics of the noise. Under certain simple assumptions, if the initial weights are sufficiently small, the validation function has a unique minimum corresponding to an optimal stopping time for training for which simple bounds can be calculated. There exists also situations where the validation function can have more complicated and somewhat unexpected behavior such as multiple local minima (at most n) of variable depth and long but finite <b>plateau</b> <b>effects.</b> Additional results and possible extensions are briefly discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Plateau</b> <b>Effect</b> was popularized in {{application}} to daily life by Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson’s 2013 book The Plateau Effect: Getting From Stuck to Success.

50|$|The <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> is also {{experienced}} in acclimation, {{which is the}} process that allows organisms to adjust to changes in its environment.

Evidence suggests that after a period of dynamic change that varies for each physiologic system, some physiologic variable stabilize at levels that may differ from those at 1 G. Other variables appear to undergo change from time to time even after months in space, and others have not been observed to reach a <b>plateau.</b> <b>Effects</b> on the neurovestibular system begin very early and certain ones diminish rapidly. Effects of weightlessness on fluid and electrolyte physiology appear to reach a peak after that of neurophysiologic effects. It is possible that the initial responses of these two systems follow a more similar time course than is now apparent.

50|$|Neurons adapt {{much quicker}} to {{training}} than muscle. The drastic increase in initial changes in force output {{at the start}} of physical training are due mostly to increases in firing frequency and EMG amplitude of the neuron. After this initial period of increase in force output, firing frequency and maximum EMG amplitude plateau. Only very small subsequent increases in these neural functions are seen after this <b>plateau</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon of neurons adapting to training much quicker than muscle likely explains the frequently observed increase in strength {{at the very beginning of}} training occurring prior to muscle growth. Increases in force output after the plateau of neural functions are due almost entirely to muscle growth.|$|E
5000|$|EMG, or electromyography, {{amplitude}} is {{the measure}} of the electric potential of motor units. Maximum EMG amplitude is more commonly referred to as maximum neuronal output. Studies have shown that maximum EMG amplitude increases with continual resistance training. These increases can range from minuscule to as much as a 50 percent increase after as little as a one-month training period. On average, {{at the end of a}} one-month period of consistent and repetitive resistance training, EMG amplitude reaches a plateau. Further increases in amplitude after this one-month period occur if the training regimen is varied. [...] This <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> is assumed to occur as a result of sufficient neuronal adaptation to the resistance load. Variance in load or repetition causes the neuron to increase its output, and therefore EMG amplitude, to allow for increased muscular force of contraction after this plateau occurs.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} assess the impact of the McGruff advertisements, O'Keefe {{surveyed}} adults in 1979 and in 1981, a year before and a year after the premiere of the first McGruff advertisement. Of the forty personal security measures that McGruff advertisements recommended, only seven were explicitly mentioned in TV advertisements: locking doors, leaving outdoor lights on, putting indoor lights on timers, asking neighbors to watch your house, watching the neighborhood, reporting suspicious activity, and forming community groups to prevent crime. Of those seven, six saw a significant increase in usage by the public after seeing McGruff advertisements. The only activity not to see an increase was locking doors, despite the first McGruff spot specifically advocating this. O'Keefe hypothesizes that this is due to a <b>plateau</b> <b>effect,</b> as 75% of respondents in 1979 already reported locking their doors; the only personal security measure not mentioned in a television advertisement to see a significant increase was getting a dog.|$|E

The result underscored the observation that both precipitation and temperature affect MNDVI based on weather stations or physico-geographical regions. Precipitation is the main climatic factor that affects the vegetation cover in the entire Tibetan Plateau. Both annual mean precipitation and annual mean precipitation of the growing period are related with MNDVI, and the positive correlations are manifested in a linear manner.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{existence}} of the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> at the social level. The authors tried to confirm the preliminary conclusion that people may not be willing to trade off any longevity to improve the health state of a large number of people if the health states are mild enough. They tested this assumption using the person-tradeoff technique. They also used a parametric approach and a nonparametric ap-proach to study the relationship between individual and social values. Results show the existence of the <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> in the context of resource allocation. Furthermore, with the nonparametric approach, a <b>plateau</b> <b>effect</b> in the middle part of the scale was also observed, suggesting that social preference may not be directly predicted from individual utilities.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of disorder on interacting bosons trapped in optical lattices are investigated by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. At small to moderate strengths of potential disorder a unique effect is observed: {{if there is}} a Mott plateau {{at the center of the}} trap in the clean limit, phase coherence increases as a result of disorder. The localization effects due to correlation and disorder compete against each other, resulting in a partial delocalization of the particles in the Mott region, which in turn leads to increased phase coherence.

We give general derivations for both cases, but in the end focus on the effect of correlations on plateaus. Plateaus are long time spans in which the performance of the networks hardly changes.
