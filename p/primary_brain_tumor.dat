5|$|A <b>brain</b> <b>tumor</b> is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).

In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> outnumbered those who had cancerous <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> by approximately 4:1.

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{has been}} {{advocated}} as a promising tool for delineation {{of the extent}} of <b>tumor</b> infiltration by <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> First reports show conflicting results mainly due to difficulties in reproducible determination of DTI-derived parameters. A novel method based on probabilistic voxel classification for a user-independent analysis of DTI-derived parameters is presented and tested in healthy controls and patients with <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> The proposed quantification method proved to be highly reproducible both in healthy controls and patients. Fiber integrity in the corpus callosum (CC) was measured using this quantification method, and the profiles of fractional anisotropy (FA) provided additional information of the possible extent of infiltration of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> when compared to conventional imaging. This yielded additional information on the nature of ambiguous contralateral lesions in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> The results show that DTI-derived parameters can be determined reproducibly and may have a strong impact on evaluation of contralateral extent of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

50|$|The class IA PI 3-kinase p110α is mutated in many cancers. Many {{of these}} {{mutations}} cause the kinase {{to be more}} active.

40|$|Background. <b>Primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of benign and malignant tumors {{arising from the}} brain parenchyma and its surrounding structures. The epidemiology of these tumors is poorly understood. The aim of our study is to systematically review the latest literature on the incidence and prevalence of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> Methods. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to a predetermined protocol and established guidelines. Only studies reporting on data from 1985 onward were included.
