30|$|Based on {{the labor}} force {{participation}} behavior after childbirth, we distinguish two types of countries: the temporary leave countries, where women take family leaves of various lengths after childbirth and then typically return to {{the labor force}}, and the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, where {{the shape of the}} participation profiles suggests that the majority of women who leave the labor force after childbirth never return. 9 The eight <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries include Ireland, the Benelux, and the Mediterranean countries except for France; the remaining 13 countries belong to the temporary leave countries.|$|R

30|$|The {{share of}} women who {{ultimately}} remain out of the labor force, as reflected by Group 4, {{turns out to be}} the most important factor for the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps in the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries. 32 The weaker the ultimate attachment of women to the labor market, the greater the risk of unemployment at all stages of family life. 33 The sizable gender unemployment gaps among young childless individuals in the four Mediterranean countries are likely to be driven by the anticipation effect and statistical discrimination as discussed in Section 4.1. The discouraged worker effect could explain the fact that stages with above-average female unemployment rates are followed by stages of stagnation or further decline in female labor force participation in all <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries and may, indeed, explain at least part of the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Gender differences in unemployment at all stages of family life in the Mediterranean countries are also consistent with taste-based gender discrimination. Which of these effects dominate and which way the causality goes remain questions for future research.|$|R

30|$|The {{profiles}} {{we present}} in the text match individuals either by age group or by a duration from the last childbirth. Cohort profiles are in many respects superior to age-based profiles when we discuss individual behavior, in particular among the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, where female participation has been rising over the studied period and {{could lead to the}} observed <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> pattern across cohorts. Unfortunately, pseudo-panel data at the cohort level cannot be constructed from 5 years of data, where age information is available only in 5 -year age bands. However, the timing of childbirth provides us with the necessary variation in the data that enables us—at least to some extent—to explore the role of cohort effects in our analysis: Fig. 11 presents the labor force participation profiles of women from the same age group (a 5 -year band between 2003 and 2007) over the five stages of family life. Clearly, for some “cohorts,” the first and the last stages of family life cannot be populated, as it is defined by age. It is, however, the evolution across the three stages defined by the age of the last child which is the most important for our argument and which shows that rising female participation among the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries has been shifting the profiles upwards while their shape remained relatively stable.|$|R
30|$|In Kim and Feldman (2000), {{the topic}} is bridge employment, a job between a {{full-time}} position and <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the workforce.

30|$|Algan and Cahuc (2006) {{find that}} in the Mediterranean {{countries}}, {{as well as in}} some countries of continental Europe including Belgium and the Netherlands, almost two thirds of respondents agree with the statement that “A preschool child suffers if the mother works,” suggesting that the traditional perception of motherhood is widespread among the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries. Such perception of motherhood is likely to contribute to the absence of family leave policies supporting mothers’ return to the labor force, {{as well as to the}} observed <b>permanent</b> labor force <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|R
3000|$|... 34 As {{the data}} only {{permit us to}} {{construct}} participation profiles from cross-sectional data, the observed <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> could be also driven by inter-cohort changes, namely, by the increase in female labor force participation. A simple version of a cohort analysis in the Appendix Cohort analysis shows that while the profiles shift upward over time, their shape remains the same across cohorts.|$|R
30|$|The {{classification}} of countries into {{the two groups}} meets the following formal definition: a country is classified as a <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> country if, among all women {{who dropped out of}} the labor force after childbirth, the share of women who return to the labor force by the fourth stage of family life (Group 3) is lower than 50 %. 22 There are three temporary leave countries (France, Germany, and the UK) where—as suggested by the participation profiles—a non-negligible number of women stay out of the labor force until the last stage of family life. However, their share in the total number of women who left the labor force after childbirth is small relative to those who return to the labor force again. There are also several <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, such as Ireland or the Netherlands, where some women return to the labor force in Group 2 or later, yet the majority of women who leave the labor force do not come back.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{as most of}} the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> {{countries}} have experienced a substantial rise in female labor force participation over the last several decades, the comparison of female participation rates at the first and the last stages of family life may reflect inter-cohort changes rather than individual behavior. 23 While we cannot disentangle the two by constructing full cohort-based profiles, the data permit us to conduct a simplified cohort analysis which suggests that the shape of the profiles represent within-cohort behavior and that inter-cohort changes in female labor force participation only shifts the profiles upwards. 24 This is also supported by individual-level evidence based on the previous year status reported in EU LFS data, suggesting that the share of currently inactive women out of those who were inactive due to domestic tasks or family responsibilities a year ago exceeds 90 % in the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries but ranges between 60 and 85 % among the temporary leave countries.|$|R

30|$|We use gender {{unemployment}} gaps {{adjusted for}} {{gender differences in}} pre-market human capital and, {{as suggested by the}} data decompositions, focus separately on individuals with children below 15 and those without. We divide the sample into the temporary leave and <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries and relate the pre-market human capital-adjusted gender unemployment gaps to the two factors, the statutory duration of paid family leave and the perceived gender discrimination, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on female}} labor force {{participation}} behavior across the five stages of family life, we distinguish two types of countries: 13 temporary leave countries, {{where the majority of}} women take family leaves of various lengths after childbirth and then return to the labor force, and 8 <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, where the shape of the participation profiles suggests that the majority of women who leave the labor force after childbirth never return.|$|R

30|$|Turning to the {{underlying}} institutions, {{we find that the}} length of the statutory paid family leave can “explain” almost half of the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps among the temporary leave countries. In contrast, the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, where gender role attitudes rooted in traditional family culture are strong and widespread, have only very short or no paid family leaves. The perceived prevalence of gender discrimination varies substantially in <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries and turns out to be strongly positively correlated with the size of gender unemployment gaps there. While the two unilateral relationships cannot be interpreted as causal, they are consistent with the main conclusions that follow from our data decompositions. We further support our account of the variation in gender unemployment gaps across the EU with a regression of gender unemployment gaps on the duration of paid family leave for 17 countries over the last 25 years, with country and year fixed effects. Based on this country-level analysis, extending the duration of paid family leave by 1 year leads to an increase in gender unemployment gap by 0.865 p.p.|$|R
30|$|We next {{focused on}} labor force {{participation}} profiles across the five stages of family life. We {{found that in}} most of the EU countries, gender labor force participation gaps open up only after women have children. Based on the participation profiles, we distinguish two types of countries: the temporary leave countries, where women take family leaves of various lengths after childbirth and then typically return again to the labor force, and the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, where the shape of the participation profiles suggests that the majority of women who leave the labor force after childbirth never return. 34 The eight <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries include Ireland, the Benelux, and the Mediterranean countries except for France; the remaining 13 countries are the temporary leave countries. Finally, we noted that {{it is only in the}} four Mediterranean countries that substantial gender unemployment gaps in favor of men prevail at all stages of family life, including both the young childless individuals and the final stage of the family life. We interpret this as a signal of the overall disadvantaged position of women in the labor market there.|$|R

30|$|We now {{introduce}} {{two factors}} that {{are closely related to}} the patterns documented above and that turn out to strongly correlate with the cross-country variation in the temporary leave and the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, respectively: the statutory duration of paid family leave and the Eurobarometer measure of perceived prevalence of gender discrimination. 35 We summarize our proposed explanation of cross-country differences in gender unemployment gaps based on these suggestive correlations within a simple regression framework.|$|R

30|$|Two facts arise {{as crucial}} for the {{observed}} cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps: the existence and the duration of career breaks after childbirth (in temporary leave countries) and the overall position of women at the labor market and their attachment to the labor force (in <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries). In line with these findings, {{it turns out that}} the observed behavioral patterns driving the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps can be “explained” to a great degree by a single factor, a different one for the two types of countries: by the statutory duration of paid family leave in the temporary leave countries and by the Eurobarometer measure of perceived prevalence of gender discrimination in the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries. We further demonstrate the importance of paid family leave for the variation in gender unemployment gaps across the EU using country-level panel data over 25 years that allow us to exploit institutional changes in the family leave policies. The regression of gender unemployment gaps on the duration of paid family leave, with country and year fixed effects, implies that increasing the duration of paid family leave by 1 year (54 weeks) increases the gender unemployment gap by 0.865 p.p.|$|R
3000|$|So far, we have {{considered}} only statistical discrimination, when weak labor force attachment {{of women from}} previous cohorts is interpreted by the employers as a signal of future labor force participation of the current cohort of young women. Gender differences in unemployment {{may also be a}} consequence of taste-based discrimination arising from gender stereotypes rooted in traditional family culture, associated by Algan and Cahuc (2007) with Catholicism or Greek Orthodoxy. With the exception of the Netherlands, the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries have the highest share of Catholics (or the Greek Orthodox in Greece) in the population in the EU. Fortin (2005) and AGM find a positive relationship between the prevalence of the belief that “when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women” and gender differences in labor market outcomes. Using a more recent measure of “prejudice,” namely, the share of men that agree with the above statement in the European and World Values Surveys in 1999, we find that the correlation between prejudice and the perceived prevalence of gender discrimination among the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries is 0.52. 44 [...]...|$|R

30|$|In the {{temporary}} leave countries, {{presented in the}} top half of Fig. 7, female participation rates are (with the exception of Finland) the same as those of men at the first stage of family life, before the potential family formation (Group 0). It is only at the second stage (Group 1) that gender labor force participation gaps open up, as women leave the labor force due to childbirth. After the family-related career interruption, women start returning to the labor force again as children get older (Group 2 or 3). At the last stage of family life (Group 4), the female labor force participation rate converges back to the male participation rate and the gender participation gap either disappears or substantially narrows relative to the stages directly following childbirth. In the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, presented in the bottom half of Fig. 7, gender participation gaps, which are in some of the countries present already before the family formation (Group 0), also widen at the second stage as women leave the labor force after childbirth (Group 1), but in contrast to {{the temporary}} leave countries, they persist over the rest of family life. There are 13 temporary leave countries and 8 <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries. The latter include Ireland, the Benelux countries, and the Mediterranean countries except for France.|$|R
25|$|This was {{followed}} by the creation of the first two Han Banners in 1637 (increasing to eight in 1642). Together these military reforms enabled Hong Taiji to resoundingly defeat Ming forces in a series of battles from 1640 to 1642 for the territories of Songshan and Jinzhou. This final victory resulted in the surrender of many of the Ming dynasty's most battle-hardened troops, the death of Yuan Chonghuan {{at the hands of the}} Chongzhen Emperor (who thought Yuan had betrayed him), and the complete and <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the remaining Ming forces north of the Great Wall.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{a series}} of country-level probit models of the {{probability}} to be unemployed as a function of standard individual characteristics, AGM conclude that gender differences in human capital accumulation are the main factor that leads to gender unemployment gaps. While we were able to qualitatively replicate the results from probit models estimated by AGM using our data, we decided to omit their voluminous regression output, as it did not bring substantively more insight on top of what we present and the length of the paper would double. A previous version of this paper also contained an analysis of transitions between labor market states in two subsequent years, similar to the one carried out in AGM. For the sake of comparison, we only mention here the main findings, which support—but are not crucial for—our main results: Similar to AGM, we find that gender differences in the flows between employment and unemployment are responsible for the gender unemployment gaps at all stages of family life in the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries and among individuals with young children among the temporary leave countries. In contrast to AGM, who conclude that transitions {{into and out of the}} labor force do not contribute to gender unemployment gaps, two of the flows between unemployment and inactivity turn out to be important in our data: First, a high share of women moves directly from family leave into unemployment, and second, in some of the <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> countries, women move from unemployment into inactivity substantially more often than men.|$|R
