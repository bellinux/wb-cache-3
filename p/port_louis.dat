5|$|In 1796 British Royal Navy {{dominance}} in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was challenged {{by the arrival of}} a squadron of six French Navy frigates, commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. Among these ships was the new 40-gun frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey, instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on Île de France. Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies, but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at <b>Port</b> <b>Louis.</b> There the squadron began to fracture, with a succession of ships sent back to France or detached on independent missions.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{had little}} {{subsequent}} success, and Preneuse returned to <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> in early December 1799. The {{entrance to the}} port was blockaded by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous under Captain John Osborn (Royal Navy officer)and the 50-gun HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham. These ships had been sent specifically to intercept Preneuse, arriving at <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on 7 December and successfully intercepting the merchant French vessels Benjamin and Bienfait and the Spanish Nuestra Señora del Carmen. Four days later they sighted the approaching frigate and chased it northeast, Adamant pressing so close that Lhermitte could not escape {{and was forced to}} drive the frigate on shore {{at the mouth of the}} Tombeau River within range of a large shore battery.|$|E

5|$|On 31 December, the {{battered}} Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men, {{who had never}} {{had an opportunity to}} seize their freedom, were marched to <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> where they witnessed the arrival of Manche, accompanied by Créole, Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810. For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade during a period of calm weather.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, fought on 11 December 1799 {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau River near <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on the French Indian Ocean island of Île de France, later known as Mauritius. Preneuse had originally been part of a powerful squadron of six frigates sent to the Indian Ocean in 1796 under the command of Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, but the squadron dispersed in 1798 and by the summer of 1799 Preneuse was the only significant French warship remaining in the region. The battle was the culmination of a three-month raiding cruise by the 40-gun French Navy frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Ordered to raid British commerce in the Mozambique Channel, Lhermitte's cruise had been eventful, with an inconclusive encounter with a squadron of small British warships in Algoa Bay on 20 September and an engagement with the 50-gun HMS Jupiter during heavy weather on 9–11 October.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Île de France in December, Lhermitte steered for <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> but {{was intercepted}} by the British {{blockade}} squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship {{of the line}} HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive Preneuse onto a beach {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. Watching from the shore as the last of his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service.|$|E

5|$|The Falklands {{remained}} uninhabited {{until the}} 1764 establishment of <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride. Whether {{or not the}} settlements were aware of each other's existence is debated by historians. In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.|$|E
5|$|Île de France {{had been}} in a state of turmoil since the French Revolution and in 1792 the republican party on the island seized control. In 1794 {{suspected}} royalists were arrested, including the naval commander , their executions forestalled by the arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery. Only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented unrest. The preoccupation of the naval authorities had prevented any offensive operations and the reduced squadron, now commanded by Captain Jean-Marie Renaud, remained in <b>Port</b> <b>Louis.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Preneuse {{had gone}} ashore near <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> Sercey {{had come to}} observe the {{engagement}} and therefore witnessed {{the destruction of the}} last of his squadron of 1796. A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning to his family and settling on Île de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly after arrival in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803.|$|E

5|$|By 1799 British forces {{dominated}} the Indian Ocean, controlling the economically vital trade routes from China, the Dutch East Indies and British India to Europe. The French Navy had originally deployed only two frigates in the region, Prudente and Cybèle, operating from <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on Île de France. This force was subsequently augmented {{in the summer}} of 1796 by a large squadron of frigates under Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, which cruised in the East Indies during 1796 and 1797, suffering setbacks at Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident. During 1798 the squadron dispersed, as his crews became increasingly mutinous and the Colonial Assembly of Île de France grew openly disdainful of his efforts, refusing to provide reinforcements or supplies to his ships.|$|E
5|$|Féretier {{repaired}} his captures at sea {{and returned}} to Île de France, arriving two months later on 22 July. Discovering {{the presence of a}} British frigate squadron under Josias Rowley off <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> Féretier diverted to Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte. Among the goods removed from the ships were the £500,000 worth of silk, which was stored in warehouses near the docks. In the British raid on Saint Paul on 21 September 1809, these warehouses and their contents were burnt and Caroline, Streatham and Europe all captured by the raiding force. Despite these subsequent losses, Féretier was highly commended for his leadership in the action and received a promotion from Governor Charles Decaen. He also received letters from the captains of Streatham and Europe, thanking him for his attention and courtesy to their crews and passengers during their period of captivity.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1800, Clarisse {{captured}} a large rice-laden merchantman, the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming {{a line of}} battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. Clarisse raked the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to <b>Port</b> <b>Louis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} was {{established as a}} French colony under the name <b>Port</b> Saint <b>Louis</b> in 1764, and within a year reached a population of 75 (most of them Acadians), with 3 marriages and 2 births recorded (1 of the births was Francois Benoit. B. 1764, son of Agustin Benoit and Francoise Theriault. Sebastien died in 1839, Bay St. George, Newfoundland) — apparently the first ever in the islands' history. After three years of French possession the {{settlement was}} ceded to Spain, and all the French settlers left {{to be replaced by}} Spaniards. Acting on personal instructions by King Carlos III, the Spanish Government reimbursed the founder of <b>Port</b> St. <b>Louis,</b> Louis Antoine de Bougainville 618,108 French livres.|$|R
6000|$|It was as Charles {{entered the}} <b>port,</b> that <b>Louis,</b> {{lying on a}} bed of ashes, with his hands crossed upon his breast, and the words, [...] "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" [...] entered not the Jerusalem of his earthly schemes, but the Jerusalem of his true aspirations.|$|R
25|$|France {{established}} a colony at <b>Port</b> St. <b>Louis,</b> on East Falkland's Berkeley Sound coast in 1764. The French name Îles Malouines {{was given to}} the islands – malouin being the adjective for the Breton port of Saint-Malo. The Spanish name Islas Malvinas is a translation of the French name of Îles Malouines.|$|R
5|$|On 14 August, one of Rowley's ships, the 18-gun sloop , {{attacked}} a French brig at Rivière Noire District on Île deFrance. Although {{the attack was}} ultimately unsuccessful, Otters captain Nesbit Willoughby and his landing party were able to break {{into and out of}} the harbour without severe difficulties. This prompted Rowley to consider a larger scale operation against a more heavily fortified French position. Two months earlier, in the Action of 31 May 1809, the French frigate Caroline had captured two East Indiamen, Streatham and Europe, in the Bay of Bengal. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Feretier, led his prizes back to the French-held islands, arriving off Île de France on 22 July. Feretier was prevented from attempting to reach <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> by Rowley's blockading squadron and instead put his ships into Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte to unload his captured vessels and replenish his supplies.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> on 18 June, the agents were {{confronted by a}} large body of heavily armed militia opposed to the {{abolition}} of slavery. Although they ordered Magallon to attack the islanders, the general refused and the agents were sent back to sea in a small corvette, eventually returning to Europe. Sercey remained in the East Indies, refitting his ships and joining his squadron to that already at Île de France. This force he divided, sending Preneuse and a corvette to patrol the Mozambique Channel. The remaining six frigates, comprising Vertu, Régénérée, Forte, Seine, Prudente and Cybèle, with the privateer schooner Alerte, Sercey took eastwards on 14 July, towards the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 30 June 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{along the}} Biscay coast of France during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy had been largely driven from the Atlantic Ocean early in the war following heavy losses {{in a series of}} failed operations. This had allowed the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet to institute a close blockade on the French naval ports of the Biscay coast, particularly Brest in Brittany. The blockade strategy included a constantly patrolling inshore squadron composed of frigates, tasked with preventing the passage of French ships into or out of the port. In the spring of 1798, several French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean were sent back to France as the base at Île de France could no longer supply them effectively. One of these ships was the 40-gun frigate Seine, which departed <b>Port</b> <b>Louis</b> laden with 280 soldiers from the garrison.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the {{leadership}} on the islands {{is closely related to}} the {{history of the}} Falkland Islands themselves. The first settlement on the islands was at <b>Port</b> St. <b>Louis</b> and was led by Louis Antoine de Bougainville, the Administrator of the French settlement which started in 1764 and ended three years later. The first leader of a British settlement was John McBride, Captain of HMS Jason, in 1766 at Port Egmont (the settlement being established a year earlier). The French settlement of <b>Port</b> St. <b>Louis</b> was transferred to the Spanish in 1767 and renamed Puerto Soledad, the first Spanish Military Administrator being Felipe Ruíz Puente. The British chose to withdraw from many overseas settlements in 1776 due to the pressure of the American War of Independence. The Spanish settlement ended in 1811 {{as a result of the}} Peninsular war.|$|R
50|$|Pernety {{took part}} in the 1763-64 {{expedition}} under Louis Antoine de Bougainville that established the <b>Port</b> Saint <b>Louis</b> settlement in the Falkland Islands, and published a two-volume account of his nature exploration of the Falklands and the Brazilian island of Santa Catarina. In particular, he gave the first description of the Falklands stone runs phenomenon.|$|R
50|$|In September 1944 Commander Mine Squadron 7 as Commander Task Unit 80.10.3 {{composed}} of Mine Divisions 16 and 21, ten YMSs (Auxiliary Motor Minesweepers), three SCs (Submarine chasers), and twelve LCVPs, operated in the Marseille, France, area {{carrying out the}} tasks of harbor clearance and clearance of <b>Port</b> St. <b>Louis,</b> and canal, and other channels and areas.|$|R
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the battle was inconclusive, both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece. French losses had been heavy, with 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente, the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle. One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean-Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier. By contrast, Centurion had only three men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none at all, but the damage to Osborne's ship was more problematic; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> Centurion {{had to return to}} India, several thousand miles away, to affect repairs. Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade, with Centurion sailing to Bombay and Diomede to Madras.|$|E
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests to make use of the Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at <b>Port</b> <b>Louis,</b> which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
25|$|In 1765, Capt. John Byron, who {{was unaware}} the French had {{established}} <b>Port</b> Saint <b>Louis</b> on East Falkland, explored Saunders Island around West Falkland. After discovering a natural harbour, he named the area Port Egmont and claimed the islands for Britain {{on the grounds}} of prior discovery. The next year Captain John MacBride established a permanent British settlement at Port Egmont.|$|R
