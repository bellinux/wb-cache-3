5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor <b>party</b> <b>stronghold.</b> The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, PdL {{suffered}} a big blow in local elections. Particularly painful was {{the loss of}} Milan, Berlusconi's hometown and <b>party</b> <b>stronghold.</b> In response to this and to conflicts within party ranks, Angelino Alfano, the Justice minister, was chosen as national secretary in charge of reorganising and renewing the party. The appointment of 40-year-old Alfano, a former Christian Democrat and later leader of Forza Italia in Sicily, was unanimously decided by the party executive. On 1 July, the National Council modified the party's constitution and Alfano was elected secretary almost unanimously. In his acceptance speech, Alfano proposed the introduction of primaries.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, the {{government}} abolished the Borough of Hemel Hempstead {{and the town}} was incorporated into Dacorum District Council along with Tring and Berkhamsted. The first chairman of that council was chairman John Johnson (1913–1977). In the 1980s, Dacorum District Council successfully lobbied to be recognised as the successor for the Royal Charter establishing the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and thus regained the Mayor and its Aldermen and became Dacorum Borough Council. The political atmosphere of the town has changed significantly. Once a Labour <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold,</b> the town has seen an increase in Conservative Party voting in recent years, and the current Member of Parliament, Mike Penning, is Conservative.|$|E

25|$|The City of Christchurch {{by-election}} of 1896 was a by-election held on 13 February 1896 {{during the}} 12th New Zealand Parliament {{in the urban}} seat of the City of Christchurch. The by-election was triggered by the appointment of William Pember Reeves as Agent-General to the United Kingdom. The Liberal Government led by Richard Seddon had trouble finding a suitable candidate and delayed Reeves' resignation {{until the day he}} left his home in Christchurch to take up the London post. Nonetheless, rumours of Reeves' pending resignation had been circulating for a month and candidates were lining up. The Liberal Party candidate who was secured resigned within a week of Reeves' eventual resignation, and a new candidate had to be found. Three candidates contested the election: Richard Molesworth Taylor was the official Liberal Party candidate, Tommy Taylor was a prohibitionist also with liberal views but an ardent opponent of Seddon, and Charles Lewis was the reluctant conservative candidate of the opposition. Being a Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold,</b> vote splitting between those candidates who held liberal views secured the election win for Lewis, with the Liberal Party candidate coming last.|$|E
500|$|Following American {{independence}} in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. [...] The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 {{cut off the}} supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. [...] By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown {{to one of the}} largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. [...] Pittsburgh was a Republican <b>party</b> <b>stronghold</b> until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it {{was the center of the}} [...] "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.|$|E
2500|$|Union County is a Republican <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold.</b> [...] Its strong Republican roots {{go back to}} the {{formation}} of the party in the 1800s following the collapse of the Whig Party, which had previously been the preferred party.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, {{the power}} of the {{plantation}} owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers, who were born in Hawaii and were U.S. citizens. They voted against the Hawaii Republican Party, strongly supported by plantation owners. The new majority voted for the Democratic Party of Hawaii, which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years. Eager to gain full representation in Congress and the Electoral College, residents actively campaigned for statehood. [...] In Washington there was talk that Hawaii would be a Republican <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold</b> so it was matched with the admission of Alaska, seen as a Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold.</b> These predictions turned out to be inaccurate; today, Hawaii votes Democratic predominately, and Alaska votes Republican.|$|E
2500|$|In Glasgow, {{the heavy}} demand for munitions and {{warships}} strengthened union power. There emerged a radical movement called [...] "Red Clydeside" [...] led by militant trades unionists. [...] Formerly a Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold,</b> the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working class districts. [...] Women were especially active solidarity on housing issues. However, the [...] "Reds" [...] operated within the Labour Party {{and had little}} influence in Parliament; the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|While {{tensions}} mounted {{between the}} Crown and the Carolinas, some key southern Pastors became {{a target of}} King George: [...] "...this church (Bullock Creek) was noted {{as one of the}} [...] "Four Bees" [...] in King George's bonnet due to its pastor, Rev. Joseph Alexander, preaching open rebellion to the British Crown in June 1780. Bullock Creek Presbyterian Church was a place noted for being a Whig <b>party</b> <b>stronghold.</b> Under a ground swell of such Calvin Protestant leadership, South Carolina moved from a back seat to the front in the war against tyranny. Patriots went on to regain control of Charleston and South Carolina with untrained militiamen by trapping Colonel Banastre [...] "No Quarter" [...] Tarleton's troops along a river.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rural area}} has {{remained}} a Democratic-Farmer-Labor <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold</b> because of its history of a largely unionized workforce in the mining industry, the mainstay of {{the economy of the}} Iron Range. In 2004, John Kerry carried most of the counties in the region by a comfortable margin. This was perhaps aided by George W. Bush referring to the area as the [...] "Iron Ridge" [...] in a campaign speech. [...] Barack Obama outperformed Kerry in 2008, carrying every county in the Iron Range. [...] The area remains the greatest Democratic stronghold in Minnesota along with the urban centers of Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2016, Donald Trump's populist message enabled him to gain ground in the Iron Range, winning multiple counties and reducing the Democratic margins of victory in others.|$|E
2500|$|Judging purely by party {{registration}} {{rather than}} voting patterns, New England today {{is one of}} the most Democratic regions in the U.S. According to Gallup, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont are [...] "solidly Democratic", Maine [...] "leans Democratic", and New Hampshire is a swing state. Though New England is today considered a Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>stronghold,</b> much of the region was staunchly Republican before the mid-twentieth century. This changed in the late 20th century, in large part due to demographic shifts and the Republican Party's adoption of socially conservative platforms as part of their strategic shift towards the South. For example, Vermont voted Republican in every presidential election but one from 1856 through 1988, and has voted Democratic every election since. Maine and Vermont were the only two states in the nation to vote against Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt all four times he ran for president. Republicans in New England are today considered by both liberals and conservatives to be more moderate (socially liberal) compared to Republicans in other parts of the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{commentary}} on the presidential election has sought to pinpoint where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lost to Republican President-elect Donald Trump.
