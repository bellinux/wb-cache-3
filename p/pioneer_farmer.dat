25|$|A <b>pioneer</b> <b>farmer</b> {{had five}} sacks of grain, {{with no way}} of selling them or buying more. He had five {{possible}} uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words {{they were on the}} margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.|$|E
