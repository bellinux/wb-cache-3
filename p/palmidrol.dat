5000|$|In 1975 Czech {{physicians}} {{described the}} result of a clinical trial in joint pain in The Lancet. [...] The analgesic action of 3 grams of aspirin during the day was compared to PEA 1.8 gram/day. Both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the pharmaceutical industry Spofa introduced Impulsin, tablets of 500 mg PEA for the treatment and prophylaxis of flu and respiratory infections in Czechoslovakia, and the company Almirall introduced <b>Palmidrol,</b> as tablets and as a suspension in Spain in 1976 for the same indication.|$|E

We recently reported CB 1 R expression in different cell types of normal canine skin (Campora et al. 2012) and increased levels of PEA and other bioactive lipid mediators in canine atopic dermatitis thus supporting the hypothesis of a protective role of these compounds during this inflammatory process (Abramo et al. 2014).|$|E
