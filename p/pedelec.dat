50|$|To {{really be}} useful, it is {{important}} for a <b>pedelec</b> to be legally classified as a bicycle in each country or jurisdiction rather than classified as a moped or motorcycle. Otherwise, if a <b>pedelec</b> is classified as a moped or motorbike then it may not be allowed in bike lanes or on bike paths; the <b>pedelec</b> may have to be registered; the rider may have to wear a motorcycle helmet; and/or vehicle insurance may have to be paid for.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pedelec</b> (from pedal {{electric}} cycle) is {{a bicycle}} where the rider's pedalling is assisted {{by a small}} electric motor; thus it {{is a type of}} low-powered e-bike. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of electric moped. Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed - usually 25 km/h - is reached. Pedelecs are useful for people who ride in hilly areas or in strong headwinds. While a <b>pedelec</b> can be any type of bicycle, a <b>pedelec</b> city bike is very common. A conventional bicycle can be converted to a <b>pedelec</b> with the addition of the necessary parts, i.e. motor, battery etc.|$|E
50|$|E-bikes with pedal-assist {{only are}} usually called <b>pedelecs</b> {{but can be}} broadly {{classified}} into <b>pedelecs</b> proper and the more powerful S-Pedelecs.|$|R
50|$|Very surprisingly, a large {{fleet of}} {{electric}} bicycles and <b>pedelecs</b> without required power control {{linked to the}} pedaling effort {{can be seen on}} the cycling paths without any proper registration.Additionally, many users found very simple ways how to tweak their <b>pedelecs</b> in order to overcome the pedaling sensor, making their <b>pedelecs</b> without further proper vehicle registration illegal.|$|R
50|$|ADAC, the German (auto)motive {{club has}} tested {{a large number}} of <b>pedelecs</b> in 2013, where about 70% of the <b>pedelecs</b> failed the test with a score lower than {{reasonable}} due to unsatisfactory safety and durability.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>pedelec</b> {{was coined}} by Susanne Brüsch in her 1999 thesis Pedelecs: Vehicles of the Future (Pedelecs: Fahrzeuge der Zukunft).|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} of the motor has {{a significant impact on}} the handling of the <b>pedelec.</b> The following combinations of actuator position and motor have been successful: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} battery (36 V / 7 Ah) (1.9 to 5.1 kg mass in a <b>pedelec)</b> has {{an energy}} content of around 250 Wh (1 kg of gasoline has about 11,500 Wh). The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical {{work is done}} with some loss of energy due to the generation of heat. Typically, incurred losses are around 25 percent, depending on {{the efficiency of the}} motor and the motor controller. Thus, a <b>pedelec</b> with a 70 kg rider (total mass of ~100 kg) can be calculated to go about 5.6 kilometres on a 10% grade at 25 km/h on battery power alone (assuming Frontal area = 0.4 meter-squared, Drag coefficient = 0.7, Altitude = 100m, Wind speed = 10 km/h and Rolling resistance coefficient = 0.007). Depending on the assistance of the rider (which is required on a <b>pedelec),</b> a proportionally greater range is possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{evaluating}} <b>pedelec</b> batteries, it {{is useful}} to consider not only the capacity, but also criteria such as durability, memory effect, charging time, weight, safety and environmental protection.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, many <b>pedelec</b> (and e-bike) users {{report that they}} can ride more defensively with the {{auxiliary}} electric drive assisting them; unlike traditional bicyclists that tend to be averse to braking since this incurs effort to accelerate again, a <b>pedelec</b> rider can brake and then accelerate back to a normal speed with much less effort. The Bavarian accident statistics {{for the first half}} of 2012 lists 6,186 accidents involving bicycles, of which 76 are e-bikes and notes that the accident risk of e-bikes is not higher than for other bicycles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pedelecs</b> {{are much}} like {{conventional}} bicycles in use and function — the electric motor only provides assistance, most notably when the rider would otherwise struggle against a headwind or be going uphill. <b>Pedelecs</b> are therefore especially useful for {{people living in}} hilly areas where riding a bike would prove too strenuous for many to consider taking up cycling as a daily means of transport. They are also useful {{when it would be}} helpful for the riders who more generally need some assistance, e.g. for elderly people.|$|R
