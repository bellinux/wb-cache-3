The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage.

The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E

Here, we report a case of retroperitoneal CEH with xanthogranulama. A 72 -year-old man {{with a history of}} genuine polycythemia was admitted for idiopathic renal subcapsular hematoma 3 years ago. Regular follow-up imaging revealed that the hematoma was gradually expanding in the left retroperitoneal space with the capsules invading <b>psoas</b> <b>muscles.</b> Given the possibility that the mass was a neoplastic intratumoral hemorrhage, we resected the mass. Complete removal of the capsule was impossible due to severe adhesion and its extension in his <b>psoas</b> <b>muscles.</b> Moreover, postoperative bleeding from <b>psoas</b> <b>muscles</b> occurred and emergency exploration to control the bleeding was required. Microscopic findings showed that the hematoma capsule consisted of collagenous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate and foreign-body granuloma with foam cells and giant cells.

40|$|Out of 70 to 80 % of {{the total}} {{population}} of the world who have experienced at least ones in their life time low back pain, 85 % of cases are not suitable for surgery. The causes of the pain vary, including those derived from the spine’s soft tissue myofascial uni, neurological disorders, visceral diseases, vascular diseases or those of psychogenic origin. Among those causes many are of myofascial in origin. For example, <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle,</b> which originates from the axis of the body, or lumbar spine which passes through the anterior pelvis and the femur which is attracting a lot of attention as it is an important muscle for maintaining posture or walking. The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold. Firstly, with the help of an MRI,we examined the characteristics of the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> of lumber pathology on 38 healthy female subjects. Then through an MRI we examined 16 females in the healthy group. We have measured the cross sectional area of <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> of the superior border of the fourth lumbar spine. In addition, we measured transverse and longitudinal diameter. The result showed that the sum of the cross sectional area of <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> was significantly smaller in the lumbar pathology group as compared to the healthy group. Furthermore, there were no significant differences within the subjects of lumbar pathology group. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the left and the right side of the transverse diameter.

To investigate the effect of lumbar muscle pain on muscle activity of the trunk muscles using muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging. Summary of Background Data. Changed muscle recruitment in patients has an important impact on the etiology and recurrence of low back pain. The mechanisms of these changes in muscle activity are still poorly understood. An experimental study investigating the cause-effect relationship of muscle pain on muscle recruitment patterns can help to clarify these mechanisms. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, the muscle activity of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, and <b>psoas</b> <b>muscles</b> was investigated with muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging. Measurements at rest and after trunk extension exercise at 40 % of repetition maximum were performed without and with induced pain. Results. The lumbar multifidus and lumbar erector spinae were significantly active during the trunk extension exercise, whereas the psoas showed no significant activity. The activity of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, and <b>psoas</b> <b>muscles,</b> was reduced bilaterally and multilevel during the exercise with unilateral low back muscle pain. Conclusion. These data demonstrate that unilateral muscle pain can cause hypoactivity of muscles during trunk extension at 40 % of the repetition maximum.

40|$|Objective This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a traditional Chinese medicine formula (TCMF) on muscle fiber characteristics in finishing pigs and the effects of the formula’s extract (distilled water, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extraction) on porcine cell proliferation and isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) gene expression in myocytes. Methods In a completely randomized design, ninety pigs were assigned to three diets with five replications per treatment and six pigs per pen. The diets included the basal diet (control group), TCMF 1 (basal diet+ 2. 5 g/kg TCMF) and TCMF 2 (basal diet+ 5 g/kg TCMF). The <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> was obtained from pigs {{at the end of the}} experiment. Muscle fiber characteristics in the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> were analyzed using myosin ATPase staining. Cell proliferation was measured using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye and cytometry. Isoforms of MyHC gene expression were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results The final body weight and carcass weight of finishing pigs were increased by TCMF 1 (p< 0. 05), while the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> cross-sectional area was increased by TCMF (p< 0. 05). The cross-sectional area and diameter of <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> fiber I, IIA, and IIB were increased by TCMF 2 (p< 0. 05). The cross-sectional area and fiber diameter of <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> fiber IIA and IIB were increased by diet supplementation with TCMF 1 (p< 0. 05). <b>Psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> fiber IIA and IIB fiber density from the pigs fed the TCMF 1 diet and the type IIB fiber density from the pigs fed the TCMF 2 diet were lower compared to pigs fed the control diet (p< 0. 05). Pigs fed TCMF 2 had a higher composition of type I fiber and a lower percentage of type IIB fiber in the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> (p< 0. 05). The expression levels of MyHC I, MyHC IIa, and MyHC IIx mRNA increased and the amount of MyHC IIb mRNA decreased in the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> from TCMF 2, whereas MyHC I and MyHC IIx mRNA increased in the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> from TCMF 1 (p< 0. 05). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator- 1 α and CaN mRNA expression in the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> were up-regulated by TCMF (p< 0. 05). Porcine skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation was promoted by 4 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL TCMF water extraction (p< 0. 05). Both 1 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL of TCMF water extraction increased MyHC IIa, MyHC IIb, and MyHC IIx mRNA expression in porcine myocytes (p< 0. 05), while MyHC I mRNA expression in porcine myocytes was decreased by 5 μg/mL TCMF water extraction (p< 0. 05). Porcine myocyte MyHC I and MyHC IIx mRNA expression were increased, and MyHC IIa and MyHC IIb mRNA expression were down-regulated by 5 μg/mL TCMF ethyl acetate extraction (p< 0. 05). MyHC I and MyHC IIa mRNA expression in porcine myocytes were increased, and the MyHC IIb mRNA expression was decreased by 1 μg/mL TCMF ethyl acetate extraction (p< 0. 05). Four isoforms of MyHC mRNA expression in porcine myocytes were reduced by 5 μg/mL TCMF petroleum ether extraction (p< 0. 05). MyHC IIa mRNA expression in porcine myocytes increased and MyHC IIb mRNA expression decreased by 1 μg/mL in a TCMF petroleum ether extraction (p< 0. 05). Conclusion These results indicated that TCMF amplified the <b>psoas</b> major <b>muscle</b> cross-sectional area through changing muscle fiber characteristics in finishing pigs.
