40|$|Management of {{fire blight}} is {{complicated}} by limitations on use of antibiotics in agriculture, antibiotic resistance development, and limited efficacy of alternative control agents. Even though successful in control, preventive antibiotic sprays also affect non-target bacteria, aiding the selection for resistance which could ultimately {{be transferred to the}} pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Trunk injection is a target-precise pesticide delivery method that utilizes tree xylem to distribute injected compounds. Trunk injection could decrease antibiotic usage in the open environment and increase the effectiveness of compounds in fire blight control. In field experiments, after 1 - 2 apple tree injections of either streptomycin, <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphites</b> (PH) or acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), significant reduction of blossom and shoot blight symptoms was observed compared to water- or non-injected control trees. Overall disease suppression with streptomycin was lower than typically observed following spray applications to flowers. Trunk injection of oxytetracycline resulted in excellent control of shoot blight severity, suggesting that injection is a superior delivery method for this antibiotic. Injection of both ASM and PH resulted in the significant induction of PR- 1, PR- 2 and PR- 8 protein genes in apple leaves indicating induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) under field conditions. The time separating SAR induction and fire blight symptom suppression indicated that various defensive compounds within the SAR response were synthesized and accumulated in the canopy. ASM and PH suppressed fire blight even after cessation of induced gene expression. With the development of injectable formulations and optimization of doses and injection schedules, the injection of protective compounds could serve as an effective option for fire blight control...|$|R

The Austral grass tree, Xanthorrhoea australis, a keystone species in the dry sclerophyll forests of southern Australia, is susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi, but is protected by applications of phosphite. We examined the effect of phosphite application on the infection of X. australi s seedlings and cell suspension cultures by zoospores of P. cinnamomi. Phosphite induced more intense cellular responses to pathogen challenge and suppressed pathogen ingress in both seedlings and cell cultures. In untreated X. australis seedlings, hyphal growth was initially intercellular, became intracellular 24 h after inoculation, and by 48 h had progressed into the vascular tissue. In phosphite-treated seedlings, growth of P. cinnamomi remained intercellular and was limited to the cortex, even at 72 h after inoculation. The cell membrane retracted from the cell wall and phenolic compounds and electron dense substances were deposited around the wall of infected and neighbouring cells. Suspension cells were infected within 6 h of inoculation. Within 24 h of inoculation, untreated cells were fully colonised, had collapsed cytoplasm and died. The protoplast of phosphite-treated suspension cells collapsed within 12 h of inoculation, and phenolic material accumulated in adjacent, uninfected cells. No anatomical response to phosphite treatment was observed before infection of plant tissues, suggesting that the phosphite-associated host defence response is induced following pathogen challenge. Anatomical changes provide evidence that phosphite stimulates the host defence system to respond more effectively to pathogen invasion. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This thesis paves the {{way towards}} the {{microfabrication}} of a solid acid electrolyte based fuel cell (µSAFC), which has a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) consisting of a thin-film of water soluble electrolyte encapsulated between two dense palladium electrode membranes. This project work investigates microfabrication techniques to realize the dense palladium membranes and to understand their suitability as hydrogen diffusive electrodes (HDEs) for the µSAFC. A thin-film transfer technique has been shown as a successful method to make defect free micron and sub-micron thick palladium membranes. 1 µm thick dense palladium membranes supported on perforated silicon gas diffusive supports (GDS) has been fabricated as the fuel cell electrodes. The supporting GDS is a silicon microsieve having straight cylindrical pores, which show low pressure drop as well as good strength. A customized recipe based on deep reactive ion etching has been developed to anisotropically etch the micropores. At 423 K and 1. 5 bar hydrogen pressure on the feed side, the palladium membranes show a hydrogen permeate flux within the range 6. 3 x 10 - 6 to 8. 8 x 10 - 6 mol H/cm 2. s and a good selectivity (> 1500) for hydrogen with respect to helium. The α-β phase change (and embrittlement) happening in palladium {{in the presence of}} hydrogen at lower temperatures (< 473 K) is thoroughly studied in this work. According to our observation, the maximum allowed hydrogen pressure on the anode side for the µSAFC operating at a temperature of 423 K (i. e. 150 °C) is ~ 1. 5 bar. <b>Potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>phosphite</b> - KH(PO 3 H) has been investigated as the electrolyte for the proposed µSAFC. A Ø 10 mm and 1 mm thick compressed disc of KH(PO 3 H) was found to have a ex-situ proton conductivity of 3. 8 x 10 - 3 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at 408 K just above the superprotonic transition temperature. The performance of KH(PO 3 H) was also tested in a conventional (porous carbon electrodes) MEA of Ø 12 mm. For an electrolyte thickness of 0. 5 mm, the measured open circuit voltage was about 0. 65 V. When a current of 0. 5 mA/cm 2 is drawn, the operational voltage drops to 0. 3 V.

40|$|AbstractPotato late blight {{caused by}} the oomycete Phytophthora infestans is a devastating disease of potato worldwide. Most of the potato cultivars grown in {{conventional}} agriculture are susceptible, or at best moderately resistant, and require frequent applications of fungicides to avoid heavy yield losses. In field trials spanning four years, we have investigated the effect of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite,</b> an inorganic salt on potato late blight. <b>Potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> is known to induce defence responses in potato and to also have direct toxic effects on oomycetes, which in turn counteract late blight and tuber blight development. However, {{the use of this}} salt is not yet implemented and approved in European potato cultivation. We compared the effect of phosphite alone with fungicides currently used in Swedish potato cultivation. We also investigated the combined use of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> and reduced doses of fungicides. Table potato cultivars and starch potato cultivars with different levels of resistance were used. We found that <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> in combination with reduced doses of fungicides results in the same level of protection as treatments with the recommended full dose of fungicides. These combined treatments reduce the need of traditional fungicides and may also decrease the selection pressure for fungicide resistance development in the pathogen. In relatively resistant starch potato cultivars using phosphite alone gave sufficient protection against late blight. Furthermore, in starch potato a combination of phosphite and fungicides at two-week intervals provided similar protection to weekly applications of fungicide at the recommended dose. Foliar treatment with phosphite also gave protection against tuber blight at similar levels to that of the best-performing fungicide. Our data suggests that <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> could be used in potato cultivation in temperate regions such as in Sweden, at least in combinations with reduced rates of fungicides.

Phi B and fungicides provided the highest levels of total soluble phenolic compounds at the grape peel, however, had no effect on the levels of anthocyanins. <b>Potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> application increases total soluble solids and pH, reduces total titratable acidity of the berries, does not affect anthocyanin contents, and it is an effective alternative for the control of downy mildew, with response similar to that of fungicides...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the effects of silicon (Si), acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), and <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> (Phi) on the potentiation of rice resistance to infection by Bipolaris oryzae. The treatments included the soil amended with Si (1. 25 g of calcium silicate per kg of soil), spraying of plants with ASM (500 mg∙L– 1), Phi (5 mL∙L– 1), and distilled water (control) 24 h before inoculation with B. oryzae. The treatments Si supply and the spraying of ASM and Phi were effective in reducing the area under brown spot progress curve {{and the number of}} lesions per cm 2 of leaf. Polyphenoloxidases activity was higher for plants supplied with Si. On plants sprayed with ASM, the activities of polyphenoloxidases, phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, chitinases, and β- 1, 3 -glucanases increased. The spraying of plants with Phi did not increase the activities of the studied defense enzymes. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} indicated that brown spot symptoms can be greatly reduced with the use of Si, ASM, and Phi...|$|E
40|$|Phosphite (Phi) {{compounds}} are salts {{derived from}} phosphorous acid. These compounds {{have the ability}} to protect plants against different pathogens. The aim of the present research was to assess the effect of Phi compounds on components of potato tuber periderm and cortex and to assess their effects on pathogen resistance in the postharvest stage. In a series of field experiments, <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> (KPhi) was applied to seed potato tubers and foliage. After harvest, several variables were analyzed in tubers obtained from these plants. An increase in pectin content was observed in both periderm and cortex tissue in tubers originating from KPhi-treated plants. After wounding and infection with Fusarium solani, a higher amount of pectin accumulation in cortical tissues was observed in tubers following treatment with KPhi. The content and/or activity of polygalacturonase and proteinase inhibitor also increased in tubers from KPhi-treated plants. A new isoform of chitinase was detected in the tuber periderm of treated plants. These results suggest that KPhi applied to seed tuber and foliage induces defense responses in tuber periderm and cortex and that these reactions are associated with structural and biochemical changes in these tissues...|$|E
40|$|Quote {{from the}} article "Potassium phosphite, also called «phosphonate», is a salt of phosphonic acid with the formula K 2 HPO 3. It {{should not be}} confounded with phosphates, nor with the organophosphorous {{insecticides}} which are also called «phosphonates». <b>Potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> {{can be used as}} a fungicide against oomycetes in various crops. In the early 1990 ies, it was extensively tested on organically grown grapevines in Switzerland. It was effective against downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola), and blocked the disease up to 3 days after infection. Phosphite was mobile and very persistent in plants and could be detected in grapes harvested one year after the last application. Analyses of 53 wine samples reveiled that the treatment inevitably leads to phosphite residues in wine, usually ranging between 5000 – 10000 ppb phosphite. Phosphite residues were also found in other crops (e. g. potato, celery) treated with potassium phosphonate. From a toxicological point of view, these residues are of no concern. However, consumers of organic wine expect to buy a «natural» product, and we assume that they would not approve the presence of such quantities of fungicide residues in organic wine. Currently, potassium phosphonate is not authorized as a fungicide for organic farming in the EU, and we do not recommend its use in the future”...|$|E
40|$|Ash dieback, {{caused by}} Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Queloz et al. (anamorph Chalara fraxinea Kowalski), {{has emerged as}} a {{critical}} disease in urban areas and in the forests of many European countries. This study was conducted to evaluate six fungicides for their potential to control the disease. In vitro assays with different concentrations of the products against five different strains of the pathogen, illustrated that thiabendazole, propiconazole and allicin exhibited lower median lethal doses, procloraz completely killed half of the samples at higher concentrations, whereas copper sulphate and <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> were totally ineffective. Subsequently, the antifungal activities of the best three compounds were investigated in planta against H. pseudoalbidus by trunk injection. The rate of necroses development following artificial inoculation of 24 F. excelsior was significantly slowed down in the growing season by the treatment with thiabendazole and allicin. In the phenological phase and climatic conditions tested, and with the chosen formulation and injection method, propiconazole injections were impracticable. The results of this study, along with some technical suggestions for application in the field, support the idea of using organic and chemical endotherapic products to combat ash dieback symptoms in Fraxinus spp., with the safe and very low impact method of trunk injection...|$|E
40|$|The {{plant disease}} Moko, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, {{is the most}} {{important}} bacterial disease in banana and plantain crops worldwide. In the present study, chlorine dioxide and seven resistance inducers in banana plants (Musa sp.) infected with this bacterium were evaluated under greenhouse conditions. For the evaluation of chlorine dioxide, three doses were used (10, 30 and 50 mg L- 1). The evaluation of the resistance inducers included the following: sodium salicylate 0. 4 g L- 1; hydrogen peroxide 1 mM; <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> 1. 5 mL L- 1; 3 -aminobutanoic acid 1. 0 g L- 1; methyl jasmonate 0. 2 g L- 1; acibenzolar-s-methyl 0. 3 mL L- 1 and chitosan 3. 0 mg mL- 1. The results showed a significant reduction of 74 % in the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) value, which was calculated for the disease development when the injected chlorine dioxide dose was 50 mg L- 1. The AUDPC value for the resistance inducers was reduced by 45. 4 % for chitosan, 75. 5 % for methyl jasmonate and 65. 5 % for 3 -aminobutanoic acid.

The search for new or improved means to reduce susceptibility to M. nivale is an ongoing target for turfgrass research. From 2010 to 2012, field studies were conducted at the Curragh Golf Club, Co Kildare, Ireland on Agrostis canina L. ssp. canina and Poa annua L. swards, to evaluate M. nivale suppression by 14 -day sequential applications of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> (KH 2 PO 3), applied alone and in combinations with a fungicide (iprodione) and a biostimulant. Treatment effect on turfgrass quality was also determined. Over two years of trials, phosphite treated plots, when compared with untreated controls, exhibited significantly lower percentages (pB 0. 01) of M. nivale incidence. The addition of the biostimulant did not enhance this effect. The iprodione treatments showed significantly higher suppression than the phosphite treatments (pB 0. 01), and the addition of phosphite significantly enhanced the fungicide control of M. nivale (pB 0. 01). This last combined treatment was most effective overall, with full inhibition on the treated plots.

Harpin protein), Phoenix (a. i. <b>Potassium</b> <b>phosphite)</b> and Rigel (a. i. Salicylic acid derivative) applied at four different growth stages of tree development (bud break, green cluster, 90 % petal fall, early fruitlet) against the foliar pathogens Venturia inaequalis and Venturia pirina which cause apple and pear scab respectively. A conventional synthetic fungicide (penconazole) used within the UK for apple and pear scab control was included for comparison. Little efficacy as scab protectants was demonstrated when each SIR product and penconazole was applied at only two growth stages (bud break, green cluster). However when the above compounds were applied at three or more growth stages efficacy as scab protectants was confirmed. The synthetic fungicide penconazole provided greatest protection against apple and pear scab in both the 2006 and 2007 field trials. There was little difference in the magnitude of scab protection conferred by each SIR agent. Results suggest application {{of at least three}} sprays during bud break to early fruitlet formation with an appropriate SIR agent may provide a useful addition to existing methods of apple and pear scab management under field conditions.

Two field tests (‘Coodetec- 219 RR’ and ‘Emgopa- 313 ’) were conducted (12 / 2005 - 4 / 2006) in Cristalina (Goiás, Brazil), in a complete ran- domized block design (Nine treatments; five replications). The treatments were with one and two applications of phosphite-K (1192 g a. i. ha- 1 P 2 O 5 + 596 g a. i. ha- 1 K 2 O) + vegetable oil (VO - 0. 5 % v v- 1), two applications of traditional fungicides (TF) [pyraclostrobin+epoxyconazole (66. 5 + 25 g a. i. ha- 1); methyl- thiophanate+flutriafol (300 + 60 g a. i. ha- 1); tebuconazole (100 g a. i. ha- 1) ], and, one application of TF+phosphite and a second application of phosphite+VO. For ‘Emgopa- 313 ’, product applications were made on V 8 and R 2 soybean growth stage, while for Coodetec- 219 RR on R 1 and R 5. Evaluations of disease severity (%DS) were made each seven days after product applications. After the first product application, all treatments significantly reduced DS. At the end of evaluations only treatments with TF significantly reduced DS. Yield and mass of 1000 seeds were significantly higher for treatments with TF.

Additional treatments showed that phosphite is not P source for common bean nutrition. Phosphite supply in soil increased the P content in shoot (at full physiological maturity stage) and grains, {{but at the same}} time considerably decreased grain yield, regardless of the soil phosphate availability. Foliar sprays of phosphite decreased grain yield in plants grown under low soil phosphate availability, but no effect was observed in plants grown under adequate soil phosphate availability.

40|$|Although {{phosphite}} {{is widely}} used to protect plants from pathogenic oomycetes {{on a wide range}} of horticultural crops, the molecular mechanisms behind phosphite induced resistance are poorly understood. The aim of this work was to assess the effects of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> (KPhi) on potato plant defense responses to infection with Phytophtora infestans (Pi). Pathogen development was severely restricted and there was also an important decrease in lesion size in infected KPhi-treated leaves. We demonstrated that KPhi primed hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion production in potato leaves at 12 h post-inoculation with Pi. Moreover, the KPhi-treated leaves showed an increased and earlier callose deposition as compared with water-treated plants, beginning 48 h after inoculation. In contrast, callose deposition was not detected in water-treated leaves until 72 h after inoculation. In addition, we carried out RNA gel blot analysis of genes implicated in the responses mediated by salicylic (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). To this end, we examined the temporal expression pattern of StNPR 1 and StWRKY 1, two transcription factors related to SA pathway, and StPR 1 and StIPII, marker genes related to SA and JA pathways, respectively. The expression of StNPR 1 and StWRKY 1 was enhanced in response to KPhi treatment. In contrast, StIPII was down regulated in both KPhi- and water-treated leaves, until 48 h after infection with Pi, suggesting that the regulation of this gene could be independent of the KPhi treatment. Our results indicate that KPhi primes the plant for an earlier and more intense response to infection and that SA would mediate this response...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{biocompatible}} {{chemical compounds}} that enhance plant disease resistance through Induced Resistance (IR) is an innovative strategy {{to improve the}} yield and quality of crops. Phosphites (Phi), inorganic salts of phosphorous acid, are environment friendly, and have been described to induce disease control. Phi, similar to other plant inductors, {{are thought to be}} effective against different types of biotic and abiotic stress, and it is assumed that the underlying signaling pathways probably overlap and interact. The signaling pathways triggered by UV-B radiation, for instance, are known to crosstalk with other signaling routes that respond that biotic stress. In the present work, the effect of <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphite</b> (KPhi) pre-treatment on UV-B stress tolerance was evaluated in potato leaves. Plants were treated with KPhi and, after 3 days, exposed to 2 h/day of UV-B (1. 5 Watt m(- 2)) for 0, 3 and 6 days. KPhi pre-treatment had a beneficial effect on two photosynthetic parameters, specifically chlorophyll content and expression of the psbA gene. Oxidative stress caused by UV-B was also prevented by KPhi. A decrease in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in leaves and an increase in guaiacol peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were also observed. In addition, the expression levels of a gene involved in flavonoid synthesis increased in UV-B-stressed plants only when pre-treated with KPhi. Finally, accumulation of glucanases and chitinases was induced by UV-B stress and markedly potentiated by KPhi pre-treatment. Altogether, this is the first report that shows a contribution of KPhi in UV-B stress tolerance in potato plants...|$|E
