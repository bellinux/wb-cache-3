50|$|In botany and horticulture, <b>parthenocarpy</b> (literally meaning virgin fruit) is {{the natural}} or artificially induced {{production}} of fruit without fertilization of ovules. The fruit is therefore seedless. Stenospermocarpy may also produce apparently seedless fruit, but the seeds are actually aborted while still small. <b>Parthenocarpy</b> (or stenospermocarpy) occasionally occurs as a mutation in nature; if it affects every flower the plant can no longer sexually reproduce but {{might be able to}} propagate by apomixis or by vegetative means.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of seedless fruit (<b>parthenocarpy)</b> is common, as is seed abortion (stenospermocarpy). When a seed is present, it is white, ellipsoidal, and nearly fills the fruit.|$|E
50|$|Seedlessness {{is seen as}} a {{desirable}} trait in edible fruit with hard seeds such as banana, pineapple, orange and grapefruit. <b>Parthenocarpy</b> is also desirable in fruit crops that may be difficult to pollinate or fertilize, such as fig, tomato and summer squash. In dioecious species, such as persimmon, <b>parthenocarpy</b> increases fruit production because staminate trees {{do not need to be}} planted to provide pollen. <b>Parthenocarpy</b> is undesirable in nut crops, such as pistachio, where the seed is the edible part. Horticulturists have selected and propagated parthenocarpic cultivars of many plants, including banana, fig, cactus pear (Opuntia), breadfruit and eggplant. Some plants, such as pineapple, produce seedless fruits when a single cultivar is grown because they are self-infertile. Some cucumbers produce seedless fruit if pollinators are excluded. Strange as it seems, seedless watermelon plants are grown from seeds. The seeds are produced by crossing a diploid parent with a tetraploid parent to produce triploid seeds.|$|E

50|$|The Grand Nain is a {{cultivar}} of {{the well}} known Cavendish bananas. This group of bananas is distinguished from other groups by their AAA genotype. The AAA genotype refers {{to the fact that}} this group is a triploid variant of the species M. acuminata. There are 33 chromosome present in the AAA cultivar and all produce seedless fruits through <b>parthenocarpy.</b> This fact means that the plants are spread by conventional vegetative methods and lack sexual reproduction. This inability to genetically diversify makes Grand Naines as well as other AAA cultivars vulnerable to disease and pests.|$|E
5000|$|However, <b>parthenocarpy</b> of some fruits on a plant {{may be of}} value. Up to 20% of {{the fruits}} of wild parsnip are parthenocarpic.

Utah juniper has a similar defense against bird feeding. The ability to produce seedless fruit when pollination is unsuccessful may be an advantage to a plant because it provides food for the plant's seed dispersers.

50|$|A flower, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (<b>parthenocarpy).</b> Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.|$|E
50|$|Musa acuminata {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} plants to be domesticated by humans for agriculture. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia and surrounding areas (possibly New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the Philippines) at around 8000 BC. It has been suggested that M. acuminata may have originally been domesticated for parts other than the fruit. Either for fiber, for construction materials, or for its edible male bud. They were selected early for <b>parthenocarpy</b> and seed sterility in their fruits, a process that might have taken thousands of years. This initially led to the first 'human-edible' banana diploid clones (modern AA cultivars). Diploid clones are still able to produce viable seeds when pollinated by wild species. This resulted in the development of triploid clones which were conserved for their larger fruit.|$|E
50|$|Seedless fruits {{can develop}} {{in one of}} two ways: either the fruit {{develops}} without fertilization (<b>parthenocarpy),</b> or pollination triggers fruit development, but the ovules or embryos abort without producing mature seeds (stenospermocarpy). Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants, whose three sets of chromosomes make it very unlikely for meiosis to produce fertile gametes. This is because one of the three copies of each chromosome can't pair with another appropriate chromosome before separating into daughter cells, so these extra third copies end up randomly distributed between the two daughter cells from meiosis 1, resulting in the (usually) swiftly lethal aneuploidy condition. Such plants can arise by spontaneous mutation or by hybridization between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same or different species. Some species, such as tomato, pineapple, and cucumber, produce seedless fruit if not pollinated, but will produce seeded fruit if pollination occurs.|$|E

In this work we extend the early description of the pat phenotype by investigating the expression of <b>parthenocarpy</b> in three different environments and by using light and scanning electron microscopy to analyse the development of male and female floral organs. The degree of <b>parthenocarpy</b> was high in the three experimental environments and was characterised by an initiation of ovary growth anticipated to pre-anthesis floral stages. Aberrations in anther development were evident at flower bud stages and resulted in shorter, irregular and teratoid organs. Ectopic production of carpel-like structures bearing external ovules was evident in the most severely altered androecia. Analysis of ovule development revealed that a fraction of pat ovules becomes aberrant from very early stages, having defective integument growth.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{engineering}} of <b>parthenocarpy</b> confers to horticultural plants {{the ability}} to produce fruits under environmental conditions that curtail fruit productivity and quality. The DefH 9 -iaaM transgene, whose predicted action is to confer auxin synthesis specifically in the placenta, ovules and derived tissues, {{has been shown to}} confer <b>parthenocarpy</b> to several plant species (tobacco, eggplant, tomato) and varieties. Results UC 82 tomato plants, a typical cultivar used by the processing industry, transgenic for the DefH 9 -iaaM gene produce parthenocarpic fruits that are malformed. UC 82 plants transgenic for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM, a DefH 9 -iaaM derivative gene modified in its 5 'ULR by replacing 53 nucleotides immediately upstream of the AUG initiation codon with an 87 nucleotides-long sequence derived from the rolA intron sequence, produce parthenocarpic fruits of high quality. In an in vitro translation system, the iaaM mRNA, modified in its 5 'ULR is translated 3 – 4 times less efficiently than the original transcript. An optimal expressivity of <b>parthenocarpy</b> correlates with a reduced transgene mRNA steady state level in DefH 9 -RI-iaaM flower buds in comparison to DefH 9 -iaaM flower buds. Consistent with the known function of the iaaM gene, flower buds transgenic for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM gene contain ten times more IAA than control untransformed flower buds, but five times less than DefH 9 -iaaM flower buds. Conclusions By using an auxin biosynthesis transgene downregulated at the post-transcriptional level, an optimal expressivity of <b>parthenocarpy</b> has been achieved in a genetic background not suitable for the original transgene. Thus, the method allows the generation of a wider range of expressivity of the desired trait in transgenic plants. </p...|$|E

An increased level of these hormones in the ovary can be a substitute for pollination and trigger fruit development. We characterized and mapped two sets of two <b>parthenocarpy</b> genes in two distinct tomato introgression lines carrying genome fragments of Solanum habrochaites (a related wild species of tomato). Tomato lines carrying these genes will produce seedless fruits in absence of pollination, and seeded fruits if the ovary is pollinated, thus affecting the uniformity of the production. The use of functional sterility in combination with <b>parthenocarpy</b> can overcome this problem of uniformity of seedless fruits production, but still allows seed production by hand pollination. The best functional sterility gene in tomato {{is likely to be the}} positional sterility- 2 (ps- 2) gene, which confers non-dehiscent anthers, containing viable pollen. We accurately determined the position of the ps- 2 gene on the short arm of Chromosome 4. Subsequently, after the successful construction of a physical map in the ps- 2 locus region, we isolated the ps- 2 gene. The ps- 2 phenotype appeared to be the result of a single nucleotide substitution in a novel tomato polygalacturonase gene, named TDPG (Tomato Dehiscence PolyGalacturonase). This single mutation affects one of the intron splicing recognition site, causing an alternative splicing of the mRNA, thus leading to an aberrant mRNA. The expression of this gene is specific to the dehiscent anthers and to a lesser degree to the mature fruit. The repression of TDPG homologs may be a potential way to introduce functional sterility in other species. ...|$|E
