40|$|Abstract Ecballium elaterium is a {{perennial}} herb with multiple medicinal properties. It was {{widely used in}} folk medicine as cathartic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. The present study was devoted to investigate the effect of diethyl ether, acetone, and methanol solvent on the extraction, phytochemicals profiles, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Ecballium elaterium seeds and <b>peels</b> <b>fruits.</b> The total phenolic, flavonoid, flavonol, condensed tannins and carotenoids contents were estimated. Maximum phenolic (107 ± 4 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (18 ± 0 mg QE/g) contents were {{also found in the}} methanol <b>peels</b> <b>fruits</b> extract. Results showed that methanol <b>peels</b> <b>fruits</b> extract have the highest antioxidant activity with IC 50 values of 1. 2 ± 0. 1 and 1 ± 0 mg/mL for DPPH and ABTS, respectively, and EC 50 value of 1040 ± 5 mg/mL for reducing power assays. Acetone and diethyl ether <b>peels</b> <b>fruits</b> extracts showed the best antibacterial agents especially against Micrococcus luteus, however no antifungal activity was observed. Spectral data of FT-IR analysis of Ecballium elaterium seeds and <b>peels</b> <b>fruits</b> extracts revealed the presence of functional groups such as ─OH, C─H, C─O and C=O. Due to their high antioxidant and antibacterial activities, E. elaterium seeds and <b>peels</b> <b>fruits</b> extracts have promising potential as future natural antioxidant and antibacterial agents in food industry...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine whether}} hand {{contamination}} with fruit {{results in a}} false blood glucose (BG) reading using capillary fingertip blood sample. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The study subjects were healthy volunteers with normal glucose tolerance test. Capillary BG samples were collected from the fingertip after peeling orange, grape, or kiwi fruit, followed by no action, washing hands with tap water, or rubbing the fingertip with an alcohol swab, then analyzed with glucose monitors. RESULTS—The BG levels measured after peeling any of the fruits, followed by washing hands, were similar to the control subjects (no fruit handling), but the levels after fruit peeling, followed by nowashing, were abnormally and significantly high, evenwhen the fingertip was cleaned once or five times with an alcohol swab before blood sampling. CONCLUSIONS—To avoid overestimation of blood glucose using portable monitors, the hands should be washed before monitoring capillary BG, especially after fruit has been handled. Even though the value of self-moni-toring of blood glucose (SMBG) intype 2 diabetes is controversial (1 – 3), {{there is no doubt}} that SMBG provides a strong motivation for im-proved self-care (4). Blood samples for SMBG are usually and easily obtained by a fingertip prick after the skin has been rubbed with an alcohol swab. How-ever, abnormally high or low BG levels using blood from the fingertip have been reported. For example, underesti-mation of BG has been reported in the setting of impaired microcirculation, in-cluding low skin temperature (5, 6). We also experienced overestimated BG levels in blood from the fingertip in patients who had <b>peeled</b> <b>fruit</b> before SMBG. Fruits contain fructose and glucose, and traces of these sugars may be left on the fingertip after fruit peeling, thus resulting in an er-roneous reading. We tested the hypothe-sis that serum glucose values will be higher after fruit peeling in those who do not wash their hands versus those who do...|$|E

Assim, considerando também que a desidratação prolonga a vida-de-prateleira de alimentos perecíveis, a pesquisa se propôs a fazer uma contribuição para o desenvolvimento do processo de fabricação de passa a partir de frutos de caqui ‘Fuyu’. Foi utilizado um secador contendo circulação forçada de ar e cinco bandejas. O fruto descascado foi fatiado em quatro formas diferentes: fatias em metades, de corte transversal; fatias em ¼, de cortes longitudinais; fatias em ¼, de corte {{longitudinal}} seguido de corte transversal; fatias em 1 / 8, de dois cortes longitudinais seguidos de transversais. A condição de secagem que aplicou temperatura de 80 °C por 1 h seguida de 60 °C por cerca de 23 h produziu passas de caqui ‘Fuyu’ com a melhor aparência. A forma da fatia passa que teve a preferência dosprovadores foi aquela em que o fruto foi cortado em oito fatias (fatias de 1 / 8). As passas de caqui ‘Fuyu’ contendo umidades residuais baixas, 19, 7 e 27, 4 %, foram apreciadas, quanto ao paladar, igualmente pelos provadores. Os frutos de caqui proporcionaram, em peso, 16, 7 e 18, 1 % de produtos em passas e perdas estimadas em 25, 5 %.
