5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220â€“250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts. River otters are very susceptible {{to the effects of}} environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. A number of reintroduction <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker {{plays an}} active role as {{co-chair}} of JuntoBox Films since his initial involvement as co-chair with the collaborative film studio starting in March 2012. JuntoBox was developed as a social-media platform for filmmakers and fans to share ideas to create films and then collaborate to make them. Since Whitaker joined as co-chair, five <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> greenlit for production.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple Line {{has been in}} planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway. The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1988, twenty-eight land {{consolidation}} <b>projects</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> completed, and thirty-one projects <b>were</b> underway. Where <b>projects</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> completed, minute plots were almost completely eliminated, the average size of plots increased by 100 percent, {{and the number of}} plots declined by about 70 percent.|$|R
5|$|Afforestation <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{undertaken}} to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide {{easy access to}} nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E
5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to}} provide habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's lupine. In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E

5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is {{considered}} a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction <b>projects</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> particularly valuable in restoring populations {{in many areas of}} the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.|$|E
