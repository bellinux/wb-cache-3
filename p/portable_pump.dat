40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus requires an exogenous supply of insulin that ideally mimics physiological insulin secretion. The treatment {{goal is to}} achieve normoglycaemia {{in order to prevent}} or delay chronic complications, while limiting the risk of hypoglycaemia. Numerous advances have been performed in the last 10 years, as far as nature of insulin formulations, home blood glucose monitoring devices and modes of insulin delivery. Among the latter, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> represents the most sophisticated treatment capable of best mimicking normal insulin secretion. Such treatment provides better glucose control and glucose stability as compared to conventional multiple injection insulin therapy. However, it is essential to respect well defined indications and to organize a structured management by a multidisciplinary team {{in order to get the}} best metabolic results. The present paper describes recommendations, advantages and limits as well as cost of CSII with <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> in type 1 diabetic patients...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{volunteer}} fire brigade was founded. At first, {{it was rather}} primitively equipped, with a small, <b>portable</b> <b>pumping</b> unit, although eventually a fire engine with modern firefighting equipment was acquired, necessitating an expansion of fire station facilities. In 1970, the old pond was dredged and equipped to be a fire pond. The local fire brigade has won many prizes at contests within the Birkenfeld district for its speediness.|$|R

Vincent primarily made munitions, but Vincent engines were trialled in boats and <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> during the war, and the end of hostilities saw Vincent ready to return to motorcycle production. Vincent developed a highly efficient opposed-piston two-stroke engine for use in air-dropped lifeboats, although development outlasted the war and it never went into service.|$|R
50|$|The last {{horse drawn}} salvage tender was {{withdrawn}} in 1923, {{two years after}} the last of the London Fire Brigade’s horses were retired from service at Kensington fire station. By May 1936 the LSC fleet consisted of seven Leyland 3-tonners that had been in operation since 1923. It also had a 30-cwt and a 5-cwt. van; the larger used for carrying extra waterproof clothes and other gear, whilst the smaller vehicle could be used for taking first-aid gear to smaller outbreaks and thus save the expense of turning out a major tender. One of the LSC tenders, which carried a crew of two, was equipped with a <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> used for pumping out basements which had been flooded.|$|E

50|$|George makes a {{mess with}} ink and a {{fountain}} pen {{and tries to}} wash it away with the garden hose, but the room fills with water and he rushes to a nearby farm to get a <b>portable</b> <b>pump.</b> He is chased by the farmer but eludes him by hiding in a shirt on a clothes line then jumping in a truck headed for the museum. He reluctantly makes another mess in the museum with a dinosaur display. When the museum owners proceed to take George to the zoo, Professor Wiseman wants him {{to go up in}} a space ship and then bail out. George agrees and is given a tiny space suit. At the critical moment, it is uncertain whether George will jump or not, but he does and the experiment is a success. George is carried to Earth by a parachute and is awarded a medal.|$|E

50|$|During a gale in December 1940 Rodney {{experienced}} heavy panting and {{the beam}} added by the crew broke off. The two watertight compartments {{in the affected}} area flooded. The situation worsened {{as a result of}} a hole previously drilled into the watertight bulkhead by an officer to provide access for a hose connected to a <b>portable</b> <b>pump.</b> As a result of this hole the flooding expanded into the platform deck. The gale also tore the covers off the navel pipes which resulted in the cable-lockers flooding. The flooding extended into the torpedo tube compartments and drain tanks. Two bulkheads on the starboard side of Rodney also flooded. Rodney underwent repairs at Rosyth from December 1940 to January 1941. A planned refit in the United States occurred in Boston following the action against Bismarck. Yet even after this refit Rodney continued to suffer from leakage and hull defects. The Admiralty drew up plans for a complete modernization in 1944 but these were never executed.|$|E
50|$|The Blackwater {{fire was}} started by a {{lightning}} strike on August 18, 1937, but it remained undetected until early August 20, at which time it {{was estimated to be}} about 2 acre in size. By the evening, it had expanded to 200 acre, and 65 firefighters from the United States Forest Service (USFS), which included CCC company 1852 from the Wapiti Ranger District of Shoshone National Forest and employees of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), were constructing fire lines along two flanks of the fire. A gas-powered <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> was delivered and set up using water from Blackwater Creek by midnight. Another pump arrived after that and firefighters installed 2000 ft of hose line on the north flank of the fire and another 5000 ft on the west flank. CCC workers from the National Park Service arrived at 2:30 am on August 21 and started construction of fire line along the north flank of the fire.

50|$|This {{incident}} saw {{possibly the}} largest fire brigade attendance in UK history: 78 different brigades (with over 200 appliances, 147 of which responded from London Fire Brigade) and 38 different military units spread detergent and pumped out contaminated water. The clean-up lasted months and the brigades stayed on-site throughout working 24/7.

5000|$|While she was en route, however, {{an enemy}} bomber, {{identified}} as a [...] "Betty", came in at 2121, very low over the port quarter, strafing, and scored a direct bomb hit in the high-speed transports starboard mess hall, above her number one engine room. A second bomb hit her stack, glanced off, and splashed close aboard without exploding. Fire broke out immediately in the mess hall, galley, and troop quarters on the main deck; and the ship lost all power. Heavy smoke forced the abandonment of the number two fire and engine rooms, while a 500-gallon-per-minute <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> was demolished and all other such pumps were rendered inoperable by the shock. This damage reduced Blessmans crew to bucket brigades {{and the use of}} helmets to try to keep the blaze from spreading. Her sailors jettisoned topside ammunition aft, and attempted to clear ammunition from clipping rooms and bedding from troop quarters to halt the fires spread. At 2250, anti-aircraft and small arms ammunition began exploding, forcing the evacuation of wounded to stern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Portable</b> <b>pump</b> {{filters are}} commercially {{available}} with ceramic filters that filter 5,000 to 50,000 litres per cartridge, removing pathogens {{down to the}} 0.2 - 0.3 micrometer (µm) range. Some also utilize activated charcoal filtering. Most filters of this kind remove most bacteria and protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia, but not viruses except for the very largest of 0.3 µm and larger diameters, so disinfection by chemicals or ultraviolet light is still required after filtration. It {{is worth noting that}} not all bacteria are removed by 0.2 µm pump filters; for example, strands of thread-like Leptospira spp. (which can cause leptospirosis) are thin enough to pass through a 0.2 µm filter. Effective chemical additives to address shortcomings in pump filters include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, iodine, and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). There have been polymer and ceramic filters on the market that incorporated iodine post-treatment in their filter elements to kill viruses and the smaller bacteria that cannot be filtered out, but most have disappeared due to the unpleasant taste imparted to the water, as well as possible adverse health effects when iodine is ingested over protracted periods.|$|E
50|$|It {{all began}} {{one evening in}} 1957 when Garth Young {{was sitting at the}} table playing crib with friends. His sister ran in and said she could see flames in a window upstairs as she was driving down the road. Garth and his father each grabbed a bucket of water and ran upstairs, but there was nothing they could do. There was no fire {{department}} in Musquodoboit Harbour. They called Lands and Forests (now called the Department of Natural Resources) who showed up later with a <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> and some hose. But by now, the two story house was in flames and the dozen family members who lived there could only watch helplessly as it burned to the ground. The loss motivated Garth Young and other people in the community to establish their own fire department. By 1960 Garth Young was clearing land for the new station. A year later the Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department was born and he became one of its original members. The Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department formed in 1961 with the fire hall opening on October 6, 1964. The first piece of equipment they had was a trailer with a pump on it. It had compartments on each side into which they were able to put extra equipment, such as hoses. The first truck they had was a 1957 milk truck that they bought in 1963 from a farmer. The Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary formed in February 1967.|$|E
