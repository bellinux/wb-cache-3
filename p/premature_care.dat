50|$|Respiration in {{neonates}} is very irregular, {{prone to}} periodic breathing and apnea. In utero and at birth, the carotid body’s response to hypoxia {{is not fully}} developed; it takes {{a few days to}} a few weeks to increase its sensitivity to that of an adult carotid body. During this period of development, it is proposed that neonates heavily rely on other oxygen-sensing chemoreceptors, such as the aortic body or central chemoreceptors. However, non-carotid body chemoreceptors are sometimes not enough to ensure appropriate ventilatory response; SIDS deaths occur most frequently during the days or weeks in which the carotid body is still developing, and it is suggested that lack of appropriate carotid body activity is implicated in this condition. SIDS victims often are reported to have displayed some of the characteristic troubles in carotid body development, including periodic breathing, much sleep apnea, impaired arousal during sleep, and low sensitivity to hypoxia. The carotid bodies of SIDS victims also often display physiological abnormalities, such as hypo- and hypertrophy. Many of the findings on to carotid body’s relation to SIDS report that carotid body development is impaired by environmental factors that were already known to increase the risk of SIDS, such as premature birth and exposure to smoke, substances of abuse, hyperoxia, and hypoxia, so it may seem initially as if carotid body studies are only extending what we know about SIDS into another domain. However, understanding the mechanisms that impair carotid body development could help elucidate how certain aspects of neonatal, particularly <b>premature,</b> <b>care</b> might be improved. For example, oxygen therapy may be an example of a technique that exposes premature infants to such high oxygen levels that it prevents them from acquiring appropriate sensitivity to normal oxygen levels.|$|E

40|$|In the UK, new {{intermediate}} {{care services}} {{have been established}} to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions, facilitate effective discharge and prevent <b>premature</b> <b>care</b> home admissions. This paper reports findings from a national evaluation of intermediate care, focusing {{on the relationship between}} hospital services and intermediate care. Participants included key managers and practitioners involved in the planning, management and delivery of intermediate care in five case study sites. During the study, they identified a range of tensions between hospital services and intermediate care, including concerns about the role and involvement of acute clinicians; the safety, quality and appropriateness of intermediate care; access to and eligibility for intermediate care; a lack of understanding and awareness of intermediate care; and the risk of intermediate care being dominated by acute pressures. Although participants were able to identify several practical ways forward, resolving such fundamental tensions seems to require significant and long-term cultural change in the relationship between acute and intermediate care. Overall, this study raises questions {{about the extent to which}} intermediate care will be able to rebalance the current health and social care system and make a substantial contribution to tackling ongoing concerns about emergency hospital admissions and delayed transfers of care...|$|E

In this paper, we explore the process of decision making among doctors, nurses, and parents in <b>premature</b> <b>care</b> units (neonatal intensive care unites, NICUs) located in the central region of Portugal. Forty-one semistructured interviews with doctors, nurses, and mothers were conducted and analyzed. There is evidence that the medical teams provide a considerable amount of information to parents of premature babies, although sometimes unfavorable prognostic data are omitted. Mothers showed a high degree of confidence in the skill and knowledge of the medical professionals and accepted the latter’s role in making decisions regarding the care and treatment of their premature babies. Only when invasive procedures or surgery were serious possibilities was something resembling written informed consent obtained. Ethics committees were seldom consulted. The results show that in the region surveyed, parents neither are invited nor appear to demand a role in making medical decisions that affect their babies. No conflicts between medical providers and parents were detected, suggesting that informed consent and the participation of parents in medical decisions regarding the care and treatment of their babies are not considered necessary or useful in this particular area by the respective parties, in contrast with the tenets of autonomy-based ethics...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the changing nature}} of <b>premature</b> infant <b>care</b> {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Data are drawn from a variety of sources including manuscript collections from hospitals in Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia, papers of several influential physicians, and records of the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago. Medical and nursing literature of the era support the data while newspaper and magazine articles illustrate the public 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in this story. By 1950 hospital based, medically directed <b>premature</b> infant <b>care</b> was considered standard in most areas. New ideas about children in general, declining birth rates, and increased visibility all contributed to increasing medical and public interest in premature infants. In Chicago the interest and zeal of one physician resulted in the opening of the first permanent premature infant nursery in 1922. Attentive nursing care was called essential to the successful operation of premature nurseries and in fact was a major ingredient as medical treatment options were limited. In the 1930 s medical innovations such as improved incubator technology and oxygen therapy promised better outcomes and enhanced the reputation of hospital based, medically directed care. Public health campaigns provided education, financial assistance and transportation of infants from rural areas. Once identified as worthy of emotional and financial investments, premature infants were afforded attention and resources that not only prolonged their lives, but also changed forever the expected response to their birth. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{a fundamental}} concern deriving {{from the need}} to increase {{the focus on the}} social, emotional and intimate aspects in the design of healthcare technologies. The development of such technologies is in fact often afflicted by conflicting perspectives. While technical perspectives demand rational methods, social perspectives ask for non-rationalistic, phenomenology inspired approaches (Jacucci, 2007). The issue is addressed from the standpoint of a particular socio-technical setting, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. In particular, the chapter describes the human-centred and participatory design process, from problem analysis to concept generation, prototype development and testing of a new incubator system employing different technologies. All these technologies aim to provide unobtrusive monitoring, improving the baby’s comfort as well as parent-child bonding by lowering the emotional barrier created by the current incubator setup.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Although {{high volumes}} of {{literature}} {{have been written}} on interventions in dementia home care, only a poor efficiency has been proved. Nevertheless, caregivers often express strong feelings of satisfaction about the proposed support. In this meta-analytic review, a quantitative analysis {{of the effect of}} the different types of professional dementia home care interventions was made. METHOD: A systematic literature search, covering the years 1980 until 2007, was performed using Medline, Embase, Cochrane DSR, Dare, CCTR, and ACP Journal Club). Limitations on publication type were determined as randomized controlled trial and controlled trial. RESULTS: Psychosocial intervention in dementia home care was found to be beneficial in a non-significant way on caregivers' burden. An almost negligible decrease in depression was found in the psychosocial intervention arm while multidisciplinary case management contributed to a larger though insignificant decrease of depression in caregivers. Respite care was responsible for an increase in burden. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated, in accordance with other qualitative reviews, the weak evidence that supporting family caregivers could be beneficial. Although the rather small benefits of formal support, supporting family caregivers is an indispensable issue in dementia home care.

Because of the contactless principle, the technique offers potential application advantages in medical fields like emergency medicine (burn patient) or <b>premature</b> baby <b>care</b> where adhesive electrodes are not easily applicable. A laser-based, mobile, contactless vibrometer for on-site diagnostics that works with the principle of laser Doppler vibrometry allows the acquisition of vital functions in form of a vibrocardiogram. Preliminary clinical studies at the Klinikum Karlsruhe have shown that the region around the carotid artery and the chest region are appropriate therefore. However, the challenge is to find a suitable measurement point in these parts of the body that differs from person to person due to e. g. physiological properties of the skin. Therefore, we propose a new Microsoft Kinect-based approach. When a suitable measurement area on the appropriate parts of the body are detected by processing the Kinect data, the vibrometer is automatically aligned on an initial location within this area. Then, vibrocardiograms on different locations within this area are successively acquired until a sufficient measuring quality is achieved.

Method: Mobile residents who had fallen in the past year, were asked to wear a tri-axial accelerometer (ActivPAL 3 TM) on the lower thigh for 7 days. Care staff were trained in device application. Users’ skin and problems with use were checked daily. Activity data sought were: step count, time sedentary, time standing and Metabolic Equivalent of Task. Care records were checked for falls. Results: 10 / 16 residents agreed to wear accelerometers. 7 wore them for 7 days and the remainder for 4, 5 and 6 days respectively. No falls were recorded. Data indicated 1 resident continuously standing which was verified {{not to be the}} case by observation.

Due to the minimal touch policy in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), massaging is not usually performed on premature infants. However, there is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that newborn infants with complex medical conditions should not be massaged. This study aimed {{to determine the effects of}} massage with coconut and sunflower oils on oxygen saturation of infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial on 90 newborns who were admitted to Alzahra Hospital (Tabriz, Iran). The infants were divided into control and massage therapy groups (massage with coconut and sunflower oils). Data was collected using a hospital documentation form. A 15 -minute daily massage was performed for 3 days. Respiratory rate (RR), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) and oxygen saturation were measured 5 minutes before the massage, 3 times during the massage, and 5 minutes after the massage. The collected data was analyzed using a mixed model. Results: In comparison to coconut oil and control groups, mean oxygen saturation of sunflower oil group was improved. In addition, the coconut massage group showed lower oxygen saturation than the control group but was all values were within the normal range. Although massage decreased oxygen saturation, there was no need to increase FiO 2. Conclusion: Massage therapy can provide developmental care for infants treated with NCPAP...|$|R

ROP was found in 1834 infants (20. 7 %). 823 different interventions for infants with active ROP were performed: 737 retinal lasercoagulations, 3 -ports vitrectomy — 72, lensvitrectomy — 14. the total efficacy of the treatment was 92. 9 %. Conclusion : the ophthalmologic help system for premature infants in Central region of Russia combines all directions from de- tailed diagnostic to hich-technology treatment. It allows to reproduce one all over the Russian Federation territory. </p...|$|R
40|$|Health {{literacy}} {{represents the}} cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health, according to WHO. Common health literacy level may be sufficient {{in the case of}} smooth pregnancy and natural childbirth. However, if there are some health problems, it is necessary to support an increase in health literacy level of mothers. Main objective of this thesis is to describe the objective health literacy level of mothers with premature baby and to identify areas that are for these mothers most problematic. The theoretical part deals with demographic data related to premature births, the basic definition of prematurity, an essential characteristic of neonatology and organization of <b>care,</b> <b>premature</b> baby, the most common medical complications and prognosis. Defines and operationalizes health literacy of mothers with premature baby. Research used a qualitative methodology. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Respondents for interview were physicians who care for preterm infants. The selection of respondents was conducted using the snowball sampling to facilitate data analysis, were interviews transcribed and then analyzed using the cluster analysis. Results were [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mothers’ {{involvement}} in <b>caring</b> for their <b>premature</b> infants: an historical overview Background. Advances in technology {{have resulted in}} increasing survival rates even for extremely premature infants. While sophisticated medical management is vital to infant survival, {{research has found that}} social factors and care giving processes are important predictors of infants’ later outcome. Consequently, evidence is accumulating to demonstrate the fundamental role of mothers and families to the optimal developmental outcome of premature infants. Aim. The aim of the work reported here was to undertake an historical overview of <b>premature</b> infant <b>care</b> practices to increase neonatal nurse’s knowledge of the crucial role of mothers and families in the <b>care</b> of their <b>premature</b> infants. Understanding past practice and current trends can provide neonatal nurses with critical insight which will assist in formulating current and future care. Method. Research and historical articles focusing on maternal {{involvement in}} preterm infant care from the development of the incubator to the present time were examined. A search of the literature between 1960 and 2002 was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL and PSYCLIT databases. The search terms were premature infant, neonatal intensive care, history, and maternal care. Findings. Three major themes were identified which reflect the development of neonatal care. Firstly, over the last century advances in medical and public health practice saw a decline in mortality rates for mothers and infants. Secondly, the application of this new knowledge resulted in the institutionalization and professionalization of obstetric and neonatal care which, in turn, resulted in the isolation of infants from their mothers. Finally, concurrent advances in infant research emphasized the importance of mother–infant relationships to infants’ developmental outcome, resulting in greater flexibility in hospital practices regarding parental contact with their infants. Conclusion. As biomedical advances in technology continue to help smaller, sicker premature infants to survive, neonatal nurses are strategically placed to promote positive outcomes for infants and their families through the integration of social science and behavioural research into nursing practice...|$|R
