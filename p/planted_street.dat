On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a <b>planted</b> <b>street</b> tree. It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E

40|$|Trees are {{essential}} to urban habitats because they provide services that benefit the environment and improve human health. Unfortunately, urban trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), {{on one of the}} most commonly <b>planted</b> <b>street</b> trees in the eastern U. S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most, they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees. Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found that warmer sites had over 70 % more trees in poor condition than those in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and emphasize the need fo...|$|E
40|$|Trees provide {{numerous}} {{benefits for}} urban residents, including reduced energy usage, improved air quality, stormwater management, carbon sequestration, and increased property values. Quantifying these benefits can help justify {{the costs of}} planting trees. In this paper, we use i-Tree Streets to quantify the benefits of street trees planted by nonprofits in three U. S. cities (Detroit, Michigan; Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) from 2009 to 2011. We also use both measured and modeled survival and growth rates to “grow” the tree populations 5 and 10 {{years into the future}} to project the future benefits of the trees under different survival and growth scenarios. The 4059 re-inventoried trees (2864 of which are living) currently provide almost $ 40, 000 (USD) in estimated annual benefits ($ 9 –$ 20 /tree depending on the city), the majority (75 %) of which are increased property values. The trees can be expected to provide increasing annual benefits during the 10 years after planting if the annual survival rate is higher than the 93 % annual survival measured during the establishment period. However, our projections show that with continued 93 % or lower annual survival, the increase in annual benefits from tree growth {{will not be able to}} make up for the loss of benefits as trees die. This means that estimated total annual benefits from a cohort of planted trees will decrease between the 5 -year projection and the 10 -year projection. The results of this study indicate that without early intervention to ensure survival of <b>planted</b> <b>street</b> trees, tree mortality may be significantly undercutting the ability of tree-planting programs to provide benefits to neighborhood residents...|$|E
40|$|Urban Design; Designing an Urban setting, it self can {{perceive}} {{as a single}} architectural process, not only an individual building, but also the way buildings are related each other and its three-dimensional composition represents the total image of the city. Performances of these solid-void compositions directly effected to thermal behaviour of the city. The metropolization phenomenon at Colombo has provoked deep changes {{in the field of}} "Urban design". As well, as changes in thermal comfort levels and the energy balance, leading to an altered atmosphere of the urban area, In Colombo, higher relative humidity values and moderation in wind speed, the daily (diurnal) variation in temperature and diminishing diurnal temperature variation would indicate a growing UHI problem. The phenomena of Urban Heat Island can create unpleasant microclimatic conditions at the pedestrian level. Pedestrian walkways are the key pubic domain of Equatorial towns and cities, where the greatest amount of human contact and interaction taken place. Shading can create a comfortable level, avoids the direct solar radiation. Vegetation in particular tall trees can create a cooling effect, lower temperature and increase relative humidity. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of Orientation, built mass, tall trees with a wide foliage canopy and water bodies, on the climatic parameters, at the pedestrian level in street canyons, Colombo metropolitan. The research was conducted in either-side pedestrian walkways of two major public realms selected based on its Orientation. Each street canyon consisted with areas of deep, shallow and intermediate canyons, tall dense trees <b>planted,</b> <b>street</b> canyon relatively lacking in tall trees, directly effected water bodies etc. One pair of walkways was located parallel to and, the other perpendicular to, the coastline. Data collected in two days of December 2003 : Temperature and relative humidity, by a HOBO-HT data logger, in a well cross-ventilated radiation shield at seven feet height on each pavement, Traverse walking along canyon, by which temperature and relative humidity were, measured using the mobile data logger at midday and night, in Dec 18 th and 2200. The results show that during the day hours the temperature values in the canyons with vegetation were up to 2 THI values lower than those measured in the canyons without trees and it was up to 4 THI values lower in Gall face Green, where directly affected by the Ocean. Wind speed in the canyons placed perpendicular to the coastline, was generally higher than in the canyons located parallel to the coastline and blocked by rows of building from the sea breeze, which is a characteristic of Sri Lankan western shoreline. But the effect of vortex phenomena caused by perpendicular winds, can clearly experienced in N-S oriented deep canyons, Wind speed in canyons without trees was generally higher that in canyons with threes due to the windbreak and friction effects of the trees in the latter. The existence of shading devices above the pavements and tall dense trees in an urban environment could result in two opposite climatic effects. Shading devices moderate the air temperature and surface temperatures, preventing the direct solar radiation. In addition, trees act as moderators in both temperature and relative humidity levels towards comfortable levels. This research shows imperative need of interferences, of climatized architectural imlpiceations in the case of street canyons and adjoined pedestrian walkways at the Colombo Metropolitan...|$|E
