5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chokehold, {{at which point}} a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{played the}} Detroit Lions at Ford Field. Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching down the field. At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, stepped on, bit and ripped apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E
5|$|As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 {{became more}} common, the U.S. Air Force {{initiated}} the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program {{to provide an}} equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop's existing F-5 <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the AN/APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to be fired from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop's entry was announced as the IFA winner. Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E

The company was successful and was even able to find beehives and bring back ten gallons of honey. On October 3 the army reached the site of modern Terre Haute, a strategic location on the Wabash River. The company continued to scout the countryside and forage while the rest of the army constructed Fort Harrison. A small detachment of mounted men under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Berry was added the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
25|$|In {{their next}} game, an unheralded Northwestern team handed Michigan State its worst {{defeat of the}} season, beating them 83–65 for their fourth loss in six games. After that game, they faced Ohio State in a contest that {{required}} overtime; the Spartans emerged with an 84–79 win. That led to a winning streak; Michigan State ran off wins in their next nine games, defeating four of the teams that had beaten them in the process. Wisconsin snapped the Spartans' streak in their final game before the NCAA tournament, winning 83–81 on a long-range shot at the buzzer. The Spartans' 13–5 Big Ten record <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three-way tie with Iowa and Purdue for first in the conference, and they won 21 of 27 games in all regular season play; their final AP poll ranking was third.|$|E

25|$|The Detroit Ambassadors {{became the}} Detroit Jr. Wings in 1992 to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of {{popularity}} with the NHL's Red Wings. The {{owner of the}} Detroit Red Wings Mike Ilitch {{and the owner of}} the Detroit Jr. Red Wings Peter Karmanos had an ongoing feud. Notably, the Jr. Red Wing and Red Wings both shared the Joe Louis Arena. The rivalry between Ilitch and Karmanos boiled over, and the Jr. Red Wings were unceremoniously evicted from the Joe Louis Arena. When Karmanos bought the Hartford Whalers, the team became the Detroit Whalers, but played out of the tiny Oak Park Arena and the Palace of Auburn Hills, the latter of which could have been an appropriate venue for the NHL Whalers. Karmanos then had his own arena for his team constructed, Compuware Arena. In 1997, the Detroit Whalers became the Plymouth Whalers, simply because the team played out of Plymouth, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Miami had {{to score}} a {{touchdown}} {{to tie the game}} and send it to a 3rd overtime. The Hurricanes drew a couple of blanks to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 4th and 3 situation where Dorsey completed a 7-yard pass to Winslow for a 1st down. A facemask penalty was called on Ohio State during the play to make it 1st and 5 for Miami from the Buckeye 6-yard line. Ken Dorsey then threw an incomplete pass to Andre Johnson but a pass interference call on the Buckeyes defender gave Miami a 1st and goal from the 2-yard line. The Buckeye defense held Miami to only one yard in the next 3 plays to bring up a big 4th and goal on the 1-yard line. Ken Dorsey threw a pass as he was being hit by linebacker Cie Grant; it was incomplete, ending the game with Ohio State winning the BCS National Championship 31–24.|$|E
25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E

25|$|As {{the time}} for voting on the budget approached, Livingstone {{discovered}} that instead of the outright illegality involved in resolving {{not to make a}} rate, the other councils were planning to exploit the legal grey area of refusing to make a rate for the time being. This strategy would <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different position to the GLC and ILEA who would be illegal immediately. Budget papers prepared by the Director-General Maurice Stonefrost then revealed that the capping limit still allowed the council to increase spending substantially; the papers were circulated to all members of the GLC on 1 March. A long and acrimonious debate at a Labour group meeting on 4 March agreed by 24 votes to 18 to support the legal budget with its £25m in growth. The GLC Labour group split into three factions, with one group of 10 under John McDonnell insistent on not setting a rate, another of 8 under Ken Livingstone willing to defy the law but also to accept a budget at the cap if that stance failed, and a third group unwilling to support any illegal budgeting.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, a {{day after}} Russia cut off gas {{supplies}} to Ukraine, Hungary, Romania and Poland were the first countries to report that pressure in their pipelines had fallen. Bulgaria reported that their supply was also falling and that transit to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia was affected. Two days later the Czech Republic and Turkey reported drops in pipeline pressure. Starting on January 7, several countries began to report a significant drop in gas supplies from Russia. Throughout the crisis many countries were unprepared and had been left without supplies for days, leading to significant economic and humanitarian consequences; Bulgaria was forced to stop production in some of its important industrial plants, while one country, Slovakia, {{declared a state of}} emergency. The most severely effected countries were in Southeastern Europe, most of which rely completely on Russia for gas and at the time didn't have sufficient alternative energy sources. However North-West Europe wasn't much effected by the cutoff and none of Europe's major markets came close to cutting off customers. Many European countries had made investments since the 2006 crisis which <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> better position.|$|E
