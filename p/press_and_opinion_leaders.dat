30|$|To {{appeal to}} more {{hesitant}} faculty members, {{the dissemination of}} SCALE-UP may need to involve more change agents <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> to cross the chasm to the more hesitant majority. Specifically, implementers may need more guidance from near-peers <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> to reduce implementation challenges. Leveraging social networks could help facilitate a flow of information about SCALE-UP and provide an encouraging and supportive community. Enlisting the aid of change agents that use SCALE-UP in diverse educational settings may demonstrate to hesitant adopters {{that they can use}} elements of the radical reform without overthrowing the status quo. However, since much of the success of SCALE-UP comes from the radical nature of the reform, resources should be developed and shared to ensure that instructors can productively adapt SCALE-UP to their local setting.|$|R

30|$|Extant {{studies have}} {{documented}} {{the effects of}} innovativeness <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> leadership on adoption behavior, but there are mixed results {{on the relationship between}} innovativeness <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> leadership (Flynn et al. 1996; Hoffmann and Soyez 2010). For example, Summers (1971) suggested that innovators <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> are one <b>and</b> the same, whereas Grewal et al. (2000) argued that innovativeness is a predictor of <b>opinion</b> leadership. Schrank <b>and</b> Lois Gilmore (1973) confirmed that innovators are not <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> all the time, but some individuals may play a dual role as influencers <b>and</b> innovators. As <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> are likely to be knowledgeable about products in their domain of interest, it is highly likely that they will adopt an innovation earlier than others and then pass on the information (Shi and Fernandes 2014).|$|R
