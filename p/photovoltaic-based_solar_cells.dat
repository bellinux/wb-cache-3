Stand-alone {{transparent}} Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and {{low band}} gap Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> {{can be applied}} together in a high performance multi-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> system to absorb the middle and long wavelength light. In this system, optics needs to be designed carefully for {{the back side of}} transparent Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> to optimize the long wavelength light transmission. Photon losses cannot be eliminated in the stand-alone system. In this thesis a 3 -terminal Si-Si:Ge monolithic tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> consisting of a top silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and a bottom Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> sharing a common base, which can take advantage of both the silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and overcome the current mismatch effect and photon losses between Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is designed, modeled and fabricated. It can replace independent Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in a multi-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> system. Modeling of 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge monolithic tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is done to find out its maximum efficiency. A modified PERL cell is put on top of the modeled structure because it's the world record silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> Its thickness is modified to analyze the effects of near band edge absorption. There are three cases for the bottom Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> under modified PERL cell, the best fabricated device, product of the best measured parameters and the model of Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> 14. Modeling shows that 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> outperforms PERL cell in most cases, and a thicker Si device leads to higher efficiency. The efficiency of 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> with 800 um silicon substrate is 10 % relative and 2. 5 % absolute higher than PERL cell at 500 suns. Three groups of <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are fabricated. Performance of Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> in this structure improve significantly due to better Si:Ge epitaxial layers growth conditions. The Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> achieved with a Jsc of 3. 26 mA/cm 2, Voc of 189 mV below the silicon filter under one sun without light trapping.
