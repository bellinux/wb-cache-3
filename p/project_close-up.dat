50|$|The {{technology}} for the simulcasts and other innovations like OperaVision—a series of screens located throughout the War Memorial Opera House that <b>project</b> <b>close-up</b> shots of the action on stage—is made possible through SFOs Koret-Taube Media Suite. Completed in 2007, The Koret-Taube Media Suite is the first permanent high-definition broadcast-standard video production facility installed in any American opera house according to the companys website.|$|E
50|$|The Katzenjammer act {{has been}} {{compared}} to Victor Borge, as the pair often use their own comic compositions as well as parody a wide range of musical styles from The Spice Girls to Ragtime. A key part of their live show is a <b>projected</b> <b>close-up</b> image of the piano keyboard so the audience can see the tangle of hands and arms during their performance.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Gockley joined Houston Grand Opera as {{business}} manager and was appointed general director in 1972. Under his tenure, Houston Grand Opera presented 35 world premieres and six American premieres. Gockley oversaw {{the founding of}} the Houston Grand Opera Studio in 1977, the company’s young artist development program, and the opening of the Wortham Theater Center in 1987. He introduced “plazacasts”, free broadcasts of mainstage opera productions to outdoor audiences; created OperaVision, a series of screens located throughout the Wortham Center that <b>projected</b> <b>close-up</b> shots of the action on stage; and began annual radio broadcasts of Houston Grand Opera performances in the U.S. and abroad.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} process for an interactive multimedia application is discussed. The application {{allows students to}} perform a walkthrough of a wood frame residential <b>project,</b> with <b>close-ups</b> and explanations of selected items available upon user's action. A second set of features consists of watching video clips and pictures of related construction processes. The application is delivered in CD-ROM and works under the Microsoft Windows operating system. New multimedia projects can benefit from the ensuing discussion on this application's planning, and the hardware and software employed, since some of the design considerations could be reused in similar educational contexts...|$|R
40|$|Sunset Strip is day-by-day {{animated}} {{diary of}} a year's sunsets, recorded directly onto a continuous strip of 35 mm film. The film was commissioned by The Arts Council and Channel 4, and funded through an Animate Award. The opening programme, 'Elemental Animation', features Kayla Parker's 35 mm film Sunset Strip: "A programme of works which use the material of film itself as a canvas. These visceral, vibrant films feature camera-less techniques such as scratching, painting and printing onto the filmstrip, subjecting film to decay and decomposition, and affixing materials such as letraset or insects to its surface. The remarkable visions created through these diverse approaches fill the frame with dynamic textures and colour, and many will be presented on 16 mm and 35 mm prints. Seen in the cinema, these works achieve a powerful effect, immersing us in strange and previously unseen worlds, and displaying the breadth and scope of abstract film. " The event {{is part of the}} 2016 London International Animation Festival. Cinema screening followed by audience Q+A discussion with artist film-makers Kayla Parker, Ian Helliwell, and Vicky Smith, facilitated by the Edge of Frame curator and organiser Edwin Rostron.

40|$|This project {{takes as}} a {{hypothesis}} {{that the future of}} architectural education is going to change dramatically in the following years, mainly due to constant rise of technology in the field. As a result it argues that architectural education may not need to be confined by the limits suggested by a building. Thus, it proposes to ‘split’ the school into its departments and comprise a system for the whole via a point by point approach. In order to do so however, it focuses on the reuse of existing structures and design of new semi-permanent ones. For that reason the project moves towards an inceptive architecture; one that returns to basics, embryonic. This proposal was lead by the observation of the intensity of movement in the city; one which this project has engaged to facilitate in the design. The intervention itself requires a focus on several scales, from the urban, to the landscape and the building scale. Therefore, in order to re-think the structure in the different scales the strategy works with a grid system. As a result it aims to a have a space that promotes constant dialogue between the building, the landscape, and the people; a relationship that inevitably will promote the growth of the learning environment. For that purpose the research was based on the notion of the ambient space-or in-between space- relative to the organization analysis of the city of delft. Probably the case for all the cities in the Netherlands, but particularly in delft, it seems that the city follows its urban infrastructure in all scales: urban scale, the city scale and the block scale. In all three one can infer a certain directionality and movement that evolves through that system. The centre of delft has always initiated certain movement, such as the pedestrian move in a five phase plan that started in the early 2000 ’s and aimed to pedestrianize certain areas of the city. Relative to that {{on the other side of}} the campus was the relocation of the TU faculty, while in between there are botanical gardens, a museum, student housing, and a what it seems to be a potential site for the architecture department of this <b>project.</b> At first <b>close-up</b> one can see the importance of that spot due to the fact that lies between the city centre, the urban infrastructure and the rest of the tudelft campus. So the urban strategy for this site was formulated through the notion of urban acupuncture. For that purpose three main aspects acted as the focus in which the ‘split’ could be made possible. First, was determining the size of the existing program, second was the distance between them, and third was their relation to their immediate surrounding areas. The investigation started through a study of solid vs void, the main urban infrastructural elements such as the river, the public squares and courtyards, and all that relative to the immediate location of the site. As I mentioned before the opportunity rose at this point due to the point’s connection to the campus & the city centre. In addition the intersection of main traffic arteries becomes crucial to the its future development as an architecture school. So the first point is now placed. A department that is in shared program to the architecture department, one that requires a certain degree of landscape relation, one that is at the heart of the city center, and one that relates to its urban conditions. Together they form a two bind system of a building and a ‘open space’ in which action may or may not be required. Through the intervention one can see that movement between them but more importantly the identity that starts to evolve. DSDExplore LabArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
