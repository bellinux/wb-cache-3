This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E

25|$|Acceleration of auroral charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. <b>Particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|The {{details of}} these {{phenomena}} {{are not fully}} understood. However {{it is clear that}} the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> processes. Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty citizen science observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed [...] "STEVE" [...] (a reference to the animated film Over the Hedge in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature [...] "Steve"); subsequent reportage went viral, and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three parts. The first part {{consists of}} a study of high-Reynolds number, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence in wind tunnels which has been strained via an axi-symmetric contraction. The effect of strain on the turbulence is studied by detailed hot-wire measurements. The results are compared with Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT). The return to isotropy of the strained turbulence is studied and compared with Rotta's linear theory. The effect of strain on intermittancy {{as well as the}} structure of turbulence is also studied. In the second part the experimental measurements of inertial <b>particle</b> Lagrangian <b>accelerations</b> are described. These are the first measurements of inertial <b>particle</b> <b>accelerations</b> in a well documented high-Reynolds number wind-tunnel flow. Using a high-speed camera which moves with the mean speed of the flow, inertial particle trajectories are obtained. The trajectories are analyzed to obtain the <b>particle</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The acceleration probability distribution functions (PDFs) are compared with those of recent computer simulations. The last part consists of an analysis of inertial particle motion in turbulent flows. A new model called the Vortex model is proposed and used to study the inertial particles in turbulent-like flows. Using this model, several mechanisms through which attenuation of inertial <b>particle</b> <b>accelerations</b> may occur in real turbulent flows are studied. We also compare the results of the Vortex model with those of the DNS simulations of Bec et al. [J. Fluid Mech 550 (2006) ]. The range of applicability and shortcomings of stochastic acceleration models for inertial particle modeling are also discussed. The results of this work have a wide range of applicability. The complex spectral dynamics associated with relatively simple straining flow and subsequent relaxation which is found in many engineering and natural flows is explored in detail. These results can be used to build better models for strained flows. Inertial <b>particle</b> <b>accelerations</b> are suspected to play major roles in determining rain drop formations, particle agglomeration in industrial flows, pollutant transport and other related phenomena.
