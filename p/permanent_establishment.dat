However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> of a second TAG {{to be based on the}} east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E

By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby.

25|$|Following Trajan's {{successful}} {{conquest of}} Mesopotamia in the 2nd century, the Parthian Empire began to decline.

The Sassanids were a more aggressive enemy than their Parthian predecessors and consequently, the Romans found themselves fighting a more dangerous Eastern opponent {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire was weakening due to the civil chaos arising from the death of the Roman Emperor Commodus.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} wealth of perspectives, {{including}} the commander's, it is difficult if not impossible to tell exactly what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who {{might well have been}} motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable, and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, Ranger's capture of Drake was one of the Continental Navy's few significant military victories during the Revolution, and was of immense symbolic importance, demonstrating as it did that the Royal Navy was far from invincible. By overcoming such odds, Ranger's victory became an important symbol of the American spirit and served as an inspiration for the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> of the United States Navy after the revolution.|$|E

During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatius, who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual anathemas made in 863 by his predecessor Photios I and Pope Nicolas I. Just like Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> of the Roman Church in Bulgaria.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the notion of risk {{as set out in}} Issues Notes 1, in the {{document}} “Transfer Pricing Aspects of Business Restructurings: Discussion Draft for Public Comment”. Furthermore, the approach of this draft is compared with the authorized OECD approach, established in the 2010 Report on the Attribution of Profits to <b>Permanent</b> <b>Establishments.</b> German law on transfer pricing provisions will also be examined to see whether domestic provisions could make a good example in allocating risks, as a supplement to the guidance from the OECD. Issues Notes 1 has been subject for a debate as to how it should be interpreted and whether the provisions laid down in the document provide the tax authorities of contracting states too much room for subjectivity in determining whether risk allocation scenarios as set up by associated enterprises have economic substance. It has also been argued that Issues Notes 1 is an attempt by the OECD to align risk allocation under Article 9 of the OECD Model Convention with the authorized OECD approach, applicable to <b>permanent</b> <b>establishments,</b> because risk allocation under Article 7 is conducted by applying the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations by analogy. There are however crucial differences between associated enterprises and <b>permanent</b> <b>establishments</b> which makes this impossible. The guidance under Issues Notes 1 is insufficient, why the OECD should seek to further clarify the concepts regarding business restructurings. The German way of implementing domestic provisions is incompatible with the provisions of the OECD and Article 9 and therefore violates most of its tax treaties...|$|R

25|$|While {{this debate}} focused {{largely on the}} {{controversial}} Mitchell, its early star was Foulois. Both returned from France with combat leadership experience in aviation, expecting to become the peacetime leaders of the Air Service. Instead, the War Department appointed Maj.Gen.

Foulois was reduced to his <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> rank of captain and assigned to head a minor agency. Mitchell received the vacant position of Director of Military Aeronautics, but its responsibilities had been transferred to Menoher by Executive Order 3066 to end the dual status mess of the DMA and BAP, and his position was titular only. Instead he became Third Assistant Executive (in effect, S-3), chief of the new Training and Operations Group, where he installed like-minded airmen who had served with him France as division heads and used the position to expound his theories.|$|E
