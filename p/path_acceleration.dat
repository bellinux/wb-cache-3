We compute the relaxation of the problem which involves the so-called Fisher-Rao functional a convex functional on the space of measures. This relaxation enables the derivation of several optimality conditions and, in particular, a sufficient condition which guarantees that a given path of the initial problem is also a minimizer of the relaxed one.

40|$|Estimation-based {{iterative}} {{learning control}} (ILC) {{is applied to}} a parallel kinematic manipulator known as the Gantry-Tau parallel robot. The system represents a control problem where measurements of the controlled variables are not available. The main idea is to use estimates of the controlled variables in the ILC algorithm, and in the paper this approach is evaluated experimentally on the Gantry-Tau robot. The experimental results show that an ILC algorithm using estimates of the tool position gives a considerable improvement of the control performance. The tool position estimate is obtained by fusing measurements of the actuator angular positions with measurements of the tool <b>path</b> <b>acceleration</b> using a complementary filter.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{strategies for}} I/O sharing in Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) systems mostly {{deployed in the}} special environment of avionic systems. MILS system designs are promising approaches for handling the increasing complexity of functionally integrated systems, where multiple applications run concurrently on the same hardware platform. Such integrated systems, also known as Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) in the aviation industry, require communication to remote systems located outside of the hosting hardware platform. One possible solution is to provide each partition, the isolated runtime environment of an application, a direct interface to the communication's hardware controller. Nevertheless, this approach requires a special design of the hardware itself. This paper discusses efficient system architectures for I/O sharing in the environment of high-criticality embedded systems and the exemplary analysis of Free scale's proprietary Data <b>Path</b> <b>Acceleration</b> Architecture (DPAA) with respect to generic hardware requirements. Based on this analysis we also discuss the development of possible architectures matching with the MILS approach. Even though the analysis focuses on avionics it is equally applicable to automotive architectures such as Auto SAR...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a theoretical Structural Impairment Detection System (SIDS) for timber railway bridges. Due to fatigue, the timber stringers in timber railway bridges develop shear cracks. These shear cracks lead to higher bridge deflections, higher stresses in the stringers and rail, and shorter fatigue life of the system. A SIDS is proposed which links wheel <b>path</b> <b>accelerations</b> obtained from traversing freight cars to the condition of the bridge. In order to develop the SIDS, two models of timber railway bridges with various levels of structural impairment were developed. The first model was a quasi-static model developed from classical beam theory and implemented in MATLAB. The second model was a dynamic, finite element model created in LS-DYNA. Traversing axle loads were imposed on the models. The results obtained from the model were the wheel paths the axles take as they traverse the bridge. The paths were expressed as vertical displacements as a function of position on the bridge. Wheel <b>path</b> <b>accelerations</b> were obtained by numerically differentiating the vertical displacements. The accelerations were then used to train neural networks to have an input of an acceleration vector and an output of a bridge condition vector. The neural networks were trained on results from both models under three train speeds: 40 mph, 30 mph, and 20 mph. The networks were able to determine the correct bridge condition 90 % of the time when the train speed was 40 mph and 70 % of the time when the train speed was 30 mph. The networks were not successful in determining bridge condition when the train speed was 20 mph...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimally balancing motion energy and communication transmission energy of a mobile robot tasked with transmitting a given number of data bits to a remote station, while navigating to a prespecified destination in a given amount of time. The problem is cast {{in the setting of}} optimal control, where the robot has to choose its <b>path,</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and transmission rate along the path so as to minimize its energy required for transmission and motion, while satisfying various power and communication constraints. We use realistic models for the robot's channel estimation, motion dynamics, and power and energy costs. The main contribution of the paper is to show how to co-optimize robot's path along with other communication and motion variables. Two versions of the problem are solved: the first is defined offline by assuming that all the channel measurements are taken before the robots starts moving, while in the second the channel estimation is updated while the robot is in motion, and hence it is solved online. In both cases we utilize an in-house algorithm that computes near-optimal solutions in little time, which enables its use in the online setting. The optimization strategy is described in detail and validated by simulation of realistic scenarios. Comment: 8 pages, ACC 2016 accepte...|$|E

40|$|A new {{automatic}} {{flight control}} system concept suitable for aircraft with highly nonlinear aerodynamic and propulsion characteristics and which must operate over a wide flight envelope was investigated. This exact model follower inverts a complete nonlinear model of the aircraft {{as part of the}} feed-forward path. The inversion is accomplished by a Newton-Raphson trim of the model at each digital computer cycle time of 0. 05 seconds. The combination of the inverse model and the actual aircraft in the feed-forward path alloys the translational and rotational regulators in the feedback path to be easily designed by linear methods. An explanation of the model inversion procedure is presented. An extensive set of simulation data for essentially the full flight envelope for a vertical attitude takeoff and landing aircraft (VATOL) is presented. These data demonstrate the successful, smooth, and precise control that can be achieved with this concept. The trajectory includes conventional flight from 200 to 900 ft/sec with <b>path</b> <b>accelerations</b> and decelerations, altitude changes of over 6000 ft and 2 g and 3 g turns. Vertical attitude maneuvering as a tail sitter along all axes is demonstrated. A transition trajectory from 200 ft/sec in conventional flight to stationary hover in the vertical attitude includes satisfactory operation through lift-cure slope reversal as attitude goes from horizontal to vertical at constant altitude. A vertical attitude takeoff from stationary hover to conventional flight is also demonstrated...|$|R

A computer code <b>PATH</b> (particle <b>acceleration</b> and transport in the heliosphere) was tuned to simulate this event. The model includes local particle injection at an evolving quasi-parallel shock, first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock, and self-consistent excitation of MHD waves to enhance particle scattering, particle trapping, and escape from the shock complex, and transport in the inner heliosphere up to several AU. The shock and solar wind boundary conditions are derived from Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) observations at 1 AU, which are then extrapolated to 0. 1 AU. Modeled time-dependent spectra for energetic protons, iron, and oxygen ions are compared with ULEIS and SIS measurements onboard ACE, and with GOES- 8 data.

The equation of motion is {{described in terms of}} operational coordinates. The coordinates are separated into active and passive components.

This method is also extended to path tracking control of a manipulator with passive joints. A desired path is geometrically specified in operational space. The position of the manipulator is controlled to follow the path. In this method, a path coordinate system based on the path is defined in operational space. The path coordinates consist of a component parallel to the path and components normal to the <b>path.</b> The <b>acceleration</b> of the components normal to the path is controlled according to feedback based on tracking error by using the dynamic coupling among the components.

In a series of field tests with four artificially triggered avalanches, we compared the effect of additional safety equipment. We measured burial depth and visibility of dummies equipped with two different brands of avalanche airbags (ABS and Snowpulse), the avalanche ball and of dummies with no additional equipment. The burial depth of dummies equipped with an airbag was significantly lower compared to dummies which carried an avalanche ball or no additional equipment. Moreover, based on a qualitative validation the airbag systems were rated better than dummies without airbag. Both brands of airbags and the avalanche ball were visible in all cases {{on the surface of}} the avalanche deposits – partly due to the avalanche size and the <b>path</b> topography. <b>Acceleration</b> measurements at the head of the dummies suggest that the risk of injury may be reduced with an appropriate form of the airbag...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} attain the {{requisite}} sensitivity for LISA - a joint space mission of the ESA and NASA- the laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the secondary noises such as the optical <b>path</b> noise, <b>acceleration</b> noise etc. By combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams containing fractional Doppler shifts - a technique called time delay interferometry (TDI) - the laser frequency noise may be adequately suppressed. We consider the general model of LISA where the armlengths vary with time, so that second generation TDI are relevant. However, we must envisage the possibility, that not all the optical links of LISA will be operating at all times, and therefore, we here {{consider the case of}} LISA operating with two arms only. As shown earlier in the literature, obtaining even approximate solutions of TDI to the general problem is very difficult.

40|$|LISA is a {{joint space}} mission of the ESA and NASA for {{detecting}} low frequency gravitational radiation in the band $ 10 ^{- 5 } - 1 $ Hz. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the other secondary noises such as the optical <b>path</b> noise, <b>acceleration</b> noise etc. This is achieved because of the redundancy in the data, more specifically, by combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams containing fractional Doppler shifts - time delay interferometry (TDI). The orbits of the spacecraft are computed in the gravitational field of the Sun and Earth in the Newtonian framework, while the optical links are treated fully general relativistically and thus, effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay, etc. are automatically incorporated. We show that in the model of LISA that we consider here, there are symmetries inherent in the physics, which may be used effectively to suppress the residual laser frequency noise and simplify the algebraic approach to TDI.
