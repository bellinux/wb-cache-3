We estimate the labor supply of physicians employed at hospitals in Norway, using <b>personnel</b> <b>register</b> data merged with other public records. A dynamic labor supply equation is estimated using a sample of 1303 male physicians observed over the period 1993 - 1997. The methods of estimation are GMM and system GMM. We reject the static model in favor of a dynamic model and obtain short run wage elasticities around 0. 3. This is higher than previously estimated for physicians, in particular for those who are not self-employed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mortality}} pattern among 86 men {{was determined}} to investigate the possible hazards of polishing steel. The men had polished steel with polishing paste {{for at least five}} years. The polish-ing pastes had contained tallow, beeswax, carnauba wax, alundum, carborundum, ferric oxide, and chalk. A total of 18 men had died compared with 13 - 3 expected. Four had died of stomach cancer compared with 0 O 44 expected (p < 0 005). The mortality for other causes of death was not increased. The study does not permit any definite conclusion but indicates a possible cancer hazard among polishers. Metal polishing can be heavy, dirty work, the occupational hazards of which have not been studied extensively. Recently, however, two studies have been published concerning the risk of cancer among polishers. Blair ' could not show any increased mortality from cancer in workers in the polishing and plating industry, but Sparks and Wegman 2 found an increased incidence of stomach cancer among jewellery workers mainly occupied with polishing. The present study was started before the publication of these two studies, and was under-taken as a screening programme to detect any possible occupational risk among polishers in the mechanical engineering industry. Subjects and methods The factory to which the study group of polishers belonged was founded in 1907, and its main product is bearing rings. Today some 3000 workers are employed. The study was designed as a cohort study, all men were selected from the <b>personnel</b> <b>register,</b> had been employed any time between 1950 and 1966, and had worked at least five years as a polisher. The <b>personnel</b> <b>register</b> contained every person who had ever been employed by the company. Alto-gether 86 were selected as fulfilling the criteria for inclusion. Follow-up continued until 31 December 1976 or until death or emigration (five people) before that date. There was no other loss to follow-up.

40|$|The Management Information and Decision Support Environment (MIDSE) is a {{research}} activity to build and test a prototype of a generic human interface on the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Information Network (CIN). The existing interfaces were developed specifically to support operations rather than the type of data which management could use. The diversity of the many interfaces and their relative difficulty discouraged occasional users from attempting to use them for their purposes. The MIDSE activity approached this problem by designing and building an interface to one JSC data base - the personnel statistics tables of the NASA Personnel and Payroll System (NPPS). The interface was designed against the following requirements: generic (use with any relational NOMAD data base); easy to learn (intuitive operations for new users); easy to use (efficient operations for experienced users); self-documenting (help facility which informs users about the data base structure {{as well as the}} operation of the interface); and low maintenance (easy configuration to new applications). A prototype interface entitled the JSC Management Information Systems (JSCMIS) was produced. It resides on CIN/PROFS and is available to JSC management who request it. The interface has passed management review and is ready for early use. Three kinds of data are now available: personnel statistics, <b>personnel</b> <b>register,</b> and plan/actual cost...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a questionnaire on sickness absence due to back pain and respiratory disorders with the view of using sickness absence as a measure of morbidity. METHODS [...] A cross sectional survey was conducted among 511 male workers aged 20 - 65, drawn from the <b>personnel</b> <b>register</b> of an animal feed mill. The response was 404 (79 %) participants. Data on sickness absence in the six months before the survey were collected by a self administered questionnaire and by sickness absence records. Correlation between both methods was examined for prevalence, duration, and frequency of overall sickness absence, back pain absence, and absence due to respiratory complaints. RESULTS [...] The questions about the prevalence of sickness absence from all causes, back pain, and respiratory complaints showed a high specificity of 91 %, 97 %, and 98 %, respectively. The sensitivities of these questions were 79 %, 88 %, and 13 %, respectively. The survey found a moderate agreement between the questionnaire and the medical register for duration and frequency of overall sickness absence with kappa values of 0. 54 and 0. 50. A good agreement was found for back pain absence with kappa values of 0. 65 and 0. 61. Respiratory absence showed a poor agreement of 0. 16 and 0. 13. CONCLUSION [...] In epidemiological studies questionnaires might be considered a valuable source of information on overall sickness absence or absence due to back pain which lasted for at least two weeks in the past six months. Whether a questionnaire survey is a reliable source of data on sickness absence due to respiratory complaints remains to be seen...|$|E
40|$|Background:Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} locality differences of sickness absence {{in the context of}} health and social conditions of inhabitants. Aim:To examine the number of days of sickness absence among blue- and white-collar workers according to the diagnoses in four factories of a food industry in Finland during a 6 -year period (2003 - 2008).     Methods:The study was carried out at the main four food factories of a large food industry   in Finland.   The data was collected in a 6 -year period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 from the <b>personnel</b> <b>register</b> of the company. The data included age, gender, occupational status, target units, sickness absence of all members of staff due to diagnoses, and person years of work.   The study participants were represented by blue (88. 3 %). and white collar workers (11. 7 %). The age structure of the study was from 17 to 69, the mean age by 2006 was 36. 8 with range equal to 13. 1. Descriptive analyses were done by using frequency tables. The number of sickness absence days per person years among blue and white collar workers was calculated separately for each factory due to diagnoses. Differences in sickness absence for each diagnosis in different factories among blue and collar workers were evaluated with rate ratio and 95 % CI from general linear models, presuming negative binominal distribution for the days. Results:There were significant differences in number of sick leave days due to diagnoses in the studied target units. The highest rate of sickness absence days according to diagnoses was among blue (127. 3) and white (53. 5) collar workers at one of the factories. Also, the highest incidence rate of diseases was noted in blue (RR= 2. 16, 95 %CI 1. 04 - 4. 50) and white (RR= 2. 73, 95 %CI 1. 86 - 4. 00) collar workers of the same factory. Musculoskeletal diseases were the most common reason for sick leave, followed by injury or accident for blue and flu for white collar workers. Conclusion:The study showed that there are differences in number of sick absence days due to diagnoses between four food factories belonging to the same company.

The aim in the first phase was to describe the composition of the residents and nursing personnel of old age homes in South Africa. An exploratory and descriptive survey was conducted and the data was collected by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire also included data on the financial implications of utilising professional nursing personnel to manage the care of the frail residents/older persons in old age homes in South Africa. The questionnaires were mailed to 612 old age homes published in the Hospital and Nursing Yearbook of 1997 (100 % sample).
