Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area.

5|$|The {{other two}} {{accidents}} concerned {{testing of the}} station's TORU manual docking system to manually dock Progress M-33 and Progress M-34. The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking Spektr and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module's solar arrays produced {{a large proportion of}} the station's electrical supply, causing the station to <b>power</b> <b>down</b> and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run <b>power</b> <b>down</b> the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Static power {{consumption}} {{is an important}} com-ponent of the total {{power consumption}} in FPGAs built using 90 nm and smaller technology nodes. A previous study proposed <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> regions of logic blocks in an FPGA when idle to reduce the static power dissipation. This previous work did not consider <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the switch blocks (SBs). However, the static power of SBs constitute more than 50 % of an FPGA’s static power. In this paper, we present an architecture that enables selectively <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> SBs along with the logic blocks during their idle periods. The potential power savings from this architecture depends on the proportion of SBs that can be <b>powered</b> <b>down.</b> We present modifications to our CAD flow to maximize {{the number of such}} SBs, and we experimentally estimate their proportion using a set of synthetic benchmark circuits. Our estimation results show that 53 % to 83 % of the SBs can be <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> in a functional module of size 24 × 24 tiles and an architecture power gating regions of size 4 × 4 tiles, leading to overall static power reductions of 70 % to 84 % compared to an architecture that does not support power gating.

25|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. This is like <b>power</b> <b>down,</b> but the SDRAM uses an on-chip timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than power-down mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E
25|$|After {{working through}} the checklists to safely <b>power</b> <b>down</b> the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew {{performed}} the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note that {{the door to the}} Waste Collection System in shuttle's mid-deck flew open during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston the next day.|$|E

50|$|Computer {{components}} are usually described as cold-pluggable if {{the computer system}} must be <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> to add or remove them.

The transformer is deliberately positioned as far away as possible from the inputs to avoid electromagnetic interference, while the power supply and its capacitors are closer to both the transformer and the output devices.

2500|$|Although {{the sensor}} unit was {{originally}} planned {{to contain a}} microprocessor that would perform operations such as the system's skeletal mapping, it was revealed in January 2010 that the sensor would no longer feature a dedicated processor.
