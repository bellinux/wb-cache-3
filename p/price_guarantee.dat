40|$|The {{globalization}} hazard hypothesis {{maintains that}} the current account reversals and asset price collapses observed during 'Sudden Stops' are caused by global capital market frictions. A policy implication of this view is that Sudden Stops can be prevented by offering global investors <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on emerging markets assets. These guarantees, however, introduce a moral hazard incentive for global investors, thus creating a tradeoff by which <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> weaken globalization hazard but strengthen international moral hazard. This paper studies the quantitative implications of this tradeoff using a dynamic stochastic equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, distortions induced by margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> prevent this deflation by introducing a distortion that props up foreign demand for assets. Non-state-contingent guarantees contain Sudden Stops but they are executed often and induce persistent asset overvaluation. Guarantees offered only in high-debt states are executed rarely and prevent Sudden Stops without persistent asset overvaluation. If the elasticity of foreign asset demand is low, <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> can still contain Sudden Stops but domestic agents obtain smaller welfare gains at Sudden Stop states and suffer welfare losses on average in the stochastic steady state. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Sudden Stops to capital inflows in emerging economies {{may be caused}} by global capital market frictions, such as collateral constraints and trading costs, suggests that Sudden Stops could be prevented by offering <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on the emerging-markets asset class. Providing these guarantees is a risky endeavor, however, because they introduce a moral-hazard-like incentive similar to those that are also viewed as a cause of emerging markets crises. This paper studies this financial frictions-moral hazard tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model in which margin constraints, trading costs, and ex-ante <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> interact in the determination of asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics. In the absence of guarantees, margin calls and trading costs create distortions that produce Sudden Stops driven by occasionally binding credit constraints and Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> contain the asset deflation by creating another distortion that props up the foreign investors’ demand for emerging markets assets. Quantitative simulation analysis shows the strong interaction of these two distortions in driving the dynamics of asset prices, consumption and the current account. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> are found to be effective for containing Sudden Stops but at the cost of introducing potentially large distortions that could lead to ‘overvaluation’ of emerging markets assets.

40|$|Capital {{markets have}} {{witnessed}} {{a rash of}} `Sudden Stops' during the last decade. Policy proposals to prevent these crises include creating indexed bond markets and providing <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> for emerging market assets. Chapter 1 explores the macroeconomic implications of indexed bonds with a return indexed to the key variables driving emerging market economies such as terms of trade or productivity. We employ a quantitative model of a small open economy in which Sudden Stops are driven by the financial frictions inherent to world capital markets. While indexed bonds provide a hedge to income fluctuations and can undo the effects of financial frictions, they lead to interest rate fluctuations. Due to this tradeoff, there exists a non-monotonic relation between the "degree of indexation" (i. e., {{the percentage of the}} shock reflected in the return) and the overall effects of these bonds on macroe- conomic fluctuations. Therefore, indexation can improve macroeconomic conditions only if the degree of indexation is less than a critical value. When the degree of indexation is higher than this threshold, it strengthens the precautionary savings motive, increases consumption volatility and impact effect of Sudden Stops. The threshold degree of indexation depends on the volatility and persistence of income shocks as well as the relative openness of the economy. Chapter 2 explores the implications of asset <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> provided by an international financial organization on the emerging market assets. This policy is motivated by the globalization hazard hypothesis, which suggest that Sudden Stops caused by global financial frictions could be prevented by offering foreign investors <b>price</b> <b>guarantees</b> on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a trade- off, however, because they weaken globalization hazard while creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using a quantitative, equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by a Fisherian deflation. <b>Price</b> <b>guarantees</b> prevent this deflation by propping up foreign demand for assets. The effectiveness of <b>price</b> <b>guarantees,</b> their distor- tions on asset markets, and their welfare implications depend critically on whether the guarantees are contingent on debt levels and on the price elasticity of foreign demand for domestic assets...|$|R
