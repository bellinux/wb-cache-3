In these cases, the fault current with high fault resistance are small. So majority of the protection algorithms, which are influenced by fault resistance, fails to perform satisfactorily. Thus, it is essential to study the effect of fault resistance on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

Faults on one <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> will cause a protection event (fuse or breaker open) locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment. An example of application is local distribution in Europe (and elsewhere), where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral (which is common to the three phases). When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced {{as much as possible}} within premises where 3-phase power is used. [...] These same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply.For domestic use, some countries such as the UK may supply one phase and neutral at a high current (up to 100A) to one property, while others such as Germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower fuse rating, typically 32 A per phase, and [...] "shuffled" [...] to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase.|$|E

The first line to trip was a 66 kV line near Adelaide, and it was automatically reset.

The Davenport-Belalie line tripped with one <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground,</b> was automatically reset, but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be 42 km from Davenport.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a high-speed fault detection, classification and fault location scheme {{for all types}} of shunt faults (63 <b>phase(s)</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> and 57 <b>phase(s)</b> <b>to</b> <b>phase</b> fault combinations) in six phase transmission lines, using wavelet transform and modular multilayer feed-forward neural network. Extensive simulation studies are performed to evaluate the impact of variation in fault and power system parameters such as fault type, fault inception angle, fault location, short circuit capacity of the either end source and there X/R ratio, voltage (± 10  %), frequency (± 5  %), power flow angle. The variations in fault resistance (0 – 135  Ω) along with high fault impedance have also been considered on the performance of proposed algorithm during <b>phase(s)</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> faults. For all the cases tested, the results show that the proposed scheme correctly detects/identifies the faulty phase and corresponding fault type within one cycle time from the inception of fault. This is a marked improvement over the existing techniques which were able to provide the necessary output only after one cycle time from the inception of fault. Also, detection and classification accuracy of 100  % is achieved for all the test cases. The maximum error in estimating the location of fault is found to be within ± 0.688  %. The performance of the proposed scheme was tested up to 99.9  % of line length. Using the proposed scheme, 90  % of the line length can be covered accurately, which is better than 80  % provided by conventional distance relays. The simulation results obtained with the proposed scheme confirm the reliability and suitability of the proposed technique under different fault situations. Thus, the proposed technique can be applied as an independent protection scheme or as a supplement to existing schemes. Also, the technique uses the data measured at one end only; without any information {{about the state of the}} line at the other end or zero sequence current as in conventional distance relaying. Due to these advantages, the proposed algorithm can be used for primary protection or can act as back up in the absence of communication link.|$|R

SINTEF took part in a field test, which was done in 2005. After the field test being done, a report was elaborated. The report became the main reference of this document. The purpose of this work is the creation of a PSCAD model that can be an authentic representative of the tested distribution network in 2005. Moreover, a detection and location method for single <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> faults is tested in order to find any limitation in it and to be {{an important part of the}} validation of the model. The model was created from a variety of given information from SINTEF, a frequency line dependent model was used as a part of the overhead lines representation, in order to have a model as close as possible from the real distribution network behaviour. A deep study of resonant grounding was made in this document, due to its direct involvement in the single <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> faults measurements in the field test. The main focus of the model were related to the magnitude and the orientation of the zero sequence currents, the latest ones are considered as the most important variable of study throughout this work. The validation of the proposed model was granted by the important variables consistency between the field test and the given results from the simulations. The field test results were gotten from the report elaborated by SINTEF. The QU diagrams, which were gotten from the simulations, gave the expected behaviour according to the field test.

40|$|The rural {{power grid}} has {{traditionally}} mostly consisted of overhead power lines. In {{recent years the}} trend has been to replace the overhead lines with cables instead. The reason is that overhead lines are relatively vulnerable, strong winds and storms can cause trees and branches to fall over the power lines and cause a <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault. This will then trip the ground fault relays and disconnect the faulty power line. A cable grid is not vulnerable in the same way, and {{could be considered a}} solution to make the power grid more reliable. A cable grid does come whit other types of problems instead. It generates about 50 times more <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> capacitance compared with the same length of overhead lines. When a <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault occurs the capacitance in the healthy phases will generate a current to ground and then through the fault. On average a cable grid generates about 2 A per kilometer. Large cable grids can therefore cause very large capacitive currents to flow through the fault.   To counter this, a reactor is placed between the neutral point of the transformer and ground. When a <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault occurs, the reactor will generate an inductive current which is in the opposite phase compared to the capacitive current. This current will flow through the faulty line and cancel out the capacitive current. In a perfectly tuned power grid the only component left in the fault is a smaller resistive current. Large cable grids will require a large reactor to generate the large inductive current, which might need to flow over a great distance in the grid to reach the fault location. To reduce the inductive current from the central reactor, it is possible to install smaller local reactors in the grid. These will then {{in the event of a}} <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault generate a part of the inductive current, which will reduce the currents from the central reactor. This report will look at the factors related to grounding systems and how these factors affect the ground fault currents. The purpose of the report is to give recommendations to Umeå Energi on where in their grid they should install additional local reactors and also which factors they should consider when doing future expansions and rebuilds of their power grid. ...|$|E
