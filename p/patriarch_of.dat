5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting the situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E

50|$|The <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople often {{tried to}} adopt an {{imperious}} position over the other patriarchs, provoking their resistance.

5|$|Bohemond {{had already}} been on bad terms with Peter of Angoulême, Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch. Taking {{advantage}} of a conflict between the patriarch and the papal legate, Peter Capuano, Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch, Symeon II, in early 1206 or 1207. Peter of Angoulême and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune {{with the approval of}} the Holy See. He also imposed an interdict on Antioch, but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches.|$|E

5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, {{pretended to be}} the Orthodox <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Chalcedon the <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople remained in communion with the non-Chalcedonian <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, while Rome remained out of communion with them, and in unstable communion with Constantinople. It was not until 518 that the new Byzantine Emperor, Justin I (who accepted Chalcedon), demanded that the Church in the Roman Empire accept the Council's decisions. Justin ordered the replacement of all non-Chalcedonian bishops, including the <b>patriarchs</b> <b>of</b> Antioch and Alexandria. The extent {{of the influence of}} the Bishop of Rome in this has been a matter of debate.|$|R

5|$|At this point, again {{according}} to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, who found him and delivered an offer by the <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the Taurus Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (ca. 1375). At the same time, the <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.

He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E
5|$|During his exile, Duke Henry III of Eppenstein, {{brother of}} Ulrich I, <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Aquileia (r. 1086–1121), had seized {{property}} {{belonging to the}} Salzburg diocese in Friuli and Carinthia.

5|$|In 1907, Khrimian {{clarified}} {{the relations}} between the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople and emphasized the primacy of the see of Echmiadzin.

5|$|Peter of Angoulême helped Raymond-Roupen's {{supporters}} {{to return from}} Cilicia to Antioch in late 1207. Surprised by the coup, Bohemond sought refuge in the citadel. Although Leo of Cilicia also entered the town, Bohemond was able to muster his troops and defeat his enemies. He captured and imprisoned the Latin patriarch who refused to acknowledge him as the lawful prince. After Peter of Angoulême died of thirst, Pope Innocent III ordered Albert Avogadro, Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem, to excommunicate Bohemond. Bohemond continued to support the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch and did not allow Peter of Ivrea, the new Latin <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Antioch, to visit his see. He also debated {{the right of the}} Holy See to make a judgement about the succession in Antioch, stating that the principality was a fief of the Latin Emperors of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Wallachia was {{recognized}} by the Ecumenical <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople in 1359. Wallachia issued its own currency under Vladislav I (1364c.1377). The earliest written information about Gypsies in modern Romania, a deed issued by Dan I of Wallachia (c.13831386) refers to Vladislav I's former donation of Gypsies to the Vodiţa monastery. Later on, all the important monasteries and boyars owned Gipsy slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Cardinals plus Borja's own vote numbered 14, {{one short}} of the required two-third majority. However, Cardinals Carafa, Costa, Piccolomini, Cibò, and Zeno, followed by Medici, were unwilling to be bribed. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, followed by Basso, was intractably opposed to Borja's election. Thus, the eighty-six-year-old Gherardo, the Cardinal <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> Venice, who was paid only 5,000 ducats, constituted the deciding vote.|$|E
