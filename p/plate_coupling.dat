30|$|To {{evaluate}} the stress shadow effect around megathrust earthquakes, {{we had to}} estimate the state of <b>plate</b> <b>coupling,</b> where <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> χ is defined as Coseismic slip/Total slip for one cycle of the megathrust earthquake (e.g., Kato and Hirasawa 1997) or 1 [*]−[*]Present slip rate V/Plate convergence rate Vpl (e.g., Hyndman et al. 1997). On {{the relation between the}} <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> and the frictional parameters of RSF law, {{it is well known that}} the degree of the <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> has a strongly negative correlation with the value of Lmin (e.g., Kato and Hirasawa 1997), if we assume a fixed size of asperity. In this study, we chose two models: a strong coupling model (SCM) and a weak coupling model (WCM). The WCM is the model adopted by Ariyoshi et al. (2013) for the 1944 Tonankai earthquake. The SCM is the same as the WCM, except that the frictional stability parameter γ for large asperity is about 2.6 times greater under the higher value of the frictional parameter b in the RSF law.|$|E

40|$|We used three-component surface {{velocities}} {{in southwest}} Japan to estimate <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> on the subducting plate interface at the Nankai trough. We analyzed continuous GPS {{data from the}} Japanese GEONET network from 1996 to 2006 using a consistent analysis strategy that generates bias-fixed solutions for the entire network. We applied systematic time-series analysis methods to estimate common mode error, which improved position solutions for the entire network. To allow for differences in regional deformation sources, we modelled the <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> on the plate interface beneath Shikoku island to Kii Peninsula and the Tokai-Suruga trough separately. The results show strong coupling {{at a depth of}} ~ 10 – 30 km off Shikoku and Kii Peninsula. The spatial variation in <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> coincides well with the coseismic rupture zones of the past large earthquakes. Maximum slip deficit rates of ~ 2 – 3 cm yr^(− 1) at the depth of ~ 5 – 25 km are found beneath the Tokai area, consistent with results from other studies. The downdip limits of the highly coupled areas and transition zones beneath Shikoku and the Kii Peninsula correspond approximately to estimates of the 450 °C isotherms. Good correlation is observed between the lateral variations of the slip deficit distribution, low frequency earthquakes, and coseismic slip. This correlation suggests that temperature, and possibly fluid variations, contribute to such correlation in space. The interplate slip deficit derived from the GPS velocities over the 10 yr of observations is generally compatible with the results over shorter time spans, suggesting that <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> in SW Japan does not change significantly over the period of these GPS measurements...|$|E

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> on very low-frequency event (VLFE) activity resulting from megathrust earthquakes, we performed long-term multiscale earthquake cycle simulations (including a megathrust earthquake and slow earthquakes) on a 3 -D subduction plate boundary model, based on a rate- and state-dependent friction law. Our simulation suggests that quiescence of shallow VLFEs off Miyagi {{may be explained by}} the location in the shallow central part of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake because of the locally strong coupling, while observed activation of VLFEs off Iwate (northern part of Tohoku district), Fukushima (southern part of Tohoku district), and Ibaraki (northern part of Kanto district) is explained by the location on the outer rim. The area and duration of the quiescence off Miyagi may be a new clue to evaluate the potential for <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> strong enough to cause the next megathrust earthquake.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is the dramatic variability in the along-strike segments. The seismicity of the Tohoku subduction zone {{has been active in}} Segment C, while virtually no large earthquakes have occurred in Segments B and D over the last 500 years except for a few events in 1938 (Abe, 1977). A large tsunami earthquake in 1896 in a shallow segment B′ (Kanamori, 1972) and slow or aseismic slip events in Segment B (Kawasaki et al., 2001), as shown by green patches in Fig. 3 (a), indicate weak <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> in Segments B and B′. Segments C and C′ appeared to have slipped significantly during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake from both tsunami (e.g., Maeda et al., 2011) and high-frequency seismic waves (e.g., Honda et al., 2011), implying very strong <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> although their background seismic patterns are quite different from each other.|$|E
30|$|Segment C, {{where the}} {{epicenter}} of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is located, may have a potential to generate a large earthquake, as already mentioned, while its adjacent two segments, Segments B and D, do not. Following a recent popular term in seismology, we may call Segment C a segment with strong asperities while Segments B and D have no, or very minor, asperities. This dramatic variability among along-strike segments, including segments of weak <b>plate</b> <b>coupling,</b> is very striking. Thus, the idea that no megathrust earthquakes are likely in the Tohoku subduction zone appeared reasonable before 2011. The interaction between deep and shallow segments, Segments C and C', is considered essential for causing an M 9 earthquake; their combined slips may have triggered large slips in adjacent along-strike segments (Segments B and D) of relatively weak <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> where no large slips can happen if they fail by themselves.|$|E

30|$|The {{seismic gap}} of large {{earthquakes}} {{may reflect the}} mode of the <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> in the region. In the Kanto region, the Philippine Sea plate subducts northwestward from the Sagami Trough and the Pacific plate subducts westward beneath the Philippine Sea plate from the Japan Trench. Several studies have estimated the <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> rate around the source region of the largest aftershock (the 2011 Ibaraki-oki event in the following). In the region off Ibaraki Prefecture, {{to the south of}} the source area of the main shock (Honda et al., 2011), the plate contacting with the Pacific plate changes from the North American plate to the Philippine Sea plate. The hypocenter of the 2011 Ibaraki-oki event was on the plate boundary between the North American plate and the Pacific plate. From a study of repeating earthquakes on the plate boundaries, Uchida et al. (2009) considered that the coupling coefficient between the Pacific plate and the North American plate is relatively large compared with that between the Pacific plate and the Philippine Sea plate. However, the coupling strength in the focal region of the 2011 Ibaraki-oki event cannot be inferred from such an analysis, for there is no repeating earthquake there. Nishimura et al. (2007) estimated the <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> rate in and around the Kanto region using GPS data. According to their result, the 2011 Ibaraki-oki event is located at the border of the areas of low and high coupling rates.|$|E

Further development of the slip distribution model with time dependence also remains as a goal for future work.|$|E
40|$|After the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, the {{immediate}} threat of megathrust earthquakes {{in and around}} Japan has been suddenly advocated by some researchers. One even points {{out the possibility of}} a larger event than ever, an event of Magnitude 10. In this study, we discuss whether an event of M 10 will be realistic or not, from not only statistical aspects of earthquake occurrence or macroscopic scaling laws of seismic sources in a conventional manner（e. g., fault size, the amount of slips）but also the diversity of megathrust earthquakes that was revealed after the occurrence of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. From a simple extrapolation of seismicity and macroscopic scaling laws, one event of M 10 occurs every 500 years all over the world, with its fault length, width and average slip to be 1, 200 km, 600 km and 50 m, respectively. The width may not exceed 200 km very much because of the limitation of an elastic region of a plate boundary in a subduction zone. We therefore need either of （ 1 ） average slip as large as 100 m or （ 2 ） fault length of more than 1, 500 km for a possible M 10 event. The average slip may be able to exceed 100 m, considering an area of very large shallow slips associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, but we must take care that this is possible only for an event of the along-dip double segmentation. This type of events is, however, generally adjacent to segments of weak <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> with small coseismic slips. In contrast, an event of the conventional along-dip single segmentation may extend its fault into many adjacent segments. A drawback in this case is that the average slip may not exceed 50 m unless there are several segments of very strong <b>plate</b> <b>coupling,</b> resulting in co-seismic slips lager than those with usual events repeating in each segnent. Although a very large strong shallow segment of the double segmentation is a candidate of am M 10 event, we cannot find any clear evidence of such a region from the present spatial seismic pattern in the world. The subduction zone in south Chile is the best candidate from its apparent strong <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> although it may not occur for a while due to the nearly complete strain release associated with the 1960 earthquake. We consider a very large event will be impossible even if a large portion of subduction zones breaks in the Aleutian trench because of the existence of several segments of weak <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> with slow events or aseismic slips in this trench...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} research aims {{to improving}} the dynamic modelling of <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures across a wide frequency range by using analytical, statistical and experimental methods. The analytical waveguide method is used to model the flexural displacement of <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures which are simply supported along two parallel edges. A method of quickly predicting the average energy level in a plate from details of the waveguide model is described, and used for comparison with SEA models. The Poynting and Impedance methods of predicting the energy flow in <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures are investigated. Transmission coefficients for <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures are evaluated using the analytical waveguide method for both semi-infinite and finite <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures. Finite transmission coefficients have traditionally been more difficult to evaluate due {{to the presence of}} a reverberant field, but in this work a novel method of separating the reverberant field using a scattering matrix method is presented. The transmission coefficients for semi-infinite and finite structures are then compared for L-shaped plates. A modal transmission coefficient is also defined and for the cases considered, and is used to develop an alternative method of deriving the transmission coefficient in a finite structure. Frequency averaged transmission coefficients are also considered, and the transmission coefficients derived for finite and semi-infinite structures are found to be very similar after frequency averaging. Statistical Energy Analysis models of <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> are evaluated using transmission coefficients derived from waveguide models. The results of the SEA models are compared to those predicted by the analytical waveguide method. A modal transmission coefficient based SEA model is also investigated.

With the SCM, however, Figure  5 c shows there is a quiescence in slow earthquakes that appears on the shallow belt during the interseismic stage (about 0 to + 40  years), where the whole region is aqua except for the central part, which is blue (|Strike|[*]<[*] 30  km), and there are no streaks of warm colors. This is due to strong <b>plate</b> <b>coupling,</b> as shown in Figure  4 a. From other additional simulations, in which we varied the nucleation length of Lmin and L∞ in the large asperity by changing the frictional parameters b[*]=[*](a 1 [*]−[*]γ 4) and dc 1 for the large asperity, the lower frictional instability of the large asperity caused the quiescence of the VLFEs to be shorter in time and smaller in space because of the weaker <b>plate</b> <b>coupling</b> (e.g., Kato and Hirasawa 1997).
