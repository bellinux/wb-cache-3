40|$|Several drugs {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of chronic <b>peripheral</b> <b>ischaemic</b> and venous diseases, i. e. aescine, Cyclo 3, Ginkor Fort, hydroxyethylrutosides, naftidrofuryl, naphthoquinone and procyanidolic oligomers, were tested on the mitochondrial respiratory activity. The results show that all these drugs protected human endothelial cells against the hypoxia-induced decrease in ATP content. In addition, they all induced a concentration-dependent increase in respiratory control ratio (RCR) of liver mitochondria pre-incubated with the drugs for 60 [*]min. The drugs were divided into two groups according to their effects. The first group (A), comprising aescine, Ginkor Fort, naftidrofuryl and naphthoquinone, increased RCR by decreasing state 4 respiration rate. The second group of drugs (B), comprising hydroxyethylrutosides, procyanidolic oligomers and Cyclo 3, increased RCR by increasing state 3 respiration rate. The drugs of group A were able to prevent the inhibition of complexes I and III respectively by amytal and antimycin A while the first two drugs of group B increased adenine nucleotide translocase activity. Cyclo 3 inhibited the carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (mCCP) -induced uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration. None of these seven drugs could protect complexes IV and V, respectively, from inhibition by cyanide and oligomycin. When tested on endothelial cells the drugs of group A, in contrast to group B, prevented the decrease in ATP content induced by amytal or antimycin A. The present results suggest that the protective effects on mitochondrial respiration activity by these venotropic drugs may explain their protective effect on the cellular ATP content in <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> and some of their beneficial therapeutic effect in chronic vascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) {{has been}} reported to produce differential electrophysiological effects in isolated epicardial and endocardial cells. This study aimed to examine regional electrophysiological effects of LVH in normal and <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> in the whole heart. LVH was secondary to perinephritis-induced hypertension. Monophasic action potential duration (MAPD(90)), effective refractory period (ERP) and conduction delay were measured in paced, isolated working rabbit hearts either at one right ventricular and two left ventricular sites (apical and basal epicardium) or at three left ventricular sites (apical and basal epicardium, apical: endocardium). The hearts were subjected to 30 min of regional ischaemia and 15 min of reperfusion. In non-ischaemic conditions, LVH produced uniform prolongation of MAPD(90) and ERP in the left ventricular epicardium, but not in the endocardium. After coronary artery occlusion, LVH significantly increased ischaemia-induced transepicardial dispersion of repolarisation, but not refractoriness. LVH did not affect arrhythmogenesis in either non-ischaemic or <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Differential effects of LVH on epicardial and endocardial electrophysiological parameters are also observed in the whole heart. In addition, the sensitivity of hypertrophied myocardium to ischaemia is increased and leads to an increase in ischaemia-induced dispersion of repolarisation. However, neither dispersion of refractoriness nor arrhythmogenesis are affected by LVH in non-ischaemic or <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> in this experimental model...|$|R

This condition affects mainly the arteries of the lower limb leading to decreased blood flow with subsequent ischaemic lesions.

40|$|Experimental data {{indicate}} that NMDA receptor activation is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischaemia. However, the results from in vivo studies are equivocal, with NMDA antagonists being active in only some models. It has recently been demonstrated that competitive and non-competitive NMDA antagonists behave differently under normal and <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> These studies have used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to investigate whether this disparity is due to redox-modulation of the NMDA receptor which occurs in ischaemia. NMDA-mediated toxicity was concentration dependent with little damage occurring with less than 10 µM NMDA and maximal damage produced by 30 µM. NMDA toxicity was significantly enhanced by pre-treatment with 1 mM dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, such that damage occurred at 1 nM NMDA, and maximal damage was produced by 10 µM. The efficacy of MK- 801 was not altered by reducing conditions, but the EC 50 of the competitive antagonist APV was increased by 20 -fold. These data strongly suggest that the neuroprotective efficacy of NMDA antagonists is significantly altered under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions,</b> and that more beneficial effects will be obtained with antagonists having a higher affinity for the receptor in the reduced configuration...|$|R
50|$|Meldonium is {{believed}} to continually train the heart pharmacologically, even without physical activity, inducing preparation of cellular metabolism and membrane structures (specifically in myocardial mitochondria) to survive ischemic stress conditions. This is done by adapting myocardial cells to lower fatty acid inflow and by activating glycolysis; the heart eventually begins using glycolysis instead of beta oxidation during real life <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> This reduces oxidative stress on cells, formation of cytotoxic products of fatty acid oxidation and subsequent cellular damage. This has made meldonium a possible pharmacological agent for ischemic preconditioning.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} if endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) under normal and <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> exhibits a direct arrhythmogenic effect that is independent of its ability to cause coronary vasoconstriction, and to determine the contribution of the ETA and ETB receptor subtype. ETA/B (with ET- 1) and ETA (ET- 1 in the presence of BQ- 788) receptor activation resulted in a significant reduction in both epi- and endocardial monophasic action potential duration (MAPD 90). ETA receptor activation reduced both epi- and endocardial effective refractory period (ERP). This MAPD 90 and ERP shortening were associated with a reduction in coronary flow, myocardial contractility and induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during ERP measurement. The ETB agonist sarafotoxin (S 6 c) had no marked, or concentration-dependent, effect on MAPD 90, ERP, myocardial contractility or induction of arrhythmias. Neither ET- 1 nor S 6 c, given prior to coronary artery occlusion, significantly changed the ischaemia-induced dispersion of MAPD 90, ERP or the % incidence of VF. In conclusion, neither ETA nor ETB receptor stimulation has a direct arrhythmogenic effect in isolated rabbit hearts under normal or <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ET- 1 -induced arrhythmogenic effect observed in nonischaemic hearts {{is likely to be the}} result of the associated coronary vasoconstriction caused by ETA receptor stimulation resulting in myocardial ischaemia...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the {{metabolites}} phosphocreatine (PCr), Pi and ATP were quantified by 31 P n. m. r. spectroscopy in {{the human}} calf muscle during isometric contraction and recovery under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Time resolution of the measurements was 10 s. During a 30 - 60 s ischaemic isometric contraction, PCr decreased linearly {{at a rate of}} 1. 17 %/s (relative to the resting value) at a contraction strength equivalent to 70 % of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and at a rate of 2. 43 %/s at 90 % MVC. There was a corresponding increase in Pi but the concentration of ATP did not change. pH decreased linearly during contraction by 4. 22 and 8. 23 milli-pH units/s at 70 and 90 % MVC respectively. During a subsequent 5 min interval of ischaemic recovery, PCr, Pi, ATP, phosphomonoesters and calculated free ADP, free AMP and pH retained the value they had attained by the end of contraction with no significant recovery. Thus it is concluded that anaerobic glycolysis and glycogenolysis is halted momentarily on termination of contraction and that PCr is not resynthesized during ischaemic recovery. This paradoxical arrest of glycolytic flow in spite of the very significantly elevated concentration of potent activators such as Pi and free AMP clearly indicates that parameters other than PCr, ATP, Pi, calculated pH, free ADP and free AMP regulate glycolysis and glycogenolysis of human skeletal muscle very efficiently under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Prisms {{of adult}} rat cortex were {{maintained}} in vitro in either aerobic conditions (control) or conditions simulating an acute ischaemic challenge (hypoxia with no added glucose). Endogenous glutamate efflux increased with time in <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions,</b> being 2. 7 fold higher than control efflux at 45 [*]min. Returning prisms to control solution after 20 [*]min of simulated ischaemia resulted in glutamate efflux returning to near-control values. Endogenous GABA efflux in <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> also increased, being 4. 5 fold higher than control efflux at 45 [*]min. Ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux was not accompanied by increased lactate dehydrogenase efflux and was unaltered by omitting calcium from the extra-cellular solution and adding EGTA (0. 1 [*]mM). Both GABA and the GABA-mimetic clomethiazole inhibited ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux, with IC 50 values of 26 and 24 [*]μM respectively. The maximum inhibition by either drug was 60 – 70 %. Bicuculline (10 [*]μM) abolished the inhibitory effect of GABA (100 [*]μM) but not clomethiazole (100 [*]μM). Picrotoxin (100 [*]μM) abolished {{the action of}} both GABA and clomethiazole. Pentobarbitone inhibited glutamate efflux at 100 – 300 [*]μM (maximal inhibition: 39 %). Bicuculline (10 [*]μM) abolished this effect.

The inhibitory effect of GABA, clomethiazole and pentobarbitone on ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux appears to be mediated by GABAA receptors.

Methods and Results We conducted an incremental cost-consequence analysis {{from the perspective of}} the admitting hospital for the period of the first 7 days. Costs were analysed for the management of refractory <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> and myocardial infarctions, including incremental days on the general ward or intensive care unit, as well as necessary revascularization procedures, and expressed in Swiss francs (CHF) and European currency units (ECU). Drug costs were based on a loading dose of 0 · 4 μ. kg− 1. min− 1 and a maintenance dose of 0 · 1 μ. kg− 1. min− 1 for tirofiban at a cost of CHF 273 · 55 (ECU 166 · 50) per vial. Heparin was administered at a loading dose of 5000 U and a maintenance dose of 1000 U. h− 1. All calculations were standardized to 100 treated patients. The costs of managing ischaemic complications were based on typical practice patterns in Swiss hospitals. The incremental costs per patient of managing unstable angina patients with recurrent ischaemia or myocardial infarction were calculated as CHF 23325 (ECU 14198) and CHF 18599 (ECU 11321), respectively. The incremental drug costs amounted to CHF 82065 (ECU 49954). The additional use of tirofiban resulted in net savings of CHF 54899 (ECU 33418) per 100 patients, achieved through a reduction in the cost of treating refractory <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> (CHF 79306, ECU 48275) and myocardial infarctions (CHF 57658, ECU 35097).

During deep anesthesia or under {{conditions such as}} occur with haemorrhagic shock, however, renal blood flow falls, the blood flow being directed to other essential organs so that any fall in blood pressure throughout the whole organism is obviated. The kidney itself, however, is plunged into <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The object of the present work was to study both the changes with time which occur in renal cytology after the establishment of <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions,</b> and to define the point in time at which renal cytology undergoes the change from a reversible to an irreversible state. In an experiment using domesticated rabbits, continuous renal artery ligation was performed (0, 1, 2. 5, 5 hours) and the time course investigated histologically (mainly by observation of glomerular epithelial and endothelial cytology) with both light and electron (transmission and scanning) microscopes.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of MgADP and/or MgATP on the Ca 2 +-dependent and Ca 2 +-independent {{contractile}} force restoration were determined {{in order to identify}} the origin of the tonic force increase (i. e. ischaemic contracture) which develops during advanced stages of ischaemia. Experiments were performed at 15 °C during simulated <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> in Triton-skinned right ventricular myocytes from rats. In the presence of 5 mm MgATP the maximal Ca 2 +-dependent force (Po) of 39 ± 2 kN m− 2 (mean ± s. e. m.) under control conditions (pH 7. 0, 15 mm phosphocreatine (CP)) decreased to 8 ± 1 % during simulated ischaemia (pH 6. 2, 30 mm inorganic phosphate (Pi), without CP). This change was accompanied by a major reduction in Ca 2 + sensitivity (pCa 50 4. 10 vs. 5. 62). Substitution of MgADP for MgATP restored isometric force production and its Ca 2 + sensitivity (pCa 50 4. 74 at 4 mm MgADP and 1 mm MgATP). In addition, it shifted the MgATP threshold concentration of Ca 2 +-independent force development to higher levels in a concentration-dependent manner. However, Ca 2 +-independent force was facilitated less by MgADP than Ca 2 +-dependent force. The MgADP-induced increase in force was accompanied by marked reductions in the velocity of unloaded shortening and the rate of tension redevelopment. These data and simulations using a model of cross-bridge kinetics suggest that the ischaemic force is not a consequence of a reduction in intracellular MgATP concentration, but identify MgADP as a key modulator of the cross-bridge cycle under simulated <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> in cardiac muscle, with a much lower inhibition constant (0. 012 ± 0. 003 mm) than in skeletal muscle. Therefore, MgADP has a high potential to stabilize the force-generating cross-bridge state and to facilitate the development of ischaemic contracture, possibly involving a Ca 2 + activation process in the ischaemic myocardium...|$|R

An inciting factor was identified in 14 patients: aortography in 10, aortic surgery in two, and thrombolysis in two. Clinical course of acute renal failure was quite variable. Four patients required dialysis; 11 were conservatively man-aged. All patients had concomitant skin lesions, includ-ing digital mottling, cyanosis and gangrene of the toes, and livedo reticularis of the lower limb and abdomen.

We found a strong involvement of cholinergic systems, both projective and intrinsic, in all forms of cognition. Each form of cognition had an individual cholinergic molecular profile and the cholinergic synaptic compositions in the ischaemic rat brains differed significantly from normal ones. Our data demonstrated that under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions,</b> instead of damaged connections new key synaptic relationships, which were stable against pathological influences and able to restore damaged cognitive functions, arose. The plasticity of neurochemical links in the individual organization of certain types of cognition gave a new input into brain pathology and can be used in the future for alternative corrections of vascular and other degenerative dementias...|$|R

40|$|Objectives to {{investigate}} the effects of chronic ischaemia on the subcutaneous and the skeletal muscle resistance vasculature. To understand the redistribution of available blood in the ischaemic limb. Methods human subcutaneous and skeletal muscle resistance arteries were obtained from limbs amputated for critical limb ischaemia and studied under isobaric conditions using pressure myography. Morphological measurements of wall and lumen were analysed using light microscopy and image analysis. Vasoconstrictor responses to potassium and adrenoceptor agonists were used to measure functional status. Noradrenaline re-uptake mechanisms and α 1 -selectivity were investigated. Results both human skeletal muscle and subcutaneous resistance arteries undergo a severe atrophy of the arterial wall in <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, whereas subcutaneous resistance arteries become less able to vasoconstrict to adrenoceptor stimulation, the response of skeletal muscle resistance arteries becomes exaggerated and significantly augmented. This is true in response to both the endogenous vasoconstrictor noradraline and the α 1 -selective adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Conclusions hypersensitivity to circulating catecholamines in the skeletal muscle vascular resistance bed {{may contribute to the}} progression of ischaemic disease by differentially diverting available blood to the subcutaneous tissue to the detriment of skeletal muscle perfusion...|$|R

The major limitation of this technique is neointima hyperplasia which can ultimately lead to occlusion and failure of the graft. Although critical in maintaining vascular homeostasis, the roles of nitric oxide and the endothelium in modulating vein graft neointima hyperplasia are not well understood.

40|$|Introduction: Erytropoietin (EPO) has cytoprotective and angiogenic {{properties}} {{and has a}} beneficial effect in <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Since the development of renal interstitial abnormalities are often associated with ischaemia, we studied {{the effects of the}} long-acting EPO analogue darbepoetin alpha (DA) on kidney damage in TGR(mRen 2) 27 (Ren 2) rats. Materials and methods: Ren 2 rats were randomised to DA or vehicle (VEH) or to DA + angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or VEH + ACEi. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. Blood pressure was measured weekly and 24 -h urine was collected to measure proteinuria. Blood samples were collected for creatinine and haematocrit. Kidneys were studied for inflammation and pre-fibrosis. Renal mRNA expression was studied for EPO, EPO-receptor, collagen- 3 alpha 1 and kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1). Results: DA had no effect on SBP, serum creatinine and proteinuria. Interstitial and glomerular alpha-SMA expression was significantly increased in Ren 2. ACEi but not DA improved the increased renal inflammatory and pro-fibrotic profile in Ren 2 rats. DA on top of ACEi further reduced glomerular alpha-SMA and KIM- 1 expression. Conclusion: Long-term DA treatment has no beneficial effects on renal structural and functional changes in TGR(mRen 2) 27 rats in the time frame studied and the dose provided...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{swelling}} activates or upregulates {{a number}} of anion channels. Of the volume-activated or -regulated anion channels (VAACs or VRACs), the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOR) is most prominently activated and ubiquitously expressed. This channel {{is known to be}} involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell volume regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and cell migration as well as cell turnover involving apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that VSOR activity is also involved in {{a number of}} pathophysiological processes including the acquisition of cisplatin resistance by cancer cells, ischaemia–reperfusion-induced death of cardiomyocytes and hippocampal neurons, glial necrosis under lactacidosis as well as neuronal necrosis under excitotoxicity. Moreover, VSOR serves as the pathway for glutamate release from astrocytes under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> and when stimulated by bradykinin, an initial mediator of inflammation. So far, many signalling molecules including the EGF receptor, PI 3 K, Src, PLCγ and Rho/Rho kinase have been implicated in the regulation of VSOR activity. However, our pharmacological studies suggest that these signals are not essential components of the swelling-induced VSOR activation mechanism even though some of these signals may play permissive or modulatory roles. Molecular identification of VSOR is required to address the question of how cells sense volume expansion and activate VSOR...|$|R
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] effects of variable periods of ischaemia on the isolated lungs of rats and rabbits, stored for up to 6 hours at 4 °C, 21 °C and 37 °C under standardized conditions, were investigated in vitro in terms of oxygen consumption, the rate of 1 - 14 C-leucine incorporation into soluble proteins, and 1 - 14 C-palmitate incorporation into total phospholipids and lipid fractions. The endogenous oxygen uptake of rat lung slices in an air phase, from tissues stored at 4 °C and 21 °C under <b>ischaemic</b> <b>conditions</b> for 6 hours and at 37 °C for 4 hours, was {{significantly different from the}} control values. The oxygen uptake of lungs from animals anaesthetized with pentobarbitone prior to exsanguination and stored for only 2 hours at 37 °C differed significantly from control values. Judged by the rate of incorporation of radiolabelled leucine into soluble proteins and that of palmitate into total lipids and phospholipids of lungs after storage for increasing periods at 4 °C and 37 °C, significant differences were already found after 1 1 / 2 hours. From this observation it would appear that these parameters are very sensitive indicators for assessing irreversible lung damage due to ischaemia. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
