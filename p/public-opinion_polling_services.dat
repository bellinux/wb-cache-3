50|$|Jimmy Carter ran as a {{reformer}} who was “untainted” by Washington political scandals, which many voters found attractive {{in the wake}} of the Watergate scandal that had led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. Ford, although personally unconnected with Watergate, was seen by many as too close to the discredited Nixon administration, especially after he granted Nixon a presidential pardon for any crimes he might have committed during his term of office. Ford's pardon of Nixon caused his popularity, as measured by <b>public-opinion</b> <b>polls,</b> to plummet. Ford’s refusal to explain his reasons for pardoning Nixon publicly (he would do so in his memoirs several years later), also hurt his image.|$|R

The findings also suggest that the intersection of ethnicity and sect shapes people's attitudes toward Turkish foreign policy in Iran and Iraq.

Initially, people expressed opinions on standards that were in line with <b>public-opinion</b> <b>polls</b> that have revealed support for standards, assessments, and accountability.

About 19 % of the respondents had visited the sites of PNE with different aims and in different periods. The majority (70 - 80 %) of the respondents believes that the PNEs, which were carried out in Yakutia in the last century, are the main source of radioactive contamination in the area of their settlements.

50|$|Since 1991 Korea has {{experienced}} a large influx of foreign workers, {{and the government has}} utilized trainee programs since 1992. About 10,000 Asian workers came to Korea under this program in 1992, and there were about 57,000 trainees in Korea in June 1996. However, the trainee program experienced problems: the trainees became undocumented workers due to a difference in wages and since they were not classified as laborers, they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law. The Employment Permit Program for foreigners (the government’s foreign-labor policy since 2004) is a product achieved by a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers. However, these issues have more details to be resolved.On the legal front, the Korean state still allows foreigners to apply for low-wage jobs and excludes them from social benefits. The social dimension of nationhood is shown by <b>public-opinion</b> <b>polls</b> of Korean citizens' attitudes towards foreign workers, which demonstrate discrimination.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{project is}} presented to describe, evaluate and investigate the megacity Seoul by several interdisciplinary and city-morphologic aspects, picking the city’s green belt out as a central element of the urban development. The closed and unique green belt is hypothesised to structure the metropolitan area of Seoul and to have especially sustainable effects on the urban development. A literature research outlines four parameters: city structure, mobility, environmental quality and urban quality. The city structures of Seoul and the planning history are described in a first step, followed by the recording of the environmental quality within the megacity region, as well as, the mobility by means of different parameters. The interpretation of these three working steps will lead, {{in conjunction with the}} results of qualitative and quantitative <b>public-opinion</b> <b>polls</b> on quality of life, to new findings {{about the importance of the}} green belt.

The scheduling algorithm for the service classes is not defined by the IEEE 802.16 standards. The scheduling algorithm must guarantee the QoS for both multimedia applications (real-time and non-real-time), while efficiently utilizing the available bandwidth.

Some of the defeated Republican district court judges were later re-appointed to vacant District Court benches by Governor Rick Perry. Republicans continue to hold all statewide offices after the 2014 elections, including all nine slots on each of the two high courts, but Harris County still has a mix of Democratic and Republican district court judges. All members of the two courts of appeals in the old Harris County Courthouse, by contrast, are Republicans. They are elected from an appellate district that includes Harris County, but also includes nine other counties that are more conservative and vote more Republican. Any generalizations about political leanings and voting patterns of the local electorate must take into consideration the geographic area/jurisdiction, and the same goes for <b>public-opinion</b> <b>polls.</b> Whether elections for local offices coincide with presidential elections or midterm elections also matters because turnout and composition of the voting segment of the electorate differ. The City of Houston, which overlaps with Harris County in part, but represents a smaller and more urban area and electorate, is even more liberal. That is why the city can elect a mayor who is not only a Democrat, but openly gay. (Mayoral elections are nominally nonpartisan).|$|R
