25|$|Suction pumps, {{a special}} device for lips uses vacuum pumping to {{increase}} {{blood pressure in}} each lip and to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> a bit, making it quite an instrument to adjust proper lip length/value in a slow determinite step-by-step way. One {{example of such a}} device is the Fullips enhancer.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} superhero {{characters}} of the Silver Age of Comic Books, The Question was more ruthless in his methods. For example, when he was fighting some criminals in a sewer and knocked them into a deep and fast moving water flow, he declined to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> despite their real danger of drowning. Instead, he left to notify the police to retrieve them in case they survived the ordeal.|$|E

25|$|Grouper {{are often}} found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They {{can be quite}} large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy {{crushing}} tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C {{perceived}} that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, [...] "When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner." [...] Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.|$|E
2500|$|In each [...] "Adventures" [...] segment {{in which}} Bill appears, he usually {{attempts}} {{to do something}} of an outdoors nature, such as backpacking, building something, chopping down a tree, or playing a sport. Each of his actions are basically slapstick comedy routinesâ€”for example, when he swings an axe, it flies {{out of his hands}} and smashes into another character or Red's Possum Van. [...] In what has become a classic occurrence, Bill often manages to knock {{one or both of the}} side mirrors off the van. He can also store large tools and miscellaneous items in his overalls, and <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> on demand. Many segments show Bill getting hurt somehow, but apparently not seriously or permanently. (One segment in particular ends with Bill's arms crushed and flattened in a grape press.) There is generally no continuity from one [...] "Adventures" [...] segment to the next, and Bill comes back in the following episode good as new.|$|E
50|$|Many gardeners still remove weeds by {{manually}} <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the ground, {{making sure}} to include the roots that would otherwise allow them to resprout.|$|R

2500|$|In {{intensive}} broiler sheds, the air {{can become}} highly polluted with ammonia from the droppings. In {{this case a}} farmer must run more fans {{to bring in more}} clean fresh air. If not this can damage the chickens' eyes and respiratory systems and can cause painful burns on their legs (called hock burns) and blisters on their feet. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high rate of leg deformities because the large breast muscles causes distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. In cases where the chickens become crippled and can't walk farmers have to go in and <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> Because they cannot move easily, the chickens are not able to adjust their environment to avoid heat, cold or dirt as they would in natural conditions. [...] The added weight and overcrowding also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs and Ascites can develop. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year. In the case of no ventilation due to power failure during a heat wave 20,000 chicken can die {{in a short period of}} time. In a good grow out a farmer should sell between 92 and 96 percent of their flock. With a 1.80 to a 2.0 feed conversion ratio. After the marking of birds the farmer must clean out and repair for another flock. A farmer should average 4 to 5 grow outs a year.|$|E

60|$|Denis {{had nothing}} more, at the moment, to say. Two or three canvases {{stood in the}} corner behind Anne's chair, their faces turned to the wall. He <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> and began {{to look at the}} paintings.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} was also born in eastern Canada. Reports from around 1820 tell of youngsters at Lake Ainslie, Nova Scotia, amusing themselves by driving sticks into the ground, <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> then lighting the escaping natural gas.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{found the}} Woozy," [...] {{explained}} the boy, [...] "and {{he agreed to}} give us the three hairs; but we couldn't <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> So we had to bring the Woozy along with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Charnock stopped him. [...] "It's those confounded posts! If we <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> we'll have to {{cut down}} to the rock to find a solid bed, and there's a mass of stone to move. What would the job cost?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, I {{know all}} that. But you can't help people, Jon; they're hopeless. When you <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> they only get into another hole. Look at them, still {{fighting}} and plotting and struggling, though they're dying in heaps all the time. Idiots!" ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Tod {{had gone}} out at the front door, and round {{to the back of}} the house. On the way, he {{stumbled}} over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any idea who was inside it he would have <b>pulled</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> quickly.|$|R
60|$|But {{there are}} some fish which would not only gratify but astonish most of us, if we could be so {{fortunate}} as to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the water. For instance, here are some fish with both their eyes {{on one side of}} their heads.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] Graham agreed. [...] "The pity is that {{he should}} find men willing to do his dirty work on very {{moderate}} pay; but there's no lack of them. There are men you can only dynamite out of the mire, because if you <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> by gentler means they crawl straight back again. It's unfortunate, because you meet some with a few likable qualities; I think our new packer is one of these." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hand me up four of them, Tom; I did {{not know}} how much I wanted a change of food till my eyes lit on those beauties. We saw you <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> but I did not expect {{it was going to be}} as good as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You're {{welcome to}} a dozen quills, if that's what you want; but you'll have to get Bunny to <b>pull</b> <b>'em</b> <b>out,</b> for I can't do it,' and Jimmy looked around {{at me as if}} expecting I was going to thrust my paws among all those sharp-pointed toothpicks.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{under the}} wagon sheet, boys," [...] he said. [...] "I know what you're waiting for. If Sam lets it run out again we'll use those yellow shoes of his for a target. There's two cases. <b>Pull</b> <b>'em</b> <b>out</b> and light up. I know you all want a smoke." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor and}} Mrs. Merriam now joined them, {{for the latter}} was an expert on shoes and had no mind to miss the outing.

6000|$|... 'I'll {{pull him}} through,' the Squire said grimly, {{as though he}} meant to pull him through a threshing-mill; 'I'll save him from this gang; God help him with the next!

Let us pray he'll take the lesson,' he added more gravely, 'but youth is here to make troubles, and age to <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> again.' ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{as the boy}} {{made his}} first step forward, the Blue Wolf sprang upon him with its {{enormous}} jaws stretched wide open. Button-Bright jammed the sofa-pillow into the brute's mouth and crowded it in {{as hard as he}} could. The terrible teeth came together and buried themselves in the pillow, and then Mr. Wolf found he could not <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> again--because his mouth was stuffed full. He could not even growl or yelp, but rolled upon the floor trying in vain to release himself from the conquering pillow.|$|E
60|$|He was correct, Evelyn {{moved forward}} a pace or two, {{and then stopped}} with the skirt she had {{gathered}} up brushing the quivering emerald moss, and her boots, which were high ones, hidden in the latter.

50|$|Bikini waxing is {{the removal}} of pubic hair using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and <b>pulls</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip.
