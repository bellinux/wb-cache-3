5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the <b>protein</b> synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether <b>protein</b> synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the <b>protein</b> synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of <b>protein</b> synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing <b>protein</b> synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local <b>protein</b> synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E

For instance, inserting calmodulin into green fluorescent <b>protein</b> (GFP) allowed researchers {{to measure the}} activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP.

50|$|The <b>proteins</b> {{that make}} up the {{remaining}} 20% of the fraction of <b>proteins</b> in cream are known as whey <b>proteins.</b> Whey <b>proteins</b> are also widely referred to as serum <b>proteins,</b> which is used when the casein <b>proteins</b> have been precipitated out of solution. The two main components of whey <b>proteins</b> in milk are β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin. The remaining whey <b>proteins</b> in milk are; immunoglobulins, bovine serum albumin, and enzymes such as lysozyme. Whey <b>proteins</b> are much more water-soluble than casein <b>proteins.</b> The main biological function of β-lactoglobulin in milk is to serve as a way to transfer vitamin A, and the main biological function of α-lactalbumin in lactose synthesis. The whey <b>proteins</b> are very resistant against acids and proteolytic enzymes. However whey <b>proteins</b> are heat sensitive <b>proteins,</b> the heating of milk will cause the denaturation of the whey <b>proteins.</b> The denaturation of these <b>proteins</b> happens in two steps. The structures of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin unfold, and then the second step is the aggregation of the <b>proteins</b> within milk. This {{is one of the main}} factors that allows whey <b>proteins</b> to have such good emulsifying properties. Native whey <b>proteins</b> are also known for their good whupping properties, and in milk products as described above their gelling properties. Upon denaturation of whey <b>proteins,</b> there is an increase in the water holding capacity of the product.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} of animal cells, many membrane-spanning <b>proteins</b> exhibit lower lateral mobilities than glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -linked <b>proteins.</b> To {{determine if the}} GPI linkage was {{a major determinant of}} the high lateral mobility of these <b>proteins,</b> we measured the lateral diffusion of chimeric membrane <b>proteins</b> composed of normally transmembrane <b>proteins</b> that were converted to GPIlinked <b>proteins,</b> or GPI-linked <b>proteins</b> that were converted to membrane-spanning <b>proteins.</b> These studies indicate that GPI linkage contributes only marginally (approximately twofold) to the higher mobility of sev-eral GPI-linked <b>proteins.</b> The major determinant of the high mobility of these <b>proteins</b> resides instead in the extracellular domain.

5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a <b>protein</b> with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a <b>protein</b> with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the <b>protein</b> was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this <b>protein</b> design method. This type of <b>protein</b> design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of <b>protein</b> synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription and <b>protein</b> synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon <b>protein</b> synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and <b>protein</b> synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the major}} {{distributed}} computing projects involved in <b>protein</b> research, Folding@home {{is the only one}} not using the BOINC platform. Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study <b>protein</b> misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models to understand how and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of <b>protein</b> folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computing <b>protein</b> design and predicting <b>protein</b> structure and docking.|$|E
40|$|The {{secretions}} of the Sertoli cell {{were examined}} with two polyvalent antisera [...] one prepared against <b>proteins</b> in rat serum {{and the other}} against testis-specific <b>proteins</b> in rete testis fluid. These antisera detected 12 serum and 9 testis-specific <b>proteins</b> in rete testis fluid. To determine the origin of these <b>proteins,</b> primary cultures enriched in Sertoli cells were incubated with [35 S]methionine, and the radiolabeled <b>proteins</b> in the medium were immunoprecipitated. Gel electrophoresis of the two immunoprecipitates resolved eight serum and nine testis-specific <b>proteins.</b> These two sets of <b>proteins</b> were specifically bound to their respective antiserum and were immunologically distinct. Medium from Sertoli cell cultures contained 10 times more of the testis-specific <b>proteins</b> than did cultures enriched for testicular myoid or interstitial cells. The concentration of the serum <b>proteins</b> in Sertoli cell medium was 5 and 10 times greater, respectively, than in myoid or interstitial cell preparations. The <b>proteins</b> from Sertoli cells were next characterized on two-dimensional gels. Seven of the <b>proteins</b> recognized by antiserum against serum <b>proteins</b> had identical molecular weights and isoelectric points as serum <b>proteins.</b> Three of these <b>proteins</b> were ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and glycoprotein 2. In addition to the <b>proteins</b> immunoprecipitated by the two antisera, more than 60 other <b>proteins</b> were detected on two-dimensional gels of the total secretory <b>proteins.</b> We conclude that the Sertoli cell secretes many <b>proteins,</b> {{some of which are}} specific to the testis and others of which are similar to serum <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local <b>protein</b> synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local <b>protein</b> synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global <b>protein</b> synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local <b>protein</b> synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global <b>protein</b> synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global <b>protein</b> synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E

Little {{is known about the}} <b>proteins</b> of ISKNV virions. In this study, a total of 38 ISKNV virion-associated <b>proteins</b> were identified by four different workflows with systematic and comprehensive proteomic approaches. Among the 38 identified <b>proteins,</b> 21 <b>proteins</b> were identified by the gel-based workflows (one-dimensional [1 -D] and two-dimensional [2 -D] gel electrophoresis). Fifteen <b>proteins</b> were identified by 1 -D gel electrophoresis, and 16 <b>proteins</b> were identified by 2 -D gel electrophoresis, with 10 <b>proteins</b> identified by both methods. Another 17 <b>proteins</b> were identified only by liquid chromatography (LC) -based workflows (LC–matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization [MALDI] and linear trap quadrupole [LTQ]-Orbitrap).
