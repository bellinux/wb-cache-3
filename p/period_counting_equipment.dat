40|$|We {{present a}} new method to {{determine}} 226 Ra in aqueous environmental samples, {{based on the}} rate of ingrowth of 222 Rn from 226 Ra, using the radium delayed coincidence counter (RaDeCC).

In contrast to methods published earlier, the approach does not require a modification of the <b>counting</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>counting</b> separately for 226 Ra, or waiting for radioactive equilibrium. We show that the calibration works from as low as 10 dpm (0. 166 Bq) per sample, up to more than 1000 dpm (16. 7 Bq). Although uncertainties are larger (typically around 10 %) than reported uncertainties for γ counting, liquid scintillation, or mass spectrometry at comparable activities, the simple setup, low cost, and robustness of the method make it a useful approach for underway measurements, combi- nations with short-lived radium isotopes, or monitoring purposes when limited funding or infrastructure is available...|$|R

The excellent light yield and transmission properties of the (Dioxan + PPO + POPOP + Naphtalene + TOPO) liquid scintillator allow the use of conventional <b>counting</b> <b>equipment</b> as normally used with ZnS and NaJ scintillation crystals. With such <b>equipment</b> <b>counting</b> plateaus with a slope of less than 0. 1 % per 100 V over the best range are readily obtained.

The scintillator mixes with samples of aqueous Pu-solutions containing considerable quantities of salts and with samples of organic Pu-solutions containing organic complexing agents of low volatility. Both these types of samples cause difficulti for counting plate techniques due to self-absorption.
