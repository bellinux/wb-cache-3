50|$|In {{order to}} access the natural gas trapped by shale, {{vertical}} drilling is used to puncture deep boreholes to access deeply buried shale deposits. As the casings are cemented in place, horizontal drilling starts {{to access the}} production zone. Once <b>production</b> <b>casing</b> is in place and punctured where fracking will occur, fluids are pumped in at high pressures to release the shale gas by fracturing the solid formations trapping it. This process {{requires the use of}} different chemicals and large quantities of water. The composition of the fluid used during the fracturing process is different for every location.|$|E

50|$|When a {{hydrocarbon}} well is hydraulically fractured, {{this is done}} through a production packer (seal), through the drill pipe or tubing. Fluids are circulated down the tubing, to below {{the point where the}} packer is sealed against the <b>production</b> <b>casing.</b> Pressure is then be applied only that part of the casing below the packer. The rest of the well casing will not experience any increase in pressure due to the sealing of the packer. The surface casings do not experience the great pressures experienced at the production zone. This means the stresses on a surface casing are no greater than on a normal oil or gas well. Smaller diameter pipes can sustain much larger pressures than large diameter pipes.|$|E
5000|$|Nuclear logging was {{initially}} developed {{to measure the}} natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations. However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with nuclear particles. The gamma ray log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI neutron log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display {{a higher level of}} gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with <b>production</b> <b>casing).</b> WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells. During World War II, the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on open-hole logging to Schlumberger, and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to Lane-Wells.

50|$|Lyco drilled {{the first}} {{horizontal}} {{well in the}} field, the Burning Tree State #36-10 in late 1999, as the oil price moved upwards toward $20 per barrel. Although designed as a 3,000 foot lateral, the well was terminated early due to hole stability issues. <b>Production</b> <b>casing</b> was run to bottom and cemented, then perforated in three intervals over the roughly 1,000 foot lateral; at the toe, the middle and the heel. The well flowed oil immediately, at 196 barrels per day, and continued flowing for several months. Finally, the well was fracced, with {{a substantial increase in}} production. Lyco then began a continuous drilling program, progressing to 3 rigs and beyond. Headington, another oil company in the area that happened to own leases, began a drilling program also, followed by Continental and others who rushed in to take lease positions on this new, hot play.|$|E

5000|$|Gas wells on {{the site}} are old, and have {{required}} considerable maintenance in recent years. Of 229 storage wells {{on the site}}, half were more than 57 years old as of July 2014. [...] Casing, tubing, and wellhead leaks have occurred in recent years. For example, in 2013, two wells were found with casing leaks, four with tubing leaks, and two with leaks at the wellhead.

5000|$|Volume II of {{the report}} cited above {{contains}} {{the report of the}} Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). [...] That volume states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of acement barrier in the <b>production</b> <b>casing</b> string, a high‐strength steel pipe set in a well to ensure well integrity and to allow future production. The failure of the cement barrier allowed hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‐minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform. BP, as the designated operator under BOEMRE regulations, was ultimately responsible for conducting operations at Macondo in a way thatensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment. Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon, was responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel on board. Halliburton, as a contractor to BP, was responsible for conducting the cement job, and, through its subsidiary (Sperry Sun), had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well.|$|E
5000|$|Deepwater Horizon was a {{floating}} semi-submersible drilling unit — a fifth-generation, ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, column-stabilized drilling rig owned by Transocean and built in South Korea. The platform was 396 ft long and 256 ft wide and could operate in waters up to 8000 ft deep, {{to a maximum}} drill depth of 30000 ft. Press releases from Transocean state the platform had historically been used for deeper wells, including the deepest underwater gas and oil well in history at 35055 ft in 2009. [...] The $560 million platform was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and completed in 2001. It was owned by Transocean, operated under the Marshalese flag of convenience, and was under lease to BP until September 2013. At {{the time of the}} explosion, the Deepwater Horizon was on Mississippi Canyon Block 252, referred to as the Macondo Prospect, in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 41 mi off the Louisiana coast. In March 2008, the mineral rights to drill for oil on the Macondo Prospect were purchased by BP at the Minerals Management Service's lease sale. The platform commenced drilling in February 2010 at a water depth of approximately 5000 ft. At the time of the explosion the rig was drilling an exploratory well. [...] The planned well was to be drilled to 18360 ft below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer. <b>Production</b> <b>casing</b> was being run and cemented {{at the time of the}} accident.

5000|$|During World War II, {{portions}} of the [...] "Car Shops", as they {{had to come to}} be known, were converted over to wartime production, including the <b>production</b> of bomb <b>casings.</b> Around 1939, a portion of the car shops was purchased by Precision Engineering, which originally built components for locomotives.

25|$|After the war, {{the company}} {{returned}} to the manufacture of goods it had produced before the war and added production of vacuum flasks to replace the <b>production</b> of shell <b>casings.</b> Sales dropped to pre-war levels. The worldwide economic crisis and the situation in Germany affected HASAG as well, as workers continually found their remuneration to be inadequate. By 1930, HASAG had 1,000 employees and annual sales of 5 million Reichsmarks, {{but this was a}} drop from previous levels. In October 1931, the company reported that sales were down nearly 15 percent and the company's value had dropped by nearly 30 percent.

5000|$|On 8 September, BP {{released}} a 193-page report on its web site. The report identified 8 key findings {{with respect to}} the cause of the accident. 1) The day before the accident, cement had been poured to fill the gap between the borehole (the actual hole in the ground) and the casing (the outermost pipe), and this cement failed and oil moved into that space from the reservoir. 2) Oil then entered the <b>production</b> <b>casing</b> (an inner pipe) although two barriers (one made of cement called a [...] "shoe track") were supposed to prevent this. 3) A test was conducted as to whether the well was sealed (a negative pressure test), conducted by temporarily replacing heavy drilling mud with lighter seawater. This is controlled unbalancing of the well. The test was considered successful, although it was not, since oil was actually moving out of the reservoir. The report names the Transocean rig crew and the BP staff on hand as having made this error. 4) When the test was completed, the seawater was replaced with mud, stopping the flow. But later, when preparing to temporarily shut down the well, mud was again replaced with seawater, allowing oil to flow up the riser toward the rig. This flow was detected by pressure sensors on the rig. The report blames the rig crew for missing the increased pressure readings. 5) When the flow was noticed, the crew activated the blowout preventer and diverted the oil to a mud separation system rather than diverting it into the ocean; diverting it into the ocean may have spared much of the damage. 6) The design of the mud separation system allowed the oil to keep coming and gas carried by the oil to be vented onto the rig. 7) The venting system allowed the gas to move into areas of the rig where it would be in contact with electrical equipment. 8) The blowout preventer failed in several ways; controls on the rig were disabled by the explosion; an automatic shutoff system within the blowout preventer failed, probably due to failure of two components - a solenoid and battery; when a submersible was able to activate a blind shear within the blowout preventer, the blind shear functioned but failed to seal the well. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed [...] "BP's fatally flawed well design." ...|$|E
30|$|First item in {{the design}} steps is to {{determine}} the outside diameter of <b>production</b> <b>casing.</b> This parameter is fixed to 5.5 in. which is commonly used in Marcellus shale gas well production. The sizes of the four other casings can be determined based {{on the size of the}} <b>production</b> <b>casing.</b> The outside diameter of the coupling used on <b>production</b> <b>casing</b> is 6.05 in. As discussed earlier, the surface subsidence in coal mine area can cause large vertical and horizontal ground displacement. In this case, the horizontal displacement would cause the bending effect on the casings, which will be discussed later. As for other casing’s annular space, the Pennsylvania Code requires that all permanent casing be surrounded by a minimum of 25  mm (1 inch) of grout at the entire length of casing. Therefore according to the cementing tables of Halliburton and design code of wellbores in Pennsylvania, one can determine the sizes of other casings and couplings. After the casing size is determined, the corresponding bit size can be selected using the bit size table in Fig.  6. Figure  8 shows the schematic view of the designed casings.|$|E

5000|$|The {{equipment}} {{associated with}} a rig is to some extent dependent {{on the type of}} rig but (#23 & #24) are devices installed at the wellhead to prevent fluids and gases from unintentionally escaping from the borehole. #23 is the annular (often referred to as the [...] "Hydril", which is one manufacturer) and #24 is the pipe rams and blind rams. In the place of #24 Variable bore rams or VBRs can be used. These offer the same pressure and sealing capacity found in standard pipe rams, while offering the versatility of sealing on various sizes of drill pipe, <b>production</b> tubing and <b>casing</b> without changing standard pipe rams. Normally VBRs are used when utilizing a tapered drill string (when different size drill pipe is used in the complete drill string).|$|R
30|$|The {{performed}} experiments mimic field {{observations from}} the geothermal research site Groß Schönebeck, where fluid–casing–rock interactions were {{assumed to be}} responsible for clogging the pores of the reservoir rock near the <b>production</b> well <b>casing.</b> To find evidence for this hypothesis, simplified experiments were conducted and the effects of oxygen, salinity, temperature, and type of steel on the reactions were determined. The type of steel was found to have the largest effect on the electrochemical corrosion at geothermal conditions. If the type of steel is nobler as compared to copper, the electrochemical reaction is prevented. However, in geothermal wells, the material of choice for application as casing material is carbon steel and therefore a reaction with Cu can be expected if the fluid contains dissolved Cu. The effect of dissolved oxygen in solution is also rather large. However, since in a natural deep geothermal system, hardly any dissolved oxygen occurs, this parameter is of more relevance in either more shallow reservoirs or when air is pumped into a geothermal well for example during a lift-test. Usually, temperature, pressure, and salinity at depth are the factors that predominantly control the investigated electrochemical reaction. It was shown that due to chloride complex formation of Cu and Fe, electrochemical reaction rates are lower in highly saline solutions. The effect of temperature differs depending of the type of saturated/precipitating Cu mineral.|$|R
