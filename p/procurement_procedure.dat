The purpose of this investigation is to increase the understanding of how <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> affect project performance. A procurement model including eight hypotheses is first developed {{on the basis of a}} literature review and then tested through multivariate statistical techniques based on empirical data collected through a survey investigation of 106 Swedish construction clients. The results of hierarchical regression analyses show that cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> positively affect collaboration among project actors and that collaboration in turn have positive effects on project performance. In general, however, cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> do not have direct effects on project performance. Godkänd; 2009; 20091005 (andwan...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the implementation of <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the King William’s Town Education District. In spite of {{the provisions of the}} Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996 and Public Finance Management Act No 1 of 1999 (PFMA), in respect of the provision of services, procurement in the King William’s Town Education District is flawed. The study explored the legislative framework governing <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the District, the extent of compliance and non compliance with <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> and the causes of flawed <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> A descriptive case study was used to describe, analyse and interpret a particular phenomenon, in this case the <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the King William’s Town Education District. Purposive sampling was chosen for this study to create an understanding of the research problem, and to complement the case study method in eliminating any potential bias in the data. Respondents included mainly the managers in the District, who are instrumental in the implementation of procurement processes in the District. Self administered interviewing schedules were used for respondents to answer without the assistance of the researcher. The study found out that the District was lagging behind in respect of compliance to <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> monitoring and evaluation, and accountability. Based on the above findings, the study recommended the following: (a) strengthening accountability in all managers and public servants, (b) professional training and education of personnel and managers {{in order to be able}} to implement procurement processes, (c) establishment of compliance office, (d) introduction of complaints mechanisms, and (e) effecting monitoring and control mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative arrangements, such as partnering, have {{received}} {{increased interest in}} recent years. Several studies show however that cooperative relationships are not easily achieved in construction. Implementation of cooperative relationships requires changes in several elements of the traditional <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is therefore to propose and test a sequential model regarding clients' cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> We especially ask: what elements in clients' <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> facilitate the establishment of cooperation and trust in their relationships with contractors? The model was tested through structural equation modelling. The empirical data required for the test were collected through a survey responded to by 87 Swedish professional construction clients. The empirical results show that cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> are triggered by clients' wish to involve contractors early in specification, which has a simultaneous effect on procedures regarding bid invitation and compensation. Furthermore, these simultaneous effects breed a certain kind of partner selection based on task-related attributes, which also has a direct positive effect on trust and above all on cooperation in client-contractor relationships. Besides these implications from the model, the improvement of measurements for future modelling is discussed. Cooperation, partnering, procurement, SEM,...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Public <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> {{provide a}} crucial {{function}} {{in the public sector}} and often involve making decisions of far-reaching effects. Recent years have seen much debate about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using open procedures as the main legal vehicle for public procurement. Investigating public <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> as decision making processes could provide insights about the nature of various types of procedures. This paper provides findings regarding the difficulties decision makers face when running open procedures. The investigation includes cases of Hungarian public procurement projects run by both private and public contracting authorities according to the EU-conform Hungarian Act on Public Procurement...|$|R

This final section of the fence completely seals off Bulgarian border with Turkey. As of March 2016, nearly 100 km of the 166 km planned barrier were constructed.

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how a client&# 039;s cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> influence subcontractor involvement, value creation, and innovation in the construction of complex facilities. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical data were collected through interviews, surveys and participation in workshops during a longitudinal action research case study. The case project was located in Sweden and concerned the construction of plant facilities for manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. Findings - The case study findings reveal that the client&# 039;s <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> affect the level of subcontractor involvement and integration, but that this does not necessarily result in increased subcontractor value creation and innovation in the construction process. Research limitations/implications - Since the empirical results are based on data collected from only one case project, the possibilities for generalisations are limited. Practical implications - Clients&# 039; <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> heavily affect subcontractor involvement, but in order to increase subcontractor contributions to innovation and value creation the actors should adopt a long-term perspective and actively work to establish an innovation-friendly climate. Originality/value - This paper focuses on the often-neglected importance of subcontractors and their contributions to innovation and value creation...|$|R
