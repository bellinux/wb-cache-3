Consideration in the gravel pack design requires that the particle size is {{five or six times}} the formation sand depending on the formation sand median diameter. Sieve analysis result shows that the grain sizes of sand and gravel of the Ethiope River sediments fall within the size range (0. 378 - 12. 0 mm) recommended for a gravel pack by the American Petroleum Institute. Acid solubility test on the gravel and sand gives desirable results as the maximum solubility of 1. 0 % required for gavel pack is not exceeded. The sphericity and roundness of the particle grains range from 0. 70 - 0. 68 and 0. 70 - 0. 67 respectively, which is within the range (0. 6) allowed for gravel pack.

50|$|Up until now, {{the focus}} has been mostly on the {{structure}} of the ice itself; the particles are almost an afterthought to the templating process but in fact, the particles can and do play a significant role during freeze-casting. It turns out that particle arrangement also changes {{as a function of the}} freezing conditions. For example, researchers have shown that freezing velocity has a marked effect on wall roughness. Faster freezing rates produce rougher walls since particles are given insufficient time to rearrange. This could be of use when developing permeable gas transfer membranes where tortuosity and roughness could impede gas flow. It also turns out that z- and r-crystals do not interact with ceramic particles in the same way. The z-crystals pack particles in the x-y plane while r-crystals pack particles primarily in the z-direction. R-crystals actually pack particles more efficiently than z-crystals and because of this, the area fraction of the particle-rich phase (1 - area fraction of ice crystals) changes as the crystal population shifts from a mixture of z- and r-crystals to only z-crystals. Starting from where ice crystals first begin to exclude particles, marking the beginning of the transition zone, we have a majority of r-crystals and a high value for the particle- rich phase fraction. We can assume that because the solidification speed is still rapid that the particles will not be packed efficiently. As the solidification rate slows down, however, the area fraction of the particle-rich phase drops indicating an increase in <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> At the same time, the competitive growth process is taking place, replacing r-crystals with z-crystals. At a certain point nearing the end of the transition zone, the particle-rich phase fraction rises sharply since z-crystals are less efficient at packing particles than r-crystals. The apex of this curve marks the point where only z-crystals are present (SSZ). During steady-state growth, after the maximum particle-rich phase fraction is reached, the efficiency of packing increases as steady-state is achieved. In 2011, researchers at Yale University set out to probe the actual spatial packing of particles within the walls. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) they characterized the particle size, shape and interparticle spacing of nominally 32 nm silica suspensions that had been freeze-cast at different speeds. Computer simulations indicated that for this system, the particles within the walls should not be touching but rather separated from one another by thin films of ice. Testing however revealed that the particles were, in fact, touching and more than that, they attained a packed morphology that cannot be explained by typical equilibrium densification processes.|$|E

40|$|Changes {{in protein}} {{conformation}} play key roles in facilitating various biochemical processes, ranging from signaling and phosphorylation to transport and catalysis. While various factors that drive these motions such as environmental changes and binding of small molecules are well understood, specific causative {{effects on the}} structural features of the protein due to these conformational changes have not been studied on a large scale. Here, we study protein conformational changes in relation to two key structural metrics: <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and disorder. Packing {{has been shown to}} be crucial for protein stability and function by many protein design and engineering studies. We study changes in <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency</b> during conformational changes, thus extending the analysis from a static context to a dynamic perspective and report some interesting observations. First, we study various proteins that adopt alternate conformations and find that tendencies to show motion and change in <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency</b> are correlated: residues that change their <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency</b> show larger motions. Second, our results suggest that residues that show higher changes in packing during motion are located on the changing interfaces which are formed during these conformational changes. These changing interfaces are slightly different from shear or static interfaces that have been analyzed in previous studies. Third, analysis of <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency</b> changes in the context of secondary structure shows that, as expected, residues buried in helices show the least change in <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency,</b> whereas those embedded in bends are most likely to change packing. Finally, by relating protein disorder to motions, we show that marginally disordered residues which are ordered enough to be crystallized but have sequence patterns indicative of disorder show higher dislocation and a higher change in packing than ordered ones and are located mostly on the changing interfaces. Overall, our results demonstrate that between the two conformations, the cores of the proteins remain mostly intact, whereas the interfaces display the most elasticity, both in terms of disorder and change in <b>packing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> By doing a variety of tests, we also show that our observations are robust to the solvation state of the proteins...|$|E

40|$|Gravel packing is a {{well-known}} method in sand control where stabilizing the formation with gravel prevents the production of formation sand. Longer and more complex completion operations are making the business of completing wells continually changing with new challenges, new technology and new methods. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the gravel placement in nearly vertical openhole systems with blank pipe sections between the screens. In vertical openhole completions with long blank pipe sections slurry and gravel settling regimes will occur differently compared to a conventional gravel pack operation without blank pipe sections. The {{reason for this is}} when a lower screen section is packed with gravel and the overlying section is with blank pipe, the carrier fluid can no longer flow through the lower screen. The gravel in the blank pipe sections is mainly settling due to gravitational forces and therefore displaces the carrier fluid, which flows upwards to the upper screen section. By simulating gravel pack operations with blank pipe sections in Halliburton’s laboratory scale model in Tananger it has recently been shown (with continuous pumping) that with a higher inclination on the well (less vertical), a better packing is achieved in the blank pipe section; a higher gravel <b>pack</b> <b>efficiency</b> is achieved. By analyzing and calculating theoretically how the gravel settles with regards to physical laws in fluid dynamics will give a better view on how to optimize the packing of gravel in the blank pipe sections in nearly vertical wells. How to optimize the packing in these blank pipe sections without the use of extensive expensive rig-time was one of several challenges that had {{to be taken into account}} during the work with this thesis.

The slaughter and processing costs were lower for plants with higher volumes of AMA cattle relative to cash market cattle. Plants that slaughter cattle from AMA sources operated at higher volumes, had less variable volumes, and had lower average total costs per head because of the substantive economies of size.
