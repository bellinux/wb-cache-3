In order to improve performance, the problems of segmentation and tracking of the structure of interest are dealt with simultaneously by introducing the notion of time in the process and looking for a solution that satisfies that prior constraints while being consistent along consecutive frames.

40|$|Abstract: A {{strategy}} for collision avoidance between several moving robots {{that are not}} in possession of each other’s plans is presented here. A robot’s awareness of other robots is limited to the knowledge of their current states represented by their present and impending velocities and their motion direction. A robot is aware of the presence of other robots when they fall within its field of vision. Collision avoidance is attempted at three levels namely at individual, cooperative and propagation levels through velocity control. At individual level it suffices that one of the robots involved in a forthcoming collision modifies its velocity. The cooperative level is characterized by the requirement that all the robots involved in collision modify their velocities in a synchronized fashion. In the third level robots not involved in a collision are entailed to participate by altering their velocities in a manner that resolves collision conflicts between the robots involved. The third level is termed as the <b>propagation</b> <b>level</b> since the collision conflict is propagated to robots {{not a part of the}} conflict and their assistance sought in avoiding conflicts. The strategy is implemented in a distributed fashion across all robots in the system. Simulation results are presented to authenticate the efficacy of the proposed method. I...|$|E

In the quantitative analysis of the cortex from MR images, extracting the structure and obtaining a representation for various measurements are key steps. While manual segmentation is tedious and labor intensive, automatic reliable efficient segmentation and measurement of the cortex remain challenging problems, due to its convoluted nature. Here we present a new approach of coupled-surfaces propagation, using level set methods to address such problems. Our method is motivated by the nearly constant thickness of the cortical mantle and takes this tight coupling as an important constraint. By evolving two embedded surfaces simultaneously, each driven by its own image-derived information while maintaining the coupling, a final representation of the cortical bounding surfaces and an automatic segmentation of the cortex are achieved. Char-acteristics of the cortex, such as cortical surface area, surface curvature, and cortical thickness, are then evaluated. The level set implementation of surface propagation offers the advantage of easy initialization, computational efficiency, {{and the ability to}} capture deep sulcal folds.

This approach has led to the increasing development of multi-agent and activity-oriented modeling.

In this respect, we propose an activity-based predictive dynamic traffic assignment model based on a multi-agent approach with two interacting levels: the travelers ’ adaptive reaction level and the network <b>propagation</b> <b>level.</b> For the first level, traffic conditions change according to travelers ’ departure time/route/destination choices, dynamic traffic information and network supply constraints.

This algorithm focuses on how to provide dynamic on-route information and off-route information to guide travelers to make the best travel decision in a dynamic environment.

40|$|International audienceA Cohesive zone model (CZM) is {{developed}} for simulating the thermo-mechanical fatigue of solders in electronic chip packages subjected to active power cycling. Repeated on-off switching {{of the device}} {{is the source of}} thermal strains, resulting in the initiation and the propagation of a fatigue crack in the solder joint. The fatigue failure in the solder material may cause local intensification of the temperature gradient due to partial or total degradation of the thermal conductance in the cracked region. In this paper, the coupling between fatigue cracking and crack heat transfer is accounted for by using a thermo-mechanically coupled cohesive zone element. Thus, the quantity of heat flux transferred across the interface will be dependent on the degradation level of the interface thermal conductance. Typically, the cohesive zone conductance is taken {{as a function of the}} separation between the cohesive surfaces, meaning that the thermal conductance can be restored across the interface during crack closure. It may alternately be chosen as being dependent on the damage's level of the cohesive zone element, describing in this way an irreversible thermal degradation in the solder joint. Simulations are carried out in order to analyze and predict the solder fatigue under active power cyclic loading. The numerical results reproduce qualitatively the desired behavior for the cracked interface and demonstrate how the temperature field and the heat transfer in the system are radically changed.

This work is based on a data set of Sina Weibo which contains 80. 8 million users' profiles and 7. 2 billion relations and a large data set of Twitter. Firstly some basic features of Sina Weibo and Twitter are analyzed such as degree and activeness distribution, correlation between degree and activeness, and the degree of separation. Then the following preference is investigated by studying the assortative mixing, friend similarities, following distribution, edge balance ratio, and ranking correlation, where edge balance ratio is newly proposed to measure balance property of graphs. It is found that Sina Weibo has a lower reciprocity rate, more positive balanced relations and is more disassortative. Coinciding with Asian traditional culture, the following preference of Sina Weibo users is more concentrated and hierarchical: they are more likely to follow people at higher or the same social levels and less likely to follow people lower than themselves.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{introduces}} value precedence on integer and set sequences. A useful {{application of}} the notion is in breaking symmetries of indistinguishable values, an important class of symmetries in practice. Although value precedence can be expressed straightforwardly using if-then constraints in existing constraint programming systems, the resulting formulation is inefficient {{both in terms of}} size and runtime. We present two propagation algorithms for implementing global constraints on value precedence in the integer and set domains. Besides conducting experiments to verify the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal, we characterize also the <b>propagation</b> <b>level</b> attained by various usages of the global constraints as well as the conditions when the constraints can be used consistently with other types of symmetry breaking constraints. 1 Introduction Symmetry is a beauty in nature, but a curse to solving algorithms of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). This paper concerns an important class of symmetries, namely those induced by indistinguishable values, examples of which include colors in graph coloring problems and personnels of the same rank in many rostering problems. We introduce the notion of value precedence on sequences, and explain how imposing value precedence on a sequence of constrained variables can break symmetries of indistinguishable values in both integer and set domains. The value precedence condition on a sequence of variables is easy to express using if-then constraints, but such a formulation is inefficient both in terms of number of constraints and propagation efficiency. We propose linear time propagation algorithms for maintaining value precedence as the basis of efficient implementation of two global constraints on integer and set variable sequences respectively. Experimental results on three benchmarks confirm the efficiency of our proposal. In addition, we give theoretical results to (a) ensure consistent use of the constraint with other symmetry breaking constraints and (b) characterize the consistency level attained by various usages of the global constraints...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{partial discharge}} (PD) propagation within a high voltage transformer winding. Location of PDs and magnitude estimation are important tools for both diagnosis and prognosis {{of the health}} of large transformers. In reality there is limited access and knowledge of a winding and consequently any practical method {{requires the use of}} estimation techniques. The approach taken in this thesis is by considering lumped circuit parameter models. Firstly, a lumped capacitive parameter model was considered and secondly a transmission line lumped parameter approach developed. A technique of split winding analysis is introduced for both types of model. The derivation of the capacitive network considers the source location of a PD by defining the PD signal propagation in two directions. At the source, the currents are equal in magnitude and are attenuated as they flow in each direction. This provides information for a fixed distribution model equation. Under transmission line lumped parameter models, split winding analysis explains the development of accumulated harmonic waveforms of the PD propagation signal towards the neutral and bushing tap-point. At the source, a D’Alembert solution is employed to estimate the oscillation level and found to be in very good agreement with measured data using rectangular wave signal injection. PD signal behaviour is then considered using a time varying boundary conditions model with a principle of superposition equation of source signal. Duhamel’s principle is employed to find a solution for any waveform applied to some point on the transformer winding. Under the influence of losses and distortion, an accumulated harmonic amplitude analysis from the Duhamel’s principle estimates the PD <b>propagation</b> <b>level.</b> For different injection points along the transformer winding, the measured PD level at the neutral and bushing tap point caused by the accumulated harmonic amplitude reveals different patterns. As the PD injection point is altered from the bushing tap point to the neutral, the measured signals significantly change. This in turn contains information of the level of discharge signal at the source. From this analysis a technique based on minimum mean error (MME) calculation using the measurements at the bushing tap and neutral points can be used to identify the source location of PDs based on the analysis of accumulated harmonic amplitudes. With a known location, the information can then be used to estimate PD levels. As the actual charge transferred at the location of a partial discharge cannot be measured directly, by using the D’Alembert solution, the PD source level is found to have approximately twice the apparent magnitude. By using the predominantly capacitive model derived based on split current propagation, PD estimation at higher frequencies is also possible. As a result, an estimation of PD level can be estimated for measurement signals having bandwidth of up to 150 MHz. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

By evolving two embedded surfaces simultaneously, each driven by its own image-derived information while maintaining the coupling, a final representation of the cortical bounding surfaces and an automa [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Deformable {{surfaces}} {{have been}} successfully used for modeling 3 -D objects. However, {{they have not been}} able to model multi-object scenes or objects with holes. In the paper, we propose a new method of modeling objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on wavefront <b>propagation.</b> Differing from <b>level</b> set modeling methods, we do not require repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions, and hence the method is computationally efficient. The method has been applied in several experiments using range data, and the results are reported in the paper. ...|$|R
