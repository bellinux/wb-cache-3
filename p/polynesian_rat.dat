5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat.</b> The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{native land}} mammals, {{but there are}} native insects, land crabs, and birds, {{including}} the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat,</b> cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat).</b> Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E
50|$|A {{survey of}} Orona {{carried out in}} 2006 did not detect rats. However, in 2009 <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> were located on the island, {{as well as more}} than 20 cats.|$|R
50|$|Raratoka Island {{is used as}} {{an island}} sanctuary, with the Department of Conservation {{releasing}} 15 captive bred birds in 2006 after eradicating the population of <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats.</b> The island contains a lighthouse and a small airstrip.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{extinction}} {{is not well}} established, but it was likely hunted for meat, and its bones and feathers were used in old style art. It may have also have been attacked by <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> that were introduced by the natives by accident.|$|R
5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Flightless birds that had {{previously}} known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had {{a major impact on}} the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rat</b> (Rattus exulans).|$|E
5|$|The tuatara Sphenodon punctatus {{has been}} {{protected}} by law since 1895. A second species, S. guntheri, was recognised in 1989 but since 2009 {{it has been}} reclassified as a subspecies. Tuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, such as the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus exulans). They were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Sanctuary in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a <b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rat</b> (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{extinction}} {{is not very}} well known, but we can speculate that it was hunted for meat, and that its bones and feathers were used for decoration. It may have also have been attacked by the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> that were introduced by early settlers.|$|R
5000|$|The island {{boasts a}} large colony of sooty terns, {{estimated}} at 1.5 million pairs, together with <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats,</b> feral cats, green turtles, and around fifteen {{other species of}} seabirds. [...] Other accounts estimate the sooty tern population to {{be as high as}} three to six million birds.|$|R
25|$|The Austronesian Polynesians, {{who first}} settled the island, {{are likely to}} have arrived from the Marquesas Islands from the west. These {{settlers}} brought bananas, taro, sugarcane, and paper mulberry, as well as chickens and <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats.</b> The island at one time supported a relatively advanced and complex civilization.|$|R
5|$|The {{first factor}} in {{the decline of the}} kakapo was the arrival of humans. Māori {{folklore}} suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo. Although the kakapo was extinct {{in many parts of the}} islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island.|$|E
25|$|Kiribati {{has a few}} land mammals, none being {{indigenous}} or endemic. They {{include the}} <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus exulans), dogs and pigs. Among the 75 bird species, the Bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis) is endemic to Kiritimati.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial species {{includes}} the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> on Sibylla. The more aggressive black rat {{appears to be}} absent, despite wrecked fishing vessels on the eastern and north eastern reefs. The snake-eyed skink and large hermit crabs are common.|$|E
50|$|When {{the islands}} were settled by humans {{since the late}} 1st {{millennium}} AD, the owls presumably rapidly succumbed to the depredations of introduced pigs and possibly <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats,</b> as well as habitat destruction for agriculture. They were never seen alive by scientists, being known only from subfossil bones.|$|R
40|$|Snap traps {{were set}} and {{monitored}} in two native Hawaiian rain forests on Maui, Hawai'i, {{to determine the}} relative abundances, distributions, and diets of rodents. Black <b>rats</b> (R. rattus), <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> (R. exulans), and mice (Mus musculus) were abundant throughout the mesic to wet forest habitat in both areas from 1600 to 2000 m elevation during both summer and winter trapping periods. Invertebrates, particularly insect larvae, were the most frequently found and abundant food item in the stomachs of both rat species. Consumption of these prey by rats was higher in winter than in summer. Black rats ate more fruits, seeds, and other vegetation than did <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats.</b> More information about the life history, ecology, and behavior of rats in native Hawaiian forests is needed to document their impact on endemic ecosystems and to develop effective control techniques...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} threatened by introduced species, particularly <b>rats.</b> <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> and black rats have devastated populations of Bonin petrels in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, primarily by taking eggs. <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> introduced to Kure Atoll {{were such a}} problem for Bonin petrels that for a five-year period in the 1960s not a single chick fledged (hatching success can {{be as high as}} 90% in the absence of introduced predators). Similar devastation occurred on Midway, where black rats introduced in 1943 (the same black rats that caused the extinction of the Laysan rail) reduced the population of Bonin petrels from 500,000 birds to 32,000 by 1995. Rabbits introduced to Lisianski Island destroyed nesting habitat and undermined nesting burrows. Habitat destruction limits breeding success on some islands, especially as it increases competition with more aggressive species like the wedge-tailed shearwater.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduced}} Australian common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) {{and introduced}} species of rats — mainly the ship or black rat (Rattus rattus) {{but also the}} kiore or <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus exulans) and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) — have significantly reduced the amount of fruit available for pigeons and other native birds and also prey on eggs and nestlings.|$|E
25|$|The common {{species are}} {{opportunistic}} survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, {{they are known}} as commensals. They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries. However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus. Many species of rats are island endemics and some have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown, black or <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The only mammals {{native to}} the region are the common <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus exulans), and the goat, but even these are tricky. Indeed, the rat {{would seem to have}} been {{introduced}} by native seafarers numerous centuries before Cook found Kiritimati in 1777, and the goat is extinct since 14 January 2004. Black rats (Rattus rattus) were present at some time, perhaps introduced by 19th century sailors or during the nuclear tests. They {{have not been able to}} gain a foothold between predation by cats and competitive exclusion by Polynesian rats, and no black rat population is found on Kiritimati today.|$|E
2500|$|Secondly, they {{suggested}} that Polynesian settlers arriving about 800–1000 years ago, bringing dogs and <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> and hunting takahē for food, started another decline. European settlement {{in the nineteenth century}} almost wiped them out through hunting and introducing mammals such as deer which competed for food and predators (e.g. stoats) which preyed on them directly.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, an {{ecological}} project {{conducted by the}} University of Auckland and the Ornithological Society of Polynesia aimed to eradicate Vahanga's <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats,</b> which had colonized the atoll, to restore balance to the ecosystem supporting bird species such as the Polynesian ground-dove and the Tuamotu sandpiper. A previous campaign in 2000 had failed in this goal.|$|R
50|$|The {{deforestation}} {{is a fact}} of the island's history, {{which may}} have caused widespread famine due to ecological collapse and a catastrophic drop in population, accompanied by wars between clans for control of dwindling resources. However, it has also been proposed that the deforestation was primarily due to <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus exulans) and that the islanders adapted to this change gradually.|$|R
25|$|Many murid {{species have}} been {{introduced}} to New Guinea. These include: the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus exulans), the Himalayan field rat (Rattus nitidus), the black rat (Rattus rattus), the rice field rat (Rattus argentiventer), the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus). Most of these have not caused much damage, and most have only established in human settlements. R. nitidus and R. argentiventer have very limited distributions on the island. The house mouse is the most widespread of the introduced murids, and is found in settlements and grassland. It is the only introduced murid to reach the central region of Telefomin.|$|E
25|$|Other mammal species {{found within}} the {{protected}} area are classified as Least Concern by the IUCN include the Crab-eating Macaque (Macaca fascicularis); Malayan Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus malayanus); Common Palm Civit (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus); Jarvan Mongoose (Herpestes javanicus); Plantain Squirrel (Callosciurus notatus); Greater Bandicoot Rat (Bandicota indica); and the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rat</b> (Rattus exulans). There are also over 4000 Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) farmed by approximately 280 families in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. It is unknown what impact the numbers of buffalo have on the ecosystem, however many avian species use their grazing areas for feeding and breeding sites including heron, egrets, stilts and wader species.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand wrens, {{like many}} New Zealand birds, {{suffered}} several extinctions after {{the arrival of}} humans in New Zealand. Two species became extinct after {{the arrival of the}} Māori and the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat,</b> and are known today only from fossil remains; a third, Lyall's wren, became extinct on the main islands, surviving only as a relict population on Stephens Island in the Cook Strait. This species and the bushwren became extinct after the arrival of Europeans, with the bushwren surviving until 1972. Of the two remaining species, the rifleman is still common on both the North and the South Islands, while the New Zealand rock wren is restricted to the alpine areas of the South Island and is considered vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Heavy losses In Hawaiian {{sugarcane}} {{are caused}} by <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus exulans), Norway rats (R. norveglcus), and black rats (R. rattus). Relative population levels, movement patterns, damage to sugarcane, and suggested timing of control during five stages of the 2 -year crop cycle are described. The progress toward the registering of zinc phosphide for use in crops {{and the development of}} other rodenticides are mentioned...|$|R
50|$|The Maui nukupuu {{is one of}} {{the species}} a project of the East Maui Watershed has been aimed at. Other birds from this area {{included}} the ōū and the poouli. The project involved fencing in the area and eradicating introduced predators. The entire project took out 22 feral cats, 209 pigs, 1,596 <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats,</b> 1,205 black rats, and 1,948 common mice. On Kauai, comparable projects exists around the Koaie Stream.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the traditions}} of the Aotea, Horouta and Māmari ancestral canoes, kiore (<b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats)</b> were {{passengers}} on their voyages from Hawaiki to New Zealand. Carvings on a window frame of Te Ōhākī marae at Ahipara depict the story of Ruanui's rat, Ruanui being the captain of the Māmari canoe. On arriving in Hokianga Harbour, he released his rats onto an island now called Motukiore [...] "rat island".|$|R
25|$|It {{may seem}} that the {{erstwhile}} numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, {{it is not clear}} whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> is of little if any harm for seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimati's cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted accordingly, with cats being less territorial generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.|$|E
25|$|The {{most current}} {{reliable}} evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE {{at the end}} of the medieval warm period. Previous dating of some kiore (<b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat)</b> bones at 50–150CE has now been shown to have been unreliable; new samples of bone (and now also of unequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases) match the 1280 date of the earliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained deforestation by humans. Māori oral history describes the arrival of ancestors from Hawaiki (the mythical homeland in tropical Polynesia), in large ocean-going waka. Migration accounts vary among tribes (iwi), whose members may identify with several waka in their genealogies (whakapapa). In the last few decades mitochondrial DNA research has allowed an estimate to be made of the number of women in the founding population—between 50 and 100. There is limited evidence of return, or attempted return voyages, from archaeological evidence in the Kermadec Islands.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} island was {{apparently}} settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is quite old, was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several Gallirallus and/or Porzana rails make the most likely candidates, given their former {{presence in the region}} and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a Todiramphus kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (T. sanctus) group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia. These birds would have fallen victim to the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rat</b> and, {{in the case of the}} rails which would have almost certainly been flightless, hunting by natives.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} preliminary feeding trials with Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), roof rats (/?. rattus), and <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats</b> (R. exulans) {{to examine the effects of}} carbon disulfide (CS 2) on consumption of nontoxic foods. We formulated CS 2 at target concentrations of 10 ppm in deionized water, and of 50 ppm to 100, 000 ppm in a starch xanthate matrix. However, we did not analyze actual concentrations of CS 2 in the test foods or measure its rate of volatilization, and thus cannot verify the levels of CSj the rats were exposed to. CS 2 diluted in water and applied directly to food had no apparent effect on consumption by any of the species. Formulations with 50 ppm CS 2 in starch xanthate influenced food choice by Norway rats and roof rats in one test, but not in another. Concentrations ^ 10, 000 ppm repelled Norway rats. CS 2 -starch xanthate had little effect on consumption by <b>Polynesian</b> <b>rats.</b> Further testing is needed to develop effective formulations and delivery methods for utilizing CS 2 as a bait additive...|$|R
5000|$|Nicolas Baudin {{named the}} island in 1801 {{as part of his}} {{expedition}} around Australia. [...] The name of the island was first charted on the Freycinet Map of 1811. It was declared a Nature Reserve in 2001 in recognition of its status as a bird breeding sanctuary. Since then the Department of Environment and Conservation has embarked on a campaign to eradicate the island of the <b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rats</b> that are a constant threat to the native seabirds.|$|R
40|$|Design of {{selective}} bait stations to deliver rodenticide bait is often proposed for management of non-target animal access, {{but much of}} the information on the behavioural and physical capabilities of rodents relative to station access has not been readily available or is based on unpublished, informal observations or anecdotes repeated for many years. We studied the climbing and jumping abilities of <b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rats</b> (Rallus exulans), Norway Rats (R. norvegicus), Roof Rats (R. rallus), and House Mice (Mus musculus), focused on applications for eradication of these invasive rodents from island ecosystems in the Pacific where a variety of important non-target animals occur. The maximum jumping heights achieved by the three rat species was 40 cm; House Mice jumped a maximum of 25 cm. The minimum diameter holes through which these species could pass were 40 mm (Norway Rats), 35 mm (Roof <b>Rats),</b> 30 mm (<b>Polynesian</b> <b>Rats),</b> and 13 mm (House Mice). Our findings establish threshold differences for these species for transiting access openings or jumping to platforms to obtain food. In areas where endangered birds or other animals occur, such information could be used in designing selective stations so as to prevent unnecessary poisoning...|$|R
