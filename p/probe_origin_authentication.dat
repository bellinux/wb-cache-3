Multicast data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> {{must take}} into consideration the scalability and the efficiency of the underlying cryptographic schemes and mechanisms, because multicast groups can be very large and the exchanged data is likely to be heavy in volume (streaming). Besides, multicast data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> must be robust enough against packet loss because most of multicast multimedia applications do not use reliable packet delivery. Therefore, multicast data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> is subject to many concurrent and competitive challenges, when considering these miscellaneous application level requirements and features. In this paper, we propose an efficient multicast data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol based on a novel layered hashchaining scheme. Our protocol tolerates packet loss and guarantees non-repudiation of media-streaming origin. Furthermore, our protocol allows receivers to make the decision regarding the authentication information redundancy degree depending on the quality of reception in term of packet loss ratio.

40|$|International audienceMulticasting is an {{efficient}} communication mechanism for group-oriented {{applications such as}} videoconferencing, broadcasting stock quotes, interactive group games, and video on demand. The lack of security obstructs a large deployment of this efficient communication model. This limitation motivated a host of research works that have addressed the many issues relating to securing the multicast, such as confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation, integrity, and access control. Many applications, such as broadcasting stock quotes and video-conferencing, require data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> of the received traffic.

40|$|International audienceSecurity and QoS are {{two main}} issues for a {{successful}} wide deployment of multicast services. For instance, in a multicast streaming application, a receiver would require a data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> service {{as well as a}} quality adaptation technique for the received stream. Signature propagation and layered multicast are efficient solutions satisfying these two requirements. In this paper we investigate the use of signature propagation to ensure data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> service. We, then, propose a set of novel data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> techniques for layered media-streaming video. In addition to data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication,</b> the proposed techniques offer continuous non-repudiation of the origin and data integrity. These techniques take advantage of the preestablished layered structure of the encoded video data to reduce the overhead and improve the overall verification in lossy network environments. We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques through extensive simulations using NS 2 simulator...|$|R

40|$|As the rollout of secure route <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> {{with the}} RPKI slowly gains {{traction}} among network operators, {{there is a}} push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i. e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). <b>Origin</b> <b>authentication</b> already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP {{is expected to be}} long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by <b>origin</b> <b>authentication.</b> Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system...|$|R

40|$|Attacks against Internet routing are {{increasing}} {{in number and}} severity. Contributing greatly to these attacks {{is the absence of}} origin authentication: {{there is no way to}} validate claims of address ownership or location. The lack of such services enables not only attacks by malicious entities, but indirectly allow seemingly inconsequential miconfigurations to disrupt large portions of the Internet. This paper considers the semantics, design, and costs of <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> in interdomain routing. We formalize the semantics of address delegation and use on the Internet, and develop and characterize broad classes of <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> proof systems. We estimate the address delegation graph representing the current use of IPv 4 address space using available routing data. This effort reveals that current address delegation is dense and relatively static: as few as 16 entities perform 80 % of the delegation on the Internet. We conclude by evaluating the proposed services via traced based simulation. Our simulation shows the enhanced proof systems can reduce significantly reduce resource costs associated with <b>origin</b> <b>authentication...</b>|$|R

40|$|Multicast is an {{efficient}} communicating scheme in group communications, and data <b>origin</b> <b>authentication</b> {{is one of}} the most important problems in multicasting. But at present, there is no ideal approach that is efficient for all sorts of multicast applications. For example, tree-hashing’s authentication probability can maintain 100 %, but it has high communication overhead. Chain-hashing’s computation overhead and communication overhead are low, but it isn’t efficient when any data packet is lost or disordered in transit. Hence, this paper proposes a Hybrid Approach to Multicast data <b>origin</b> <b>Authentication</b> (HAMA), which is based on tree-hashing and chain-hashing. Approved by the performance evaluations and simulation results, HAMA can support non-repudiation, has less communication overhead than that of the traditional tree-hashing, and the authentication probability of HAMA is much higher than that of the traditional chain-hashing, since it can maintain 90 % if the loss probability is less than 25 %. Thus, HAMA is secure, reasonable, and efficient, especially for multicasting unreal-time data...|$|R
