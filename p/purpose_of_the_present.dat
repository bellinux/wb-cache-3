60|$|In his Principles of Psychology, Mr. Herbert Spencer {{appears to}} me to have brought out the {{essential}} truth which underlies Kant's doctrine in a far clearer manner than any one else; but, for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> summary view of Hume's philosophy, it must suffice if I state the matter in my own way, giving the broad outlines, without entering {{into the details of}} a large and difficult discussion.|$|E

60|$|As it {{is foreign}} to the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> {{treatise}} to decide between these conflicting theories, we are precluded from inquiring into the existence, or defining the extent and limits, of knowledge a priori, and from characterizing the kind of correct assumption which the fallacy of incorrect assumption, now under consideration, simulates. Yet since it is allowed on both sides that such assumptions are often made improperly, we may find it practicable, without entering into the ultimate metaphysical grounds of the discussion, to state some speculative propositions, and suggest some practical cautions, respecting the forms in which such unwarranted assumptions {{are most likely to}} be made.|$|E
60|$|For {{these reasons}} we propose (merely for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> work) to define {{religion}} as {{the belief in}} a primal being, a Maker, undying, usually moral, without denying that the belief in spiritual beings, even if immoral, may be styled religious. Our definition is expressly framed {{for the purpose of}} the argument, because that argument endeavours to bring into view the essential conflict between religion and myth. We intend to show that this conflict between the religious and the mythical conception is present, not only (where it has been universally recognised) in the faiths of the ancient civilised peoples, as in Greece, Rome, India and Egypt, but also in the ideas of the lowest known savages.|$|E
60|$|To {{those who}} have been kind enough to {{communicate}} books and manuscripts for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> publication, the Editor and, through him, Mr. Coleridge's executor return their grateful thanks. In most cases a specific acknowledgement has been made. But, above and independently of all others, it is to Mr. and Mrs. Gillman, and to Mr. Green himself, that the public are indebted for the preservation and use of the principal part of the contents of these volumes. The claims of those respected individuals on the gratitude of the friends and admirers of Coleridge and his works are already well known, and in due season those claims will receive additional confirmation.|$|E

60|$|The {{indications}} now given of {{the scope}} and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> volume renders it evident that, before we can proceed to {{the discussion of the}} remarkable phenomena presented by insular faunas and floras, and the complex causes which have produced them, we must go through a series of preliminary studies, adapted to give us a command of the more important facts and principles on which the solution of such problems depends. The succeeding eight chapters will therefore be devoted to the explanation of the mode of distribution, variation, modification, and dispersal, of species and groups, illustrated by facts and examples; of the true nature of geological change as affecting continents and islands; of changes of climate, their nature, causes, and effects; of the duration of geological time and the rate of organic development.|$|E
60|$|For the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> inquiry I also omit all {{the rites}} of leaping sportfully, and of driving cattle through light fires. Of these cases, from the Roman Palilia, or Parilia, downwards, {{there is a}} useful {{collection}} in Brand's Popular Antiquities under the heading 'Midsummer Eve.' One exception must be made for a passage from Torreblanca's Demonologia (p. 106). People are said 'pyras circumire et transilire in futuri mali averruncatione'--to 'go round about and leap over lighted pyres {{for the purpose of}} averting future evils,' as in Mannhardt's theory of the Hirpi. This may be connected with the Bulgarian rite, to be described later, but, as a rule, in all these instances, the fire is a light one of straw, and no sort of immunity is claimed by the people who do not walk through, but leap across it.|$|E
60|$|It is in {{this spirit}} that the {{following}} collection of Mrs. Browning's letters has now been prepared, in {{the conviction that the}} lovers of English literature will be glad to make a closer and more intimate acquaintance with one--or, it may truthfully be said, with two--of the most interesting literary characters of the Victorian age. It is a selection from a large mass of letters, written at all periods in Mrs. Browning's life, which Mr. Browning, after his wife's death, reclaimed from the friends to whom they had been written, or from their representatives. No doubt, Mr. Browning's primary object was to prevent publications which would have been excessively distressing to his feelings; but the letters, when once thus collected, were not destroyed (as was the case with many of his own letters), but carefully preserved, and so passed into the possession of his son, Mr. R. Barrett Browning, with whose consent they are now published. In this collection are comprised the letters to Miss Browning (the poet's sister, whose consent has also been freely given to the publication), Mr. H.S. Boyd, Mrs. Martin, Miss Mitford, Mrs. Jameson, Mr. John Kenyon, Mr. Chorley, Miss Blagden, Miss Haworth, and Miss Thomson (Madame Emil Braun).[1] To these have been added a number of letters which have been kindly lent by their possessors for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> volumes.|$|E
