40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the stick-slip properties of dry polyester <b>plain,</b> <b>ribs</b> and satin woven fabric weaves.

Stick-slip force and accumulative retraction force depend on fabric weave, fabric density, the number of pulled ends in the fabric and fabric sample dimensions. The weft directional single and multiple yarn stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces of dry plain fabrics in fabric edge and centre regions were higher than those in the satin fabric due to fabric weave. In addition, the warp directional single and multiple yarn stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces in the meso-cell- 1 to the meso-cell- 6 of dry wide and long satin fabric in fabric edge were higher than those in the weft direction due to fabric density.

They are crossed, above the peripheral carina by numerous elevated, thin, oblique ribs, which rise into lamellas near the suture, where they join the carina forming small nodules. Between the ribs are fine parallel lines of growth and sometimes a few fine revolving lines. Below the periphery, {{in line with the}} posterior edge of the lip, there is a smaller, <b>plain,</b> angular <b>rib,</b> and around the umbilicus there is a strong nodulose rib.

Also, it was observed that the closer the distance between the ribs, the higher the capacity produced for equal number of ribs. The ribbed piles gave higher capacities through the increase in their shaft capacity which is associated with the presence of ribs along their lengths.

40|$|Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) {{has been}} criticised {{for a long}} time for its high energy {{consumption}} during the production process that releases quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have been searching for substitutive binders for manufacturing concrete. Of all the proposed alternative binders, geopolymers stand out because of their total environmental friendliness, good mechanical capabilities and inexpensive processing costs. A geopolymer is an inorganic polymer with an internal chemical composition very similar to that of natural zeolite. A commonly used raw material for producing geopolymers is low-calcium (class F) fly ash, which is a major by-product of power generation industries. Class F fly ash-based geopolymers are usually synthesized by activating the fly ash with alkaline activators. The reaction happening in synthesis is geopolymerisation which transforms fly ash into cement-like binder material. Previous research on class F fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (GPC) has proved its great potential as an alternative to OPC concrete in terms of outstanding chemical and comparable engineering characteristics. However, the structural performance of the reinforced concrete (RC) components relies on there being a sufficient bond between the concrete and the reinforcing bars. Before being utilised in any concrete structures, GPC must demonstrate that it possesses adequate bond strength and predictable bond behaviour with commercial steel reinforcements. Although the importance of investigating the bond characteristics of GPC has been recently acknowledged, nevertheless the bond performance between the reinforcement sand GPC matrices has not been sufficiently studied. The definitions about the bond mechanism and bond-slip rules for GPC were still not clear, which was an inevitable obstacle to its application. As part of the research committed to investigate the suitability of GPC in RC structures, this study aims to not only qualitatively but also quantitatively define the bond behaviour of GPC and, determine whether it could qualify as an alternative to traditional concrete in RC structures. This study used experimental tests, statistical analyses and finite element (FE) modelling to investigate the bond behaviour of GPC. The experimental program included manufacturing and testing <b>plain</b> and <b>ribbed</b> bar reinforced GPC cylinders in direct pull-out tests and beams in beam pull-out tests. Meanwhile, corresponding tests were conducted on equivalent reinforced OPC concrete cylinders and beams, in order to be used as control groups in comparison of bond quality. The experimental data were planned and obtained so as to be suitable for statistical regression and hypothesis testing. The empirical equations obtained from regression well predicted the bond-slip behaviour of GPC and were used in FE modelling. In the bond tests, the types of reinforcements were 16 mm <b>plain</b> and <b>ribbed</b> bars. The samples used for direct pull-out tests were cylinders 100 mm in diameter, and for beam pull-out tests were beams 220 mm wide, 450 mm deep and 600 mm long. In addition, standard 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders were cast together with the bond test specimens for mechanical testing on characteristics related to bond, including compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus. The mechanical test results illustrated that GPC possessed comparable compressive and indirect tensile strength but significantly lower elastic modulus than OPC concrete. Data obtained from mechanical tests were used in regression. The statistical correlations among these three crucial mechanical characteristics of GPC were examined and described by statistical predictions. Equations for predicting GPC’s indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus from its compressive strength were presented. The bond tests results illustrated that the failure modes observed in both the reinforced GPC and OPC concrete specimens were similar. All the ribbed bar reinforced samples failed in splitting while all the plain bar reinforced ones failed in pull-out. However, statistical significant differences had been shown in the bond strength and the bond-slip curves between GPC and OPC concrete samples. Specifically, test results demonstrated that the plain bar reinforced GPC samples had considerably higher bond strengths than those of OPC concrete. This was attributed to the relatively homogenous steel-GPC interface observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that, unlike OPC, no particularly weak layer existed in the contact area between the steel and geopolymer. Meanwhile, the ribbed bar reinforced GPC samples had significantly better energy absorption capabilities than the ribbed OPC concrete ones. This was also attributed to the homogeneity of steel-GPC interface, as well as the low elastic modulus of GPC. Strain gauges were installed along the bars to obtain changes in the steel strain during pull-out procedure. The distribution of bond stress within the bond length was calculated from the recorded values of steel strain. The bond stress distribution curves illustrated that the bond stress distributed non-uniformly along the bond length of <b>plain</b> and <b>ribbed</b> bar reinforced GPC, with the maximum stress occurring near the loaded-end. The uniform stress distribution assumption is not true for either OPC concrete or GPC. The bond-slip behaviour of GPC was successfully modelled using ANSYS with empirical equations and material properties obtained from the experiments. The modelling results successfully reflected the bond-slip and bond distribution curves obtained from experiments. With the bond-slip effects, the FE analysis on flexural behaviour of GPC beams obtained more realistic results than the perfect bonding model reported in the literature. To sum up, GPC possesses eligible engineering properties, remarkable bond strength and predictable bond-slip behaviour. Therefore, it could qualify as an appropriate replacement for OPC concrete in steel bar RC structures...|$|R

The study and experimental verification of ?Multiple-Aspect Scattering? techniques were achieved through scaled experiments in our tank facilities, using real types of seabed representative of European shores and scaled targets. High-frequency (238 kHz) bistatic scattering is investigated with a 5 -degree of freedom robotics system, enabling the positioning of the source and hydrophones at different distances from each other, and at different depths in the water column. This set-up is a scaled-down version of the SITAR sea trials performed in September/October 2003 in the Stockholm Archipelago, except that it offers a totally controlled laboratory environment. We measured the acoustic scattering of the targets and the background (silt) seabed, imaged with a highly directional beam at 45 ° grazing angle. These measurements were taken {{as a function of the}} bistatic angle (in-plane, 10 ° and 20 ° away) and the scattering angle (22 ° to 73 °).

50|$|The cathedral was {{designed}} in the Gothic Pointed architectural style. The present structure consists of a nave with double aisles, pseudo-transepts with eastern aisles, and a sanctuary. The nave and aisles are of four bays westward of the cross. The primary aisles are carried to the same height as the nave. The secondary aisles are low, and used for chapels. The wall between the two aisles carries a clerestory. The piers are worked in imitation of palm-trees. On a bold square base, 5 sq ft, is imposed an octagon. On the octagon, there is a circle of deeply cut classicizing mouldings from which rise columns circular in plan. These columns are finely moulded; four bold circular rolls at the cardinal sides; between each are three fluted members. The whole effect combines the Corinthian and Pointed. These columns are banded twice with a very rich and effective moulding, combining a cable, with a row of ball-flowers above it; below, a deeply cut chevron, pointing downwards. These shafts have no capitals; they run up into a horizontal fillet, from which spring <b>plain</b> vaulting <b>ribs,</b> which flow from the shafts as palm-branches do from the trunk. The vaulting is good sexpartite. Between the two aisles are pure pointed arches. The responds to the circular piers,—that is, the responds on the wall between the aisles, into which the vaulting of the primary aisles falls,—are half shafts of ordinary Pointed work, without fillets, and of five foliaged heads; the caps of the aisle vaulting are also foliaged. The western responds to the circular shafts are also ordinary Pointed. It is plain, therefore, that the architect could only trust to his palmary development in the isolated shafts.

Although stainless steel reinforcing bar costs more than carbon steel, its selective use for high risk elements is cost-effective when the whole life costs of the structure are taken into account. Considerations for specifying stainless steel reinforcing bars and a review of applications are presented herein. Attention is then given to the elevated temperature properties of stainless steel reinforcing bars, which are needed for structural fire design, but have been unexplored to date. A programme of isothermal and anisothermal tensile tests on four types of stainless steel reinforcing bar is described: 1. 4307 (304 L), 1. 4311 (304 LN), 1. 4162 (LDX 2101 ®) and 1. 4362 (2304).

Design of maifan stone fiber knitted fabrics Choosing needle pitch. When the flat knitting machine knits the weft <b>plain</b> structure and <b>rib</b> structure, the relations between needle pitch and yarn linear density can be identified by the following formula...|$|R
40|$|The {{thoracic}} outlet syndromes {{encompass the}} diverse clinical entities affecting the brachial plexus or subclavian artery including cervical ribs or bands. Thoracic outlet syndrome are {{often difficult to}} diagnose on existing clinical and electrophysiological criteria and new diagnostic methods are necessary. This study reports our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brachial plexus in 20 patients with suspected thoracic outlet syndrome. The distribution of pain and sensory disturbance varied widely, weakness and wasting usually affected C 8 /T 1 innervated muscles, and electrophysiology showed combinations of reduced sensory nerve action potentials from {{the fourth and fifth}} digits, and prolonged F-responses or tendon reflex latencies. The MRI study was interpreted blind. Deviation of the brachial plexus was recorded in 19 out of the 24 symptomatic sides (sensitivity 79 %). Absence of distortion was correctly identified in 14 out of 16 asymptomatic sides (specificity 87. 5 %). The false positive rate was 9. 5 %. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated all seven cervical <b>ribs</b> visible on <b>plain</b> cervical spine radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed a band-like structure extending from the C 7 transverse process in 25 out of 33 sides; similar structures were detected in three out of 18 sides in control subjects. These MRI bands often underlay the brachial plexus distortion observed in our patients. We also observed instances of plexus distortion by post-traumatic callus of the first rib, and by a hypertrophied serratus anterior muscle. If they did not demonstrate a cervical <b>rib,</b> <b>plain</b> cervical spine radiographs had no value in predicting brachial plexus distortion. We believe MRI to be of potential value in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome by (i) demonstrating deviation or distortion of nerves or blood vessels; (ii) suggesting the presence of radiographically invisible bands; (iii) disclosing other causes of thoracic outlet syndrome apart from ribs or bands...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} metalwork deposition, {{distribution and}} association in the British Early Iron Age (800 - 600 BC) {{through the medium}} of the socketed axe. Out of 1412 known Early Iron Age axes, 954 specimens were analysed in detail for this thesis: 680 associated finds and 274 single finds. The methodology was governed by two main objectives: firstly, to propose a reworked and more comprehensive typology of Early Iron Age cast copper-alloy and wrought iron socketed axes in conjunction with their metallurgy, distribution and deposition, and secondly, to discuss their place within Early Iron Age society and what part they may have played in the people’s life, work, trade and exchange, ritual and death. As a result, this thesis introduces, defines and discusses 12 new types of transitional and Early Iron Age socketed axes. While the transitional type can be dated to the Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age transition (c. 850 - 750 BC), the remaining 11 types can be dated to the fully developed Early Iron Age (800 - 600 BC). The 11 types of bronze Early Iron Age socketed axes display a great variety of decoration, shape, size, weight and colour. While Late Bronze Age axes are <b>plain</b> or simply <b>ribbed,</b> almost all Early Iron Age socketed axes are decorated with ribs-and-pellets, ribs-and-circlets or a more elaborate version thereof. Some axe have a shiny silver surface colour (Portland, Blandford, East Rudham and Hindon types). More than three quarters of Early Iron Age socketed axes were found in association with other metalwork. These hoards can be divided into two main groups: axe hoards and mixed hoards. The eight geographical regions outlined in this thesis are defined by different contexts, associations and the predominance of different Early Iron Age axe types, and in terms of depositional contexts this research suggests that the depositional contexts of Early Iron Age hoards containing socketed axes was different from the deposition of single finds: while hoards were often found in retrievable places, single finds were not. The survival {{of a large number of}} complete and almost undamaged bronze axes suggests that in the British Early Iron Age socketed axes were not just commonplace tools that were in use until they reached the end of their life. The changes in looks and shape, and consequently the adaption of a new and improved typology of socketed axes in the British Early Iron Age were accompanied by a change in conceptualisation and the overall meaning of socketed axes. Even when used in a different context their basic, very recognisable socketed-axe-shape was always maintained, that is a wedge of different dimensions with a socket and a small side loop for suspension or possible attachment of other items of metalwork. Throughout British prehistory axes were one of the most familiar objects in daily use: as a tool, socketed axes were omnipresent and thus an established part of British Late Bronze Age life – a life that appeared to be foremost practical rather than ritual, with the majority of Late Bronze Age socketed axes showing clear signs of use and resharpening. In the Early Iron Age socketed axes adopted a previously unseen duality in function and meaning (that is materialistic and symbolic). Thus, while Late Bronze Age axe may have been regarded as common woodworking tool, types of Early Iron Age axes were understood as ingots, weapons, or objects needed for certain displays or performances, with their unique ornaments communicating their role in both display and society as well as perhaps their users regional identity and status...|$|R
