5|$|A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch {{was invited}} by film {{director}} J. J. Abrams to film {{a role in}} Star Trek. Abrams heard of Pausch's condition and sent a personal e-mail inviting Pausch to the set. Pausch accepted and traveled to Los Angeles, California, to shoot his scene. In addition to appearing in the film, {{he also has a}} line of dialogue {{at the beginning of the}} film ("Captain, we have visual.") and donated the $217.06 <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> charity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Harry {{returns home}} {{where his father}} Norman tells him to take {{responsibility}} and study by himself. Norman then goes to meet with Hammerhead, revealing that he helped them steal the suit from Tri-Corp as they are his company's competitor. He talks over speaker phone with the Big Man, who wants him to create new supervillains in return for funding. At his house, Peter sends his photos to the Bugle and tries to give Aunt May the money, but she insists that he uses 10% of every <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> save for a new camera.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, {{like all the}} other Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a law was passed in Massachusetts reducing the maximum number of hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months in the dead of winter. Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for overtime work. The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E
50|$|The Golden Dragon {{restaurant}} {{continued operation}} {{shortly after the}} massacre, but was closed in January 2006 after a failed health inspection. The restaurant also owed a year's worth of <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> its employees. It was reopened as the Imperial Palace Restaurant.|$|R
50|$|APA’s 152 {{chapters}} and {{its members}} head out into their local communities to teach workers and teens all about their paychecks and payroll-related benefits during National Payroll Week. The educational efforts focus on helping employees better manage their <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> put more money in their pockets each payday.|$|R
50|$|Romero {{leads the}} California chapter of Democrats for Education Reform, an {{interest}} group funded by Wall Street hedge fund managers who support charter schools. In the 2012 election, she is campaigning for California's Prop. 32 that would bar unions from withholding money from worker <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> finance political activities.|$|R
500|$|On October 6, 2007, Pausch {{joined the}} Pittsburgh Steelers {{for the day}} during their regular practice, after the {{organization}} learned {{that one of his}} childhood dreams mentioned in his [...] "Last Lecture" [...] was to play in the National Football League. A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch was invited by film director J. J. Abrams to film a role in the latest Star Trek movie. Abrams heard of Pausch's condition and sent a personal e-mail inviting Pausch to the set. Pausch happily accepted and traveled to Los Angeles, California to shoot his scene. In addition to appearing in the film, he also has a line of dialogue and donated the $217.06 <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> charity. On April 9, 2008, the ABC network aired an hour-long Diane Sawyer feature on Pausch entitled [...] "The Last Lecture: A Love Story For Your Life". On July 29, 2008, ABC aired a follow up to the Last Lecture special, remembering Pausch.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{signed a}} {{recording}} deal with Decca Records in 1958. He was paired with singer Donny Lytle, who later gained fame {{under the name}} Johnny <b>Paycheck,</b> <b>to</b> perform the Miller-written [...] "A Man Like Me," [...] and later [...] "The Wrong Kind of Girl." [...] Neither of these honky-tonk-style songs charted. His second single with the label, featuring the B-side [...] "Jason Fleming," [...] foreshadowed Miller's future style. To make money, Miller went on tour with Faron Young's band as a drummer, although he had never drummed. During this period, he signed a record deal with Chet Atkins at RCA Victor, for whom Miller recorded [...] "You Don't Want My Love" [...] (also known as [...] "In the Summertime") in 1960, which marked his first appearance on country charts, peaking at No.14. The next year he made an even bigger impact, breaking through the top 10 with his single [...] "When Two Worlds Collide", co-written with Bill Anderson. But Miller soon tired of writing songs, divorced his wife, and began a party lifestyle that earned him the moniker [...] "wild child." [...] He was dropped from his record label and began to pursue other interests.|$|E
2500|$|Diaghilev {{dismissed}} Nijinsky summarily {{from the}} Ballets Russes after the dancer's marriage in 1913. Nijinsky appeared {{again with the}} company, but the old relationship between the men was never re-established; moreover, Nijinsky's magic as a dancer was much diminished by incipient madness. Their last meeting was after Nijinsky's mind had given way, and he appeared not to recognise his former lover. Dancers such as Alicia Markova, Tamara Karsavina, Serge Lifar, and Lydia Sokolova remembered Diaghilev fondly, as a stern but kind father-figure who put the needs of his dancers and company above his own. He lived from <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> finance his company, and though he spent considerable amounts of money on a splendid collection of rare books {{at the end of}} his life, many people noticed that his impeccably cut suits had frayed cuffs and trouser-ends. [...] The film The Red Shoes is a thinly disguised dramatization of the Ballet Russes.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{employer}} {{is responsible for}} paying the employer's share of payroll taxes, for depositing tax withheld from the employees' paychecks, preparing various reconciliation reports, accounting for the payroll expense through their financial reporting, and filing payroll tax returns. As you see this suite of employer payroll tax responsibilities is far above issuing <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> employees.- ...|$|R
5000|$|Employers had {{to modify}} payroll systems {{to the new}} lower {{deduction}} for the FICA payroll tax. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowed employers until January 31, 2011, to do so. [...] While companies that specialize in payroll processing could adapt to the change quickly, smaller companies that do their own payrolls could take longer. [...] It was possible that employees {{would have to wait}} for up <b>to</b> three <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> see the reduction take place.|$|R
40|$|The Occupy {{movement}} at UC Davis was initially about {{the connections between}} the privatization of the university and income inequality in society at large. The pepper spraying of students has shifted the discussion to police brutality, the policing of the Occupy movement, and who should {{take responsibility for the}} attack. The question that underlies these is: why isn’t the answer simple? Why doesn’t responsibility lie with the administrators who have the authority (and the <b>paychecks)</b> <b>to</b> run the university...|$|R
2500|$|An August 2017 {{survey by}} CareerBuilder found that 8 out of 10 U.S. workers live <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> paycheck. CareerBuilder {{spokesman}} Mike Erwin blamed [...] "stagnant wages {{and the rising}} cost of everything from education to many consumer goods". According {{to a survey by the}} federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the financial well-being of U.S. citizens, roughly half have trouble paying bills, and more than one-third have faced hardships such as not being able to afford a place to live, running out of food, or not having enough money to pay for medical care.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Carlson's {{abundant}} culinary skills, {{his restaurant}} Schwa {{has struggled to}} stay afloat. Carlson has described the restaurant as living [...] "from <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> paycheck". This {{has been attributed to}} a complete lack of business acumen, and is a source of frustration for Achatz and Trotter. Despite long reservation waiting lists, on any given night Schwa is usually half empty, partly by choice, partly because Carlson rarely answers the phone. The restaurant's voice mail is frequently full, meaning potential customers are unable to make, or cancel, reservations. Schwa does not have a liquor license, which takes away a large source of potential income (and an even larger source of potential profit). [...] Carlson has claimed limited size of Schwa makes storing wine bottles and glasses difficult, and that it allows him to be educated by the sophisticated customers who bring in their own wines. [...] Achatz called Carlson's decision not the offer wine [...] "stupid," [...] while Trotter said he was [...] "crazy" [...] for [...] "leaving so much money on the friggin' table." [...] For a portion of 2007, Carlson even closed Schwa on Saturdays – traditionally the most profitable day for restaurants – to spend time with his family.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E
50|$|On September 28, 2006, Treasurer Cisneros also pioneered a {{financial}} empowerment project called Bank on San Francisco. Well over 10% of Californians {{do not have}} bank accounts. Instead, too many take their <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> check cashing companies that charge up to 30% or more. One of Bank on San Francisco’s top priorities will be to coordinate community-based leaders and local banks to provide low-income families with financial literacy education and free checking accounts to help them begin to achieve financial security.|$|R
5000|$|Sadly, this {{comfortable}} world came to {{a screeching}} halt in 1930 with the coming of the Great Depression. Grimly, the school held on with faculty and staff often forgoing <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> keep the school running. The end of World War II and the GI Bill saw a resurgence in enrollment and, by the mid-1960s, the [...] "college on the hill" [...] experienced an upswing comparable to the 1920s. Several new buildings now crowned the campus including four dormitories, a new library, Brengle Hall, a science building, and Stinson Hall, a classroom building containing an auditorium.|$|R
50|$|All check cashing {{assets were}} {{acquired}} in 2008 by Phoenix Check Cashing, Inc. In 2009, Phoenix Check Cashing changed its dba name from BioPay <b>Paycheck</b> Secure <b>to</b> AllTrust Networks.|$|R

50|$|This {{practice}} {{created a}} conflict between older employees, who preferred the certainty of a <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> an unreliable pension, and younger employees, who saw opportunity for increased job security if superannuated workers could be induced to retire by guaranteeing them a decent pension.|$|E
25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|R
50|$|Teachers, {{with support}} from {{students}} and parents, began an escalating campaign to restore funding to the schools and <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> the teachers. They believed that Chicago's banks had access to {{millions of dollars in}} unpaid taxes that might balance the city's budget; they were angry about the CCPE's explicitly anti-school agenda, and they were also provoked by a $90 million bank bailout from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that did nothing to help the schools. More generally, teachers were alarmed by an apparent corporate attack on education; they believed that the nation's ruling class wanted to dismantle education for the public and reserve it only for the wealthy.|$|R
50|$|Kudzu Kings is an {{alternative}} country/roots rock jam band from Oxford, Mississippi. Their sound has been categorized as a blend of country music, bluegrass and improvisational rock & roll. The band was actively together and toured aggressively for almost ten years (1994-2003). Today, Kudzu Kings play regularly in the Southeast for festivals, benefits, obscure astrological events, or big <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> tamper with their unique chemistry. In addition, members are working on various projects, both solo and with other Kudzu members; some current projects the Kings have sired are Pithecanfunkus Erectus, Tate Moore and the Cosmic Door, Effie Burt Band, Hemptones, Sparkle Pants, Blackbird Hour, and Rocket 88.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main goal}} of Kiyosaki's anecdotal {{lessons in the}} Rich Dad series of books is to create financially literate and aware persons who can support {{themselves}} on their investments alone, rather than running the [...] "rat race" [...] and living <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> <b>paycheck.</b> <b>To</b> do this they advocate investments such as real estate and small businesses. They clearly define {{the difference between an}} asset and a liability. Kiyosaki defines [...] "assets" [...] as things that generate money, such as rental properties or businesses and [...] "liabilities" [...] as things that cost money, such as house payments, cars and so on. Financial leverage is also a key component towards becoming rich. Lechter advocates learning to take existing infrastructures and systems and applying them to your project.|$|E
50|$|Under Nigerian Law, {{employees}} who make over ₦3,000 must also contribute 2.5% of their <b>paycheck</b> <b>to</b> the National Housing Fund, which {{is controlled by}} the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. Any company who fails to deduct 2.5% from a paycheck of an employer could face a fine of ₦50,000.|$|E
50|$|Fintech {{innovations}} {{have led}} to viable alternatives to overdraft fees. Simple Bank, for example, opts to decline transactions rather than extending credit to its users.

50|$|In 2014, In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>paychecks</b> being subject <b>to</b> {{the state}} taking union dues from them, Cutler {{put forth a}} proposal to have this discontinued. Cutler argued that the state ought {{to stay out of}} the handling of union dues because the state is aware that a certain percentage of union dues is used for political purposes including lobbying and paying for ads.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Porth {{was charged}} with and was later convicted of failure to deduct {{withholding}} taxes from employees' <b>paychecks,</b> failure <b>to</b> file withholding tax returns, and failure to file his own individual tax return for the year 1963. The convictions were upheld on appeal.|$|R
50|$|The next season, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's career goal-scoring {{record and}} won the scoring title, but the team began a long slide, and despite {{numerous}} player and coaching moves, they failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs again until 1998. After the financially troubled McNall was forced to sell the Kings in 1994, Gretzky's relationship with the Kings' new owners grew strained. Under both McNall and the new ownership group, the team was fiscally unstable, to the point that <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> players bounced. Finally, in early 1996, Gretzky requested a trade. During the 1994-95 NHL lock-out, Gretzky and some friends (including Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Brett Hull, and Steve Yzerman) formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played eight exhibition games in various countries.|$|R

Íris is still a host on the show after the huge buzz that ensued her participation on the house.|$|E
50|$|This did {{not seem}} to affect the AHL at first, as it {{expanded}} to 12 teams by 1970. However, to help compensate for the rise in player salaries, many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development, and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> remain with their clubs. As a result, half of the AHL's teams folded from 1974 to 1977. The league bottomed out in the summer of 1977 with news that the Rhode Island (formerly Providence) Reds - the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the 1936-37 season, and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America - had decided to cease operations after 51 years in Rhode Island.|$|R
5000|$|The label {{released}} nine {{album in}} 2010, and in 2011, the label worked on several dozen projects. Unlike many independent labels, MMG as of 2011 offered regular <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> their signed artists {{as compared to}} advances, with Tolle stating [...] "we try to provide stability, regular paychecks instead of chunk advances. This gives a little more peace of mind, and means that everyone is free to work on music... it’s also about making people {{feel like they have}} an entire career to develop, not just a fiscal quarter to show results." [...] The company continues to be based in Tucson as of 2011. Oddisee as of 2011 was working as the company's Assistant Director of Operations, while Tolle continued to serve as the company's Director of Operations.|$|R
5000|$|Scherer {{and other}} ex-columnists and reporters founded Proceso, edited by CISA. The {{first years of}} the {{magazine}} were difficult and the board had problems issuing <b>paychecks</b> <b>to</b> its staff. A year later, the director of Proceso, Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa quit to join the newspaper Unomásuno. Then Gastón García Cantú, a columnist, left the publication because of an article published in Proceso questioning his designation as director of the National Institute of Anthropology and History. During the presidency of José López Portillo(cousin of Scherer) there was a flirting with the magazine that finished with Lopez Portillo's anger, saying [...] "No pago para que me peguen (I don't pay to be beaten)" [...] and pressuring the magazine by withdrawing governmental advertisements.|$|R
