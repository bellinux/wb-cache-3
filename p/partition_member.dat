40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the hierarchical hybrid control theory presented in [3], one may pose the following hybrid modelling problem: for a given finite state machine M, find a state space X, a state space partition Π, and a controlled ODE system S on X such that the associated hierarchical hybrid partition machine M ß based upon S is a hybrid inblock controllable (HIBC) machine satisfying M ß = M. In this paper a constructive solution is given to this problem for all finite state machines. Key words: hybrid systems, hierarchical control, state space partitions, controlled ODE systems. 1 Introduction and Basic Definitions In [3] a theory of hierarchical control was introduced via the formulation of a dynamical relation between aggregated sets of system states called dynamical consistency (DC).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{dynamical}} consistency is introduced {{to define a}} high level transition function for an arbitrary partition of the state space of a finite input-state machine M. The existence of a dynamically consistent transition from a <b>partition</b> <b>member</b> X i to a member X j corresponds to the existence, for every state x in X i, of some (x dependent) control sequence which takes that state directly into X j. This paper analyses what are termed in-block controllable partition machines and between-block controllable partition machines, and establishes {{the existence of the}} associated in-block controllable hierarchical lattice IBCP (M). It is shown that any partition machine in IBCP (M) is between-block controllable if and only if the base machine M is controllable. This setting allows the specification of state to state control trajectories of M to be decomposed into high level and low level components.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Knowledge spaces {{have been}} a major tool for {{modeling}} interactive uncertainty in game theory and economics, ever since Aumann's seminal Z. paper "Agreeing to Disagree" Aumann, 1976. Player's knowledge is modeled, in a knowledge space, by ascribing to him a partition of the space. At each element of the space, called a state, he knows those events Z. i. e., subsets of the knowledge space which contain the <b>partition</b> <b>member</b> that includes the state. To describe what the players know about a game, we associate with each state a state of nature, which specifies the value of the objective parameters of the game, like the payoffs or signals. In this way, it is possible to describe what each player knows, in each state, Z. * This is a revised version of part of the material in Heifetz and Samet 1993.

40|$|Abstract — an {{important}} issue in WSN is the regional covering. A coverage algorithm {{should be able to}} solve this issue by considering the power consumption to improve the network lifetime. This requires employing the lowest number of sensors. A solution is just to turn on a subset of nodes. This subset should be chosen in such a way to cover the entire region. This can be achieved by partitioning the network nodes and considering a representative for each part in a time slice to perform the responsibilities of all the <b>partition</b> <b>members</b> for full coverage. This will lead to turn on some of the nodes in a time slice rather than all of them. This paper presents a novel algorithm that employs grouping and time scheduling sensor nodes to turn some of them on to cover the entire area. In this algorithm the sensing range of the nodes depends on their energy. The cluster head denotes the sensing range and also turn on time slice of each node by considering node’s remained energy and position.

However, if members are not evenly distributed based on these options of requirements or there is no sufficient members, a lot of sparse nodes (groups without member or just with few members) will be generated. The tree with many sparse nodes is not desired since it leads to poor searching performance. In order to avoid generating too many sparse nodes, a classification threshold is predefined. When the number {{of members of the}} current processing node is less than the classification threshold, {{it is not necessary to}} continue the partition process.|$|R

In each cluster, a Fibonacci multicast tree is constructed by recursively <b>partitioning</b> the <b>member</b> sequence into two halves with different length.

We <b>partition</b> the <b>members</b> into topologically-aware clusters based on the ordering of their close landmarks.

Our results on performance evaluation show that constructing topologically-aware data paths can reduce unnecessary high latency and redundant network resource usage with low overhead over existing scalable approaches.

Our main contributions are as follows.

The result is not only interesting in itself but also essential to derive the first known analytical bounds for the throughput of multicast flow control. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve not only the list partition problem but also the optimal paging problem and the problem of bulk data transfer using multiple multicast groups. The complexity of our algorithm is one order less than the best known algorithm designed only for the problem of bulk data transfer using multiple multicast groups in the literature.
