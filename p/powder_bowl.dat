50|$|The slopes on {{both sides}} of the road leading up to the resort—known as Powder Country—are served by a bus that will pick riders up at a waiting area halfway down the access road. There is also an $18 per-ride Snowcat service up Lightning Ridge (very close to James Peak). James Peak is one of the premier <b>powder</b> <b>bowl</b> runs in Utah.|$|E
50|$|Lost Trail has two parks {{to offer}} known as Front Country and Powder Park. Front Country, located {{directly}} in front of the lodge, has a variety of jumps to provide big air. Powder Park, located in <b>Powder</b> <b>Bowl,</b> is known for its more natural terrain features including its natural bumps and jumps making it a beginners dream. Powder Park as well as Front Country can be found off of Chair #1.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} good spots for off-piste skiing and snowboarding, {{the best of}} which are: {{to the sides of}} 'Yeti', the long black run off Chamossiere and also by taking a short hike {{from the top of the}} Ranfoilly lift. the latter has been rated as one of the best off-piste <b>powder</b> <b>bowls</b> in Europe (although there is very often a medium chance of avalanches).|$|R
5000|$|Today Mt Potts Station is {{a working}} cattle farm, {{restaurant}} and lodge, which doubles up as a heliski {{base in the}} winter. Unlike normal resorts, there are no fixed ski tows or chairlifts. Instead, vertical transport is provided by snowcats and helicopter. The ski area covers 660 hectares and includes, [...] "steep faces, chutes, rocks to drop off, cornices, wide open <b>powder</b> <b>bowls</b> and gullies" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{resurgence}} {{of interest in}} snowshoeing in the late 20th century was in some part due to snowboarders, who took to them {{as a way to}} reach backcountry <b>powder</b> <b>bowls</b> and other areas while they were still banned from most ski areas. Their similarities to snowboards, in shape and binding, led many of them to continue use even after snowboarders were allowed to use most ski slopes. Despite most ski areas now allowing snowboarders, there is a growing interest in backcountry and sidecountry snowboarding in the search for fresh powder. The recent development of splitboards has enabled snowboarders to access backcountry without the need for snowshoes.|$|R
5000|$|High Campbell [...] "Chair 6" [...] Replacement (C-2) {{provided}} direct lift {{access to}} the area around Silver Queen and the Southback area. Previously, this area was served by a fixed-grip double known as High Campbell. The old chair was destroyed by an avalanche in March 2014 and was inoperable. The new lift is a fixed-grip double chairlift from HTM Skytrac, installed {{in the summer of}} 2014 with a top terminal on Silver Queen at 7002', still providing access to <b>Powder</b> <b>Bowl,</b> Southback and Campbell Basin. The new chair can withstand higher winds than the original.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Although highly {{effective}} in plaque and stain removal, {{the use of}} air polishing devices (APDs) on denuded root surfaces may lead to clinically relevant loss of tooth substance. As the amount of powder emitted by an APD may {{have a significant impact}} on the safety and efficacy of the instruments, the purpose of the study was to quantify the amount of powder emitted by APDs depending on their powder filling status and powder setting. Methods: Four different APDs were filled to maximum level and the cumulative amount of powder emitted, depending on instrument settings and filling status, was quantified during 15 subsequent 120 -s periods of use. Differences in powder emission were analyzed using ANOVA repeated measures. Results: Exact powder dosage was possible in one APD only (Dentsply Prophyjet®) where emission rates also remained constant over the first five periods assessed. In the three other APDs assessed (EMS Air-Flow®, Satellec Air-Max®, KaVo Prophyflex II®) powder emission depended on the amount of powder present in the powder chamber and declined with ongoing use. Changes in powder setting had a significant impact on powder emission in all APDs assessed, apart from the KaVo Prophyflex II® unit. Conclusions: Powder emission of APDs may vary greatly depending on the amount of powder present in the <b>powder</b> <b>bowl.</b> Therefore, instrument powder setting may not be a reliable parameter for safety and efficacy adjustments. This should be considered in clinical applications as well as in future research. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
50|$|Zorio's Senza titolo (untitled) is a performative sculpture. Zorio took a {{bowl and}} filled it {{with a mix of}} bright yellow sulphur powder and iron <b>powder.</b> In the <b>bowl</b> of <b>powder</b> is a {{magnetic}} handle. As the participant drags the handle along the powder, it picks up the black iron powder thus creating black marks across the surface. Eventually the handle loses its magnetic pull and the iron will start falling back into the sulphur mixture.|$|R
5000|$|Brass broidered coconut shell {{craft of}} Kerala is {{the craft of}} making beautifully carved and brass broidered {{products}} like cups, flower vases, snuff boxes, nut <b>bowls,</b> <b>powder</b> boxes and spoons using coconut shells as practiced by the artisans of Kerala in India. This art requires great skill {{on the part of}} the artisan as the shell is extremely hard. The main centres of production in Kerala are located in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode Districts. Though the coconut shell craft is also prevalent in Goa, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and West Bengal, the brass broidered variety is practiced only in Kerala.|$|R
