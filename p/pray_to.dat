5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E
5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested {{him to go}} to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
50|$|Legend {{says that}} when Agasthiyar came to this vanam (forest), he <b>prayed</b> <b>to</b> this goddess. Markandeya also <b>prayed</b> <b>to</b> this goddess. The full name of the village is “Kathir Veaintha Mangalam”. The Tamil Poet Kambar <b>prayed</b> <b>to</b> this goddess when he wrote the Ramayana. He lived {{here for a long}} time. In all Shaivite temples Durga is one among the Deities., but Kathiramangalam has a {{separate}} temple for Durga ialone Here the Durga is in the Padma Peedam whereas in other temples Durga is in Simma or Mahisha Vahanam. The Temple faces east.|$|R

5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E
5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E

Yes, there they <b>prayed</b> <b>to</b> a golden locust standing on an altar in a sanctuary that was surrounded by crystal coffins wherein rested the flesh of former kings of the land. To me the sight was pitiful, but Bes asked me what was the difference between <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> a locust and <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> images with the heads of beasts, or to a dwarf shaped as he was like we did in Egypt, and I could not answer him.|$|R

50|$|<b>Praying</b> <b>to</b> the Anima Sola is a {{tradition}} in many ways unlike that of the more widespread cult of saints. In lieu of <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> a saint who then appeals to God, the Anima Sola represents souls in purgatory who require the assistance both of {{the living and the}} divine to ameliorate their infernal sufferings.|$|R
