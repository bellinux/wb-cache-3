2500|$|Disposal {{of solid}} waste is most {{commonly}} conducted in landfills, but incineration, recycling, composting and conversion to biofuels are also avenues. [...] In the case of landfills, advanced countries typically have rigid protocols for daily cover with topsoil, where underdeveloped countries customarily rely upon less stringent protocols. [...] The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of pathogens. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for <b>perimeter</b> <b>sealing</b> of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of leachate that could contaminate groundwater (and hence jeopardize some drinking water supplies).|$|E

Joints and cracks in the concrete were treated with an acrylic resin where the <b>perimeter</b> <b>seal</b> crosses the joint to prevent reservoir water bypassing the <b>perimeter</b> <b>seal.</b> A reinforced concrete wave wall was constructed to the same dimensions and levels as the existing but it extended into the high ground at {{the left and right}} ends of the dam. Finally, riprap erosion protection was laid at the left hand end of the dam to arrest erosion of the embankment. The material for the erosion protection was sourced from the reservoir basin.|$|R

2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} {{double-glazed}} windows transmit heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>seals.</b> The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|R
40|$|Giardia intestinalis is a {{ubiquitous}} parasitic protist {{that is the}} causative {{agent of}} giardiasis, {{one of the most}} common protozoan diarrheal diseases in the world. Giardia trophozoites attach to the intestinal epithelium using a specialized and elaborate microtubule structure, the ventral disc. Surrounding the ventral disc is a less characterized putatively contractile structure, the lateral crest, which forms a continuous <b>perimeter</b> <b>seal</b> with the substrate. A better understanding of ventral disc and lateral crest structure, conformational dynamics, and biogenesis is critical for understanding the mechanism of giardial attachment to the host. To determine the components comprising the ventral disc and lateral crest, we used shotgun proteomics to identify proteins in a preparation of isolated ventral discs. Candidate disc-associated proteins, or DAPs, were GFP-tagged using a ligation-independent high-throughput cloning method. Based on disc localization, we identified eighteen novel DAPs, which more than doubles the number of known disc-associated proteins. Ten of the novel DAPs are associated with the lateral crest or outer edge of the disc, and are the first confirmed components of this structure. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) with representative novel DAP::GFP strains we found that the newly identified DAPs tested did not recover after photobleaching and are therefore structural components of the ventral disc or lateral crest. Functional analyses of the novel DAPs will be central toward understanding the mechanism of ventral disc-mediated attachment and the mechanism of disc biogenesis during cell division. Since attachment of Giardia to th...|$|R

40|$|Giardia trophozoites {{attach to}} the {{intestinal}} microvilli (or inert surfaces) using an undefined "suction-based" mechanism, and remain attached during cell division to avoid peristalsis. Flagellar motility is {{a key factor in}} Giardia's pathogenesis and colonization of the host small intestine. Specifically, the beating of the ventral flagella, one of four pairs of motile flagella, has been proposed to generate a hydrodynamic force that results in suction-based attachment via the adjacent ventral disc. We aimed to test this prevailing "hydrodynamic model" of attachment mediated by flagellar motility. We defined four distinct stages of attachment by assessing surface contacts of the trophozoite with the substrate during attachment using TIRF microscopy (TIRFM). The lateral crest of the ventral disc forms a continuous <b>perimeter</b> <b>seal</b> with the substrate, a cytological indication that trophozoites are fully attached. Using trophozoites with two types of molecularly engineered defects in flagellar beating, we determined that neither ventral flagellar beating, nor any flagellar beating, is necessary for the maintenance of attachment. Following a morpholino-based knockdown of PF 16, a central pair protein, both the beating and morphology of flagella were defective, but trophozoites could still initiate proper surface contacts as seen using TIRFM and could maintain attachment in several biophysical assays. Trophozoites with impaired motility were able to attach as well as motile cells. We also generated a strain with defects in the ventral flagellar waveform by overexpressing a dominant negative form of alpha 2 -annexin::GFP (D 122 A, D 275 A). This dominant negative alpha 2 -annexin strain could initiate attachment and had only a slight decrease in the ability to withstand normal and shear forces. The time needed for attachment did increase in trophozoites with overall defective flagellar beating, however. Thus while not directly required for attachment, flagellar motility is important for positioning and orienting trophozoites prior to attachment. Drugs affecting flagellar motility may result in lower levels of attachment by indirectly limiting the number of parasites that can position the ventral disc properly against a surface and against peristaltic flow...|$|R
40|$|A paper {{presents}} {{first stage}} {{of the research on}} the role of the shaft surface roughness in lubrication and wear of the oil lip seals. Surface roughness of the shafts was characterized by means of the selected roughness parameters. Short term tests of the oil lip seals revealed that torque as well as the oil lip wear are greatly affected by the ratio of the profile height and average radius of curvature of all shaft irregularities, ordinates distribution across the profile height as well as by mean slope of the profile. It was found that some of the oil lip seals had uneven wear track over lip <b>perimeter.</b> These <b>seals</b> had lower power consumption than those with symmetrical lip wear. The lack of the symmetry in contact conditions over the lip perimeter renders the relation between the shaft surface roughness and the lip wear to be not so distinct...|$|R

40|$|This work builds upon discoveries by the University of Pennsylvania {{and others}} {{pertaining}} to the oxidation of dry hydrocarbon fuels in high temperature solid oxide fuel cells. The work reported here was restricted primarily to dry methane and confirms that YSZ-based cells, having ceria in the anode as a catalyst and copper in the anode as a current collector, can operate on dry methane for extended periods. Thirty-three lab-scale cells of various designs were fabricated and operated {{under a variety of}} conditions. The longest-lived cell gave stable performance on dry methane at 800 C for over 305 hours. Only slight carbon deposition was noted at the completion of the test. A corresponding nickel/YSZ-based anode would have lasted for less than an hour under these test conditions (which included open circuit potential measurements) before carbon fouling essentially destroyed the cell. The best performing cell achieved 112 mW/cm{sub 2 } on dry methane at 800 C. Several problems were encountered with carbon fouling and declining open circuit voltages in many of the test cells after switching from operation on hydrogen to dry methane. Although not rigorously confirmed by experimentation, the results suggested that air infiltration through less than perfect <b>perimeter</b> <b>seals</b> or pinholes in the electrolytes, or both gave rise to conditions that caused the carbon fouling and OCV decline. Small amounts of air reacting with methane in a partial oxidation reaction could produce carbon monoxide that, in turn, would deposit the carbon. If this mechanism is confirmed, it implies that near perfect hardware is required for extended operation. Some evidence was also found for the formation of electrical shorts, probably from carbon deposits bridging the electrolyte. Work with odorized methane and with methane containing 100 -ppm hydrogen sulfide confirmed that copper is stable at 800 C in dry hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of sulfur. In a number of cases, but not exclusively, the performance life on dry methane with sulfur compounds was much longer than with dry methane alone. The effect of sulfur compounds in these cases appeared to correlate with inhibition of carbon deposition. Mixed results were obtained for the effect of the sulfur compounds on power density. Progress also was made in understanding the mechanisms involved in direct utilization of dry natural gas. Evidence was developed for three possible mechanisms for dry methane utilization in addition to the usually cited mechanism [...] direct oxidation of methane by oxygen anions. Further work is required at a fundamental level before the knowledge gained here can be translated into higher levels of performance...|$|R
5000|$|The Great Seal of the State of Nevada {{is derived}} from the Seal of the Territory of Nevada. As Nevada {{prepared}} for statehood in 1864, its Constitutional Convention began to formalize the features of the state's official seel. Nevada was admitted as a state on October 31, 1864 by proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln. On February 24, 1866, the motto [...] "Volens et Potens" [...] ("Willing and Able") was replaced by [...] "All for Our Country". The design of the seal was formalized, and Nevada's mineral resources are featured with a silver miner and his team moving a carload of ore from a mountain in the foreground. A quartz mill stands before another mountain. Transportation and communication are symbolized by a train steaming across the background, with telegraph poles spanning the distance. Agriculture is represented by a sheaf of wheat, a sickle, and a plow in the foreground. Nevada's natural environment is symbolized by a brilliant sun rising over snow-capped peaks. The inner circle of the seal carries the motto [...] "All for Our Country", and Nevada's entry into the Union as the 36th state is shown with 36 stars completing the inner ring. The <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>seal</b> proclaims [...] "The Great Seal of the State of Nevada". Mark Twain was said to have convinced the designer to make the two trails of smoke blow in opposite directions as a prank, which was later rectified when the mistake was realized.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} unfortunate {{legacies}} of more than 100 years of mining in the Central Witwatersrand Mining Basin {{is the presence of}} many unsafe mine related openings such as shafts and subsidences that are present {{in the southern part of}} the city of Johannesburg. Using available mine plans and knowledge of the manner in which these holes were formed, a search was undertaken and a total of 244 openings were located. A literature survey revealed that <b>perimeter</b> walls, concrete <b>seals</b> and plugs have most often been used to prevent human access to these unsafe mine openings. Locally mine openings have most often been backfilled with available materials though concrete plugs or seals, walls and fences have also commonly been used. In order to assess which holes should be considered for sealing, a simple “hole risk rating system” was developed, which considered the depth of the hole and its proximity to settlements or thoroughfares. During a Department of Minerals and Energy project led by the author, it was concluded that concrete plugs were probably the most effective method of sealing such unsafe mine openings. Eighty holes were thus sealed using unreinforced, concrete plugs. Polyurethane Foam (PUF) has been used as an alternative method to seal mine openings in the United States for nearly 25 years and was used here to seal two abandoned mine openings. This method requires minimal design, engineering supervision and offers a quick, simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly method of sealing such openings. The documentation of the mine openings, the openings plugged, the methods of plugging and the locations of the plugged holes ia a valuable practical and historical record. The plugging of many holes is a significant contribution to public safety...|$|R
