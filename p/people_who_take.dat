Rare but serious side effects include prolonged erections, {{which can lead to}} damage to the penis, and sudden-onset hearing loss. Sildenafil should not be taken by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> nitrates such as nitroglycerin (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include sleepiness, poor coordination, and agitation. Long-term use {{may result in}} tolerance, dependence, and {{withdrawal}} symptoms if stopped abruptly. Dependence occurs in one-third of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> clonazepam for longer than four weeks. It may increase risk of suicide in people who are depressed.

25|$|Clozapine {{carries a}} black box warning for drug-induced {{agranulocytosis}}. Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> clozapine {{during the first}} few months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.|$|E
25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs {{gabapentin}} and pregabalin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. Gabapentin may be of significant benefit for pain relief in about 35% of people with fibromyalgia. It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> gabapentin to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{may be used}} {{to treat}} musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate may be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, hair loss, stomach aches/cramps, headache, liver toxicity, and increased risk of infections. Also, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop cancer later.|$|E

25|$|The {{sport of}} surfing now {{represents}} a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. The World Surf League (WSL) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors {{in some of}} the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers.Sixty-six surfboarders on a 42-foot surfboard set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a surfboard at one time.As for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> it more seriously, such as Dale Webster, he consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.|$|E

Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.|$|E

[...] Even if 'objective' changes are not documented in people's lives, it is noteworthy that people feel happier, more satisfied, more relaxed, and more 'alive.'

500|$|The {{comments}} of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or {{cited in the}} writings of mass media commentators.

In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together". In another case, writer Ian Maxtone-Graham made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with The Independent, calling them [...] "beetle-browed" [...] and saying, [...] "That's why they're on the Internet and we're writing the show." [...] Writer Bill Oakley used to respond to select Simpsons fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed [...] "here are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> it seriously to the point of absurdity".
