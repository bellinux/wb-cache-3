50|$|<b>Piritramide</b> was {{developed}} and patented in Belgium, at Janssen, in 1960.

50|$|<b>Piritramide</b> (R-3365, {{trade names}} Dipidolor, Piridolan, Pirium and others) is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic (narcotic painkiller) that is marketed in certain European countries including: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands. It comes in free form, is about 0.75x times as potent as morphine and is given parenterally (by injection) {{for the treatment}} of severe pain. Nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and constipation are believed to be less frequent with <b>piritramide</b> than with morphine (the gold standard opioid against which other opioids are compared and contrasted), and it produces more rapid-onset analgesia (pain relief) when compared to morphine and pethidine. After intravenous administration the onset of analgesia is as little as 1-2 minutes, which may be related to its great lipophilicity. The analgesic and sedative effects of <b>piritramide</b> are believed to be potentiated with phenothiazines and its emetic (nausea/vomiting-inducing) effects are suppressed. The volume of distribution is 0.7-1 L/kg after a single dose, 4.7-6 L/kg after steady-state concentrations are achieved and up to 11.1 L/kg after prolonged dosing.|$|E

50|$|Diphenoxylate is the {{prototype}} of a small subfamily of opioids (the phenylpiperidines) including difenoxin (diphenoxylic acid), an active metabolite of diphenoxylate produced in the human body, and loperamide, which unlike the former two works exclusively in the intestines because it only crosses the blood-brain barrier in very small amounts. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956. It is a congener to the narcotic pethidine. Other somewhat more distant relatives include alphaprodine and <b>piritramide.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 is an {{international}} treaty to prohibit production and supply of specific (nominally narcotic) drugs and of drugs with similar effects except under licence for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research. As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide; research on fentanyls and <b>piritramide</b> was also nearing fruition at that point.|$|E
5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as <b>piritramide</b> and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Piritramide</b> is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic which {{is commonly used}} for postoperative analgesia. It is structurally related to meperidine, exhibiting full mu-receptor agonism. Pharmacokinetic data of the drug have not been reported so far. METHODS: Plasma protein binding of <b>piritramide</b> was studied in vitro. The kinetics were examined after a single intravenous bolus (0. 2 mg/kg) in 10 male patients aged 22 - 53 years undergoing elective minor surgery. Plasma and urine concentrations were determined by gas chromatography in samples drawn {{before and after the}} bolus. The concentration vs. time data were evaluated by nonlinear regression analysis, and the mean values and SD of the individual pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. A three-compartment body model was fitted to the data. RESULTS: The volume of distribution at steady state was 4. 7 (0. 7) l/kg, systemic plasma clearance was 7. 8 (1. 5) (mean (SD)) ml/kg/min. Renal clearance of unchanged <b>piritramide</b> was negligible (0. 13 (0. 09) ml/kg/min). The terminal elimination half-life was 8. 0 (1. 4) h. In vitro, the free fraction in plasma of <b>piritramide</b> did not change over the therapeutic concentration range (5. 5 (1. 3) % at a pH of 7. 35) but decreased considerably with pH within the physiological range. CONCLUSION: Since the elimination half-life of <b>piritramide</b> appears to exceed the duration of clinically effective analgesia observed during the treatment of acute pain, the dose of <b>piritramide</b> should be titrated carefully during long-term treatment to avoid accumulation that may lead to adverse effects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{question}} whether some opioids exert less respiratory depression than others {{has not been}} answered conclusively. We applied pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling to obtain {{an estimate of the}} C 50 for the depression of CO 2 elimination as a measure of the respiratory depressant potency of alfentanil and <b>piritramide,</b> two opioids with vastly different pharmacokinetics and apparent respiratory depressant action. METHODS: Twenty-three patients received either alfentanil (2. 3 microg x kg(- 1) x min- 1, 14 patients, as published previously) or <b>piritramide</b> (17. 9 microg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1), nine patients) until significant respiratory depression occurred. Opioid pharmacokinetics and the arterial PCO 2 (PaCO 2) were determined from frequent arterial blood samples. An indirect response model accounting for the respiratory stimulation due to increasing PaCO 2 was used to describe the PaCO 2 data. RESULTS: The following pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated with NONMEM [population means and interindividual variability (CV) ]: k(elCO 2) (elimination rate constant of CO 2) 0. 144 (-) min(- 1), F (gain of the CO 2 response) 4. 0 (fixed according to literature values) (28 %), C 50 (both drugs) 61. 3 microg l- 1 (41 %), k(eo alfentanil) 0. 654 (-) min(- 1) and k(eo <b>piritramide)</b> 0. 023 (-) min(- 1). Assigning separate C 50 values for alfentanil and <b>piritramide</b> did not improve the fit compared with a model with the same C 50. CONCLUSION: Since the C 50 values did not differ, both drugs are equally potent respiratory depressants. The apparently lower respiratory depressant effect of <b>piritramide</b> when compared with alfentanil is caused by slower equilibration between the plasma and the effect site. Generalizing our results and based on simulations we conclude that slowly equilibrating opioids like <b>piritramide</b> are intrinsically safer with regard to respiratory depression than rapidly equilibrating opioids like alfentanil. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The concentration-effect {{relationship}} of <b>piritramide,</b> a synthetic opioid analgesic predominantly used for postoperative analgesia and analgosedation, {{has not been}} reported so far. METHODS: Twenty-four patients of both genders aged 58. 1 (11. 7) yr (mean (SD)) received inhalational anaesthesia for abdominal surgery. Postoperative pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Analgesia was provided with <b>piritramide,</b> infused {{at a rate of}} 7 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1 until analgesia was considered sufficient (VAS < 25) or up to a maximum dose of 0. 2 mg/kg. The plasma concentrations of <b>piritramide</b> were determined by gas chromatography. An inhibitory fractional sigmoid Emax-model was used to describe the relation between effect site concentration and perceived pain. RESULTS: The equilibration half-life between plasma and effect site concentrations (T 1 / 2 (keo)) was 16. 8 min (median; range: 4. 4 - 41. 6 min). The steady-state plasma concentration required to produce 50 % of maximum analgesia (EC 50) was 12. 1 ng/ml (range: 2. 9 - 29. 8 ng/ml) and correlated with initial pain intensity. The slope factor gamma was 1. 9 (range: 0. 5 - 6. 1) and increased with age. Clinically relevant respiratory depression did not occur. Due to the relatively large equilibration half-life of the effect compartment, the context-sensitive half-time of the effect site concentrations after short-time administration (< 2 h) clearly exceeded those of alfentanil, sufentanil, and fentanyl. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic effect of <b>piritramide</b> was adequately described by an inhibitory fractional Emax-model.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the influence of bolus size on efficacy, opioid consumption, side effects and patient satisfaction during i. v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in 60 patients (ASA I-II, aged 32 - 82 yr) after abdominal surgery.

40|$|Background. Successful {{management}} of postoperative pain requires that adequate analgesia is achieved without excessive adverse effects. Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting {{is known to}} impair patients ' satisfaction, {{but there are no}} studies providing suf®cient power to test the hypothesis that the incidence of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting differs between m-opioid receptor agonists. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the incidence of vomiting and nausea differs between morphine and <b>piritramide.</b> Methods. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, we administered either morphine (n= 250) or <b>piritramide</b> (n= 250) by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for post-operative pain relief. We used a bolus dose of 1. 5 mg with a lockout time of 10 min. Incidence and intensity (numerical rating scale) of postoperative nausea, vomiting, pain, patient satisfac-tion (score 0 ± 10), side-effects (score 0 ± 3) and drug consumption were measured. Results. Mean drug consumption did not differ between the <b>piritramide</b> and morphine groups (30. 8 (SD 22. 4) mg day± 1 vs 28. 4 (21. 8) mg day± 1) during the ®rst postoperative day and there were no signi®cant differences in the overall incidence of nausea (30 % vs 27 %) and vomiting (19 % vs 15 %). Intensity of nausea correlated inversely (P= 0. 01) with morphine consumption but not with <b>piritramide</b> consumption. Pain scores both at rest (2. 2 (1. 9) vs 2. 6 (2)) and during movement (4. 4 (2. 2) vs 4. 9 (2. 3)) were slightly but signi®cantly less with morphine. Conclusions. Opioid-induced emesis was observed in about one-third of the patients using morphine and <b>piritramide</b> for PCA and the incidence of vomiting was one-half of that. Potential differences in the incidence of vomiting during PCA therapy between these m-opioid receptor agonists can be excluded...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics of the micro-agonist opioid pirinitramide (<b>piritramide)</b> after prolonged administration. METHODS: Nine patients requiring intensive care therapy and artificial ventilation for several days received <b>piritramide</b> with a median infusion rate of 5 mg h(- 1) (range 4. 8 - 10 mg h(- 1)) for a median period of 69. 9 h (range 49 - 89 h) for analgesia and sedation. After the end of the infusion, frequent arterial blood samples were withdrawn for 96 h and assayed for <b>piritramide</b> using a gas chromatographic method. Standard compartmental models were fitted to the individual concentration-time courses to characterize the elimination of <b>piritramide</b> after prolonged administration. RESULTS: The concentration-time course after the end of the infusion was adequately described with a three-compartment model in eight patients and a two-compartment model in one patient (standard two-stage geometric mean and 16 - 84 % quantile: volumes of distribution V 1 = 47. 9 (26. 8 - 85. 8) L, V 2 = 402 (241 - 672) L, V 3 = 332 (124 - 885) L; clearances Cl 1 = 66. 5 (53. 2 - 83. 0) Lh(- 1), Cl 2 = 215 (125 - 369) Lh(- 1), Cl 3 = 18. 4 (9. 2 - 36. 8) Lh(- 1)). Both the steady-state volume of distribution (782 L) and the terminal elimination half-life (17. 4 h) were larger than predicted from single bolus pharmacokinetic studies (412. 5 L and 10. 4 h, respectively), the context-sensitive half-time after more than 72 h of administration was 32 % shorter than predicted (285 vs. 420 min). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing terminal elimination half-life and volume of distribution at steady state (increasing drug load for a given plasma concentration), the context-sensitive half-time of <b>piritramide</b> after 3 days of administration is lower than predicted from bolus kinetics, making the drug a suitable candidate for intensive care unit analgesia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Piritramide</b> is a {{synthetic}} opioid used for postoperative analgesia in several European countries. The authors present a mixed-effects model {{of its population}} pharmacokinetics in patients undergoing surgery. METHODS: After institutional approval and informed patient consent was obtained, 29 patients who were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and aged 21 - 82 yr {{were enrolled in the}} study. They received 0. 2 mg/kg <b>piritramide</b> as an intravenous bolus before anesthesia was induced. Central venous blood samples were drawn for as long as 48 h after administration of the drug. The plasma concentration of <b>piritramide</b> was determined by gas chromatography. The concentration-time data were analyzed by mixed-effects modeling. Target-controlled infusions and intermittent bolus regimens were simulated to identify a regimen suitable for patient-controlled analgesia based on population pharmacokinetics and published pharmacodynamic data. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of <b>piritramide</b> were described adequately by a linear three-compartment model. Patient age and weight were significant covariates. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters are: V 1 = 50. 5 [1], V 2 = 150 x (1 + 9. 32 x 10 (- 3) x (age - 47 yr)) [l], V 3 = 212 x (1 + 6. 37 x 10 (- 3) x (age - 47 yr)) [l], Cl 1 = 0. 56 x (1 - 6. 14 x 10 (- 3) x (age - 47 yr)) [l/min], Cl 2 = 8. 25 x (1 + 2. 02 x 10 (- 2) x (Wt - 74 kg)) [l/min], Cl 3 = 0. 80 [l/min]. The age of 47 yr and the weight of 74 kg refer to the median values for these factors in the patients studied. Rapid distribution, slow distribution, and elimination half-lives for the median patient are 0. 05, 1. 34, and 10. 43 h, respectively. The context-sensitive half-time after a 24 -h infusion is predicted at 10. 5 h in a 75 -yr-old patient compared with 7 h for the median patient.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{efficacy}} and {{side effects of}} a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine for postoperative pain relief after lumbar disc surgery. In 36 of 51 patients who accepted the procedure, an epidural catheter was inserted (L 1 -L 2 level). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in O 2 /N 2 O. After emergence from anesthesia, epidural analgesia was initiated according to two randomly assigned protocols: 1 mg of morphine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group M) or 12. 5 mg of bupivacaine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group B), in 10 mL saline. <b>Piritramide</b> was administered during the first postoperative 24 hours using a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). The following parameters were recorded: <b>piritramide</b> consumption during the first 24 hours; pain at rest during the first postoperative hours (D 0), during the first night (D 1), and during the first mobilization; [visual analogue scale (VAS) ]; and the occurrence of drowsiness, motor blockade, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching, micturition problems, and bladder catheterization during D 0 and D 1. Epidural administration of morphine-clonidine significantly improved postoperative pain relief and reduced <b>piritramide</b> consumption as compared to epidural bupivacaine-clonidine. Side effects did not differ between groups except for {{a higher incidence of}} micturition problems in Group M during D 1. The occurrence of bladder catheterization was not significantly higher in that group. We conclude that a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine offers a better postoperative analgesia than does bupivacaine-clonidine. The excellent analgesic conditions were obtained at the expense of a higher incidence of difficulties in initiating micturition. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), headache typically is severe and often requires treatment with opioids. Magnesium has analgesic effects in several conditions, {{but whether it}} reduces headache after SAH is unknown. METHODS: In a cohort of 108 SAH patients included in the randomised controlled trial Magnesium in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage-II (MASH-II), severity of headache was regularly assessed on an 11 -point scale until day 10 after SAH. Headache was treated according to a standardised protocol with acetaminophen, codeine, tramadol or <b>piritramide.</b> Serum magnesium levels were assessed every other day. Differences in mean headache scores between {{patients with}} mean high (> 1. 0 mmol/l) and normal (<or = 1. 0 mmol/l) magnesium levels were analysed with a Student t test. Crude and adjusted ORs {{for the use of}} codeine, tramadol and <b>piritramide</b> for patients with high versus normal magnesium levels were calculated with logistic regression. RESULTS: The 61 patients with high magnesium levels had lower mean headache scores (4. 1) than the 47 patients with normal magnesium levels (4. 9; mean difference, 0. 8; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 1. 6) and required less tramadol (adjusted OR, 0. 3; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 7) or <b>piritramide</b> (adjusted OR 0. 2; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 5). There were no differences in the use of acetaminophen or codeine. CONCLUSION: In SAH patients, elevated serum magnesium levels are associated with slightly less severe headache and less frequent use of opioids. These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcom...|$|E
40|$|A randomized, open-label, {{comparative}} study was undertaken {{to assess the}} analgesic efficacy of piroxicam and <b>piritramide</b> in 57 inpatients who underwent orthopedic/traumatologic surgery. They received either piroxicam 40 mg or <b>piritramide</b> 20 mg in a single intramuscular (IM) dose after surgery and a second IM dose the next morning, Supplemental analgesic medication (usually paracetamol) was given at the patient's request during the postoperative period. Up to 3 days after surgery, both drugs were highly effective, relieved the pain significantly (P < 0. 001), and were rated statistically equivalent on three pain scales. No difference was detected {{between the two groups}} regarding the need for supplemental analgesic medication, except on day 2, when 36 % of the piritramide-treated patients requested supplemental analgesics versus 8 % of piroxicam-treated patients. A low incidence of mainly mild side effects was reported with both medications. Results confirm those of short-term postoperative/posttraumatologic and other pain studies in which piroxicam provided good analgesia and was well tolerated. The two agents studied provided comparable and significant pain relief after orthopedic/ traumatologic surgery. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|After {{achieving}} {{a reduction of}} pain scores for 10 h with a single dose wound infiltration after shoulder surgery, we examined in a prospective, placebo-controlled and double-blinded study the analgesic effects of continuous wound infiltration with different concentrations of ropivacaine. Forty-five patients undergoing shoulder surgery were randomly assigned into three groups to receive single dose wound infiltration with 30 mL saline (group S) or ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/mL (groups R 2 and R 3. 75) after skin closure. Postoperatively, patients received a continuous wound infiltration with saline (group S), ropivacaine 2 mg/mL (group R 2) or ropivacaine 3. 75 mg/mL (group R 3. 75) for 48 h. Supplemental pain relief was provided by IV patient-controlled analgesia with the opioid <b>piritramide.</b> At 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 h postoperatively visual analogue scale (VAS) values (0 - 100 mm), <b>piritramide</b> requirements and side effects were registered. Plasma levels of ropivacaine were measured preoperatively and at 24 h and 48 h after surgery. Until 48 h VAS values were smaller in group R 3. 75 compared with group S (group R 3. 75, 8 +/- 9 mm; group S, 31 +/- 14 mm; P < 0. 005), whereas 4 h and 48 h postoperatively VAS values were even smaller in group R 3. 75 compared with group R 2 (P < 0. 05). Cumulative <b>piritramide</b> consumption was always smaller in groups R 2 and R 3. 75 compared with group S (1 - 24 h, P < 0. 005; 48 h, P < 0. 05). Plasma ropivacaine levels remained less than the toxic threshold. We conclude that continuous postoperative wound infiltration with ropivacaine, especially using 3. 75 mg/mL, provides smaller VAS values and opioid requirement in comparison with saline after shoulder surgery. IMPLICATIONS: The continuous postoperative wound infiltration after shoulder surgery with different concentrations of ropivacaine, 2 mg/mL and 3. 75 mg/mL, results in lower pain scores and opioid requirement compared with infiltration with placebo. Plasma levels of ropivacaine remained less than the toxic threshold...|$|E
