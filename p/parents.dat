5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both <b>parents</b> participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both <b>parents</b> brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the <b>parents</b> take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both <b>parents</b> feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending <b>parents</b> call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the <b>parents</b> bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the <b>parents</b> for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E

Participants included 85 Chinese immigrant mothers and their pre-school children. Mothers reported on their <b>parenting</b> style, psychological well-being, per-ceived <b>parenting</b> support and stress, and children’s hyperactivity/attention. Teacher ratings of child adjustment were also obtained. Results revealed that Chinese immigrant mothers of preschoolers strongly endorsed the authoritative <b>parenting</b> style. Moreover, authoritative <b>parenting</b> predicted increased children’s behavioral/attention regulation abilities (lower hyperactivity/inattention), which then predicted decreased teacher rated child difficulties. Finally, mothers with greater psychological well-being or <b>parenting</b> support engaged in more authoritative <b>parenting,</b> but only under conditions of low <b>parenting</b> stress.

Recent surveys indicate that Japanese society remains ambivalent {{about the need for}} fathers to be involved in child rearing. This {{article examines}} why these attitudes and ideas persist and how the Japanese media, specifically Japanese <b>parenting</b> magazines, may contribute to perpetuating traditional attitudes towards <b>parenting</b> roles. The article explores how <b>parenting</b> is represented in text and visual elements of contemporary popular <b>parenting</b> magazines, with comparisons made between the distinct approaches of selected Japanese and English-language <b>parenting</b> magazines. The findings indicate that narrow and stereotypical representations of mothers and fathers remain common in the Japanese <b>parenting</b> magazines. The findings also highlight the lack of visibility of the social context within which <b>parenting</b> occurs, with <b>parenting</b> represented as a largely individual-level experience. In contrast, the English-language <b>parenting</b> magazines depict a more diverse range of social issues of relevance to <b>parenting,</b> a more diverse range of family structures, and greater involvement of fathers in <b>parenting</b> compared to Japanese <b>parenting</b> magazines...|$|R
40|$|Adolescent {{aggressive}} behavior {{is a major}} social problem in the United States and is linked to violence and violence-related injury. Understanding the relationship between <b>parenting</b> and early adolescent aggression provides important insights for developing prevention interventions. This study explored the relationship between <b>parenting</b> and early adolescent aggression in an urban low-income, predominately African American sample. The first aim was to examine whether aggression-specific <b>parenting</b> practices and <b>parenting</b> style predicted subsequent early adolescent aggression. The second aim {{was to examine the}} extent to which <b>parenting</b> style moderated the relationship between aggression-specific <b>parenting</b> practices and subsequent early adolescent aggression. The third aim was to explore the bidirectional relationship between <b>parenting</b> (<b>parenting</b> style and aggression-specific <b>parenting</b> practices) and early adolescent aggression. A total of 209 sixth grade early adolescents attending two Baltimore City middle schools completed questionnaires about their overt and relational {{aggressive behavior}}s at two time points. Early adolescents also reported on their perceptions of a <b>parent</b> or guardian's <b>parenting</b> style (support/behavioral control and psychological control) and aggression-specific <b>parenting</b> practices (aggression-avoidance <b>parenting</b> practices and aggression-endorsing <b>parenting</b> practices). Adjusted logistic regression results indicated that early adolescents who reported having a <b>parent</b> who supported aggression avoidance strategies were less likely to engage in overt aggression. Study findings also showed that <b>parent</b> support for aggression avoidance strategies ameliorated the tendency toward aggressive behavior when <b>parenting</b> styles were at their least protective levels. A bidirectional relationship between <b>parenting</b> and early adolescent aggression was not found; however, Structural Equation Modeling results indicated significant relationships between early adolescent aggression and subsequent <b>parenting.</b> Early adolescent overt and relational aggression predicted declines in <b>parenting</b> practices and <b>parenting</b> styles associated with buffering early adolescents from aggression. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>parenting</b> practices and <b>parenting</b> styles may exert a minor influence on early adolescent aggressive behavior in an urban low-income, predominately African American sample.

40|$|Despite broad {{consensus}} {{about the effects}} of <b>parenting</b> practices on child development, many questions about the construct <b>parenting</b> style remain unanswered. Particularly pressing issues are the variability in the effects of <b>parenting</b> style {{as a function of the}} child's cultural background, the processes through which <b>parenting</b> style influences the child's development, and the operational-ization of <b>parenting</b> style. Drawing on historical review, the authors present a model that integrates two traditions in socialization research, the study of specific <b>parenting</b> practices and the study of global <b>parent</b> characteristics. They propose that <b>parenting</b> style is best conceptualized as a context that moderates the influence of specific <b>parenting</b> practices on the child.

This quasi-experimental study examined the relationships between child problem behavior, <b>parenting</b> behavior and <b>parenting</b> stress and secondly, the direct effect of Alles Kidzzz on child problem behavior and <b>parenting</b> behavior and the indirect effect on <b>parenting</b> stress. Methods This study used data from an ongoing RCT-study; 117 <b>parent</b> reports were obtained, using the CBCL, APQ, PS and NOSI on two measuring moments for mothers and fathers. Results A correlation was found between <b>parenting</b> stress and all other variables, and child behavior as well as <b>parenting</b> behavior served as predictors for <b>parenting</b> stress.

40|$|Previous {{research}} literature on <b>parenting</b> has presented a strong {{argument for the}} relationship between individual <b>parenting</b> behaviors, including <b>parenting</b> styles, perceptions about <b>parenting,</b> and parental religiosity, and the influence on child development. However, there is limited research that has examined the differences in <b>parenting</b> behaviors across religious groups. The studies that examined religiosity typically have combined all Catholic and Protestant denominations into a generic Christian category, rather than examining the differences across the denominational groups. This study was informed by Baumrind 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parenting</b> styles and Mowder 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parent</b> development theory (PDT) to examine <b>parenting</b> factors, including <b>parenting</b> styles, perceptions of the <b>parent</b> role, and individual religiosity, across Christian denominations. ^ For the current study, 213 participants completed a demographics questionnaire, the Parental Authority Questionnaire-Revised (PAQ-R), the <b>Parent</b> Behavior Importance Questionnaire-Revised (PBIQ-R), and the Religiousness Scale (RS).

5000|$|The {{techniques}} of harmful <b>parenting</b> may be subtle and [...] "genuine". A <b>parent</b> can triangulate the {{child into the}} marital conflictby encouraging the child to make even minor complaints about the other <b>parent</b> and then [...] "enthusiastically validating" [...] them. This signals to the child that the other <b>parent</b> is dangerousand insensitive. This encouragement to complain manipulates the child {{into the role of}} victim without the child's awareness, allowing the <b>parent</b> to move into the protector role, forcing the other <b>parent</b> into the [...] "inadequate" [...] <b>parent</b> role, and leaving no trace of what happened for bystanders who only see the child acting as a [...] "victim". Over time, the combined effects of growing closer to the alienating <b>parent</b> through this complaining process and growing further from the rejected <b>parent</b> as the result of focusing on negative things about the other <b>parent</b> cause the child to reject their other <b>parent</b> as being inadequate. A <b>parent</b> may also mix in lies, partial lies, and exaggerations, particularly ones that the child {{may not be able to}} verify or where only the true part of the partial lie is easy to verify. As the result of being encouraged to act as judge of their rejected <b>parent,</b> the child then feels superior to their rejected <b>parent,</b> leading to the symptoms of grandiosity, entitlement, and haughty arrogance. This feeds the delusion of the <b>parent,</b> that they are protecting the child from an inadequate <b>parent.</b> The child then begins to adopt this delusion also.Because the child and <b>parent</b> are from different generations, this qualifies as a perverse triangle,further complicated by enmeshment, and made even worse because a member of the perverse triangle has a personality disorder, climaxed by the splitting dynamic of the <b>parent</b> with the personality disorder that requires the ex-spouse to also become the ex-parent of the child. Finally, the child may be led to misinterpret the grief they experience from the loss of a <b>parent</b> as pain that means the rejected <b>parent</b> is abusive, since they mainly experience it in the presence of the rejected <b>parent.</b>|$|R
