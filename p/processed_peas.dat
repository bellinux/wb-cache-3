40|$|The {{processed}} pea {{industry has}} grown rapidly in New Zealand {{over the last}} few years and prospects for further growth look reasonably bright. In the past the main production area for <b>processed</b> <b>peas</b> has been Hawkes Bay. With the opening of a second processing factory in Christchurch and further expansion of one in Timaru in the 1970 - 71 season, Canterbury is becoming increasingly important in the production of <b>processed</b> <b>peas,</b> and is likely to become the dominant green pea producing area of New Zealand before long. Despite their increasing importance to New Zealand, very little agronomic research has been carried out on <b>processed</b> <b>peas</b> New Zealand. Although seasonal fluctuations in yield occur there appears to have been no consistent increase in green pea yields {{over the last few}} years. Average green pea yields are not high and more information is required on agronomic factors which may affect yield. The results of overseas work on the effect of plant density on green peas are variable and no reliable indication of the optimum plant density for Canterbury could be obtained from them. Good responses to irrigation have been measured overseas, and have also been obtained by some Canterbury farmers. However, most of the overseas work has been done in areas where the soil and climate differ from that in Canterbury and results are unable to be applied directly to Canterbury. This study was therefore initiated to obtain information on the response of green peas to different plant spacings and moisture levels under Canterbury conditions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the pea plant as {{sentinel}} specie for the heavy metal molybdenum. Evaluation of soil quality after the molybdenum uptake by pea revealed the following results: Pea plant is a bioindicator that concentrates molybdenum with fast reaction to increasing concentrations in soil. Molybdenum had a positive effect concerning the plant growth (throughout all experimental <b>process,</b> <b>pea</b> plants treated with highest concentrated metal solution reached the largest dimensions). Accumulated molybdenum was directly proportional to increasing concentration of the applied solution to roots, stem, leaves and flowers of the experimental plants; however it resided in flowerpot soil too. In the leguminous roots where the nitroreductase and nitrogenese activity is increased, molybdenum content was much higher compared to the aerial parts of the plant. All the way through molybdenum accumulation in the experimental plants up to high concentrations, other chemical elements revealed lower concentration although within the normal limits, with the exception of phosphorus. These plants were found to assimilate high molybdenum quantities without any detrimental consequences for them since molybdenum accumulation occurred in vacuoles in innocuous chemical forms...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of <b>process</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) crops by the immature fruit of black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and hairy nightshade (S. physalifolium Rusby var. nitidibaccatum (Bitter.) Edmonds) causes income losses to pea farmers in Canterbury, New Zealand. This thesis investigates {{the questions of}} whether seed dormancy, germination requirements, plant growth, reproductive phenology, or fruit growth of either nightshade species reveal specific management practices that could reduce the {{contamination of}} <b>process</b> <b>peas</b> by the fruit of these two weeds. The seed dormancy status of these weeds indicated that both species are capable of germinating to high levels (> 90 %) throughout the pea sowing season when tested at an optimum germination temperature of 20 / 30 °C (16 / 8 h). However, light was required at this temperature regime to obtain maximum germination of S. nigrum. The levels of germination in the dark at 20 / 30 °C and at 5 / 20 °C, and in light at 5 / 20 °C, and day to 50 % germination analyses indicated that this species cycled from nondormancy to conditional dormancy throughout the period of investigation (July to December 2002). For S. physalifolium, light was not a germination requirement, and dormancy inhibited germination at 5 / 20 °C early in the pea sowing season (July and August). However, by October, 100 % {{of the population was}} non-dormant at this test temperature. Two field trials showed that dark cultivation did not reduce the germination of either species. Growth trials with S. nigrum and S. physalifolium indicated that S. physalifolium, in a non-competitive environment, accumulated dry matter at a faster rate than S. nigrum. However, when the two species were grown with peas {{there was no difference in}} dry matter accumulation. Investigation of the flowering phenology and fruit growth of both species showed that S. physalifolium flowered (509 °Cd, base temperature (Tb) 6 °C) approximately 120 °Cd prior to S. nigrum (633 °Cd). The fruit growth rate of S. nigrum (0. 62 mm/d) was significantly faster than the growth rate of S. physalifolium (0. 36 mm/d). Because of the earlier flowering of S. physalifolium it was estimated that for seedlings of both species emerging on the same date that S. physalifolium could produce a fruit with a maximum diameter of 3 mm ~ 60 °Cd before S. nigrum. Overlaps in flowering between peas and nightshade were examined in four pea cultivars, of varying time to maturity, sown on six dates. Solanum physalifolium had the potential to contaminate more pea crops than S. nigrum. In particular, late sown peas were more prone to nightshade contamination, especially late sowings using mid to long duration pea cultivars (777 - 839 °Cd, Tb 4. 5 °C). This comparison was supported by factory data, which indicated that contamination of crops sown in October and November was more common than in crops sown in August and September. Also, cultivars sown in the later two months had an ~ 100 °Cd greater maturity value than cultivars sown in August and September. Nightshade flowering and pea maturity comparisons indicated that the use of the thermal time values for the flowering of S. nigrum and S. physalifolium can be used to calculate the necessary weed free period required from pea sowing in order to prevent the flowering of these species. The earlier flowering of S. physalifolium indicates that this species is more likely to contaminate pea crops than is S. nigrum. Therefore, extra attention may be required where this species is present in <b>process</b> <b>pea</b> crops. The prevention of the flowering of both species, by the maintenance of the appropriate weed free period following pea sowing or crop emergence, was identified as potentially, the most useful means of reducing nightshade contamination in peas...|$|R

40|$|Legumes have {{increased}} in interest as a locally produced low input protein feed for ruminants in northern Europe. Peas are of special interest in Sweden since they are possible to cultivate on most farms. Protein feed is also a limited resource in organic farming, especially for high producing dairy milk cattle. Farmers often have to complement feed rations with conventional produced protein concentrate. The limitation with all legume grains, including peas, is that their protein is very soluble in the rumen. As a result, the pea protein is almost immediately degraded to a great deal {{and much of the}} protein, which is transformed to ammonia, is lost through the rumen wall, transported with the blood and excecreted with the urine. The consequence is that much nitrogen is lost to the environment instead of being synthesised as microbe protein. Different methods of feed processing, including preservation of feed and milling, rolling and heat treatment could improve protein utilisation. Of great importance affecting rumen degradation rate is particle size in <b>processed</b> <b>peas.</b> The extent to which peas are processed may also affect the passage rate through the rumen. A combination of different processing: preservation methods (i. e. wet or dry), grinding, flaking and cracking might give an additive effect in reducing protein degradation in the rumen...|$|E
40|$|Pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Laguna) seeds were {{submitted}} to extrusion process at 129, 135 and 142 °C and modifications on the proximate composition and nutritional parameters were evaluated. Peas {{were a good}} source of protein (24 g/ 100 g), amino acids (sulphur amino acids were the limiting ones), dietary fibre (18 g/ 100 g), carbohydrates (53 g/ 100 g), energy (330 kcal/ 100 g), riboflavin and thiamine (0. 1 - 0. 2 mg/ 100 g). Pea seeds also contained non-nutritive compounds such as α-galactosides (4 g/ 100 g), phytic acid (0. 4 g/ 100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (2 TIU/mg). Extrusion cooking caused a slight increase of protein and fat content, whilst it reduced dietary fibre, thiamine and α-galactosides, and led to negligible trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) levels. The protein quality of pea measured by biological indexes (net protein utilisation, net protein ratio, relative net protein ratio, true protein digestibility and biological value) was not affected by extrusion treatments. Protein quality measured by chemical indexes (chemical score and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score) decreased in <b>processed</b> <b>peas.</b> Among extruded peas, those processed at 135 °C presented the highest chemical indexes. Therefore, the aforementioned condition could be considered adequate for the manufacture of novel pea-derived products with high nutritive value. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Grinding is a {{technological}} process widely {{applied in the}} feed manufacturing industry and {{is a prerequisite for}} obtaining representative samples for laboratory procedures (e. g. gas production analysis). When feeds are subjected to technological processes other than grinding (e. g. expander treatment), grinding afterwards may disturb the effect of processing, both in practice and when laboratory techniques are applied. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the possible effects of different grinding procedures and sample preparation on the degradative behaviour of expander <b>processed</b> barley and <b>peas.</b> Samples of expander <b>processed</b> barley and <b>peas</b> were subjected to six different sample preparation procedures (intact sample, dissolved sample, samples ground stepwise over 6 and 3 mm sieves, samples ground stepwise over 6, 3 and 1 mm sieves, samples ground over a 3 mm sieve and samples ground over a 1 mm sieve). The patterns of gas production in these samples were studied over a period of 72 h incubation using an automated in vitro gas production system. The particle size distribution determined by dry sieve analysis and the Coulter counter method changed due to the different grinding procedures. Grinding the samples of expander <b>processed</b> barley and <b>peas</b> changed the kinetics of gas production and led to a faster degradation, most pronounced after stepwise grinding. However, the formation of the fermentation end-product was not affected by the method of sample preparation. In expander processed barley, the difference in the degradation pattern due to the different grinding procedures was small...|$|R

However, {{data about}} the {{nutritional}} composition and the shelf-life stability of these leaves, especially their phytonutrient composition is scarce. In this work, the macronutrient, micronutrient and phytonutrients profile of minimally <b>processed</b> <b>pea</b> shoots were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of a 10 -day storage period. Several physicochemical characteristics (color, pH, total soluble solids, and total titratable acidity) were also monitored. Standard AOAC methods were applied in the nutritional value evaluation, while chromatographic methods with UV–vis and mass detection were used to analyze free forms of vitamins (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS), carotenoids (HPLC-DAD-APCI-MSn) and flavonoid compounds (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn). Atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS-AAS) was employed to characterize the mineral content of the leaves. As expected, pea leaves had a high water (91. 5 %) and low fat (0. 3 %) and carbohydrate (1. 9 %) contents, being a good source of dietary fiber (2. 1 %). Pea shoots showed a high content of vitamins C, E and A, potassium and phosphorous compared to other ready-to-eat green leafy vegetables. The carotenoid profile revealed a high content of β-carotene and lutein, typical from green leafy vegetables. The leaves had a mean flavonoid content of 329 mg/ 100 g of fresh product, mainly composed by glycosylated quercetin and kaempferol derivatives. Pea shoots kept their fresh appearance during the storage being color maintained throughout the shelf-life. The nutritional composition was in general stable during storage, showing some significant (p < 0. 05) variation in certain water-soluble vitamins...|$|R

Four experimental diets were formulated such that each diet contained raw, boiled, boiled with potash and toasted pigeon pea seed meals at 26 % dietary level respectively. One hundred and ninety two 5 -week old Anak 2000 broiler chicks {{were randomly assigned to}} the four experimental diets in a completely randomized design (CRD). Each treatment group was replicated four times with 12 birds per replicate. At the end of the 4 weeks feeding trial, three birds were randomly selected from each replicate and transferred to metabolic cages for faecal collection and determination of apparent nutrient digestibility. Another set of 3 birds were randomly selected from each replicate, deprived of water but not feed for 24 hours, slaughtered and eviscerated for organ weight determination. Results showed significant (P 0. 05) difference in performance among the groups fed differently <b>processed</b> pigeon <b>pea</b> seed meals. The results of the digestibility trial showed that significant (P < 0. 05) differences existed among the groups in protein digestibility only.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of 252 food samples (UK-produced and imported) purchased {{from a variety}} of retail outlets in England was undertaken for the presence of PFOS, PFOA and nine other PFCs. A Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of 1 μg/kg was achieved for all target analytes, in all samples. Standard addition was used for quantification of PFC levels. All eleven of the targeted PFCs were detected, in 75 of the individual foods. In 70 % of the samples, including all meats other than offal, none of the analytes were present at above the LOD. The highest levels found were 59 μg/kg of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and 63 μg/kg total PFCs (ΣPFCs) in an eel sample, and 40 μg/kg PFOS (62 μg/kg ΣPFCs) in a whitebait sample. The highest level in an offal sample was 10 μg/kg, in a wild roe deer liver. There were 6 samples with ΣPFCs > 15 μg/kg (fish, shellfish, crustaceans), a further 7 samples with ΣPFCs 11 - 15 μg/kg (including a liver), nine with ΣPFCs 6 - 10 μg/kg (fish and livers), 31 with ΣPFCs 2 - 5 μg/kg (including kidneys, popcorn and <b>processed</b> <b>peas)</b> and a further 22 with ΣPFCs close to the LOD of 1 μg/kg (including eggs and potatoes). These concentrations indicate that English consumers are being exposed to a low level of PFC contamination from food. The estimated upper bound dietary intake of 10 ng/kg bodyweight/day of PFOS for average adult consumers is well below the 0. 15 µg (150 ng) /kg bw Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) set by the European Food Safety Authority.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was the estimation of seed lot magnetic stimulation effect on free radicals concentration and dynamics of pea seeds germination. The first factor were two cultivars of pea: Rola (traditional form) and Piast (afila type), the second factor were the 3 exposure doses of magnetic field intensity: D 0 &# 8211; no stimulation (control), D 1 &# 8211; 10 750 Jm 3 s and D 2 &# 8211; 85 987 Jm 3 s. The stimulated seeds of both pea forms showed faster uptake of water and achieved larger mass during the seed imbibition in comparison to the seeds without stimulation. It was found that earlier and more steady emergence of these plants was a consequence of this <b>process.</b> <b>Pea</b> seedlings which were grown from stimulated seeds achieved in the following successive dates of measurement significantly larger hypocotyl and roots length in comparison to the seedlings without stimulation with magnetic field. A significant increase of free radicals concentration was ob- served in the seeds which were pre-sowing treated with magnetic field. There was no significant effect of the stimulation on the free radicals concentration in the organs of young pea plants grown from seeds of the varieties under examination. Free radicals numbers in the leaves, stems and roots did not differ significantly from those which were found in the particular organs of plants which were grown from non-stimulated seeds.

The experimental design was completely randomized design (CRD) and comprised pullets fed 10 % PSM diet during the chick (0 - 56 days) stage of life that were fed 20 % PSM diets. The diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. The seeds were used as raw, boiled for 30 minutes, toasted for 30 minutes or soaked in water for 24 hours. Each treatment (raw, boiled, toasted, soaked or control diet) was replicated three times. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), daily feed cost, feed cost per kg weight gain and feed cost of raising a pullet to point of lay (POL) were measured. Results showed that prolonged feeding of raw or processed PSM diets to pullets did not significantly affect live weight at POL, daily weight gain, FCR and average mortality while pullets fed raw PSM diet had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower feed and protein intake than others. Raw PSM diet also significantly reduced daily feed cost and consequently feed cost to POL more than others did. It was concluded that PSM could be a good protein source for pullets from the chick stage to point of lay.

Twenty four Italian Holstein cows (8 primiparous and 16 pluriparous), 604 ± 109 kg body weight, 34. 5 ± 2. 5 kg/d milk yield, were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments in a 4 x 4 Latin square arrangement with periods of four weeks and washout period of seven days. Diets were fed ad libitum(5 % orts). The bulk of the base diet on a dry matter basis was corn silage (31. 2 %), alfalfa hay (16. 7 %), grass hay (4. 1 %), protein supplement (10. 3 %), whole cotton seed (8. 5 %), corn and barley mix (24. 9 %), soybean meal (3. 4 %) and calcium soap (0. 9 %). The pea (2. 5 kg/cow/day) partially replaced the soybean meal and totally replaced the barley meal of the base diet. The unprocessed or differently <b>processed</b> <b>pea</b> did not affect the dry matter intake. The extruded pea group had a 3. 2 % increase (P< 0. 05) of the milk yield compared to the control group. When estimated as contrast analysis, the technological treatment (extruded or expanded) on peas did not modify the milk yield and composition. Among pea diets, animal fed the extruded pea had the higher (P< 0. 05) milk protein content, although not different than that of the control group. The rumen acetate was reduced (P< 0. 05) and the butyrate and valerate were increased (P< 0. 05) in animals fed extruded pea compared to the control. No differences were observed among feeding groups on blood parameters except for the cholesterol level higher (P< 0. 05) in animals fed the expanded pea diet.

However the association between an inflammatory dietary pattern and cognitive decline has not been investigated. We aimed to investigate dietary patterns associated with inflammation and whether such diet is associated with cognitive decline. MethodsWe analyzed 5083 participants (28. 7 % women) from the Whitehall II cohort study. Diet and serum interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were assessed in 1991 – 1993 and 1997 – 1999. We used reduced rank regression methods to determine a dietary pattern associated with elevated IL- 6. Cognitive tests were performed in 1997 – 1999 and repeated in 2002 – 2004 and 2007 – 2009. The association between dietary pattern and cognitive decline between ages 45 and 79 was assessed using linear mixed models. ResultsWe identified an inflammatory dietary pattern characterized by higher intake of red meat, <b>processed</b> meat, <b>peas</b> and legumes, and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains which correlated with elevated IL- 6 both in 1991 – 1993 and 1997 – 1999. A greater decline in reasoning was seen in participants in the highest tertile of adherence to the inflammatory dietary pattern (− 0. 37 SD; 95 % confidence interval [CI] − 0. 40, − 0. 34) compared {{to those in the}} lowest tertile (− 0. 31; 95 % CI − 0. 34, − 0. 28) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, occupational status, education, and total energy intake (p for interaction across tertiles =  0. 01). This association remained significant after multivariable adjustment. Similarly for global cognition, the inflammatory dietary pattern was associated with faster cognitive decline after multivariable adjustment (p for interaction across tertiles =  0. 04). Associations were stronger in younger participants (< 56 years), reducing the possibility of reverse causation. ConclusionsOur study found that a dietary pattern characterized as higher intake of red and <b>processed</b> meat, <b>peas,</b> legumes and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains was associated with higher inflammatory markers and accelerated cognitive decline at older ages.

Immunoblot results indicated the presence of a 30 -kDa band specific for pea root nodules. The EXP proteins content rose during growth of pea root nodules. Expansin(s) protein was localized in nodule apoplast {{as well as in the}} infection thread walls. The enhanced amount of expansin-like proteins in meristematic part of nodule, root and shoot was shown. The localization of this protein in the meristematic cell walls can be related to the loosening of plant cell wall before cell enlargement. Both, plant cell enlargement and infection thread growth require activity of expansin(s). Possible involvement of EXPs in the <b>process</b> of <b>pea</b> root nodule development is also discussed...|$|R

Linear programming has been accepted in the U. S. A. as an extremely useful and versatile tool for both farm management research and advisory work but has not as yet been widely accepted in the United Kingdom, where simpler techniques such as Programme Planning 4 Clarke, G.

Official advisory services in New Zealand tend to be based on techniques used in the United Kingdom and hence linear programming has not been given adequate opportunity to demonstrate its usefulness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} 150 nine week-old black Bovan Nera pullets to evaluate the performance of grower pullets fed raw or <b>processed</b> pigeon <b>pea</b> seed meal (PSM) diets from the grower (9 th week) stage of life. The experiment, which was in a completely randomized design (CRD), comprised pullets fed 20 % PSM diets that were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. The seeds were used as raw, boiled for 30 minutes, toasted for 30 minutes or soaked in water for 24 hours. Each treatment (raw, boiled, toasted, soaked or control diets) was replicated three times. Parameters measured were feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, live weight at point of lay and feed cost. Pullets fed 20 % boiled PSM diet had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) daily protein intake and live weight at point of lay. It was concluded that PSM {{could be a good}} protein source for grower pullets, which could be incorporated into the diets at 20 % of the whole diet without any adverse effect on growth performance.

40|$|The first {{committed}} {{step in the}} gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic pathway is the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) through copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP) to ent-kaurene catalyzed by ent-kaurene synthetases A and B. The ga 1 mutants of Arabidopsis are gibberellin-responsive male-sterile dwarfs. Biochemical studies indicate that biosynthesis of GAs in the ga 1 mutants is blocked prior to the synthesis of ent-kaurene. The GA 1 locus was cloned previously using the technique of genomic subtraction. Here, we report the isolation of a nearly full-length GA 1 cDNA clone from wild-type Arabidopsis. This cDNA clone encodes an active protein {{and is able to}} complement the dwarf phenotype in ga 1 - 3 mutants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In Escherichia coli cells that express both the Arabidopsis GA 1 gene and the Erwinia uredovora gene encoding GGPP synthase, CPP was accumulated. This result indicates that the GA 1 gene encodes the enzyme ent-kaurene synthetase A, which catalyzes the conversion of GGPP to CPP. Subcellular localization of the GA 1 protein was studied using 35 S-labeled GA 1 protein and isolated pea chloroplasts. The results showed that the GA 1 protein is imported into and <b>processed</b> in <b>pea</b> chloroplasts in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.)

In addition to food, pigeonpea can also be used for a number of other purposes (ie, feed, fodder, fuel, fertilizer). India is the number one producer and consumer of pigeonpea, but still needs to import around 500, 000 tons per year to satisfy the internal demand. Increasing the area under pigeonpea cultivation could contribute to increased production, but this would only be possible by expanding pigeonpea cultivation to non-traditional areas including wider latitudes, higher altitudes and marginal lands, and to fit in the narrow window of time between harvest and planting of important cereal crops...|$|R
