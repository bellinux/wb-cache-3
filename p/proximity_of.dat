5|$|Minneapolis is {{the largest}} city by {{population}} in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County. The origin and growth {{of the city was}} spurred by the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains {{generally}} {{served the}} station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While {{the village of}} Westcott was small, the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic.|$|E

5|$|The bonding in boron {{has been}} {{described}} as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic covalent network solids (such as diamond). The energy required to transform B, C, N, Si and P from nonmetallic to metallic states has been estimated as 30, 100, 240, 33 and 50 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicates the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> boron to the metal-nonmetal borderline.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E

5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as the}} feral cat (Felis catus), and rat species. The <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the threat based on the loudness of bird song {{as well as the}} level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
5|$|Desert Strike was a {{commercial}} success: {{it was a}} chart-topping best seller {{and at the time}} Electronics Arts' highest selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject matter, with commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> its release to the recently ended Gulf War.|$|E

The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{was only}} their eighth {{football}} meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 {{advantage in the}} series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E
