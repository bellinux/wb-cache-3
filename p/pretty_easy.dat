500|$|His form in {{the tour}} to the West Indies in March and April 2004 was mixed. After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a {{substantial}} match-winning contribution. This poor touring form {{may have been the}} start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, [...] "The hardest thing for me has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you get used to good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes <b>pretty</b> <b>easy</b> [...]" [...] However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.|$|E

Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also <b>pretty</b> <b>easy</b> to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E
500|$|In New Mexico, they {{obtained}} false identification, {{and purchased}} several pistols. Their {{intention was to}} purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said {{it was easy to}} obtain guns in New Mexico: [...] "we found it was <b>pretty</b> <b>easy</b> to buy guns. All {{you had to do was}} show some identification and it was easy to get." [...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt". [...] "And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets," [...] said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt [...]38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger [...]357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look <b>pretty</b> <b>easy.</b> When he {{has that kind of}} command, you can see what happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} impact of {{expectation}} on the perceived and objective usability and visual appeal of a website. The problem is that many studies have been done on the relationship between usability and visual appeal but the results of these studies vary vastly. There are many factors that influence the results, including website domain, the type of task, if incentive is given, and metrics used to get the usability and visual appeal measures. However, no one has examined the impact of expectations on these two variables. A set of five preliminary studies was completed {{in order to get a}} website data set that significantly varied in levels of visual appeal and usability. This resulted in four website versions: (1) <b>easy</b> and <b>pretty,</b> (2) <b>easy</b> and ugly, (3) hard and pretty, and (4) hard and ugly. Five levels of expectations were implemented: (a) <b>easy</b> and <b>pretty,</b> (b) <b>easy</b> and ugly (c) hard and pretty (d) hard and ugly, and (e) the control - no expectations. Three main computer laboratory studies (in the form of user-based usability tests) were completed to determine the effect of textual and verbal expectations on visual appeal and usability...|$|R

2500|$|On December 1, 2009 the album's {{title was}} {{announced}} as This Addiction, {{which is also}} the title of its opening track. Of the eleven tracks selected for the album, eight were written by Skiba and three by Andriano ("Dine, Dine My Darling", [...] "Off the Map", and [...] "Fine"). Skiba explained that both [...] members came up with an equal number of songs during the writing process, but that [...] "it was <b>pretty</b> <b>easy</b> to pick out the ones we wanted to use.

[...] Another mixed review came from Entertainment Weeklys Marc Snetiker, who commented that [...] "it’s <b>pretty</b> <b>easy</b> to replace the band’s signature electronic meta-funk with any of the boy band’s impish members, for example One Direction." [...] However, he concluded that [...] "it's catchy, infectious, and overwhelmingly mellow."

5000|$|Among other things, {{it must be}} {{possible}} to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant, plus {{there must be some}} way to specify the escape character itself. Escape sequences are not always <b>pretty</b> or <b>easy</b> to use, so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. Escape sequences, however, solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret escape sequences. When an escape character is inside a string literal, it means [...] "this is the start of the escape sequence". Every escape sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an escape sequence varies. The escape character is on the top/left of the keyboard, but the editor will translate it, therefore it is not directly tapeable into a string. The backslash is used to represent the escape character in a string literal.|$|R

2500|$|Shannon Larkin {{explained}} how {{the band is}} able to walk the line between staying true to their roots {{and being able to}} satisfy themselves creatively, stating, [...] "Usually the riffs decide how new songs come about, with one of us showing the others a riff, and then the rest of us just jamming along until a song starts to form. If the song sounds too far from our roots (or our sound or style) then we can tell after jamming it a few times, and we either drop it or re-work it to sound more true to our roots. Satisfying ourselves creatively is <b>pretty</b> <b>easy,</b> as we aren't trying to re-invent the wheel musically - we are a blue-collar hard rock band. That said, we do side projects in which we can experiment with different textures and styles and scratch any itches to experiment in different genres." ...|$|E

Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day.

Referring to the album track, [...] "Air Bud", he wrote, [...] "A guitar-obsessed longhair who got his start self-distributing his music, Vile has let the outside in - even if a basketball-playing dog from an old DVD still proves to be his best inspiration." [...] Similarly, PopMatterss Robin Smith stated, [...] "This isn’t his clearest work, nor is it his most <b>pretty,</b> but it’s <b>easy</b> to {{identify}} him as he looks inward, to see the songwriter who wants to make five different types of music. ...

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind, loomed as stubbornly as ever. But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate, wanted something to love.

40|$|Probabilistic range query (PRQ) over {{uncertain}} moving objects {{has attracted}} much attentions in recent years. Most of existing works {{focus on the}} PRQ for objects moving freely in two-dimensional (2 D) space. In contrast, this paper studies the PRQ over objects moving in a constrained 2 D space where objects are forbidden to be located in some specific areas. We dub it the constrained space probabilistic range query (CSPRQ). We analyse its unique properties and show that to process the CSPRQ using a straightforward solution is infeasible. The key idea of our solution {{is to use a}} strategy called pre-approximation that can reduce the initial problem to a highly simplified version, implying that it makes the rest of steps easy to tackle. In particular, this strategy itself is <b>pretty</b> simple and <b>easy</b> to implement. Furthermore, motivated by the cost analysis, we further optimize our solution. The optimizations are mainly based on two insights: (1) the number of effective subdivisions is no more than 1; and (2) an entity with the larger span is more likely to subdivide a single region. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches through extensive experiments under various experimental settings, and highlight an extra finding, i. e., the precomputation based approach suffers a non-trivial preprocessing time, which offers an important indication sign for the future research.
