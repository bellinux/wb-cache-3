40|$|This fMRI study {{examined}} the neural correlates of verbs controlled for argument structure complexity and nouns controlled for semantic class. Participants showed activation of left inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions for verbs as compared to nouns, and more widespread, non-perisylvian activation for nouns as compared to verbs. Verbs with more complex argument structure entries activated posterior temporal regions bilaterally. These findings suggest that <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> regions are crucial for processing the argument structure information associated with verbs...|$|R
40|$|Using {{magnetic}} resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects. Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry {{was used to measure}} hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population. © 1991 IEEE All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} early right ear {{deafness}} on lateralisation of auditory language functions {{are not fully}} known. A 36 year old right handed man, {{with a history of}} perinatal right ear deafness and undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment of seizures that began at age 10 years was studied. Language lateralisation testing by intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection showed receptive and expressive language functions to be strongly lateralised to the left hemisphere. Results with intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection further suggested that transmission of auditory input to the patient's left hemisphere was partially dependent on ipsilateral left ear pathways. Cortical language mapping through implanted subdural electrodes localised auditory language functions to traditional left <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> language areas. These results suggest that early right ear deafness does not impede left hemisphere lateralisation and localisation of auditory language functions. Moreover, transmission of auditory information to the patient's left hemisphere seems to be accomplished, in part, by recruitment of ipsilateral left ear pathways. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{this rare}} type of aphasia, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate {{fasciculus}} are intact but the watershed region around them is damaged. This damage isolates these areas {{from the rest}} of the brain. The most frequent etiology of mixed transcortical aphasia is stenosis (narrowing) of the internal carotid artery. Mixed transcortical aphasia can also occur after cerebral hypoxia, cerebral swelling, and any stroke that affects the cerebral artery. Often lesions that cause mixed transcortical aphasia affect both the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> border zones. Some times the type of aphasia can be determined just by knowing the lesion location. In order for a patient to be diagnosed with mixed transcortical aphasia all other forms of transcortical must be ruled out. Using WAB or the BDAE can rule out global aphasia if the ability to repeat is present. If verbal fluency is depressed transcortical aphasia gets ruled out and if auditory processing and comprehension is weak then it cannot be transcortical motor aphasia.|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that the processing of auditory information by the perisylvian polymicrogyric cortex may {{be different from the}} normal cortex. To characterize the auditory processing in bilateral perisylvian syndrome, we examined ten patients with perisylvian polymicrogyria (Group 1) and seven control children (Group 11). Group I was composed by four children with bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria and six children with bilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> polymicrogyria. The evaluation included neurological and neuroimaging investigation, intellectual quotient and audiological assessment (audiometry and behavior auditory tests). The results revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups in the behavioral auditory tests, Such as, digits dichotic test, nonverbal dichotic test (specifically in right attention), and random gap detection/random gap detection expanded tests. Our data showed abnormalities in the auditory processing of children with perisylvian polymicrogyria, suggesting that perisylvian polymicrogyric cortex is functionally abnormal. We also found a correlation between the severity of our auditory findings and the extent of the cortical abnormality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) technology now allow the tracing of developmental changes in the brains of children. We applied computer-matching algorithms and new techniques for measuring cortical thickness (in millimeters) to the structural MRI images of 45 children scanned twice (2 yr apart) between the ages 5 and 11. Changes in brain size were also assessed, showing local brain growth progressing {{at a rate of}} � 0. 4 – 1. 5 mm per year, most prominently in frontal and occipital regions. Estimated cortical thickness ranged from 1. 5 mm in occipital regions to 5. 5 mm in dorsomedial frontal cortex. Gray matter thinning coupled with cortical expansion was highly significant in right frontal and bilateral parieto-occipital regions. Significant thickening was restricted to left inferior frontal (Broca’s area) and bilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> (Wernicke’s area on the left) regions. In the left hemisphere, gray matter thickness was correlated with changing cognitive abilities. For the first time, developmental changes in gray matter thickness, brain size, and structure–function relationships have been traced within the same individuals studied longitudinally during a time of rapid cognitive development.

40|$|Twenty-three chronic nonfluent aphasia {{patients}} with moderate or severe word-finding impairments and 11 with profound word-finding impairments received two novel picture-naming treatments. The intention treatment initiated picture-naming trials with a complex left-hand movement and {{was designed to}} enhance right frontal participation during word retrieval. The attention treatment required patients to view visual stimuli for picture-naming trials in their left hemispace and was designed to enhance right <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> participation during word retrieval. Because the intention treatment addressed action mechanisms and nonfluent aphasia reflects difficulty initiating or maintaining action (i. e., language output), {{it was hypothesized that}} intention component of the treatment would enhance re-acquisition of picture naming more than the attention component. Patients with moderate and severe word-finding impairment showed gains with both treatments but greater incremental improvement from one treatment phase to the next with the intention than the attention treatment. Thus, the hypothesis that intention component would be a more active constituent than the attention component was confirmed for these patients. Patients with profound word-finding impairment showed some improvement with both treatments but no differential effects for the intention treatment. Almost all patients who showed treatment gains on either treatment also demonstrated generalization from trained to untrained items...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} brain atrophy in {{semantic}} dementia {{and its associated}} cognitive effects have attracted a considerable body of research, but the nature of core impairments remains disputed. A key issue is whether the disease encompasses one neurocognitive network (semantics) or two (language and semantics). In order to address these conflicting perspectives, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of two semantic dementia patients, in which behavioural performance {{across a range of}} measures of language and semantic performance was assessed and interpreted in the context of annually acquired MRI scans. Our results indicated a core semantic impairment in early stages of the disease, associated with atrophy of the inferior, anterior temporal cortex. Linguistic impairments emerged later, and were contingent on atrophy having spread into areas widely believed to subserve core language processes (left <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian,</b> inferior frontal and insular cortex). We claim, therefore, that phonological, syntactic and morphological processing deficits in semantic dementia reflect damage to core language areas. Further, we propose that much of the current controversy over the nature of deficits in semantic dementia reflect a tendency in the literature to adopt a static perspective on what is a progressive disease. An approach in which the relationship between progressive neural changes and behavioural change over time is carefully mapped, offers a more constraining data-set from which to draw inferences about the relationship between language, semantics and the brain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{neural network}} {{dysfunction}} in neurodegenerative disease {{is imperative to}} effectively develop network-modulating therapies. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognitive decline associates with deficits in resting-state functional connectivity of diffuse brain networks. The goal {{of the current study}} was to test whether specific cognitive impairments in AD spectrum correlate with reduced functional connectivity of distinct brain regions. We recorded resting-state functional connectivity of alpha-band activity in 27 patients with AD spectrum −  22 patients with probable AD (5 logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, 7 posterior cortical atrophy, and 10 early-onset amnestic/dysexecutive AD) and 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to perform an unbiased search for regions where patterns of functional connectivity correlated with disease severity and cognitive performance. Functional connectivity measured the strength of coherence between a given region {{and the rest of the}} brain. Decreased neural connectivity of multiple brain regions including the right <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> region and left middle frontal cortex correlated with a higher degree of disease severity. Deficits in executive control and episodic memory correlated with reduced functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex, whereas visuospatial impairments correlated with reduced functional connectivity of the left inferior parietal cortex.

40|$|In humans, {{transcranial}} {{direct current}} stimulation (tDCS) {{can be used}} to induce, depending on polarity, increases or decreases of cortical excitability by polarization of the underlying brain tissue. Cognitive enhancement as a result of tDCS has been reported. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test whether weak tDCS (current density, 57 microA/cm(2)) {{can be used to}} modify language processing. Fifteen healthy subjects performed a visual picture naming task before, during and after tDCS applied over the <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> region (PPR), i. e. an area which includes Wernicke's area [BA 22]. Four different sessions were carried out: (1) anodal and (2) cathodal stimulation of left PPR and, for control, (3) anodal stimulation of the homologous region of the right hemisphere and (4) sham stimulation. We found that subjects responded significantly faster following anodal tDCS to the left PPR (p< 0. 01). No decreases in performance were detected. Our finding of a transient improvement in a language task following the application of tDCS together with previous studies which investigated the modulation of picture naming latency by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) suggest that tDCS applied to the left PPR (including Wernicke's area [BA 22]) can be used to enhance language processing in healthy subjects. Whether this safe, low cost, and easy to use brain stimulation technique can be used to ameliorate deficits of picture naming in aphasic patients needs further investigations...|$|R

5000|$|BPP {{is similar}} to the other types of polymicrogyria in that it is usually symmetrical, but BPP can vary among patients. BPP is {{characterized}} by its location; the cerebral cortex deep in the sylvian fissures is thickened and abnormally infolded, as well as the sylvian fissures extending more posteriorly up to the parietal lobes and more vertically oriented. BPP has been classified into a grading system consisting of four different grades that describe that variations in severity:Grade 1: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends to either one or both polesGrade 2: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends past the perisylvian region, but not to either of the polesGrade 3: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the perisylvian region onlyGrade 4: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> region onlyThe grades move from most severe (Grade 1) to least severe (Grade 4). Although BFPP was the first form of polymicrogyria to be discovered, BPP was the first form to be described and is also {{the most common form of}} polymicrogyria. The clinical characterizations of BPP [...] "include pseudobulbar palsy with diplegia of the facial, pharyngeal and masticory muscles (facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory paresis), pyramidal signs, and seizures." [...] These can result in drooling, feeding issues, restricted tongue movement, and dysarthria. Disorders in language development have also been associated with BPP, but the extent of language disorder depends on the severity of cortical damage. Patients who suffer from BPP can also have pyramidal signs that vary in severity, and can be either unilateral or bilateral.|$|R
40|$|Working {{memory is}} the process of {{actively}} maintaining a representation of information for a brief period of time so that it is available for use. In monkeys, visual working memory involves the concerted activity of a distributed neural system, including posterior areas in visual cortex and anterior areas in prefrontal cortex. Within visual cortex, ventral stream areas are selectively involved in object vision, whereas dorsal stream areas are selectively involved in spatial vision. This domain specificity appears to extend forward into prefrontal cortex, with ventrolateral areas involved mainly in working memory for objects and dorsolateral areas involved mainly in working memory for spatial locations. The organization of this distributed neural system for working memory in monkeys appears to be conserved in humans, though some differences between the two species exist. In humans, as compared with monkeys, areas specialized for object vision in the ventral stream have a more inferior location in temporal cortex, whereas areas specialized for spatial vision in the dorsal stream have a more superior location in parietal cortex. Displacement of both sets of visual areas away from the <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> cortex {{may be related to the}} emergence of language over the course of brain evolution. Whereas areas specialized for object working memory in humans and monkeys are similarly located in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, those specialized for spatial working memory occupy a more superior and posterior location within dorsal prefrontal cortex in humans than in monkeys. As in posterior cortex, this displacement in frontal cortex also may be related to the emergence of new areas to serve distinctively human cognitive abilities...|$|R
40|$|Gestures of the face, arms, {{and hands}} are {{components}} of signed languages used by Deaf people. Signaling codes, {{such as the}} racecourse betting code known as Tic Tac, are also made up of such gestures. Tic Tac lacks the phonological structure of British Sign Language (BSL) but is similar {{in terms of its}} visual and articulatory components. Using fMRI, we compared the neural correlates of viewing a gestural language (BSL) and a manual-brachial code (Tic Tac) relative to a low-level baseline task. We compared three groups: Deaf native signers, hearing native signers, and hearing nonsigners. None of the participants had any knowledge of Tic Tac. All three groups activated an extensive frontal-posterior network in response to both types of stimuli. Superior temporal cortex, including the planum temporale, was activated bilaterally in response to both types of gesture in all groups, irrespective of hearing status. The engagement of these traditionally auditory processing regions was greater in Deaf than hearing participants. These data suggest that the planum temporale may be responsive to visual movement in both deaf and hearing people, yet when hearing is absent early in development, the visual processing role of this region is enhanced. Greater activation for BSL than Tic Tac was observed in signers, but not in nonsigners, in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus and gyros, extending into the supramarginal gyros. This suggests that the left <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> cortex is of fundamental importance to language processing, regardless of the modality in which it is conveyed. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the well}} {{established}} {{role of the}} frontal and <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> cortices in many facets of human-cognitive specializations, including language, {{little is known about}} the developmental patterning of these regions in the human brain. We performed a genome-wide analysis of human cerebral patterning during midgestation, a critical epoch in cortical regionalization. A total of 345 genes were identified as differentially expressed between superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the remaining cerebral cortex. Gene ontology categories representing transcription factors were enriched in STG, whereas cell-adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules were enriched in the other cortical regions. Quantitative RT-PCR or in situ hybridization was performed to validate differential expression in a subset of 32 genes, most of which were confirmed. LIM domain-binding 1 (LDB 1), which we show to be enriched in the STG, is a recently identified interactor of LIM domain only 4 (LMO 4), a gene known to be involved in the asymmetric pattering of the perisylvian region in the developing human brain. Protocadherin 17 (PCDH 17), a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, was highly enriched in focal regions of the human prefrontal cortex. Contactin associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP 2), in which mutations are known to cause autism, epilepsy, and language delay, showed a remarkable pattern of anterior-enriched cortical expression in human that was not observed in mouse or rat. These data highlight the importance of expression analysis of human brain and the utility of cross-species comparisons of gene expression. Genes identified here provide a foundation for understanding molecular aspects of human-cognitive specializations and the disorders that disrupt them...|$|R
40|$|Symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e. g., {{threading}} a needle) or emblems {{that facilitate}} social transactions (e. g., finger to lips indicating “be quiet”), {{play an important}} role in human communication. They are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right. The relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear. We used functional MRI to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain. Responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the gestures' meaning in English), and to visually and acoustically matched control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. General Linear Models (GLM) contrasts identified shared and unique activations and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions associated with each condition. Results support a model in which bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal cortices extract salient features from vocal-auditory and gestural-visual stimuli respectively. However, both classes of stimuli activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. We suggest that these anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> areas, identified since the mid- 19 th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in cognitive neuroscience is {{the existence of}} two major, sub-lexical and lexical, reading processes and their possible segregation in the left <b>posterior</b> <b>perisylvian</b> cortex. Using cortical electrostimulation mapping, we identified the cortical areas involved on reading either orthographically irregular words (lexical, "direct" process) or pronounceable pseudowords (sublexical, "indirect" process) in 14 right-handed neurosurgical patients while video-recording behavioral effects. Intraoperative neuronavigation system and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinates were used to identify the localization of stimulation sites. Fifty-one reading interference areas were found that affected either words (14 areas), or pseudo-words (11 areas), or both (26 areas). Forty-one (80 %) corresponded to the impairment of the phonological level of reading processes. Reading processes involved discrete, highly localized perisylvian cortical areas with individual variability. MNI coordinates throughout the group exhibited a clear segregation according to the tested reading route; specific pseudo-word reading interferences were concentrated in a restricted inferior and anterior subpart of the left supramarginal gyrus (barycentre x = - 68. 1; y = - 25. 9; z =  30. 2; Brodmann's area 40) while specific word reading areas were located almost exclusively alongside the left superior temporal gyrus. Although half of the reading interferences found were nonspecific, the finding of specific lexical or sublexical interferences is new evidence that lexical and sublexical processes of reading could be partially supported by distinct cortical sub-regions despite their anatomical proximity. These data {{are in line with}} many brain activation studies that showed that left superior temporal and inferior parietal regions had a crucial role respectively in word and pseudoword reading and were core regions for dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|The Author (2015). Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of the Guarantors of Brain. All rights reserved. Intractable focal {{epilepsy}} is a devastating disorder with profound effects on cognition and quality of life. Epilepsy surgery can lead to seizure freedom in patients with focal epilepsy; however, sometimes it fails due to an incomplete delineation of the epileptogenic zone. Brain networks in epilepsy can be studied with resting-state functional connectivity analysis, yet previous investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging or electrocorticography have produced inconsistent results. Magnetoencephalography allows non-invasive whole-brain recordings, and can be used to study both long-range network disturbances in focal epilepsy and regional connectivity at the epileptogenic zone. In magnetoencephalography recordings from presurgical epilepsy patients, we examined: (i) global functional connectivity maps in patients versus controls; and (ii) regional functional connectivity maps at the region of resection, compared to the homotopic non-epileptogenic region in the contralateral hemisphere. Sixty-one patients were studied, including 30 with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 31 with focal neocortical epilepsy. Compared with a group of 31 controls, patients with epilepsy had decreased resting-state functional connectivity in widespread regions, including <b>perisylvian,</b> <b>posterior</b> temporo-parietal, and orbitofrontal cortices (P < 0. 01, t-test). Decreased mean global connectivity was related to longer duration of epilepsy and higher frequency of consciousness-impairing seizures (P < 0. 01, linear regression). Furthermore, patients with increased regional connectivity within the resection site (n = 24) were more likely to achieve seizure postoperative seizure freedom (87. 5 % with Engel I outcome) than those with neutral (n = 15, 64. 3 % seizure free) or decreased (n = 23, 47. 8 % seizure free) regional connectivity (P < 0. 02, chi-square). Widespread global decreases in functional connectivity are observed in patients with focal epilepsy, and may reflect deleterious long-term effects of recurrent seizures. Furthermore, enhanced regional functional connectivity at the area of resection may help predict seizure outcome and aid surgical planning...|$|R
