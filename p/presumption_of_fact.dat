40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This dissertation's primary {{hypothesis}} is that the angst-spawning confusion plaguing this area of law stems from a feckless amalgamation of parallel, if not competing, notions of loss. Let me explain. When a promisee seeks judicial relief for breach, the court habitually applies two deeply-ingrained <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> whose status has been unconsciously elevated to rules of law. 10 These judicial presumptions are that: 1. The 	promisee's concern is loss of performance and not loss of promise; and (After confining the matter to loss of performance) 2. The 	promisee's performance interest is essentially pecuniary value (profit) and not non-pecuniary value (utility). The Addis case illustrates the sad result of focusing on performance {{in a situation where}} the predominant loss caused by breach is promissory in character (Presumption 1). Farley, on the other hand, promotes the commercial agenda by perpetuating the notion that financial loss is the premier interest of contract as law (Presumption 2). This dissertation tests the above hypothesis by evaluating the prohibition on mental distress damages...|$|R

Seen as an objective fact, the default will occur when the defendant stays inert at the processual moment offered to him to adduce his reasons to resist {{the request of the}} prosecutor, what doesn’t necessary implies in its procedure.

The presumption in default is relative, it means that, its effects circumscribing verisimilar facts and consistent with the other evidences that lie in the lawsuit, what goes to the need of the material direction and not only the formal side by the judge as a way to find the fair composition of the litigation, there so attending the social finalities of the process effectively inserted in the Democratic State of Law.

Verifica os limites da presunção dos fatos contidos na petição inicial quando da ausência de contestação tempestiva e com a observância das formalidades legais. Vista como um fato objetivo, a revelia ocorrerá quando o réu queda-se inerte no momento processual em que lhe é facultado aduzir suas razões de resistência à demanda do autor, o que não implica necessariamente na sua procedência. Contudo, a revelia nem sempre desencadeia os seus efeitos, que são classificados como materiais ou processuais e consistem na presunção de veracidade dos fatos afirmados pelo autor na petição inicial e na desnecessidade do revel ser intimado dos atos processuais subseqüentes, respectivamente. A presunção na revelia é relativa, isto é, os seus efeitos se circunscrevem aos fatos verossímeis e coerentes com as demais provas encartadas aos autos, o que se coaduna com a necessidade de direção material e não apenas formal do processo pelo juiz, como forma de encontrar a justa composição do litígio, atendendo, então, as finalidades sociais do processo inserido efetivamente no Estado Democrático de Direito. Conclui que deverá ser exteriorizada na fundamentação da decisão a coerência das bases fáticas e jurídicas, abrangendo todos os pontos relevantes da lide, atendendo, assim, ao princípio da persuasão racional e resultando numa tutela jurisdicional completa, sob pena de nulidade do processo ante a insuficiência de motivação da sentença...|$|R

40|$|The Authors, {{reviewing}} the Literature on asbestos-related Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), found {{that because of}} its very peculiar characteristics, the causal link between professional asbestos exposure {{and the development of}} this tumour is very difficult to define in respect to: diagnosis, causal link and individuation of possible culpable conducts. The evaluation of causal link in different medico-legal areas is studied by different criteria. In civil law the criterion of weak causality is followed to allow compensation for damages. For institutional purposes in INAIL, the definition of causal link is particularly facilitated by the legal <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> origin. In <b>fact</b> it is sufficient, that asbestos-related lesions are ascertained in individuals who are or were exposed at any time of their professional life to the risk of inhaling asbestos fibres. In criminal law, the current approach of the Supreme Court is to demand evidence of strong causality, with a high logical probability and rational credibility, and beyond reasonable doubt, because criminal liability is personal as established in article 27 of the Italian Constitution. It is worth pointing out that all the levels of evidence indicated above must pass the test of scientific suitability or possibility...|$|R

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
