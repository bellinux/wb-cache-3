5000|$|The {{house is}} a two-story frame {{structure}} with a gabled roof and double veranda. [...] It is built in a vernacular Greek Revival style. The original porch was altered in 1915 from a one-story design with simple turned wooden columns, spanned by arched latticework, to the multi-level configuration with <b>paneled</b> <b>box</b> columns seen today.|$|R
50|$|The station had {{substantial}} {{buildings on}} both platforms until the 1970s, but these have mostly been demolished (along with the footbridge); one structure still survives {{at the northern}} end of the remaining platform but it is not in passenger use. The old station signal box also remains, though it too is boarded up and disused (the area is now signalled from a <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> located next to the Castleford Gates level crossing).|$|E
50|$|Signalling was centred in the <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> at Madeley Junction until 2012, but {{following}} {{the closure of}} the box there the West Midlands Signalling Centre at Saltley has taken control of most of the route via its Oxley/Telford Workstation (previously Oxley signal box controlled the depot access and sidings until it closed on Saturday 27 November 2010 under the West Midlands Resignalling scheme). Towards Shrewsbury, Abbey Foregate signal box takes over for the last few miles beyond Wellington.|$|E
50|$|The third chord runs between Rose Street Junction on the Far North Line and Welsh's Bridge Junction on the Aberdeen/Perth line. The Aberdeen and Perth lines diverge at Millburn Junction a short {{distance}} beyond Welsh's Bridge. Signalling for the entire area is controlled from a <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> near the station built in 1988. This supervises the station area & approaches and also houses the Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) control desk that monitors {{the full length of}} the Kyle & Far North lines.

Inside the church are <b>panelled</b> <b>box</b> pews, an {{octagonal}} pulpit with a sounding board, communion rails, and a communion table, all dating from the 18th century. The octagonal stone font dates from a similar period. There are traces of paintings on the walls. On the north wall of the chancel is a monument in white and grey marble to the memory of William Hill who died in 1786.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mobile home}} {{should have a}} small metal tag {{on the outside of}} each section. If you cannot locate a tag, {{you should be able to}} find details about the home in the {{electrical}} <b>panel</b> <b>box.</b> This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date. [...] Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.|$|E
50|$|The second {{engineman}} {{was waiting}} at the control panel for the points for the opposing train to pass through. Out of habit he had the control <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> unlocked and opened. Unfortunately, out of habit, he pressed the button to operate the points at an inappropriate time, and the opposing train was diverted at a speed of about 40 km/h into the loop where it could not stop in time to avoid a head-on collision. The actual speed of impact as recorded by the locomotive data logger on NR 15 was 27 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Redesigned as a {{commuter}} station in 1998, major renovations took place, {{resulting in the}} two freight lines being replaced by a third platform, eliminating the problem of congestion. Also, a new ticket office was built and modern shelters replaced the old waiting area. These renovations coincided with the upgrades along the Taff Main Line, where {{the most of the}} track was replaced between Cardiff and Pontypridd, and the old-fashioned semaphore signals were replaced with modern, colour light signals worked from a new <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> here (this supervises the Rhondda Line all the way to [...] ).|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} walls are limewashed {{and the floor}} is stone. The nave is without aisles and has timber panelling on the walls.

5000|$|The station {{dates from}} 1852 (being opened by the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway), with the branch to Stratford via Bearley Junction opening in 1860 (this had a later {{extension}} from Bearley Junction to [...] added in 1876). [...] It sits part way along a 5-mile (8 km) long rising section of {{line with a}} ruling gradient of 1 in 110 for northbound trains known as Hatton Bank - this section was often difficult to negotiate for heavy freights {{and the use of}} banking engines was commonplace. The station had its platforms extended in 1892 and further remodelling of the track in the area would follow over the next two decades. By 1939 the branch had been doubled, but the western end to Alcester was closed in 1951 and it reverted to single track in 1969, when signalling control was transferred to the newly commissioned <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> at Saltley.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station area}} and its various routes have been {{controlled}} by colour light signalling since the mid-1960s. The 1966 <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> (which controlled {{the main line}} from west of Woking through to [...] and [...] along with part of the line to Reading) was located {{on the north side}} of the line to the east of the station, but this was superseded by a new facility in 2007 when the area was resignalled. It was announced in 2013 that a new Network Rail signalling operating centre would be built in Basingstoke; the contract was for £30 million. Twelve such regional control centres were to be built in the following 15 to 30 years, which will be responsible for all the signalling in the Wessex & South West England area (right through from London Waterloo to , Portsmouth Harbour and Exeter). [...] Several routes have had their signal control moved to Basingstoke, including the West of England main line [...] to Exmouth Jn in 2012 [...] and the Poole - [...] - [...] section of the line to Weymouth in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The Esk Valley line still uses a {{physical}} token system, modified so that train drivers operate the token instruments themselves (the {{system of working}} is known as No Signalman Token Remote and is used on other routes such as the Heart of Wales Line and the Tarka Line. Cabinets at Whitby, Glaisdale and Battersby and a signalman at Nunthorpe pass on key tokens to train drivers as authority to occupy specific line sections, ensuring that only one train can run on a section at a time. Until the mid-1980s, the line from Whitby to Sleights had two tracks, but these were removed along with the passing loop at Castleton. Trains can still pass at Glaisdale and Battersby, although Glaisdale is now the only station along the single track section that still regularly uses both platforms for [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] line trains. Between Nunthorpe and Guisborough Junction, the railway has been single track since 26 January 1986, although Nunthorpe retains its loop with separate [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] platforms. This section is worked from the <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> at Middlesbrough and uses track circuit block working.|$|E

40|$|In the partly funded {{collaborative}} project „ViPQuali 1 “ the ageing of a polymer part was numerical simulated {{on the basis}} of geographical, geometrical, environmental, material data, and time. Starting point was the numerical computer aided construction and design of the part. This construction is then exposed virtual in a box (Instrument <b>Panel</b> <b>Box)</b> to the environmental conditions described by the geographical data of the site and the calculated environmental conditions depending on day time, meteorological, material and geometrical data. The change in material properties (ageing) of the part at any point of the surface was estimated by using the dose-response-functions for these properties and statistical evaluations for the environmental conditions. For the validation of the numerical simulation parallel measurements on real parts were done in IP/DP boxes in Arizona and in the artificial investigations in the laboratories. The dose-response-functions for the polypropylene specimen were additional developed in an exposure program with Xenon Text Beta equipment.

40|$|The aim of {{the joint}} project ViPQuali (Virtual Product Qualification) was to {{describe}} a component’s ageing behaviour in a given environment, by numerical simulation. Having chosen polypropylene (PP) as the material, which does not show sensitivity to moisture, the relevant weathering parameters of the dose–response functions could be limited to spectral irradiance and temperature. In artificial irradiation tests, for PP plates of varied stabiliser content, spectral sensitivity as well as temperature dependence of irradiation-caused crack formation was quantified. For that purpose, samples were exposed both to artificial weathering tests at various constant temperatures and to spectrally resolved irradiation. The temperature dependence could be modelled by an Arrhenius fit. For fitting the spectral sensitivity, a plateau function was chosen. Subsequently, the stabiliser content was parameterised and extrapolated. The formed dose–response functions were incorporated into a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software program, simulating the environment of a sample within a Phoenix-exposed IP/DP (Instrument Panel/Door <b>Panel</b> <b>box)</b> box, based on sun position and weather conditions, including radiation interactions. Observed local effects {{as well as the}} general ageing advance of PP hats are compared with respect to simulation and experiment. Resulting from this project, for this most simple example of PP of varied stabiliser content, the time to failure can be estimated for each weathering exposure environment with known time-resolved irradiance and temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{realization}} of Peti Isi (PI) ompong identification system {{has done in}} PT. Sinar Sosro KPB Ungaran. This device is used to detect the bottle amount in box or Peti Isi (PI). Besides that this device also gives a warning if there is less bottle in the Peti Isi (PI). This system consists of mechanical and electrical device. The mechanical device consists of iron plate, pass scheibe and the <b>panel</b> <b>box.</b> Then the electrical device consists of Photo Electric Switch Type Through Beam (Emitter – Reciever), Photo Electric Switch Type Diffuse Reflective, Relay Tipe MY, Timer Eksternal Tipe H 3 CR – A, and Sirine. The basic operation of this device is when the Peti Isi (PI) goes to the PI ompong identification system, initially the box will be detected by the Photo Electric Switch Type Diffuse Reflective. After this the logic will be continued to the Photo Electric Switch type Through Beam (Emitter – Reciever). Pass scheibe will detect {{whether or not the}} contents of bottles in crates. If Pass scheibe detects that no bottle, it will cover the Photo Electric Switchs Type Through Beam (Emmiter – Receiver). And after it closed, the sirens will beep as a sign that there is less bottle in the box. Peti Isi (PI) identification system has been realized by PT.

40|$|New {{generation}} {{optical instruments}} with very demanding stability requirements are being proposed and developed for space applications. STOP (Structural-Thermal-Optical Performance) analysis and optimization {{is crucial in}} meeting the very tight distortion budgets of these instruments. This presentation outlines STOP analysis and optimization approach {{in the context of}} WFC 3 (Wide-Field Camera 3), which is a radial instrument designed to replace the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC 2) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). WFC 3 houses two separate channels, UVIS and IR, and will have greater throughput and sensitivity than WFPC 2. WFC 3 line-of-sight alignment budget for the UVIS and IR channels are as small as 10 and 20 milli-arcsec, respectively. Its optical bench is the most critical subsystem effecting the optical stability of WFC 3 hence our effort concentrates on the design and analysis of the bench and its interfaces. Structural analysis has accompanied the mechanical design of the bench since the initial concept study. A high fidelity structural Finite Element Model (FEM) of the bench has been developed and used for minimizing its thermally induced distortions as well as sizing it to meet the stiffness and strength requirements of a Shuttle launch. The bench is a composite honeycomb <b>panel</b> <b>box</b> structure with a very low planar Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of approximately 0. 1 ppm/C. Optic components are mounted to super-INVAR inserts bonded into the panels. The bench is kinematically supported on three HST latches via interface struts, which are tailored to exhibit negative CTE to cancel out the thermal motions of the latches. The interface struts also incorporate flexure elements to minimize the mechanical distortions coming into the bench from its enclosure. Bench FEM is coupled with the enclosure FEM to quantify these effects. Short term or on-orbit STOP analysis includes distortion due to the temperature variations of the bench, the struts, and the enclosure. Long term or ground-to-orbit STOP analysis includes distortional effects of gravity release, desorption, and assembly in addition to the ground-to-orbit temperature variations. A rigorous testing program has been implemented for verifying the material properties and the analysis predictions. STOP analysis results demonstrate that both the short-term and the long-term alignment budgets will be met. Presentation will cover design and analysis details that are critical to a successful implementation of the STOP analysis and optimization process...|$|E
