40|$|Abstract Background Since updated {{population}} registers {{do not exist}} in many countries {{it is often difficult}} to sample valid <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> from the study base to a case-control study. Use of patient controls is an alternative option if the exposure experience under study for these patients are interchangeable with the experience for <b>population</b> <b>controls.</b> Patient controls may even be preferable from <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> under certain conditions. In this study we examine if colon cancer patients can serve as surrogates for proper <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> in case-control studies of occupational risk factors. Methods The study was conducted from 1995 to 1997. Incident colon cancer controls (N = 428) aged 35 – 69 years with a histological verified diagnosis and <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> (N = 583) were selected. Altogether 254 (59 %) of the colon cancer controls and 320 (55 %) of the <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> were interviewed about occupational, medical and life style conditions. Results No statistical significant difference for educational level, medical history or smoking status was seen between the two control groups. There was evidence of a higher alcohol intake, less frequent work as a farmer and less exposure to pesticides among colon cancer controls. Conclusions Use of colon cancer controls may provide valid exposure estimates in studies of many occupational risk factors for cancer, but not for studies on exposure related to farming. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Several quality-of-life {{studies in}} {{patients}} awaiting major joint replacement {{have focused on}} the outcomes of surgery. Interest in examining patients on the elective waiting list has increased since the beginning of 2000. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients waiting for total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement in three Finnish hospitals, and compared patients' HRQoL with that of <b>population</b> <b>controls.</b> Methods A total of 133 patients awaiting major joint replacement due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee joint were prospectively followed from the time the patient was placed on the waiting list to hospital admission. A sample of controls matched by age, gender, housing and home municipality was drawn from the computerised population register. HRQoL was measured by the generic 15 D instrument. Differences between patients and the <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> were tested by the independent samples t-test and between the measurement points by the paired samples t-test. A linear regression model was used to explain the variance in the 15 D score at admission.

5|$|Another {{instance}} of <b>population</b> <b>control</b> is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf <b>population</b> <b>control</b> through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of <b>population</b> <b>control</b> as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative <b>population</b> <b>control</b> methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{whether there}} are {{differences}} among hospital and <b>population</b> <b>controls.</b> MethodsTwo case-control studies were conducted on lung cancer risk factors in the Santiago de Compostela Public Health District. Whereas one used randomly chosen censusbased <b>population</b> <b>controls,</b> the other used consecutive hospital controls that went to the reference hospital for non-smoking-related trivial interventions. The differences were analyzed using logistic regression. The dependent variable was type of <b>control</b> (hospital or <b>population).</b> ResultsHospital <b>controls</b> had a similar tobacco habit than <b>population</b> <b>controls,</b> but consumed more alcohol. For those consuming more than 50 ml daily, the risk of being a hospital control was 4. 83 (95 %CI: 2. 55 - 9. 14). ConclusionsThere may be some differences between hospital and population-based controls, which {{must be taken into account}} in the design of case-control studies. It is necessary to ascertain whether such differences are reproduced at other geographic locations and whether they can affect estimation of exposure-disease...|$|R
30|$|Finally, another {{limitation}} to {{the study}} is {{that we did not}} find a suitable <b>control</b> <b>population.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>population</b> we do have comes exclusively from the National Capital Area and would not be suitable for comparison.

The author conducted a case-control study of leukemia in children using two <b>control</b> groups, <b>population</b> and hospital <b>controls</b> (cancers other than leukemia and severe blood diseases), between 1980 and 1993 in Québec, Canada. Maternal, paternal, and child factors not known {{to be associated with}} leukemia as well as factors possibly associated were selected for analysis. Most factors were taken directly from parental interviews, but two factors related to parental occupational exposures were blindly coded by chemists. Hospital and <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> were compared using odds ratios estimated from logistic regression. Cases were compared with both types of controls with the same statistical method. Prevalence data from ongoing population surveys were compared with reported prevalence in controls. From the former comparisons and the distribution of socioeconomic variables, results suggested that study groups came from the same base population. Nevertheless, reported and coded exposures among hospital controls were closer to those of cases than to those of <b>population</b> <b>controls.</b> Although substantially different for only one factor, inferences using hospital controls in comparison with <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> resulted in odds ratios closer to the null value. bias (epidemiology); case-control studies; child; epidemiologic methods; leukemia; selection bias Abbreviation: ICD- 9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision...|$|R

5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on <b>population</b> <b>control</b> and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring <b>population</b> <b>control.</b> In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E

The population included 105 patients with newly diagnosed colon adenoma, 843 general <b>population</b> <b>controls,</b> and 84 hospital controls who had no pathologic lesions at colonoscopy. The adenoma patients and the hospital controls underwent total colonoscopy between November 1992 and March 1994. Information about diet, cigarette smoking and alcohol use were obtained with a self-administered questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} compare adenoma patients with general <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> and with hospital controls. We found that current cigarette smokers had a higher risk (OR = 2. 86, CI = 1. 20 - 6. 80) than did nonsmoking hospital controls. Current alcohol use did not affect the risk of colon adenoma. Ex-drinkers had a higher risk (OR = 2. 36, CI = 1. 02 - 5. 45) than did nondrinking general <b>population</b> <b>controls.</b> The same tendency was observed in comparison with hospital controls. The consumption of raw vegetables was inversely related to the risk of colon adenoma when adenoma patients were compared with general <b>population</b> <b>controls</b> (P for trend = 0. 02) or hospital controls (trend P= 0. 17). Having one bowel movement per day was associated with a lower risk than having less or more frequently bowel movements when adenoma patients were compared with either general <b>population</b> or hospital <b>controls.</b> The present study suggests that the high consumption of raw vegetables is important in the primary prevention of colon adenoma...|$|R

Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
