6000|$|Certain wasp-like insects, which {{construct}} in {{the corners}} of the verandahs clay cells for their larvae, are very numerous in the neighbourhood of Rio. These cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders and caterpillars, which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive, until their eggs are hatched; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless, half-killed victims--a sight which has been described by an enthusiastic naturalist as curious and pleasing! (2/8. In a Manuscript in the British Museum by Mr. Abbott, who made his observations in Georgia; see Mr. A. White's paper in the [...] "Annals of Natural History" [...] volume 7 page 472. Lieutenant Hutton has described a sphex with similar habits in India, in the [...] "Journal of the Asiatic Society" [...] volume 1 page 555.) I was much interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a <b>Pepsis</b> and a large spider of the genus Lycosa. The wasp made a sudden dash at its prey, and then flew away: the spider was evidently wounded, for, trying to escape, it rolled down a little slope, but had still strength sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass. The wasp soon returned, and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim. It then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox; making short semicircular casts, and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings and antennae. The spider, though well concealed, was soon discovered, and the wasp, evidently still afraid of its adversary's jaws, after much manoeuvring, inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax. At last, carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless spider, it proceeded to drag away the body. But I stopped both tyrant and prey. (2/9. Don Felix Azara volume 1 page 175, mentioning a hymenopterous insect, probably of the same genus, says he saw it dragging a dead spider through tall grass, in a straight line to its nest, which was one hundred and sixty-three paces distant. He adds that the wasp, in order to find the road, every now and then made [...] "demi-tours d'environ trois palmes.") ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pepsis</b> grossa, {{formerly}} {{and perhaps}} {{better known as}} <b>Pepsis</b> formosa, {{is a very large}} species of pepsid spider wasp from the southern part of North America, south to northern South America. It preys on tarantula spiders, giving rise to the name tarantula hawk for the wasps in the genus <b>Pepsis</b> and the related Hemipepsis. Only the females hunt so only they are capable of delivering a sting, which with that of the bullet ant is considered the most painful of any insect sting scoring 4.0 to the bullet ant's 4.0+ on the Schmidt sting pain index. It is the state insect of New Mexico. [...] There are three colour morphs, the xanthic orange winged form and the melanic black winged form. In northern South America there is a third form, known as [...] "lygamorphic" [...] which has a dark base to the wings which have dark amber median patches and a pale tip.|$|E

The genus is restricted to South America.|$|E
50|$|Hemipepsis is a genus {{of large}} pepsine spider wasps found {{throughout}} the tropics. They {{are commonly known as}} tarantula hawks. Hemipepsis wasps are morphologically similar to the related genera <b>Pepsis</b> and Entypus, but distinguishable by the pattern of wing venation. In South Africa 18 plant species from three plant families, the Apocynaceae, Orchidaceae, and Asparagaceae subfamily Scilloideae are pollinated exclusively by Hemipepsis wasps.|$|E

50|$|The {{largest of}} the ants, and the {{heaviest}} species of the order, are the females of the African Dorylus helvolus, reaching a length of 5.1 cm and a weight of 8.5 g. The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, Dinoponera gigantea, from South America, averaging up to 3.3 cm from the mandibles {{to the end of}} abdomen. Workers of the bulldog ant (Myrmecia brevinoda) of Australia are up to 3.7 cm in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles. The {{largest of the}} bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is Megachile pluto of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8 cm long, with a 6.3 cm wingspan. Nearly as large, the carpenter bees can range up to 2.53 cm. The largest wasp is probably the so-called tarantula hawk species <b>Pepsis</b> pulszkyi of South America, at up to 6.8 cm long and 11.6 cm wingspan, although many other <b>Pepsis</b> approach a similar size.|$|E

Mistaken by the mimicry of Brassia, the wasp stings the lip, while trying to grasp its prey without any success. By these movements the wasp comes into contact with the pollinarium, that then sticks to its head. By flying to another Brassia flower, this flower gets pollinated.|$|E
50|$|A ballot {{to select}} a state insect for New Mexico was {{returned}} by almost 10,000 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders from 100 New Mexico Schools and the tarantula hawk wasp was chosen by an overwhelming margin, receiving over 50% of the vote. Following which, on 3 April 1989, New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers signed House Bill No. 468 declaring that the tarantula hawk wasp <b>Pepsis</b> formosa was the official insect of the State of New Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Pepsin {{was one of}} {{the first}} enzymes to be {{discovered}}. It was discovered in 1836 by Theodor Schwann. Schwann coined its name from the Greek word [...] <b>pepsis,</b> meaning [...] "digestion" [...] (from [...] peptein [...] "to digest"). Scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes, and pepsin {{was one of the}}m. An acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen-based foods into water-soluble material was determined to be pepsin.|$|E
50|$|Their most {{dangerous}} predator is the <b>pepsis</b> wasp, commonly called the Tarantula hawk. Locally {{it is known}} as a Matacacata (The Tarantula-killer). This is a very large wasp, with an iridescent blue-green body and orange-red wings that grows to about 2 inches or more in length. It captures the spider in its burrow or sometimes in the open and stings it to paralyze it and then lays its eggs on the abdomen. The wasp will drag its victim to a safe place to incubate its young. Once the larvae hatch they will feed on the alive but paralyzed tarantula until it dies.|$|E
50|$|The more {{familiar}} species {{are up to}} 5 cm long, making them among the largest of wasps, and have blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights). The vivid coloration found on the bodies, and especially wings, of these wasps is an aposematism, advertising to potential predators the wasps' ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female <b>Pepsis</b> grossa can be up to 7 mm long, and the sting {{is considered one of}} the most painful insect stings in the world.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Pompilidae {{get their}} common name, “spider wasps”, from their notable behavior of hunting and killing spiders, often larger than themselves, as food for their larvae. They provide {{each of their}} larvae with a single prey/host, which must {{be large enough to}} serve as its food source throughout its development. <b>Pepsis</b> thisbe of the southwestern United States exhibits a direct correlation between adult wasp body length and the weight of its host spider, Aphonopelma echina. Because the size of a P. thisbe adult is determined {{by the size of the}} host provided for it by its mother, the seasonal frequency of host sizes implicitly will determine the size variation in adult wasps.|$|E
50|$|Wasps {{of the genera}} <b>Pepsis</b> and Hemipepsis produce large {{quantities}} of venom and when stung humans experience immediate, intense, excruciating short term pain. Although the immediate pain of a tarantula hawk sting is among the greatest recorded for any stinging insect, the venom itself is not very toxic. The lethality of 65 mg/kg in mice for the venom of P. formosa pattoni reveals that the defensive value of the sting and the venom is based entirely upon pain. The pain experienced by the potential predator also forms an enabling basis {{for the evolution of}} aposematic coloration, aposematic odor, and a Müllerian mimicry complex involving most species of tarantula hawks as well as Batesian mimicry with other harmless insect species.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Justin O. Schmidt, a {{researcher}} from Arizona, developed a hymenopteran sting pain scale, {{now known as}} the Schmidt sting pain index. In this index, a 0 is given to a sting from an insect that cannot break through human skin, a 2 is given for intermediate pain, and a 4 is given for intense pain. The scale rates stings from 78 different species in 42 different genera. Spider wasps of the genus <b>Pepsis,</b> also known as tarantula hawks, have a sting rating of 4. The sting is described as [...] "blinding, fierce, and shockingly electric. A running hair dryer has been dropped into your bubble bath." [...] Only the sting of the Bullet Ant, Paraponera clavata, is ranked higher, with a 4+ rating.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very large}} wasp which has three colour forms, an orange-winged (xanthic) form, a black-winged (melanic) form and a form which shows a three {{coloured}} wing pattern. The three colour forms are normally geographically separated, the melanic form {{occurs in the}} western part of the North American range, the xanthic form predominates over the remainder of the distribution except that lygamorphic individuals predominate in the southernmost part of the species range. Individuals of the melanic form of P. grossa are difficult to separate from <b>Pepsis</b> mexicana, but P. mexicana is always noticeably smaller than P. grossa. [...] The females body length is between 30-51mm, the males 24-40mm. The black and orange colour pattern combine with the wasps jerky behaviour and strong odour to give a aposemastic warning to predators.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless {{of their}} fearsome reputation, tarantulas {{themselves}} are {{an object of}} predation. The most specialized of these predators are large members of the wasp family Pompilidae such as the wasp Hemipepsis ustulata. These wasps are called [...] "tarantula hawks". The largest tarantula hawks, {{such as those in}} the genus <b>Pepsis,</b> will track, attack and kill large tarantulas. They use olfaction to find the lair of a tarantula. The wasp must deliver a sting to the underside of the spider's cephalothorax, exploiting the thin membrane between the basal leg segments. This paralyzes the spider, and the wasp then drags it back into its burrow before depositing an egg on the prey's abdomen. The wasp then seals the spider in its burrow and flies off to search for more hosts. The wasp larva hatches and feeds on the spider's non-essential parts and, as it approaches pupation, it consumes the remainder. Other arthropods, such as giant centipedes are also known to prey on tarantulas.|$|E
