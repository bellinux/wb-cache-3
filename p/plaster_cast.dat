5|$|A Tarbosaurus skull {{found in}} 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian {{scientists}} (PIN 553-1, originally called Gorgosaurus lancinator) included the skull cavity {{that held the}} brain. Making a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast,</b> called an endocast, of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about {{the shape of a}} Tarbosaurus brain. A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of Tarbosaurus brain structure and function.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Plaster</b> <b>casts</b> as {{the medium}} for data {{collection}} in orthodontic studies pose disadvantages. In this study, we aimed to assess the validity and reliability of using 3 -dimensional (3 D) photographs instead of <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> to determine the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) score. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from the clinical records of 91 subjects. The IOTN grades were independently determined first from <b>plaster</b> <b>casts,</b> then from 2 -dimensional (2 D) and 3 D photographs only, and then from 2 D and 3 D photographs combined with radiographs. IOTN grade agreement was assessed using kappa statistics and percentages of agreement. RESULTS: The percentages of agreement between both photographic sets and the <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> varied among the different occlusal traits from 63. 7 % to 93. 4 %. Agreement between the IOTN grades obtained from 2 D and 3 D photographs only and the IOTN grades obtained from <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> was fair (K = 0. 35). The reliability of using 2 D and 3 D photographs instead of <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> was improved when those were combined with radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: In general terms, orthodontic treatment need can be assessed from 2 D and 3 D pictures; however, the individual occlusal traits are sufficiently assessed only when these pictures are combined with radiographs. <b>Plaster</b> <b>casts</b> remain the preferred method compared with 3 D pictures for assessment of the IOTN...|$|R

5|$|Another feud {{created for}} Over the Edge {{involved}} Triple H and The Rock, who would {{meet each other}} in a standard singles match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. The script called for The Rock to portray an injury to his arm that required him to wear a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast.</b> Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there {{he went to the}} hospital. He had {{sustained}} multiple fractures of his right thigh, and his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E

5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E

5|$|Nevelson's first {{experience}} of art {{was at the}} age of nine at the Rockland Public Library, where she saw a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> of Joan of Arc. Shortly thereafter she decided to study art, taking drawing in high school, where she also served as basketball captain. She painted watercolor interiors, in which furniture appeared molecular in structure, rather like her later professional work. Female figures made frequent appearances. In school, she practiced her English, her second language, as Yiddish was spoken at home. Unhappy with her family's economic status, language differences, the religious discrimination of the community, and her school, Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York.|$|E
5|$|Surgeon and {{historian}} William Wilde recollected {{that as a}} medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest {{that in the early}} 19thcentury a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> of a human face with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital. Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal, in the later half of the 19thcentury the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common. In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.|$|E

5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a <b>plaster</b> <b>cast</b> of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore a}} new {{technique}} for reconstructing and measuring three-dimensional (3 D) models of orthodontic <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> using multi-baseline digital close-range photogrammetry (MBDCRP) with a single-lens reflex camera. Thirty sets of orthodontic <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> that do not exhibit severe horizontal overlap (> 2 mm) between any two teeth were recorded by a single-lens reflex camera with 72 pictures taken in different directions. The 3 D models of these casts were reconstructed and measured using the open source software MeshLab. These parameters, including mesio-distal crown diameter, arch width, and arch perimeter, were recorded six times on both the 3 D digital models and on <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> by two examiners. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Bland-Altman method to measure agreement between the novel method and the traditional calliper method by calculating the differences between mean values. The average differences between the measurements of the photogrammetric 3 D models and the <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> were 0. 011 - 0. 402 mm. The mean differences between measurements obtained by the photogrammetric 3 D models and the dental casts were not significant except for the lower arch perimeter (P> 0. 05), and all the differences were regarded as clinically acceptable (< 0. 5 mm). Measurements obtained by MBDCRP are compared well with those obtained from <b>plaster</b> <b>casts,</b> indicating that MBDCRP is an alternate way to store and measure dental <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> without severe horizontal overlap between any two teeth...|$|R

40|$|Yardsticks {{have been}} {{developed}} to measure dental arch relations in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients as diagnostic proxies for the underlying skeletal relationship. Travelling with <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> to compare results between CLP centres is inefficient so the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the reliability of using digital models or photographs of dental <b>casts</b> instead of <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> for rating dental arch relationships in children with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (CBCLP). Dental casts of children with CBCLP (n= 20) were included. <b>Plaster</b> <b>casts,</b> digital models and photographs of the <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> were available for all the children at 6, 9, and 12 years of age. All three record formats were scored using the bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) yardstick by four observers in random order. No significant differences were found for the BCLP yardstick scores among the three formats. The interobserver weighted kappa scores were between 0. 672 and 0. 934. Comparison between the formats per observer resulted in weighted kappa scores between 0. 692 and 0. 885. It is concluded that digital models and photographs of dental casts can be used for rating dental arch relationships in patients with CBCLP. These formats are a reliable alternative for BCLP yardstick assessments on conventional <b>plaster</b> <b>casts...</b>|$|R
