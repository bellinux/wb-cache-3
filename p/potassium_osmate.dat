40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the synthesis and activity of a range of compounds based on the benzo[b]thiophene- 2 -carboxamide structural motif as potential new antimalarial agents, {{and to a lesser extent}} as antibacterial agents. In order to subsequently explore any structure-biological activity relationships, the first part of the project involved the systematic synthesis of some 39 non-fused substituted benzo[b]thiophene amide derivatives including tetrahydroisoquinolines, tetrahydro-β-carbolines, dihydropyrroles, piperazines, piperidines and other bridged ring systems as part of the amide-nitrogen component. Methods for the synthesis of the new amide derivatives were developed based on benzo[b]thiophene acid chloride and amine reactions, or on dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-mediated carboxylic acid amine coupling reactions. Further substitution reactions were also undertaken on tetrahydro-β-carboline amides (55, 56, and 57) with the introduction of an N-benzyl group and an N-onitrobenzyl group in the case of 55. The N-boc protected piperazine amide 63 also served as a precursor for other N-substituted piperazine amide derivatives. A single crystal X-ray structure on amides 63 and 73 confirmed the amide rotamer geometry in the solid state with these compounds. The second part of the project incorporated the synthesis of fused analogues which were more conformationally restricted while still retaining the benzo[b]thiophene amide structural motif. A new free radical cyclisation approach to the benzo[b]thieno[2, 3 -c]pyridin- 1 -one system in compound 92 was developed, together with the corresponding model isoquinolinone analogue 95. The reaction was based on the use of tributyltin hydride and AIBN to produce the required free radical intermediate from an arylbromide precursor. The free radical cyclisation reaction was extended to synthesise N-benzyl and substituted N-benzyl analogues of 92. The dihydroxylation of the N-allyl substituent in 92 was achieved using <b>potassium</b> <b>osmate</b> and N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO). A further free radical cyclisation route to the N-benzo[b]thien- 2 -oyl derivatives 112 was also achieved. The synthesis of the novel 9 -membered ring containing fused derivatives 120 and 121 was also achieved. This synthesis involved ring closing metathesis methodology using the bis-allyl amides 118 and 119 and Grubbs’ I ruthenium catalyst. The polymer supported version of this catalyst gave better yields of the cyclisation products. A single crystal X-ray structure of 120 confirmed the cis geometry of the double bond in the 9 -membered ring. In the course of preparing the required precursor 119 for the 9 -membered ring synthesis, a new imine allylation reagent combination was discovered involving zinc, allyltributyltin and boron trifluoride etherate. This reaction is worthy of further investigation to determine its wider synthetic utility. Ring closing metathesis reactions also afforded the dihydropyrrole amides 113 and 114 in good yields. A palladium-mediated cyclisation approach to the new benzo[b]thieno[2, 3 - c]pyrrolo[2, 3 -a]indol- 11 -one system in 126 was also accomplished based on the Nacylindoles 124 and 125. A number of the compounds were tested for their possible in vitro antimalarial activity against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum (K 1 CB 1 and TM 4 / 8. 2) and two active leads, the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivatives 95 and 102, were discovered. Some potential structure-activity trends for the tested benzo[b]thiophene derivatives were observed (Chapter 4). Antibacterial testing of a few benzo[b]thiophene compounds against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains was also done, and the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivative 92 exhibited promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus...|$|E
40|$|Ligand design {{criteria}} for stabilization of high valent metals {{have been developed}} and applied to osmium, copper, and cobalt. Ligands {{have been designed to}} have favorable coordination properities, be noninnocent, and be resistant to oxidative degradation. A new subset of ligands has been synthesized, these being called Class II polyanionic chelating (PAC) ligands. These ligands possess two N-amido donors and two alkoxy donors. Both units have pKa's of approximately 18 and so would be expected to be very powerful donors. A number of ligands of this type have been developed with 5, 5, 5; 5, 6, 5; 6, 5, 6; and 6, 6, 6 coordination geometries. The key steps in all of the syntheses are coupling of highly hindered carboxylic acids with highly hindered diamines. It is found that the 5, 5, 5; 5, 6, 5; and 6, 5, 6 coordinating ligands all stabilize Os(VI) monooxo compounds. The 5, 6, 5 and 6, 5, 6 coordinating ligands also stabilize Os(IV) complexes of octahedral geometry. The 6, 6, 6 ligands of this type do not coordinate to osmium. Of the 5, 6, 5 ligands, the most interesting results have been obtained with HrHMPA-DMP, or 2, 4 -bis-hydroxymethylpropamido- 2, 4 -dimethyl- 3 -pentanone. Reaction of this with <b>potassium</b> <b>osmate</b> produces Os(Vl) (1) η^ 4 -HMPA-DMP) O. This molecule has been structurally characterized. It assumes a distorted square pyramidal geometry with the metal atom 0. 8 Å above the plane formed by the four donor atoms of the PAC ligand. The distortion appears to occur by pyramidalization at the amide nitrogen atoms, as is shown by the _(XN) values (17. 0 ° and 9. 1 °). Os(HMPA-DMP) O undergoes a number of interesting reactions. It is cleanly converted to the trans-K_ 2 0 s(η^ 4 -HMPA-DMP) 0 _ 2 species with base; it can be electrochemically reduced to a stable (although highly air-sensitive) Os(V) species; and it can be chemically reduced to produce trans-Os(IV) (1] 4 -HMPA-DMP) L_ 2 complexes where L can be a wide variety of pyridines. These Os(IV) compounds may be oxidized chemically or electrochemically to produce Os(V) compounds. The Os(V) /(IV) potential may be precisely controlled by appropriate choices of L allowing production of tunable oxidants. It is also observed that these Os(IV) compounds react with molecular oxygen to regenerate the Os(VI) monooxo species. The compounds catalytically reduce molecular oxygen and oxidize triphenylphosphine to triphenylphosphine oxide. Kinetic studies are consistent with a rate-determining step involving dissociation of a pyridine ligand from the trans-Os(IV) (η^ 4 -HMPADMP) L_ 2 species to generate a vacant coordination site to which oxygen may bind. The reaction has been examined with a variety of pyridine ligands. The rate of air oxidation decreases with increased electron donor ability of substituents on the pyridine ring, k_(obs) being 1. 9 (1) X 10 ^(- 6) min ^(- 1) for the compound synthesized from 4 -bromopyridine and k_(obs) for compounds synthesized with dialkylaminopyridines being virtually too small to measure. Similar Os(VI) monooxo and octahedral Os(IV) compounds have been synthesized with a number of other Class II PAC ligands. The Os(IV) and Os(VI) compounds produced in this work have been compared to similar species produced with Class I PAC ligands. The Class II PAC ligands have also been used to stabilize trivalent copper. A number of such compounds have been synthesized (one of which, [TPP][Cu(η^ 4 - HMPA-B) ]) has been structurally characterized) and compared with the corresponding Class I compounds. While no Cu(III) -Class I PAC complexes were stable (although reversible Cu(III) /(II) were observed in these cases), the Class II PAC ligands led to stable Cu(III) complexes, exhibiting Cu(III) /(II) potentials as low as - 1. 06 V vs Fe^+ /Fe. Such potentials are much lower than have been seen for any complexes synthesized to date with first-row donor atoms. The [TMA][Cu(III) (HMPA-DMP) ] complex {{is an example of a}} Cu(III) compound with a completely innocent ligand complement. In this case, resonance structures from lower oxidation states are not possible thus enabling the oxidation state in this complex to be unambiguously assigned as +III. The Class II PAC ligands stabilize cobalt in the rare trivalent, square planar form. These compounds, while paramagnetic with two unpaired spins, may be characterized by proton NMR. One such complex, Na[Co(III) (HMPA-B) ] has been characterized by X-ray crystallography. These compounds catalyze the epoxidation of styrene using iodosoarenes as the stoichiometric oxidants. ...|$|E
