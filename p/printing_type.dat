5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of <b>printing</b> <b>type.</b> Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized <b>printing</b> <b>type</b> production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|Woodblock {{printing}} {{made the}} written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670. The Diamond Sutra is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868. Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not. With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty. Although the later Bi Sheng's movable type printing in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant <b>printing</b> <b>type</b> in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia. The first use of the playing card during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.|$|E

25|$|Some of his inventions were an {{automated}} (self-striking) water clock (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved {{model of the}} previous metal movable <b>printing</b> <b>type</b> created in the Goryeo Dynasty. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the sight glass, and the udometer.|$|E

50|$|On the {{admission}} of George Knowles in 1799, the firm took the name of Fry, Steele, & Co.

50|$|Interest in {{type design}} was stimulated in 1922 by D. B. Updike's <b>Printing</b> <b>Types.</b> This {{led to the}} newly {{appointed}} advisor to the Monotype Corporation, Stanley Morison, initiating a program of recutting past faces. Among them was Fournier's self-named font.|$|R
50|$|Early {{cars from}} Jan 1957 to about chassis number 476 in June 1957 still used a column gear change. During their {{production}} run a Deluxe model was offered which was bodily the same but featured polished wheel trims and spinners, tachometer and twin carburettors. The chassis plate {{was similar to}} the Anzani type on the early cars but was later changed to a <b>printed</b> <b>type</b> fitted to the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder. The <b>printed</b> <b>type</b> chassis plate had <b>type</b> ‘SE328’ <b>printed</b> on it. Most of these cars had the three-speed gearbox similar to the Anzani except for the mounting flanges. All of the cars had the sloping leading edges to the doors.|$|R

50|$|Direct to Card - Also {{known as}} Edge to Edge Printing. Direct to Card {{is where the}} print-head comes {{in direct contact with}} the card.

50|$|In <b>printing,</b> <b>type</b> metal (sometimes called hot metal) {{refers to}} the metal alloys used in {{traditional}} typefounding and hot metal typesetting.

50|$|In {{the history}} of {{typewriters}}, early typewriters were initially thought to be replacements for printing and so featured proportional fonts.

His expedient was filled with other activities in the office, all providing a thorough training in the field of publications.|$|R
