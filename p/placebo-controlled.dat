5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD is {{not itself}} currently {{used as a}} treatment for any disease. However, it is being studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. Evidence on the benefit of NAD in neurodegeneration is mixed; some studies in mice have produced promising results whereas a <b>placebo-controlled</b> clinical trial in humans failed to show any effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not <b>placebo-controlled.</b> And, based on the findings of <b>placebo-controlled</b> studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{metformin}} {{has been}} associated with increased homocysteine levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial |authors=Wulffele MG, Kooy A, Lehert P, Bets D, Ogterop JC, Borger van der Burg B, Donker AJ, Stehouwer CD |volume=254 |issue=5 |pages=455–63|pmid=14535967 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01213.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118889232/HTMLSTART}} and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} Juice Plus on {{blood levels of}} {{homocysteine}} {{have been reported in}} five studies, all conducted in subjects with normal homocysteine levels (15 μmol/L). An initial study, which was not double-blind nor <b>placebo-controlled,</b> reported a 37% decrease in homocysteine levels in subjects taking Juice Plus. More rigorous studies, including three that were randomized, double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trials, found that homocysteine levels were not reduced or were reduced to a much lesser extent than originally reported.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is not {{recommended}} for patients with chronic schizophrenia. A 1982 double-blinded, <b>placebo-controlled</b> study found clonazepam increases violent behavior in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Early {{case reports}} had {{indicated}} that trazodone {{is associated with}} improvement in obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> study found that trazodone lacked antiobsessional effects.|$|E
25|$|In middle-aged men, no {{significant}} effect of prasterone supplementation on lean body mass, strength, or testosterone levels {{was found in a}} randomized <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial.|$|E
25|$|Benfotiamine is an oral prodrug of Vitamin B1 {{that has}} several <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{double-blind}} trials proving efficacy in treating neuropathy {{and various other}} diabetic comorbidities.|$|E
25|$|In one double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> study {{conducted}} in the United Kingdom, 48.6% of patients who used the nicotine patch, in conjunction with their standard treatment, showed complete resolution of symptoms. Another randomized, double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled,</b> single-center clinical trial {{conducted in the}} United States showed that 39% of patients who used the patch showed significant improvement, versus 9% of those given a placebo. Use of a transdermal nicotine patch without the addition of other standard treatments such as mesalazine has relapse occurrence rates similar to standard treatment {{without the use of}} nicotine.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in controlling motion sickness. A randomized, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial of ondansetron to treat motion sickness in air ambulance personnel showed subjective improvement, {{but it was not}} statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|Two small, <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{trials have}} been {{conducted}} to assess the efficacy of ondansetron for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery.

25|$|Clinical reports {{indicate}} that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a <b>placebo-controlled</b> study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.|$|E
25|$|Clinical medical {{practice}} changed based upon two parallel WHI studies of postmenopausal HRT. Prior studies were smaller, {{and many were}} of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> clinical trials of HRT in healthy, postmenopausal women.|$|E
25|$|Dimethylglycine (DMG) is {{hypothesized}} to improve speech and reduce autistic behaviors, {{and is a}} commonly used supplement. Two double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> studies found no statistically significant effect on autistic behaviors, and reported few side effects.

25|$|Stimulation of lean {{body mass}} and {{prevention}} of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. However, a 2006 <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial of low-dose testosterone supplementation in elderly men {{with low levels of}} testosterone found no benefit on body composition, physical performance, insulin sensitivity, or quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue {{has been}} used as a placebo; {{physicians}} would tell their patients to expect their urine to change color and view this as a sign that their condition had improved. This same side effect makes methylene blue difficult to test in traditional <b>placebo-controlled</b> clinical studies.|$|E
25|$|Food challenges, {{especially}} double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> food challenges, are {{the gold}} standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions. Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone {{has also}} been {{reported}} to have antianxiety properties. In a randomized, double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial, the anxiolytic efficacy of trazodone was {{comparable to that of}} diazepam in weeks 3–8 of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, although patients treated with diazepam had greater improvement during the first 2 weeks of treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of clonazepam {{in the short-term}} treatment of panic disorder has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Some long-term trials have suggested a benefit of clonazepam {{for up to three}} years without the development of tolerance but these trials were not <b>placebo-controlled.</b> Clonazepam is also effective in the management of acute mania.|$|E
25|$|Two randomized, {{double-blind}} <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{studies have}} examined the effect of Juice Plus on serum cholesterol and LDL levels. One study found that Juice Plus had no significant effects; the other found slight decreases in cholesterol (6%) and LDL (9%) in subjects that took Orchard/Garden Blend, but no reductions among subjects who took Juice Plus Vineyard blend in addition.|$|E
25|$|The {{ethics of}} <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{studies have been}} debated in the {{revision}} process of the Declaration of Helsinki. Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor's developed countries versus the trial's targeted developing countries.|$|E
25|$|In {{a variety}} of studies, nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDS), like aspirin, have shown evidence of preventing esophageal cancer in people with Barrett's esophagus. However, none of these studies have been randomized, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trials, which are considered {{the gold standard for}} evaluating a medical intervention. In addition, the best dose of NSAIDs for cancer prevention is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (a <b>placebo-controlled,</b> {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} of 5 years duration), simvastatin reduced overall mortality {{in people with}} existing cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol by 30% and reduced cardiovascular mortality by 42%. The risks of heart attack, stroke, or needing a coronary revascularization procedure were reduced by 37%, 28%, and 37% respectively.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{may also}} be used to help {{decrease}} excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril lead to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of people; the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2010, the WOMAN (World Maternal Antifibrinolytic) trial began, a randomised, double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{study of}} {{tranexamic}} acid in 20 060 women with post-partum haemorrhage.

25|$|Repeated daily {{application}} of silver nitrate can induce adequate destruction of cutaneous warts, but occasionally pigmented scars may develop. In a <b>placebo-controlled</b> study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% {{one month after}} treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group.|$|E
25|$|In <b>placebo-controlled</b> {{clinical}} trials {{of up to}} nine weeks' duration of patients with MDD, a systematic evaluation of discontinuation symptoms in patients taking duloxetine following abrupt discontinuation found the following symptoms occurring at a rate {{greater than or equal}} to 2% and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, nausea, headache, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, and nightmare.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} antidepressants typically do not continue once {{the course of}} medication ends, resulting in {{a high rate of}} relapse. A 2003 meta-analysis of 31 <b>placebo-controlled</b> antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a placebo.|$|E
25|$|Knowingly {{giving a}} person a placebo {{when there is}} an {{effective}} treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While <b>placebo-controlled</b> trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of the {{prevalence}} of food intolerance vary widely from 2% to over 20% of the population. So far only three prevalence studies in Dutch and English adults {{have been based on}} double-blind, <b>placebo-controlled</b> food challenges. The reported prevalences of food allergy/intolerance (by questionnaires) were 12% to 19%, whereas the confirmed prevalences varied from 0.8% to 2.4%. For intolerance to food additives {{the prevalence}} varied between 0.01 and 0.23%.|$|E
