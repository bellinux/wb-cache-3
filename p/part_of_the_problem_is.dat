When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, I {{had nothing to do}} with this sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though the}} Cessna 206H is {{certified}} as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. [...] This {{is due to}} concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. [...] Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; {{it was a hot}} summer day). [...] A switch was added to the flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. [...] The other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about [...] ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle.

This DeLorean is then stolen by Edna Strickland, {{one of the}} game's main villains.

Then Officer Danny Parker nearly arrests Marty and Doc for allegedly having the car that Edna got away in.

After they get information from Mary, who was really Edna, they go to 1876. After they stop the fire that would've burned down Hill Valley, they chase down Edna, who is trying to get away in the first DeLorean. Marty synchronizes the two DeLoreans and hoverboards back to Doc's DeLorean, which is flying behind the one Edna's driving. They all travel back to 1931, with Edna's DeLorean duplicate vanishing because of the time ripples catching up with them, causing [...] "chronal decay" [...] (i.e., since the Alternate Doc timeline ceased to exist, the alternated Clone DeLorean was folded back with the real Clone DeLorean).|$|E

The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything.
