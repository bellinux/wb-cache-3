This phenomenon was identified as creep corrosion and was the motivation for this work. This dissertation advances the state of knowledge on the creep corrosion process and the strategies for mitigation. A range of plastic encapsulated packages with noble metal pre-plated leadframes, from different vendors, with different package attributes, were used in this study. Creep corrosion on the mold compound surface was reproduced in an accelerated manner using mixed flowing gas (MFG) testing in laboratory conditions. Of the three most widely-used industry-standard MFG testing conditions, Telcordia Outdoor was found to be the most effective environment to induce and promote creep corrosion over the mold compound; Battelle Class <b>III</b> <b>environment</b> can also induce the similar effects of creep corrosion on mold compound, but in a limited rate on selective packages; Telcordia Indoor was found to induce no creep corrosion on the mold compound over a 30 day test time. In both Telcordia Outdoor and Battelle Class <b>III</b> <b>environments,</b> packages attributes and applied pre-conditionings were found to have no significant influence on the creep corrosion effect. Creep corrosion over the mold compound showed a dendritic formation. The thickness of the corrosion product layer on the mold compound tended to increase with increased exposure time. Creep corrosion products were electrically conductive and were able to bridge the adjacent leads, thereby causing electrical shorts. The corrosion products were found to consist primarily of copper oxides, copper chlorides, and copper sulfides. No distinct differences in corrosion products composition was observed on the lead versus the mold compound surfaces. Conformal coating was identified as an effective mitigation strategy to eliminate creep corrosion on noble metal pre-plated leadframe packages...|$|R

40|$|Background: Care {{plans have}} been part of the primary care {{landscape}} in Australia for almost two decades. With an increasing number of patients presenting with multiple chronic conditions, it is timely to consider whether care plans meet the needs of patients and clinicians. Objectives: To review and benchmark existing care plan templates that include recommendations for comorbid conditions, against four key criteria: (i) patient preferences, (ii) setting <b>priorities,</b> (<b>iii)</b> identifying conflicts and synergies between conditions, and (iv) setting dates for reviewing the care plan. Design: Document analysis of Australian care plan templates published from 2006 to 2014 that incorporated recommendations for managing comorbid conditions in primary care. Results: Sixteen templates were reviewed. All of the care plan templates addressed patient preference, but this was not done comprehensively. Only three templates included setting priorities. None assisted in identifying conflicts and synergies between conditions. Fifteen templates included setting a date for reviewing the care plan. Conclusions: Care plans are a well-used tool in primary care practice, but their current format perpetuates a single-disease approach to care, which works contrary to their intended purpose. Restructuring care plans to incorporate shared decision-making and attention to patient preferences may assist in shifting the focus back to the patient and their care needs.

40|$|PURPOSE: Care home {{residents}} with multiple sclerosis (MS) are more physically dependent {{than the average}} residents. However, {{little is known about}} their quality of life (QoL). We investigated the experiences of residents with MS using qualitative research methods and developed a conceptual model of QoL. METHODS: Twenty-one people with MS (age range 43 - 80 years) residing in a range of care homes were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Four core model domains identified were as follows: (i) What the care home means to the residents, (ii) Self, (<b>iii)</b> <b>Environment</b> and (iv) Relationships. Some residents reported that care homes can relieve the burden on family, address specific environmental issues regarding safety and act as a form of social support. However, some reported isolation and difficulties adjusting to life in the care home. Having access to rehabilitation strengthened the feelings of independence within the care home. CONCLUSIONS: QoL is a broad, multidimensional construct for residents with MS. QoL measures for residents with MS should incorporate broad domains, including environmental factors. The conceptual model highlighted several areas for improving QoL of residents with MS, including more involvement of family members, encouraging independence by providing access to rehabilitation and providing support in the transition process...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{robust and}} stable legged {{locomotion}} in uneven terrain, animals must effectively coordinate limb swing and stance phases, which involve distinct yet coupled dynamics. Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the critical influence of swing-leg trajectory on stability, disturbance rejection, leg loading and economy of walking and running. Yet, simulations suggest {{that not all}} these factors can be simultaneously optimized. A potential trade-off arises between the optimal swing-leg trajectory for disturbance rejection (to maintain steady gait) versus regulation of leg loading (for injury avoidance and economy). Here we investigate how running guinea fowl manage this potential trade-off by comparing experimental data to predictions of hypothesis-based simulations of running over a terrain drop perturbation. We use a simple model to predict swing-leg trajectory and running dynamics. In simulations, we generate optimized swing-leg trajectories based upon specific hypotheses for task-level control priorities. We optimized swing trajectories to achieve i) constant peak force, ii) constant axial impulse, or iii) perfect disturbance rejection (steady gait) in the stance following a terrain drop. We compare simulation predictions to experimental data on guinea fowl running over a visible step down. Swing and stance dynamics of running guinea fowl closely match simulations optimized to regulate leg loading (priorities i and ii), and do not match the simulations optimized for disturbance rejection (<b>priority</b> <b>iii).</b> The simulations reinforce previous findings that swing-leg trajectory targeting disturbance rejection demands large increases in stance leg force following a terrain drop. Guinea fowl negotiate a downward step using unsteady dynamics with forward acceleration, and recover to steady gait in subsequent steps. Our results suggest that guinea fowl use swing-leg trajectory consistent with priority for load regulation, and not for steadiness of gait. Swing-leg trajectory optimized for load regulation may facilitate economy and injury avoidance in uneven terrain...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} the trace {{chemistry}} group were to identify the processes relevant to aerosol and aerosol precursor formation occurring within aircraft gas turbine engines; that is, within the combustor, turbine, and nozzle. The topics of discussion focused on whether the chemistry of aerosol formation is homogeneous or heterogeneous; what species are important for aerosol and aerosol precursor formation; what modeling/theoretical activities to pursue; what experiments to carry out that both support modeling activities and elucidate fundamental processes; {{and the role of}} particulates in aerosol and aerosol precursor formation. The consensus of the group was that attention should be focused on SO 2, SO 3, and aerosols. Of immediate concern is the measurement of the concentration of the species SO 3, SO 2, H 2 SO 4 OH, HO 2, H 2 O 2, O, NO, NO 2, HONO, HNO 3, CO, and CO 2 and particulates in various engines, both those currently in use and those in development. The recommendation was that concentration measurements should be made at both the combustor exit and the engine exit. At each location the above species were classified into one of four categories of decreasing importance, Priority I through IV, as follows: Combustor exit: Priority I species - SO 3 :SO 2 ratio, SO 3, SO 2, and particulates; Priority II species: OH and O; <b>Priority</b> <b>III</b> species - NO and NO 2; and Priority IV species - CO and CO 2. For the Engine exit: Priority I species - SO 3 :SO 2 ratio, SO 3, SO 2,H 2 SO 4, and particulates; Priority II species: OH,HO 2, H 2 O 2, and O; <b>Priority</b> <b>III</b> species - NO, NO 2, HONO, and HNO 3; and Priority IV species - CO and CO 2. Table I summarizes the anticipated concentration range of each of these species. For particulate matter, the quantities of interest are the number density, size distribution, and composition. In order to provide data for validating multidimensional reacting flow models, it would be desirable to make 2 -D, time-resolved measurements of the concentrations of the above species and, in addition, of the pressure, temperature, and velocity. A near term goal of the experimental program should be to confirm the nonlinear effects of sulfur speciation, and if present, to provide an explanation for them. It is also desirable to examine if the particulate matter retains any sulfur. The recommendation is to examine the effects on SOx production of variations in fuel-bound sulfur and aromatic content (which may affect the amount of particulates formed). These experiments should help us to understand if there is a coupling between particulate formation and SO, concentration. Similarly, any coupling with NOx can be examined either by introducing NOx into the combustion air or by using fuel-bound nitrogen. Also of immediate urgency is the need to establish and validate a detailed mechanism for sulfur oxidation/aerosol formation, whose chemistry is concluded to be homogeneous, because there is not enough surface area for heterogeneous effects. It is envisaged that this work will involve both experimental and theoretical programs. The experimental work will require, in addition to the measurements described above, fundamental studies in devices such as flow reactors and shock tubes. Complementing this effort should be modeling and theoretical activities. One impediment to the successful modeling of sulfur oxidation is the lack of reliable data for thermodynamic and transport properties for several species, such as aqueous nitric acid, sulfur oxides, and sulfuric acid. Quantum mechanical calculations are recommended as a convenient means of deriving values for these properties. Such calculations would also help establish rate constants for several important reactions for which experimental measurements are inherently fraught with uncertainty. Efforts to implement sufficiently detailed chemistry into computational fluid dynamic codes should be continued. Zero- and one-dimensional flow models are also useful vehicles for elucidating the minimal set of species and reactions that must be included in two- and three-dimensional modeling studies...|$|R
