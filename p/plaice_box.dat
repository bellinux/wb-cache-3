40|$|The North Sea {{flatfish}} fisheries generate considerable {{numbers of}} discards, especially of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Their survival is very low. To reduce discard mortality, a partially closed area was established (“plaice box”) in 1989. The beam trawl fishery {{in this area}} was prohibited for vessels larger than 300 hp. Because the <b>Plaice</b> <b>Box</b> encompassed the major nursery grounds of North Sea plaice, it was expected that, {{at the same rate}} of exploitation, the introduction of the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> would enhance recruitment, yield and spaw-ning stock biomass. During an evaluation of the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> in 1999, it became clear that since 1989, the yield and spawning stock biomass had declined by about 40 %. A possible explanation for this decline is {{that there has been a}} shift in the spatial distribution of North Sea plaice. It is possible that the young undersized plaice inhabit places further away from the coast so that the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> is not offering as much protection against discarding as originally supposed. The results showed that the spatial distribution of plaice has indeed changed in time...|$|E
40|$|Fishery {{closures}} {{and marine}} protected areas {{are increasingly being}} used as tools to achieve sustainable fisheries. The ¿plaice box¿, a gear restriction area in the North Sea that was established to reduce the bycatch of undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), is considered ineffective {{because there has been}} a shift in the distribution of juvenile plaice to the waters that remained open to bottom trawlers. Here we examine the hypothesis that bottom trawling benefits the small benthic invertebrates that form the food source for plaice and that the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> had a negative impact on food production for plaice. A size-based model of benthic communities indicates that the production of prey was low without trawling and maximal in areas that are trawled once to twice a year. Therefore, bottom disturbance may improve the feeding conditions for species that feed on small invertebrates. As plaice aggregate at the locations with the highest benthic biomass, this may explain the observed redistribution to areas outside the <b>plaice</b> <b>box.</b> We conclude that the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> {{may not have been the}} most appropriate measure to protect plaice from discarding and that the species¿ ecology should be considered when choosing the most appropriate management measure to achieve an objective...|$|E
40|$|Two {{surveys in}} the German Bight {{revealed}} a relatively good recruitment for plaice and cod. However, {{with the current}} high effort and uneconomic way of fishing, most of these fish will end as discards. To protect young plaice {{during the winter months}} an increase of the mesh opening in beam trawls within the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> is suggested. Therefore, the fishermen are called upon to make a more considerated selection of their nets...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{environment}} is a fragile system {{at risk from}} human activities. One particularly destructive human activity is fishing. Fishing {{is one of the}} biggest causes of declining biodiversity in our seas and oceans. The EU and UK have only recently begun to establish effective marine conservation polices. In the EU the Birds and Habitats Directives provide the backbone of marine conservation. The Natura 2000 network, a system of protected areas established through these directives, is starting to spread out with greater effect into the {{marine environment}}. Marine conservation in the UK is regulated by a mixture of international, European and National laws. As a member of the EU the UK is required to take part in the Natura 2000 network. As a signatory of international treaties such as Ramsar and Ospar the UK is obliged to follow the recommendations set out in these conventions. These European and international laws are established alongside existing domestic conservation polices such as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In the marine environment the establishment of Marine Protected Areas is playing a greater role in protecting the marine environment. Declining fish stocks are one of the biggest biodiversity worries in Europe today. Fishing is traditionally regulated in the EU by the Common Fisheries Policy is putting stocks under enomnous stress. One potential new tool for fisheries managers us to create MPAs to act as a refuge for declining stocks. Critics argue MPAs are only effective in small self enclosed ecosystems such as reefs but supports point to the Georges Bank closure in Maine and to the establishment of <b>plaice</b> and mackerel <b>boxes</b> in Eurqpe as examples of MPAs protecting highly mobile stocks.

40|$|The "plaice box" is a {{partially}} closed {{area in the}} North Sea, established in 1989 to reduce the discarding of undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the main nursery areas, and thereby to enhance recruitment to the fishery. In contrast to the expected positive effects, yield and spawning stock biomass have decreased. The effects of the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> are evaluated by analyzing the relevant factors and processes (natural and anthropogenic) that affect recruitment. It is shown that the Dutch beam trawl effort has decreased in two phases. During 1989 – 1993, when the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> was closed only during {{the second and third}} quarter, effort was reduced to around 40 ␘f the original level. When the box was also closed in the fourth (1994) and first quarter (1995 onwards), effort decreased to around 6 ÐThe effort reduction would imply a reduction in discard mortality if all other factors had remained constant. However, a reduced growth rate and possibly a higher rate of natural mortality may have counteracted the reduction in fishing effort. The apparent changes in growth and mortality coincided with changes in the North Sea ecosystem that occurred in the early 1990 s but may also be related to a response to the change in beam trawl effor...|$|E
40|$|To {{protect the}} main nursery area of plaice, an area called the `Plaice Box¿ {{was closed to}} trawl {{fisheries}} with large vessels in 1989, {{with the expectation that}} recruitment, yield and spawning stock biomass would increase. However, since then the plaice population has declined and the rate of discarding outside the <b>Plaice</b> <b>Box</b> has increased, suggesting an offshore shift in spatial distribution of juvenile plaice. Using research vessel survey data collected since 1970, the change in distribution of juvenile age groups was analysed in relation to the distance to the coast. Further, a comparison of the distribution of different length classes of plaice between three historic periods was made (1902 ¿ 1909; 1983 ¿ 1987; 1999 ¿ 2003). A shift towards deeper water of larger-sized plaice (20 ¿ 39 cm) is apparent already before the 1980 s and {{may be related to the}} decrease in the number of competitors or predators. An offshore shift in the distribution of young plaice occurred in the 1990 s most likely in response to higher water temperatures that may have exceeded the maximum tolerance range or increased the food requirements above the available food resources. A decrease in competition with larger plaice offshore, possibly in combination with increased inshore predation by cormorants and seals, may also have played a role. The offshore shift in distribution has reduced the effectiveness of the <b>Plaice</b> <b>Box</b> as a technical measure to protect the under-sized plaice from discarding, since an increased proportion of the population of undersized plaice is moving to the more heavily exploited offshore areas...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{community}} metrics {{and diversity}} indices {{have often been}} proposed as indicators to support an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. The response of eight fish community indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort was studied by comparing {{the rate of change}} in (i) areas subject to different levels (high, medium, and low) of fishing effort and (ii) areas inside and outside a closed area (the <b>plaice</b> <b>box)</b> where management measures led to changes in fishing effort over time. Several indicators showed broadly consistent responses to fishing effort (slope of the biomass-size spectra, mean weight, and mean maximum length) while a range of biodiversity indices and biomass did not. The response of the indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort showed that, {{with the exception of the}} slope of the biomass-size spectra, none of the indicators reliably detected the effects of spatial management measures at the scales of time and space that were used for these analyses. While some of the size-based indicators we tested did provide evidence for fishing impacts on communities, the response of the indicators to fishing was not straightforward and may have depended on environmental conditions and historic fishing regimes. Therefore, the indicators would provide limited support for assessing the effects of short-term and small-scale management actions and must be applied with caution until we have an improved theoretical understanding of their response to fishing and the environmen...|$|E
40|$|For {{monitoring}} of the engine power of fishing vessels permitted for fishery in the <b>plaice</b> <b>box</b> with engine power of 300 HP or less at sea three different portable power measurement systems are developed and tested. A system measuring the twist of the propeller shaft by two divisible gearwheels mounted on the shaft worked well at shafts with roller bearing at {{both sides of the}} measured interval of 100 – 300 mm length. Only at a very few fishing vessels this system is applicable and therefore for monitoring purposes not suitable. The application of a commercial available system measuring the stress at the surface of the shaft was simplified for application by non experts. The torque is measured by strain gauges. The calibration of the system, measuring and recording of the power is done by a PC automatically. A small polished facet on the shaft protected against oxidation is needed for easy and quick application. In this case the system can be used by technical personnel of supervision boats for {{monitoring of}} the engine power at sea in a short time. A third power measurement system determinates the torque by measuring the displacement of two supports clamped on the shaft at a distance of 100 mm. The displacement is measured by a micrometer gauge mounted on one of the supports. Readout of the rotating gauge display is possible taking advantage of stroboscopic effect. The system needs no conditioning of the shaft and can be used by non technicians. The development is not finished until now and some additional investigations and tests are required. Additional measures for {{monitoring of the}} power on fishing vessels by self recording power measurement systems and sealed fuel racks with limited injection are reported and discussed...|$|E
40|$|To reduce {{discarding}} of plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the North Sea flatfish fisheries, {{the major}} nursery areas were closed to large trawlers in 1995. The area closed {{was named the}} ‘Plaice Box’ (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90 %,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (Solea solea) and shrimp (Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure {{was due to the}} fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980 s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the <b>Plaice</b> <b>Box</b> alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing. This case study highlights the importance of setting testable objectives and an appropriate evaluation framework including both ecological and socio-economic indicators when implementing closed area...|$|E
40|$|The {{spawning}} stock of North Sea cod is at a historic low level and immediate management measures {{are needed to}} improve this situation. As a first step, the European Commission in 2001 closed a large area in the North Sea between February 15 and April 30 to all cod related fishing fleets {{in order to protect}} the spawning population. The closed area comprised important fishing grounds of the beam trawl fleet fishing for flatfish. In this paper the response of the Dutch fleet (components 225 - 300 hp and > 300 hp) is analysed using data from EU-logbooks and from position recordings from the Vessel Monitoring System. No change was observed in the fleet of small beam trawlers. The fleet of large vessels displaced its activity to fishing grounds in the North Sea outside the closed areas, and to fishing grounds outside the North Sea. In the North Sea, beam trawling concentrated along the borders of closed areas and the <b>Plaice</b> <b>Box.</b> In the first week after the closure the number of trips in the open area doubled. Coinciding with this increase, the catch rate, expressed as revenue per hp-day, decreased. After the area was re-opened, the catch rate was exceptionally high but decreased to the normal level in the 2 nd - 3 rd week. The change in catch rate in relation to the change in fishing effort indicated that competitive interactions (in particular interference interactions) occurred among vessels. The implication of the observed fleet response is discussed against the background of the objective of the management measure to protect cod and the broader objective of the Common Fisheries Policy of ecosystem management. It is concluded that it is unlikely that cod has benefited from the area closure. Furthermore, the closure may have had a negative impact on the rate of discarding of demersal species and a negative impact on vulnerable components of the ecosystem (e. g. skates, long lived benthic species) due to an increase in trawling activities in certain area...|$|E
40|$|The North Sea {{is one of}} {{the worlds}} most intensively fished areas and {{commercial}} trawling has over years had a considerable influence on the bottom itself and the macrozoobenthic community as previous studies have shown. As a new approach, we now have the opportunity to study the development or restoration of macrozoobenthic communities after the local cessation of fishery, as up to now there have not been soft bottom areas permanently closed for fishing in the German EEZ (exclusive economic zone). In July 2003 the research platform FINO 1 was installed for preliminary studies for offshore windfarms. The surrounding of the platform, within a radius of 500 m, is closed to all shipping activities and consequently for bottom trawling. The construction of the platform provides a unique opportunity to study the faunal development after the cessation of fishing activity. The development of the fauna in the non-fished area will be compared with that in the normally fished area nearby. To avoid the influence of the platform itself, a minimum distance of 150 m was kept for all sampling methods. Direct effects of the structure should be restricted to a maximum distance of 50 100 m and are studied in the project BeoFINO (poster from T. Joschko). The study area is located in the southern German Bight at the 30 m depth line north of the island of Borkum. The area is exposed to a high level of fishing activity, as it lays just outside the <b>plaice</b> <b>box.</b> In- and epifauna are studied by grab samples, beamtrawl, underwater photography and video. First estimations about the spatial distribution and intensity of fishing activities have been carried out by side-scan surveys, supplemented by satellite data on local trawling intensity. Preliminary results of epifauna and infauna show the situation as a status quo before the platform was built. The further development of the benthic community, its structure and diversity will be observed and investigated. The presented study is part of the EU-Programme RESPONSE (Response of benthic communities and sediment to different regimens of fishing disturbance in European coastal waters). Within the project RESPONSE parallel studies with similar approaches are carried out in the North Sea, Irish Sea, Adriatic Sea and the Catalan Sea. The project aims at providing new perspectives and management options to assure sustainable fishery and protection of biodiversity of marine soft bottom communities in order to move towards an ecosystem-based management in fisheries...|$|E
