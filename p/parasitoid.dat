5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, {{those that}} do feed {{typically}} only take nectar from flowers. <b>Parasitoid</b> wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon {{the outside of the}} host. The host remains alive until the <b>parasitoid</b> larvae pupate or emerge as adults.|$|E
5|$|The USDA is also {{assessing}} {{the application of}} Beauveria bassiana, an insect fungal pathogen, for controlling emerald ash borer in conjunction with <b>parasitoid</b> wasps.|$|E
5|$|There are {{estimated}} to be 100,000 species of ichneumonoid wasps in the families Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. These are almost exclusively parasitoids, mostly utilising other insects as hosts. Another family, the Pompilidae, is a specialist <b>parasitoid</b> of spiders. Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside lepidopteran larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their haemolymph, but if a <b>parasitoid</b> emerges from the host, the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the <b>parasitoid.</b> Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism. In Peru, 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash.|$|E

These <b>parasitoids</b> are affected by some pesticides used for the control of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and P. ficus in vineyards. To establish which of the vineyard pesticides is more toxic to <b>parasitoids,</b> pesticide bioassays were carried in the laboratory using adult and pupal <b>parasitoids.</b> Fipronil and α-cypermethrin caused significant acute toxicity of both <b>parasitoids.</b> Low mortality was recorded for all these pesticides for <b>parasitoids</b> emerging from mummies indicating that the mummy case was an effective barrier to pesticides for <b>parasitoids.</b> Buprofezin, mancozeb and an insecticidal soap were not toxic to <b>parasitoids</b> in both bioassays.

5|$|One {{family of}} chalcid wasps, the Eucharitidae, has {{specialized}} as <b>parasitoids</b> of ants, most species hosted by one genus of ant. Eucharitids {{are among the}} few <b>parasitoids</b> that {{have been able to}} overcome ants' effective defences against <b>parasitoids.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>parasitoid</b> {{chalcid wasp}} Ixodiphagus hookeri has been {{investigated}} for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' <b>parasitoid</b> larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the <b>parasitoid</b> wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several <b>parasitoid</b> wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg <b>parasitoid,</b> and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer.

However, while these <b>parasitoids</b> improve the situation, they are not successful in eliminating the economic damage. Additionally, evidence suggests that the beetle is capable of developing resistance against the common pesticide endosulfan. Therefore, use of Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi to induce disease in borer populations has been considered.|$|R
30|$|Either one (solo) or two (paired) <b>parasitoids</b> {{were placed}} into a Petri dish (90 -mm diameter), and paired <b>parasitoids</b> were {{released}} simultaneously. There was no {{exit from the}} Petri dish, so the <b>parasitoids</b> remained in the dish for the entire observation. Enoggera nassaui is approximately 3 -mm long and a P. charybdis egg is approximately 4  mm[*]×[*] 1  mm, so there was sufficient space in the dish for the <b>parasitoids</b> to avoid contact with the egg batch if they chose to, even though <b>parasitoids</b> could not exit from the dish. This design was used to encourage direct competition between <b>parasitoids</b> and maximise the opportunity to observe aggressive interactions. Undiluted honey was given {{on a piece of}} paper towel (approximately 10 [*]×[*] 10  mm) and was available throughout the observation. Before the hosts were presented, the wasps were allowed to feed ad libitum for at least 15  min to ensure that the <b>parasitoids</b> were not limited by food availability (Mansfield et al. 2011).|$|R
5|$|The host {{association}} between Myrmecia and eucharitid wasps began several million years ago; M. forficata larvae are the host to Austeucharis myrmeciae, {{being the first}} recorded eucharitid <b>parasitoid</b> of an ant, and Austeucharis fasciiventris is a <b>parasitoid</b> to M. gulosa pupae. M. pilosula is affected by a gregarines parasite that changes an ants colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown workers were dissected and found to have gregarinasina spores, while black workers showed no spores. Another unidentified gregarine parasite is known to infect the larvae of M. pilosula and other Myrmecia species. This gregarine parasite also softens the ant's cuticle. Other parasites include Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Chalcura affinis, Tricoryna wasps, and various mermithid nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a <b>parasitoid</b> of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in {{glasshouse}} vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably <b>parasitoid</b> and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat patterns and displays.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parasitoids</b> are an {{important}} mortality factor for insects. Susceptibility to <b>parasitoids</b> should thus be under strong negative selection. Nevertheless, ample genetic variation for susceptibility to <b>parasitoids</b> is commonly observed in natural populations, suggesting that trade-offs may constrain the evolution of reduced susceptibility. This can be studied by assessing genetic variation for susceptibility and its covariation with other components of fitness. In a set of 17 clones of the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, for which good estimates of heritable variation for life-history traits were available, we found significant clonal variation for susceptibility to two of their common parasitoids: Aphidius colemani and Diaeretiella rapae. One clone, the only one harbouring a facultative endosymbiotic bacterium, Regiella insecticola, was entirely resistant to both <b>parasitoids.</b> Susceptibilities to the two <b>parasitoids</b> exhibited a positive genetic correlation close to unity, implying a general mechanism of defence. However, the susceptibility to <b>parasitoids</b> was uncorrelated to the clones' fecundity or rate of increase, providing no evidence for costs {{of the ability to}} resist <b>parasitoids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), is {{native to}} South America and {{invasive}} in many, parts of the world, including North America. Various morphological forms of L. humile exist in South America, {{and it is possible}} that some forms may, comprise distinct species. In Brazil, L. humile is reported to be attacked by, <b>parasitoids</b> in the genus Pseudacteon (Diptera: Phoridae). if Pseudacteon <b>parasitoids</b> attack, the invasive form of L, humile, they may be candidates for biological control of this ant. We compared body, size, scape length, in id pro notal pilosity among populations of L. humile that were attacked by <b>parasitoids</b> and those that lacked <b>parasitoids.</b> Ants that hosted <b>parasitoids</b> at foraging trails in Brazil tended to have more pronotal hairs and shorter scapes than ants that did not host <b>parasitoids</b> in Brazil, Argentina, and North America. We used paired experimental trials to determine whether phorid <b>parasitoids</b> exhibit narrow host specificity or whether they, will attack the invasive form of L humile if given the opportunity, <b>Parasitoids</b> located their natural host form but did not locate either North American L. humile or morphologically, similar ants from Brazil. Together these results suggest that various forms previously treated its L. humile, are in fact separate species, that L. humile is not a natural host of the <b>parasitoids</b> studied here, and that these <b>parasitoids</b> are not candidates for biological control of Argentine ants in North America...|$|R
30|$|In guava orchard intercropped with cowpea, {{the highest}} number of <b>parasitoids</b> and predators was {{recorded}} compared to that in the sole cropped.

5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} <b>parasitoid</b> wasps. These insects are known as {{entomophagous}} parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal.|$|E
5|$|Though P. rebeli parasitizes the Myrmica schencki ants and Gentiana cruciata food plant, it also {{acts as a}} host to the <b>parasitoid</b> ichneumon wasp (Ichneumon eumerus). The I. eumerus is a wasp that {{attempts}} to parasitize the P. rebeli {{after it has been}} introduced to the Myrmica ants' nests.

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and <b>parasitoid</b> wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E
25|$|Insects such as dipterans {{are known}} <b>parasitoids</b> of mollusks. To {{complete}} their development, many dipterans use slugs as hosts during their ontogeny. Some species of blow-flies (Calliphoridae) in the genus Melinda are known <b>parasitoids</b> of Arionidae, Limacidae and Philomycidae. Flies {{in the family}} Phoridae, specially those in the genus Megaselia, are <b>parasitoids</b> of Agriolimacidae, including many species of Deroceras. House flies in the family Muscidae, mainly those in the genus Sarcophaga, are facultative <b>parasitoids</b> of Arionidae.|$|R
30|$|Intercrops {{and border}} crops during {{flowering}} provide ample nectar, pollen, and {{shelter for the}} resident <b>parasitoids</b> and predators. They also protect them by providing shelter to the native <b>parasitoids</b> and predators during insecticidal sprays in the main crop. This provides an added advantage of favorable microclimate for the population build up of <b>parasitoids</b> and predators. Alignier et al. (2014) reported that hedgerows of non-crop plants supported diverse population of <b>parasitoids</b> and predators with higher rates of parasitism of aphids in wheat. Timing of sowing the inter-crops or border crops is a crucial factor in sustaining the synchrony between the <b>parasitoids</b> and predators and insect pests in agro-ecosystems.|$|R

5|$|Without {{factors that}} would {{normally}} suppress emerald ash borer populations in its native range (e.g., resistant trees, predators, and <b>parasitoid</b> wasps), populations can quickly rise to damaging levels. After initial infestation, all ash trees are expected to die in an area within 10 years without control measures. Every North American ash species has susceptibility to emerald ash borer, as North American species planted in China also have high mortality due to infestations, but some Chinese ash species are resistant.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of <b>parasitoid</b> Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of <b>parasitoid</b> wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash borer populations.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans live {{in social}} nests that are open combed. This leaves nests very {{susceptible}} to attacks by predators and by <b>parasitoids.</b> Attack by <b>parasitoids</b> {{will occur in}} the nest brood, as the invader will attempt to insert its own offspring into the host’s nest. The two most common <b>parasitoids</b> are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} how hymenopteran <b>parasitoids</b> deal with complex odour bouquets, using Microplitis croceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) as a model. We examined the capacity of Microplitis croceipes to respond to individual compounds in flight chamber experiments after conditioning <b>parasitoids</b> with a mixture consisting of 2 -octanone, methyl jasmonate and ß-caryophyllene. <b>Parasitoids</b> were given a choice between single compounds from the training mixture and ß-ocimene as an unrewarded alternative. When compared with control individuals lacking experience with the odour mixture, <b>parasitoids</b> trained to the odour blend showed an increased preference for 2 -octanone and ß-caryophyllene, but not for methyl jasmonate. However, when trained with methyl jasmonate alone, <b>parasitoids</b> were {{able to respond to}} this compound. This demonstrates that <b>parasitoids</b> can learn to respond to individual compounds following experience with an odour mixture. However, for certain compounds of a mixture, learning can be blocked by other mixture components. Further experiments in which <b>parasitoids</b> were conditioned and challenged with two compound mixes confirmed that the olfactory background can affect recognition of individual compounds [KEYWORDS: background odour • complex blends • insect learning • mixture recognition • plant volatiles...|$|R

5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, <b>parasitoid</b> wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a <b>parasitoid</b> {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the <b>parasitoid</b> larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
