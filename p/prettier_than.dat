In a performance in Chicago's Park West venue during the American tour, Andy Downing of the Chicago Tribune called the song [...] "a high point" [...] of the show, and said the slower version was <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> the original record {{but that it was}} [...] "the spartan arrangement" [...] that saved it from [...] "montage hell.|$|E
500|$|There was an auditioning {{process for}} both the chair model and the young blond woman that Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was {{supposed}} to be [...] "pretty" [...] and [...] "perhaps even <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> your average model", but more of just an [...] "average single girl", because the episode is more about Michael wanting to start dating again than the model herself. [...] In the scene with the [...] "Five Families", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been {{on a tour of the}} set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of [...] "Cool Guy Paul" [...] was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics and fans, and in 2010 {{it became the}} most-viewed video in YouTube history, up to that point. Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "amazing" [...] and added, [...] "I don't think Gaga has ever looked <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> in the close-ups where she's more stripped down." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! was also impressed by the video and commented, [...] "This music video really makes us appreciate everything Gaga actually brings to pop music. She's exciting to watch, plain and simple. ... We need someone like Gaga to really bring it. To put actual thought and care into her product so that it feels alive". Issie Lapowsky of New York Daily News thought Gaga laid the [...] "theatrics on thick" [...] in the video but complimented her for wearing minimal makeup, calling it [...] "refreshingly normal". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that the video brought back his faith in performance art, and that [...] "Gaga brings enough [...] on her own, thank you very much." [...] He also thought the set for the video [...] "worthy of a feature-length film". Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone felt that the scenes from the music video were reminiscent {{of the work of}} Stanley Kubrick. He added that in [...] "Bad Romance" [...] Gaga portrays her craziest ideas yet.|$|E
500|$|Hutcherson's {{breakthrough}} role in {{his career}} as a child actor came in 2007 when he portrayed Jesse Aarons in the fantasy drama Bridge to Terabithia. The film was shot on location in New Zealand {{for three and a half}} months. Hutcherson said of the filming: [...] "That was an amazing experience. It doesn't get any <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> that. There were beaches everywhere and all sorts of forests. We took little road trips everywhere and just had a lot of fun." [...] He admitted to not having read the novel that the film is based upon before being cast. Author Ann C. Paietta describes his character of Jesse Aarons as [...] "an introverted boy with four sisters, a financially strapped family, and a real talent for drawing" [...] whose life is turned around when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) arrives, with whom he creates an imaginary utopian world. Anne Hornaday of The Washington Post found his casting to be [...] "a perfect fit" [...] and commended how he portrayed the [...] "sensitive, artistic, temperament" [...] of his character, while Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times noted the chemistry between Hutcherson and Robb, referring to them as a [...] "dynamic duo". He won his second Young Artist Award for [...] "Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor" [...] for the film. Hutcherson's next role was in Firehouse Dog (2007), in which he played Shane Fahey, a firefighter's son who befriends a dog. He has expressed his pleasure in working and bonding with the four different dogs who played his canine co-star. The film received mixed reviews, although critics were favorable to Hutcherson. Following the film, Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer referred to him as the [...] "Jodie Foster of Generation Y", remarking that with [...] "each successive film Hutcherson dives deeper into his reservoir of shame and hurt and hope, unnerving for one so young, but also unusually urgent for an actor of any age." ...|$|E

2500|$|Searle calls {{any value}} {{judgment}} epistemically subjective. Thus, [...] "McKinley is <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically subjective", whereas [...] "McKinley {{is higher than}} Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically objective." [...] In other words, the latter statement is evaluable (in fact, falsifiable) by an understood ('background') criterion for mountain height, like 'the summit is so many meters above sea level'. No such criteria exist for prettiness.|$|E

She also claimed to be sixty years old in her columns but was actually 20 years younger. [...] She wrote in a light-hearted way about [...] herself as a [...] "garrulous" [...] old lady and how she managed to [...] "preserve summer in my heart all through my sixty years," [...] by [...] being [...] "not in the least dignified," [...] telling of living a healthy life and skipping rope and playing hide and go seek with the neighbor children. [...] She used wit and an ability to tell important stories by anchoring them in the minutia of [...] daily life.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 1717, the San Miguel {{earthquake}} {{struck the}} city and destroyed the San Lucas School building; the tremor cracked the tower and destroyed the top part of the main gate. The master builder of Santiago de Guatemala, Diego de Porres, inspected the damage and calculated {{that it was necessary}} to invest between five and six thousand pesos to repair it. Three years later, however, the Jesuits had rebuilt the structure, and when the master builder returned to inspect the building, declared it better and <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> the original. [...] However, on March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the church roof forcing the Jesuits to once again ask for help to the parishioners to rebuild; once again, the building was among the most beautiful of the city when the repairs were completed.|$|E

The launch was accompanied by acoustic performances by Cambio (whose members include Raimund Marasigan, Buddy Zabala and Kris Gorra-Dancel), Markus Highway (Marcus Adoro's band), and Lei Bautista of <b>Prettier</b> <b>Than</b> Pink. The performers covered Eraserheads songs such as [...] "Ligaya" [...] (performed by Lei Bautista), [...] "With a Smile" [...] (also performed by Bautista) and [...] "Magasin" [...] (performed by Cambio with Marcus Adoro). The event was dubbed a mini-reunion of Eraserheads, with Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro performing {{together for the first time}} in four years.

2500|$|Critic Chris Woodstra of AllMusic {{retrospectively}} {{described the}} song as an [...] "unforgettable hit". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times {{called it the}} highlight of Get the Knack and suggested had similar flavor to early songs by Sweet. Critic Greil Marcus described the song as a [...] "smutty little Beatles imitation". Author John Borack described the song as [...] "a mean pop tune", noting too that in the song lead singer and songwriter Fieger comes off [...] "like a leering, sexist twit with hormones a-raging." [...] Billboard referred to the song's [...] "hearty harmonica" [...] part and Beatle-esque harmonies, noting that [...] "the music is delivered in tight little notes at top speed." [...] Audio described the song as [...] "irresistible". Wayne Wadhams, David Nathan and Susan Gedutis Lindsay described the song as a [...] "well written pop tune" [...] and note that the music is <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> [...] "My Sharona" [...] and contains harmonies {{similar to those in}} songs by The Searchers and The Hollies. [...] However, they also go on to note that the lyric [...] "portrays a character more doggedly bent on sex than naturally aroused" [...] and represents a [...] "leering, postpubescent sales pitch by a dirty young man." [...] J. J. Syrja of The Seguin Gazette said that with this song the Knack [...] " [...] pure teenage delirium." [...] Other critics regarded the song as [...] "derivative" [...] and [...] "sexist".|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff always {{considered}} aesthetic and moral {{aspects of the}} game; {{it is not just}} about winning, but about winning with [...] "right" [...] style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, [...] "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,". For Cruyff and the Cruyffistas (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a [...] "right" [...] style of play to win is even more important than winning itself. Cruyff always believed in simplicity. He sees simplicity and beauty as inseparable. [...] "Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing," [...] as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy. [...] "How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things <b>prettier</b> <b>than</b> strictly necessary." [...] Cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the [...] "Cruyff Turn". The feint {{is an example of the}} simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away. As Sweden defender Jan Olsson (a [...] "victim" [...] of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, [...] "I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius." [...] With its high effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.|$|E
