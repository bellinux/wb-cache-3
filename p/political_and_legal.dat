5|$|The war of 1918 led to {{disintegration}} within both socialist and the non-socialist factions. The power political {{shift toward}} the right caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals {{on the best}} system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism, the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. Both sides justified their views via <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> grounds.|$|E
5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was marked by}} <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> reforms, a {{philosophical}} revival of Confucianism, {{and the development of}} cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community of educated scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E

5|$|The band {{recorded}} …And Justice for All {{during early}} 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Musically, {{the album is}} progressive, with long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is noted for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship.|$|E
5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will versus determinism.

The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has said is motivated by his parents' divorce when he was a child.|$|E

5|$|The War of the Second Coalition (1799–1802) {{resulted}} in {{the defeat of the}} imperial and allied forces by Napoleon Bonaparte. The treaties of Lunéville (1801) and Amiens (1802) and the Mediatization of 1803 transferred large portions of the Holy Roman Empire to the dynastic states and secularized ecclesiastical territories. Most of the imperial cities disappeared from the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> landscape, and the populations living in these territories acquired new allegiances to dukes and kings. This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of Württemberg and Baden. In 1806, after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia and Russia at the joint battles of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon dictated the Treaty of Pressburg, in which the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The court {{eventually}} {{declared that}} they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien. Three days later, Hastings took the case to the Court of Appeal, who declared that the internment orders were invalid since the Restoration of Order Act was no longer applicable. The Government was forced to introduce a Bill to Parliament giving itself retrospective immunity for having exceeded its authority, and the whole incident was a <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> triumph for the party and for Hastings personally.|$|E

5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E

25|$|Political {{scientist}} Barbara Walter {{suggests that}} most contemporary civil wars are actually repeats of earlier civil wars that often arise when leaders are not {{accountable to the}} public, when there is poor public participation in politics, and {{when there is a}} lack of transparency of information between the executives and the public. Walter argues that when these issues are properly reversed, they act as <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> restraints on executive power forcing the established government to better serve the people. Additionally, these <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> restraints create a standardized avenue to influence government as well as increasing the commitment credibility of established peace treaties. According to Walter, it is the strength of a nation’s institutionalization and good governance—not the presence of democracy nor the poverty level—that is the number one indicator of the chance of a repeat civil war according to Walter.|$|E
