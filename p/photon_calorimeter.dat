40|$|Proton {{radiography}} {{has become}} an important tool for predicting the performance of stockpiled nuclear weapons. Current proton radiography experiments at LANSCE are confined to relatively small targets {{on the order of}} centimeters in size because of the low beam energy. LANL scientists have made radiographs with 12 and 24 GeV protons produced by the accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These energies are in the range required for hydrotest radiography. The design of a facility for hydrotest radiography requires knowledge of the cross sections for producing high-energy particles in the forward direction, which are incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation used in designing the beam and detectors. There are few existing measurements of neutron production cross sections for proton-nuclei interactions in the 50 GeV range, and almost no data exist for forward neutron production, especially for heavy target nuclei. Thus the data from the MIPP EMCAL and HCAL, for which our group was responsible, are critical to proton radiography. Since neutrons and photons cannot be focused by magnets, they cause a background “fog” on the images. This problem can be minimized by careful design of the focusing system and detectors. The purpose of our research was to measure forward production of neutrons produced by high-energy proton beams striking a variety of targets. The forward-going particles carry most of the energy from a high-energy proton interaction, so these are the most important to proton radiography. This work was carried out in conjunction with the Fermilab E- 907 (MIPP) collaboration. Our group was responsible for designing and building the E 907 forward neutron and <b>photon</b> <b>calorimeters.</b> With the support of our Stewardship Science Academic Alliances grants, we were able to design, build, and commission the calorimeters on budget and ahead of schedule.

An experiment has been carried out to measure the cross sections for Real Compton Scattering (RCS) on the proton for 2. 3 - 5. 7 GeV electron beam energies and a wide distribution of large scattering angles. The 25 kinematic settings sampled a domain of s = 5 − 11 (GeV/c) 2,−t = − 7 (GeV/c) 2 and −u = 0. 5 − 6. 5 (GeV/c) 2. In addition, a measurement of longitudinal and transverse polarization transfer asymmetries was made at a 3. 48 GeV beam energy and a scattering angle of θcm = 120 o. These measurements were performed to test the existing theoretical mechanisms for this process as well as to determine RCS form factors. At the heart of the scientific motivation is the desire to understand the manner in which a nucleon interacts with external excitations at the above listed energies, by comparing and contrasting the two existing models – Leading Twist Mechanism and Soft Overlap “Handbag” Mechanism – and identify the dominant mechanism. Furthermore, the Handbag Mechanism allows one to calculate reaction observables in the framework of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD), which have the function of bridging the wide gap between the exclusive(form factors) and inclusive(parton distribution functions) description of the proton.

40|$|Abstract. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be {{the next}} high-energy gamma-ray observatory. Selection of the sites, one in each hemisphere, is not obvious since several factors have to be taken into account. Among them, and {{probably}} the most crucial, are the atmospheric conditions. Indeed, CTA will use the atmosphere as a giant calorimeter, i. e. as part of the detector. The Southern Hemisphere presents mainly four candidate sites: one in Namibia, one in Chile and two in Argentina. Using atmospheric tools already validated in other air shower experiments, the purpose of this work is to complete studies aiming to choose the site with the best quality for the atmosphere. Three strong requirements are checked: the cloud cover and the frequency of clear skies, the wind speed and the backward trajectories of air masses travelling above the sites and directly linked to the aerosol concentrations. It was found, that the Namibian site is favoured, and one site in Argentina is clearly not suited. Atmospheric measurements at these sites will be performed in the coming months and will help with the selection of a CTA site.

40|$|Current {{and future}} high energy physics {{particle}} colliders are capable to provide instantaneous luminosities of 1034 cm^(- 2) s^(- 1) and above. The high {{center of mass}} energy, {{the large number of}} simultaneous collision of beam particles in the experiments and the very high repetition rates of the collision events pose huge challenges. They result in extremely high particle fluxes, causing very high occupancies in the particle physics detectors operating at these machines. To reconstruct the physics events, the detectors have to make as much information as possible available on the final state particles. We discuss how timing information with a precision of around 10 ps and below can aid the reconstruction of the physics events under such challenging conditions. High energy photons {{play a crucial role in}} this context. About one third of the particle flux originating from high energy hadron collisions is detected as photons, stemming from the decays of neutral mesons. In addition, many key physics signatures under study are identified by high energy photons in the final state. They pose a particular challenge in that they can only be detected once they convert in the detector material. The particular challenge in measuring the time of arrival of a high energy photon lies in the stochastic component of the distance to the initial conversion and the size of the electromagnetic shower. They extend spatially over distances which propagation times of the initial photon and the subsequent electromagnetic shower which are large compared to the desired precision. We present studies and measurements from test beams and a cosmic muon test stand for calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision achievable for high energy photons of 10 GeV and above. We put particular focus on techniques to measure the timing with a precision of about 10 ps in association with the energy of the <b>photon.</b> For <b>calorimeters</b> utilizing scintillating materials and light guiding components, the propagation speed of the scintillation light in the calorimeter is important.

The electronic detection circuit of the calorimeter is based on a method that involves a high-precision digital multimeter (DMM), rather than on a more traditional technique that employs Wheatstone bridges. To test its performance the NMi water calorimeter was compared directly with the absorbed-dose-to-water standard based on the NMi graphite calorimeter for 60 Co gamma radiation. A preliminary evaluation of this comparison yields a value of 1. 0010 ± 0. 0051 (1 σ) for the ratio of the dose rate determined with the water calorimeter compared to that derived from the graphite calorimeter. Furthermore the NMi water calorimeter was tested in high-energy photon beams, measurements of absorbed-dose-to-water rates were performed at the BNM-LNHB with a Saturne 43 accelerator for 6, 12, and 20 MV photon beams. By calibrating a set of 5 NE 2611 A chambers against the water calorimeter, beam quality correction factors kQ were derived that agreed very well with the literature. Presently, a NCS subcommittee Uniformity Dosimetry Protocols is working on implementing absorbed-dose-based Codes of Practice (CoPs) for external beam radiotherapy in Belgium and The Netherlands. These CoPs will be consistent with international recommendations and replace the current CoPs based on air kerma calibration factors. In agreement with the recommendation given in IAEA TRS- 398, that preferably experimental kQ values should be used, the subcommittee is presently performing kQ measurements in nine representative clinical photon beams with the portable NMi water calorimeter for four different graphite-walled ionization chamber types. First preliminary results of the kQ measurements will be presented...|$|R
40|$|A very thin, solid radiator, totally {{internally}} reflecting, imaging Cherenkov counter (DIRC) is described. This {{device is}} well matched to the hadronic charged particle identification requirements at an asymmetric e+e- B Factory. 1. INTR~IXJ~TI~N Particle identification at a B factory is difficult, and highly {{constrained by the}} machine environment {{and the need for}} good energy measurement of soft <b>photons</b> in the <b>calorimeter</b> which surrounds the particle identification device [l]. Because of the high beam crossing rate and the potential for large backgrounds, the particle identification detector must be robust and relatively fast. Good r~‘dK separation is required over a wide momentum range between about 0. 25 and 4 GeV/c. Most detectors measure dE/dx in the tracking chamber which allows good X/K separation up to about 600 MeV/c, but a specific identification device is required over most of the momentum region [2]. The amount of material in the device should be small (preferably less than 10 % LRAD) and should be distributed {{as close as possible to}} the calorimeter in order to avoid degradation in the resolution performance of the calorimeter, and the loss of low energy conversion electrons in the magnetic field. In addition, the cost of the high quality calorimeter scales roughly like the radius squared and there will be substantial cost savings if the particle identification device can be made thin. Here, we describe a new type of imaging Cherenkov (the DIRC) that appears to be extremely well matched to the requirements for particle identification at the B factory. It is thin (with low radiation length), robust, very fast, and should have excellent performance over the complete phase space of the B factory. Although many configurations of a DIRC type device are possible, for definiteness, a particular straw-man model will be discussed which uses quartz radiator bars, read-out by conventional photomultiplier tubes in a proximity focused geometry. A brief discussion of some possible variations will follow within the space limitations here. More details can be found elsewhere [3]...|$|R
40|$|The Anti Coincidence Detector (ACD) on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope {{provides}} {{charged particle}} rejection for the Large Area Telescope (LAT). We use two calibrations {{used by the}} ACD to conduct three studies {{on the performance of}} the ACD. We examine the trending of the calibrations to search for damage and find a timescale over which the calibrations can be considered reliable. We also calculated the number of photoelectrons counted by a PMT on the ACD from a normal proton. Third, we calculated the veto efficiencies of the ACD for two different veto settings. The trends of the calibrations exhibited no signs of damage, and indicated timescales of reliability for the calibrations of one to two years. The number of photoelectrons calculated ranged from 5 to 25. Large errors in the effect of the energy spectrum of the charged particles caused these values to have very large errors of around 60 percent. Finally, the veto efficiencies were found to be very high at both veto values, both for charged particles and for the lower energy backsplash spectrum. The Anti Coincidence Detector (ACD) on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope is a detector system built around the silicon strip tracker on the Large Area Telescope (LAT). The purpose of the ACD is to provide charged particle rejection for the LAT. To do this, the ACD must be calibrated correctly in flight, and must be able to efficiently veto charged particle events while minimizing false vetoes due to 'backsplash' from <b>photons</b> in the <b>calorimeter.</b> There are eleven calibrations used by the ACD. In this paper, we discuss the use of two of these calibrations to preform three studies on the performance of the ACD. The first study examines trending of the calibrations to check for possible hardware degradation. The second study uses the calibrations to explore the efficiency of an on-board hardware veto. The third study uses the calibrations to calculate the number of photoelectrons seen by each PMT when a minimum ionizing particle is detected, which is a useful value for performing simulations...|$|R
