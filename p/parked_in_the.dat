5|$|By {{the time}} the four student hostages were released, a bomb squad, SWAT team from Jefferson County, and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{were sent to the}} scene. Ambulances <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone of the high school's {{football}} field. A 4-mile (6km) stretch of U.S. Route 285 was closed. At approximately 3:32 p.m., negotiations began to stall. Morrison later explicitly stated that he would stop negotiating at 4:00 p.m.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
50|$|Eugène Hénard also {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} nine additional parks to decongest some areas lacking green spaces: Montmartre park including part of <b>the</b> hill, Saint-Denis <b>park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10th arrondissement, Voltaire <b>park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th arrondissement, Ménilmontant <b>park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th arrondissement, Saint-Antoine <b>park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th arrondissement, Maison-Blanche and Croulebarbe <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th arrondissement, Maine and Grenelle <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th arrondissement.These <b>parks</b> would be smaller than the first group, but would not be less than 1 ha in area.|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, this good fortune came to an end. As bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, the rolling stock <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was badly damaged. Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the LNC's office building and the station platforms survived, the central section of the station was reduced to rubble. On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed.|$|E
5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic modules {{are used}} commercially as {{auxiliary}} power units on passenger cars {{in order to}} ventilate the car, reducing {{the temperature of the}} passenger compartment while it is <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun.

25|$|Development into an {{international}} venue has for outgrown the capacity of local infrastructure to adequately handle the large influxes of patrons attempting to access the venue. In particular, there is little provision for spectator parking. Thus, large numbers of vehicles are <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding streets when such events are held, resulting in access issues for local residents and need for traffic-control measures.|$|E

25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to take anything more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, {{the body}} of Randy Potter, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, was found in his truck in Economy Lot B. It had {{decomposed}} {{to the point where}} its race and gender was not obvious; Potter had gone to the airport one morning in January and killed himself with a gun. His family had {{at the time of his}} apparent disappearance given the license plate number of his truck to airport authorities, who assured him that they recorded the plates of all vehicles <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lots on a daily basis and would check it against that data base regularly. The apparent failure of this system to locate Potter's truck for eight months has led to a investigation by city government.|$|E
25|$|Three weeks later, on April 29, while <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{grounds of}} a Stanton supermarket, Bonin and Butts lured a 19-year-old {{employee}} named Darin Kendrick into Bonin's van on {{the pretext of}} selling the youth drugs. Kendrick was driven to Butts' apartment, where he was overpowered and bound by both men. In addition to enduring sodomy and partial ligature strangulation, Kendrick was forced to drink hydrochloric acid by Bonin, causing caustic chemical burns to his mouth, chin, stomach and chest. Butts then drove an ice pick into Kendrick's ear, causing a fatal wound to the youth's cervical spinal cord. His body was discarded behind a warehouse close to the Artesia Freeway, with the ice pick Butts had driven into his skull still protruding from his ear.|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> introduction {{and expansion of}} commercial irrigated farms, the establishment of different <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pastoral areas exerted pressure on the sustainability of the pastoral economy. The establishment of national <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> important grazing areas, notably <b>the</b> Awash <b>Park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east, Netch Sar <b>Park</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south and Omo and Mago <b>Parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-west, have brought additional constraints to pastoral livelihoods (Pankhurst and Piguet 2009). What is more damaging was that compensation to the pastoralists was not paid (Ayalew 2001). This resulted in confrontations and sometimes outright conflicts between the pastoralists and the Park authorities (Harbeson and Teffera- Worq 1974).|$|R
