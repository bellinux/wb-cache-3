5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with <b>pimento</b> cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, <b>pimento</b> cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E

One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the television show The Wonder Years. Homer's flashbacks to his childhood were based on the plot of the film Stand By Me, which in turn is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. However, the scenes in the quarry were based on the coming of age film Breaking Away, directed by Peter Yates. Burly, the brand of paper towels featured in the episode, is based on the real brand Brawny Paper Towels. The model for Burly paper towels, called Chad Sexington, was based on the Brawny paper towels' logo; however, the logo, within [...] "a year or two of [...] ", was changed into a more [...] "right-of-center" [...] looking brunette, according to Dean Moore.

After some delays, the ceremony went ahead on 25 February, {{under the guidance of}} Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of the coronation, Edward swore to uphold [...] "the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen". It is uncertain what this meant: it might have been intended to force Edward to accept future legislation, it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take, or it may have been an attempt by the King to ingratiate himself with the barons. The event was marred by the large crowds of eager spectators who surged into the palace, knocking down a wall and forcing Edward to flee by the back door.|$|E

50|$|Padrón peppers (pementos de Padrón) are {{a variety}} of peppers (Capsicum annuum) from the {{municipality}} of Padrón in the province of A Coruña, Galicia, northwestern Spain. These are small peppers (about 5 cm long), with a color ranging from bright green to yellowish green, and occasionally red. Their peculiarity lies on the fact that, while their taste is usually mild, a minority (10-25%) are particularly hot. Whether a given pepper ends up being hot or mild depends on the amount of water and sunlight it receives during its growth, in addition to temperature. It's said that solely watering the soil of the plant is likely to produce milder <b>pimentos,</b> whilst watering the whole plant, leaves and stalks included, produces peppers of the spicier variety.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with the}} {{invention}} of the hamburger, the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena, California takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926. A description from a 1928 menu from the O'Dell Restaurant in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time. Luis Ballast, owner of the Humpty Dumpty drive-in restaurant in Denver, Colorado, made an attempt to create a cheeseburger with a registered trademark known as a [...] "yellowburger" [...] in 1935. J.C. Reynolds, the operator of a bar in Southern California from 1932 to 1984, popularized a <b>pimento</b> burger. Processed cheese, the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers, was invented in 1911 by Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, although the first U.S. patent awarded for it was given to James L. Kraft in 1916. Kraft Foods went on to create the first commercial version of sliced processed cheese, which was first introduced to the market in 1950.|$|E

In 1899 Silent moved his family to Vail's old home north of Adams, and extended a private street south to 23rd Street, and subdivided the land into 23 lots {{on either side of the}} road. This subdivision represents the official founding of Chester Place, which could be seen behind the massive stone and steel gates that Vail had built to surround his home.

5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works.

Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (<b>pimentos</b> or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis).

25|$|The British wine merchants {{used this}} {{opportunity}} to leverage their strength {{in order to maximize}} profits. In 1727, they grouped together to form a trade association and built the Factory House, a private gentlemen's club, where they could meet and collude on details pertaining to the wine trade. They bought all the wine from growers on credit, holding off payment till the wine was sold. They built large warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia where they could keep the wine for years aging. Less than scrupulous shippers also committed widespread wine fraud by importing grapes from regions outside the Douro to blend, as well as adding non-grape based wine ingredients like elderberry juice for coloring and dried <b>pimentos</b> to add spicy flavors. These tactics increased the leverage of the British shippers and meant they could set whatever prices they wanted to pay the Portuguese grape growers. To ensure more fair pricing, the growers often had to resort to more unorthodox business dealings such as the prostitution of their daughters to the British shippers.|$|R

O delineamento experimental utilizado, em ambos os estudos, foi o inteiramente casualizado com cinco repetições. O amadurecimento do pimentão amarelo caracterizou-se por acréscimo na taxa respiratória, sendo que a temperatura de 5 ºC resultou em maior redução deste processo, em frutos de pimentão amarelo. The respiratory rate of {{the yellow}} bell pepper 'Zarco HS' was determined under influence of the stadium of maturation at harvest and at storage temperature. The bell peppers were placed inside tightly closed flasks and conditioned in 4 BODs with different temperatures: 5; 10; 15 and 25 ºC, for the products harvested at summer, and 5; 10; 15 and 20 ºC, for harvested at winter. Five flasks were used with approximately 0. 5 kg of product. The system of continuous air flow was used inside of the flasks with aid of a flow board. The readings of CO 2 were made in gaseous chromatograph VARIAN 3400, being accomplished five readings for each temperature {{during a period of}} seven days, in the summer, and 8 days, in the winter.

Pelos resultados, verifica-se que o uso de biofilme de fécula de mandioca nas concentrações utilizadas não foi eficiente em retardar o metabolismo pós-colheita e prolongar a conservação de <b>pimentões</b> 'Magali R' refrigerados ou não; o uso de refrigeração a 10 ± 1 ºC e 90 ± 5 % UR, sem associação com biofilme, foi eficiente em manter os <b>pimentões</b> Magali R com perda de massa inferior aos 15 %, estabelecido como limite para a vida útil, por até 20 dias de armazenamento, enquanto em temperatura ambiente a vida útil foi de apenas por oito dias.
