40|$|This {{research}} is an analysis about the potency {{and development of}} economy central on coastal district of Malang Regency. This analysis used data of potency on any sectors on six (6) districts on the coastal area of Malang Regency. The purposes of this research are; first, to know the description of economical potency of coastal district on Malang Regency. Secondly, to know the most potential location (place) to make it become economy central on coastal district of Malang Regency. Third, to know the extending plan of central economy on coastal district of Malang Regency. This analysis used qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative approach by describing the economical condition and its variables. And the quantitative one was used to get several values in extending gravity allocation in measuring the intercourse power between the commodity central and the central of developmental area and to determine the range from the central of economy, production, and distribution (central of commodity) on net-work system and also transformation. Besides using the analysis of gravity allocation to determine the range of area and institution or any facilities, it is used scalogram method. Based on the analysis of gravity location, the highest power between sectors of commodity and the central of extending area {{and the range of}} district of Gedangan and Sumbermanjing Wetan, with the reaction value is now equal to 255733192, 889. Based on this scalogram analysis, range of the amount of societies, it can be known on the district of Sumber Manjing Wetan, and if we saw from the economy facilities, the district of Bantur could give good service on economy facilities, but if we saw it on the range of social facilities, it was Sumber Manjing Wetan. It could give good social service to others societies. The assumption is Sumbermanjing Wetan has a role as the central of growth on the range of facilities and the amount of societies. The assumption is the district of Sumber Manjing Wetan was able to have a role as central of growth on range of societies quantities and its facilities. The most potential location as central of growth on coastal area of Malang Regency was district of Sumber Manjing Wetan. Explained that district of Sumber Manjing Wetan showed that there was structural economic activities that showed us economical potensial on the district of Sumber Manjing Wetan so that able to give interest on the citizens. The plan of extending the economic area on the coastal area of Malang can be seen from economic growth in the future, so it will be developed on Sendang Biru area as a city area with its industry and <b>public</b> <b>harbour...</b>|$|E

The figure of the robot monster is examined in its historical and cultural specificity—that is, as a direct descendent of monsters that we have grown accustomed to since the nineteenth century: Frankenstein, Mr. Hyde, vampires, zombies, etc. Using the psychoanalytic notion of projection, these monsters are understood as representing human anxieties regarding the dehumanising tendencies of science and reason, and regarding a perceived transformation in human nature {{over the last two}} hundred years. In analysing these anxieties, we can therefore gain insight into the fears—genuine or naïve—that the <b>public</b> <b>harbours</b> towards new advancements in technology; these insights can then inform those working with and designing living machines as to how their inventions might be received...|$|R

40|$|Self-management is trendy: it is a {{recognized}} {{component of the}} treatment of chronic disorders and expectations are high. Even so, there are barriers {{to the introduction of}} self-managements programmes. Despite considerable research, there is still no hard evidence of the efficacy of self-management programmes, in part because of differences in terminology. There are indications that self-management has potential, but not all patients respond to these interventions. Differences between programmes and patient populations make it difficult to establish which programme works for which patient group. Terminological confusion, also among care providers, policy makers, and the <b>public,</b> <b>harbours</b> the risks that ‘self-management’ may become a meaningless concept. This article clarifies terminology and evaluates the strength of evidence for the efficacy of self-management programmes. It is clear that not all patients benefit from the ‘one size fits all’ approach {{and that there is a}} need for tailored care, based on the individual patient. This requires further investigation of determinants of success; which type of intervention, and with what content, form, and intensity, has the great est likelihood of success in specific patient groups. The research consortium Tailored Self-management 2 ̆ 6 Ehealth (TASTE) is trying to unravel these factors and to develop tailored interventions.

40|$|With the {{completion}} of the canal, measuring 171 kilometres in length and stretching across the pan-European watershed, it was possible to create an unbroken inland waterway of 3500 kilometres between the States which border the Rhine and the Danube. This investigation is divided into three segments by a spatial subdivision of the Main-Danube waterway. In addition to the trade ports along the Main-Danube canal, which are the focal point of this investigation, interviews were also carried out in the <b>public</b> inland <b>harbours</b> along the Main and the Danube. In the course of this, data was gathered and evaluated from a total of 20 harbour locations on Bavarian territory. If one summarises the determined single results of the waterway stretches Main, Main-Danube Canal and Danube, it becomes clear that the <b>public</b> inland <b>harbours</b> in Bavaria have reacted to {{the completion}} of the Main-Danube Canal in very different manners. Whereas the harbours located after the Bavarian stretch of the Main have hardly been able to profit from the new means of transport up until the present day, equally some of the harbours along the Northern ramp of the canal have been able to build up a surprisingly low level of goods' transport connections with harbours along the Danube, the possibilities, opened up by the unbroken passageability of the Main-Danube Canal, were exploited in a particularly intensive manner in the Danube harbour Kelheim. One can therefore conclude that, in 1993, some of the Bavarian Main harbours achieve no, at the most only 3 % of their volume of water traffic with harbours along the Danube. The share of water-traffic in harbours along the Northern ramp of the Main-Danube canal ranges between 0 % and a respectable 16 %. On the other hand, some Bavarian Danube harbours use the economical potential linked to the canal in a much more intensive manner. The results of the Kelheim harbour are particularly exemplary. Approximately 65 % of the traffic volume is carried out with harbours in the Rhine area. Due to this speedy orientation to the changed situation, it was possible to increase the total traffic volume in 1993, compared to the previous year, in the Kelheim harbour by 112 %. The Bavarian inland harbours have a similarity, regardless of their location on the Main, the canal or along the Danube, i. e. that fertilisers and iron ore constitute the most frequent goods with the highest tonnage carried across the European watershed. It became clear during gathering data regarding the on-land catchment areas for the harbour locations that the commonly accepted depiction of a 50 kilometre catchment area around the harbour location rarely does justice to the actual situation. Instead, the harbours along the Main, the Main-Danube canal and the Danube all have an extremely homogenous picture, which ranges from a catchment area of just a few kilometres up to distances of over 150 kilometres. It is however questionable whether {{it will be able to}} secure operation in all Bavarian harbours in the long term. An exaggerated number of competing harbours lead in borderline cases to shut-downs, as has already occurred in Wipfeld. A possible aid in alleviating this pressure of competition would be a consequent specialisation of smaller harbour locations in dealing with specific transport goods. From the point of view of 1995 and with the exception of {{the completion of}} the construction work on the future Danube harbour Straubing-Sand, there should be no further plans or actual construction work carried out on <b>public</b> goods' <b>harbours.</b> Much more, it will be the main task in the coming years to structure and to modernise in a targeted manner the present stock of harbours. These steps must go hand in hand with an increase in co-operation between the Bavarian harbours in improving their catalogue of services and marketing. A sensible aid in achieving this is the drawing up of a harbour plan, already projected in the State Ministry for Economy and Infrastructure...|$|R
