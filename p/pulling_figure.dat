40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a Local Oscillator for a new Broadband Access System based on Point to MultiPoint microwave Radio Links. The key advance is achieving good enough phase noise performance (100 dBc/Hz@ 100 KHz), over a relatively wide frequency band (15 %), with good <b>pulling</b> <b>figure</b> and harmonics suppression, at a low cost and small size, for volume production. A fully monolithic VCO/Prescaler solution, integrating the resonator, the reflection amplifier, a single-stage buffer amplifier, a divider by eight and all main bias circuitry into a 5. 16 mm 2 GaAs chip has been developed. The development procedure set to make this possible, with specific emphasis to volume production issues, is hereby described. Some simulation and measured data are also reported. Moreover, some open issues and existing problems that still hinder first run design success are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{monolithic}} AlGaN/GaN HEMT {{voltage-controlled oscillator}} has been designed, fabricated and characterized. The oscillator design utilizes a common-gate negative resistance topol-ogy with a multi-finger interdigitated Schottky diode varactor resonator for frequency control. The VCO operating at 15 V drain bias and- 4 V gate bias, exhibits frequency range between 8. 5 and 9. 5 GHz with {{maximum output power of}} 31. 8 dBm across a 50 ohm load. Maximum power variation does not exceed ± 0. 8 dB in the oscillation frequency band. Average phase {{noise in the}} bandwith is estimated to be equal to- 77 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset and- 101 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. Average tuning sensitivity is measured to be 120 MHz/V. Oscillator’s <b>pulling</b> <b>figure</b> is equal to 139 MHz for 12 dB return loss. Pushing figure is 114 MHz/V. Output power can be increased up to 35 dBm (2. 1 W/mm) by setting drain bias voltage at 30 V. I...|$|E

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} said of Michelangelo {{that when he}} sculpted he <b>pulled</b> the <b>figure</b> out from the block of marble.

The block of marble for him is a mass made u p of many things, including the Bible, the entire history of philosophy (ancient in particular), the history of literature, Hegelianism, and Christendom. Kierkegaard pulls the absurd out of this block. Rather than imposed on the block from the very begin-ning, the absurd is an expression of strains peculiar to the mass on which Kierkegaard works. It is most readily seen to emerge only {{at the end of a}} reflective process. I say this to emphasize that beginning directly with the absurd would force us to halt before an abyss. Like Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, Kierkegaard's absurd is an abyssal thought, more like a chasm and ending than a beginning, easier to fall into than to go around. In Nietzsche's case, the eternal recur-rence is an equalizer. We read in Thus Spoke Zarathustra: Naked I had once seen both, the greatest man and the smallest man: all-too-similar to each other, even the greatest all-too-human. All-too-small, the greatest!—that was my disgust with man. And the eternal re-currence even of the smallest—that was my disgust with all existence...|$|R

The structure is designed for extreme high beam loading of nearly 98 %. The nominal input power is 30 MW at a pulse length of 1. 5 µs resulting to an unloaded accelerating voltage of 13. 5 MV.

40|$|Electrostatically {{actuated}} nanoelectromechanical switches {{based on}} carbon nanotubes have been fabricated and {{tested in a}} continuing effort to develop high-speed switches {{for a variety of}} stationary and portable electronic equipment. As explained below, these devices offer advantages over electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical switches, which, heretofore, have represented {{the state of the art}} of rapid, highly miniaturized electromechanical switches. Potential applications for these devices include computer memories, cellular telephones, communication networks, scientific instrumentation, and general radiation-hard electronic equipment. A representative device of the present type includes a single-wall carbon nanotube suspended over a trench about 130 nm wide and 20 nm deep in an electrically insulating material. The ends of the carbon nanotube are connected to metal electrodes, denoted the source and drain electrodes. At bottom of the trench is another metal electrode, denoted the <b>pull</b> electrode (see <b>figure).</b> In the off or open switch state, no voltage is applied, and the nanotube remains out of contact with the pull electrode. When a sufficiently large electric potential (switching potential) is applied between the pull electrode and either or both of the source and drain electrodes, the resulting electrostatic attraction bends and stretches the nanotube into contact with the pull electrode, thereby putting the switch into the "on" or "closed" state, in which substantial current (typically as much as hundreds of nanoamperes) is conducted. Devices of this type for use in initial experiments were fabricated on a thermally oxidized Si wafer, onto which Nb was sputter-deposited for use as the pull-electrode layer. Nb was chosen because its refractory nature would enable it to withstand the chemical and thermal conditions to be subsequently imposed for growing carbon nanotubes. A 200 - nm-thick layer of SiO 2 was formed on top of the Nb layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. In the device regions, the SiO 2 layer was patterned to thin it to the 20 -nm trench depth. The trenches were then patterned by electron- beam lithography and formed by reactive- ion etching of the pattern through the 20 -nm-thick SiO 2 to the Nb layer...|$|R
