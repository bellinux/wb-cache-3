50|$|The term {{can also}} be used for {{inhibiting}} antibody, <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and, agglutination reaction.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation {{occurs with}} most antigens because the antigen is {{multivalent}} (i.e. has several antigenic determinants per molecule to which antibodies can bind). Antibodies {{have at least}} two antigen binding sites (and in the case of Immunoglobulin M there is a multimeric complex with up to 10 antigen binding sites), thus large aggregates or gel-like lattices of antigen and antibody are formed. Experimentally, an increasing amount of antigen is added to a constant amount of antibody in solution. Initially at low antigen concentration, all of the antibody is contained in the precipitate. This is called the antibody-excess zone (i.e. <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon).</b> As more antigen is added, the amount of protein precipitated increases until the antigen/antibody molecules are at an optimal ratio. This is known as the zone of equivalence or equivalence point. When the amount of antigen in solution exceeds the amount of antibody, the amount of precipitation will decrease. This is known as the antigen excess zone.|$|E
50|$|Definite {{diagnosis}} of brucellosis requires {{the isolation of}} the organism from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, but serological methods may be the only tests available in many settings. Positive blood culture yield ranges between 40% and 70% and is less commonly positive for B. abortus than B. melitensis or B. suis. Identification of specific antibodies against bacterial lipopolysaccharide and other antigens can be detected by the standard agglutination test (SAT), rose Bengal, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), antihuman globulin (Coombs’) and indirect enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SAT is the most commonly used serology in endemic areas. An agglutination titre greater than 1:160 is considered significant in nonendemic areas and greater than 1:320 in endemic areas. Due to the similarity of the O polysaccharide of Brucella to that of various other Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella urbana, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) the appearance of cross-reactions of class M immunoglobulins may occur. The inability to diagnose B. canis by SAT due to lack of cross-reaction is another drawback. False-negative SAT may be caused by the presence of blocking antibodies (the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon)</b> in the α2-globulin (IgA) and in the α-globulin (IgG) fractions. Dipstick assays are new and promising, based on the binding of Brucella IgM antibodies, and found to be simple, accurate, and rapid. ELISA typically uses cytoplasmic proteins as antigens. It measures IgM, IgG, and IgA with better sensitivity and specificity than the SAT in most recent comparative studies. The commercial Brucellacapt test, a single-step immunocapture assay for the detection of total anti-Brucella antibodies, is an increasingly used adjunctive test when resources permit. PCR is fast and should be specific. Many varieties of PCR have been developed (e.g. nested PCR, realtime PCR and PCR-ELISA) and found to have superior specificity and sensitivity in detecting both primary infection and relapse after treatment. Unfortunately, these have yet to be standardized for routine use, and some centres have reported persistent PCR positivity after clinically successful treatment, fuelling the controversy about the existence of prolonged chronic brucellosis. Other laboratory findings include normal peripheral white cell count, and occasional leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis. The serum biochemical profiles are commonly normal.|$|E

40|$|A {{photometric}} method {{was used to}} measure the bactericidal kinetics for Brucella abortus of freshly drawn rabbit blood during the time before clotting. This antibrucellar activity varied between rabbits in different immunologic states. Nonimmunized rabbits had moderate bactericidal activity after a lag of about 2 min. The blood of some immunized rabbits gave an immediate and strong kill, but in certain other immunized rabbits, especially when hyperimmunized, the bactericidal activity was inhibited. It appeared that serum bactericidins and complement are sometimes as active in unclotted blood as they are in serum. However, this bactericidal activity can be either increased or neutralized by immunization.

40|$|Background. The <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{is known}} to be {{associated}} with high antibody titers; other associations, such as host factors, have not been elucidated. Methods. A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the incidence of the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of the syphilis rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test among 46 856 clinical samples, between June 2010 and June 2013. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Results. Our results showed that the incidence of the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> was low (0. 83 %) and could occur during any clinical phase, particularly during primary and secondary syphilis. Pregnancy and neurosyphilis were associated with the prozone phenomenon; sex, age, and whether the patient had been treated were not. The results also revealed that the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> not only occurred in patients with a high titer but also could occur in patients with a moderate/low titer. In fact, almost 31 % of the patients with the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> had titers ≤ 1 : 16. Conclusions. The <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in the RPR test was associated with the phase of syphilis, pregnancy, and neurosyphilis as well as a range of RPR titers between 1 : 8 and 1 : 512.

40|$|Although the Neisser—Wechsberg {{phenomenon}} {{resembles the}} inhibition of agglutination systems by excess antibody, the experimental results {{have indicated that}} with heat-inactivated antiserum the phenomenon results both from an excess of specific antibody and of non-specific anti-complementary activity.

40|$|Computer {{models were}} used to examine whether and under what {{conditions}} the multimeric protein complex is inhibited by high concentrations {{of one of its}} components—an effect analogous to the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in precipitin tests. A series of idealized simple “ball-and-stick” structures representing small oligomeric complexes of protein molecules formed by reversible binding reactions were analyzed to determine the binding steps leading to each structure. The equilibrium state of each system was then determined over a range of starting concentrations and Kds and the steady-state concentration of structurally complete oligomer calculated for each situation. A strong inhibitory effect at high concentrations was shown by any protein molecule forming a bridge between two or more separable parts of the complex. By contrast, proteins linked to the outside of the complex by a single bond showed no inhibition whatsoever at any concentration.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal any evidence of cerebral edema or space occupying lesion. In view of the high endemicity of brucellosis in the area, Brucella agglutination test (BAT) was done at the time of admission and was negative.

Materials and methods: In this study the tests of four cases that have false negative serological results were evaluated. Blood cultures were obtained from all cases while cerebrospinal fluid cultures were studied in the two cases. Standardagglutination test (SAT) and Coombs test were performed to all patients. Results: SAT and Coombs test was negative in titers up to 1 / 640 in all cases. The SAT and Coombs tests in cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) of the two cases with neurobrucellosis diagnosis were negative, as well. Since the clinical and laboratoryfindings suggested the brucellosis, the serums were restudied by diluting up to 1 / 10240 titer and we saw that the first 3 cases became positive at a titer of 1 / 1280. The fourth case remained negative and therefore, we applied high dilutionCoombs test. This time the test gave a positive result at 1 / 10240 titer beginning from 1 / 2560 titer.

40|$|Background: To improve current {{alpha-fetoprotein}} (AFP) assays, {{which are}} expensive and time-consuming, a specific AFP reagent {{has been developed}} for practical use in our newly developed high-speed, highly sensitive pulse immunoassay (PIA) system, in which a latex immunoagglutination reaction is carried out under a high-frequency pulse voltage, leading to an enhanced immunological reaction. Methods: We evaluated the assay performance (reproducibility, sensitivity, dilution linearity, interference) of the newly developed automated AFP PIA compared with the current AFP assay. Results: Using pooled serum samples, the within-run reproducibility resulted in a correlation variation of 3. 6 – 4. 7 %. The AFP assay detection limit {{was determined to be}} 2. 5 mg/L. Linear sequential dilution was found up to nearly 700 mg/L. Even up to an AFP concentration of 1. 0 g/L, the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> was not observed. Free and conjugated bilirubin, haemolytic haemoglobin, chyle and rheumatoid factor did not show any test interference. Using AFP-positive serum samples from 114 patients, the correlation between our PIA and a chemiluminescence immunoassay resulted in an excellent correlation coefficient of 0. 994.

The deoxyglucose uptake assay, which probably measured an effect on the macrophage cell membrane, was easy to perform, and the <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> observed with other lymphokine assay systems did not occur. The deoxyglucose uptake-enhancing moiety was stable at 56 °C for 1 h and had a molecular weight of between 50, 000 and 100, 000, as defined by Amicon ultrafiltration. Exposure of macrophages to the lymphokine-containing supernatants did not increase macrophage deoxyglucose uptake significantly until after 9 h of incubation had elapsed. The effect on deoxyglucose uptake was to increase the Vmax without changing the Km value. Deoxyglucose uptake also involved a stereospecific carrier-facilitated transport system both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} lymphokine. The increased deoxyglucose transport induced by the lymphokine-containing supernatants was reversible. A migration inhibitory factor activity of similar molecular weight and heat stability was also present in these supernatants, but in titers lower than the titers of the deoxyglucose uptake-enhancing activity. Consequently, in the absence of a complete biochemical characterization, the two effects cannot be ascribed to the same molecular species at this time. Such a characterization, along with studies of lymphokine production and action, should be facilitated greatly by the availability of very high-titer supernatants derived by this geometric culture method...|$|E

Chinchillas were immunized with purified HMW 1 /HMW 2 -like proteins from five prototype NTHI strains. Serum opsonophagocytic activity was monitored in an assay that uses a human promyelocytic cell line, HL- 60, as the source of phagocytic cells. Preimmune sera did not demonstrate opsonophagocytic killing of any strains. In contrast, the immune sera demonstrated killing of the five homologous NTHI strains at titers ranging from 1 : 320 to 1 : 640. The immune sera also demonstrated killing of eight heterologous NTHI strains that express HMW 1 /HMW 2 -like proteins at titers ranging from 0 to 1 : 640. Killing of heterologous strains sometimes demonstrated a <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> None of the immune sera killed NTHI strains that did not express HMW 1 /HMW 2 -like proteins.

These data demonstrate that antibodies produced following immunization with the HMW 1 /HMW 2 -like proteins are opsonophagocytic for both homologous and heterologous NTHI and strongly suggest that common epitopes recognized by functionally active antibodies exist on the HMW 1 /HMW 2 -like proteins of unrelated NTHI strains.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study has}} been carried out to investigate the role of immunoglobulin isotype, epitope density, and antigen/antibody ratio on the capacity of immune complexes to activate the classical and alternative pathways of human complement and for the complexes subsequently to bind to erythrocyte C 3 b-C 4 b receptors (CRI). For this purpose, a series of chimaeric monoclonal anti-NIP antibodies was used, which all shared the same combining site but had different human constant domains. Antigen epitope density was varied by coupling different numbers of NIP hapten molecules to bovine serum albumin. All three parameters affect complement fixation. In general, complement activation is better in antibody excess and at equivalence than it is in antigen excess, and better at high epitope density than at low epitope density, although the effects are variable for different immunoglobulin isotypes and for the two pathways. It has been confirmed that IgG 1 and IgG 3 are good activators of the classical pathway and are tolerant to variations in both epitope density and antigen/antibody ratio. IgG 4 and IgA do not activate the classical pathway in any circumstances. IgG 2 activates the classical pathway only at high epitope density and at equivalence or antibody excess. IgM activates the classical pathway well only at the higher epitope densities and at equivalence or antibody excess but, in addition, shows an interesting and unexpected <b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon</b> where immune complex in antibody excess inhibits complement activation by the classical pathway. The results of the alternative pathway activation are strikingly different. IgA is by far the best activator of the alternative pathway and is relatively tolerant to epitope density and to antigen/antibody ratio. IgM, IgG 1 and IgG 3 do not significantly activate the alternative pathway in any circumstances. IgG 2 is the best IgG subclass for alternative pathway activation but requires high epitope density and equivalence or antibody excess. Binding to CR 1 in general parallels the amount of complement fixed independent to the pathway by which it is fixed. However, IgG 1 and IgG 3 complexes in antigen excess activate complement well but bind poorly to CR 1. Nascently formed complexes seem to bind complement {{in a way that is}} similar to that bound by preformed complexes, but are then less able to bind to red cell CR 1. These observations help to explain the pathogenesis of complement activation in various autoimmune and immune complex diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis and others...|$|E

40|$|Malaria remains, in the 21 st Century, {{a serious}} {{infectious}} disease, with 243 million people developing clinical malaria in 2009, resulting in over 863 000 deaths worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Asia-Pacific Region and South America, falciparum malaria continues {{to result in}} 20 % of all childhood deaths, and remains a major impediment to social and economic growth and development in many low-income countries. There remains no vaccine against malaria, and the pace of development of effective treatments must compete with the parasite’s ability to develop resistance, which is proving increasingly difficult as resistance prevalence increases. Case management of malaria relies upon early and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to improve the diagnosis of malaria, particularly in remote areas. Detection of falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP 2) {{is the basis for}} many of these tests. However, RDT sensitivity in operational use has been reported to be highly variable. There is an urgent need to investigate systematically reasons for performance variation in these tests. In theory, causes for variation in PfHRP 2 -detecting malaria RDTs could occur in two main areas: problems with the detecting antibody imbedded in the test, and problems with the antigen produced by the parasite which the test detects. Antibody problems relate {{to the quality of the}} RDT: production issues, antibody specificity and affinity, heat stability of the antibody, and quality control. Antigen factors include the parasitemia of the infection, genetic diversity, gene deletion, gene transcription and protein expression, and antigen-antibody complex binding in vivo. This thesis concentrated on these antigen factors which could impact on the sensitivity of RDTs. I hypothesized that: • pfhrp 2 gene variation in structure • PfHRP 2 antigen quantity and expression differences between different strains of the parasite • an overloading of antigens, and • pre-existing antibody to PfHRP 2 may all contribute to a variation in sensitivity in the use of PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs. To date, no methodical research has been undertaken to investigate the extent of contribution of these factors, to this varied sensitivity. The aims of the research were: • to investigate molecular structural differences in the pfhrp 2 gene from a large, geographically diverse sample of Plasmodium falciparum parasite isolates, to fill a knowledge gap in the extent of diversity of this gene; • to examine the transcription of pfhrp 2 in different laboratory strains of the parasite, and the expression of PfHRP, and test whether variant strains produced variant amounts of protein, which may be differentially detected on RDTs. This has importance in detection sensitivity particularly at low parasitemia; • to test whether an excess of antigen (<b>prozone</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> or high dose-hook effect), could contribute to the sensitivity of the tests. This has importance in detection sensitivity particularly at high parasitemia and high antigen levels; • to study whether a high level of pre-existing in vivo anti-PfHRP 2 antibodies present in the patient could bind strongly with antigen produced by the parasite, preventing the antigen binding to the detection antibody in the PfHRP 2 -detecting RDT, and produce a so-called “blocking” effect. Key outcomes of the research included: • Characterization of the pfhrp 2 gene. Whilst extensive diversity was observed in the sequence of this gene, it was concluded from this research that the pfhrp 2 gene structure does not significantly impact upon the sensitivity of the tests at parasitemia > 250 P/µL. The results substantially contributed to the information collated by the World Health Organization in their Round One and Round Two Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test product testing, 2008 and 2009; • Description of the transcription of pfhrp 2 and expression of PfHRP. The research found that differences exist between transcription and expression of this gene and protein in a number of laboratory isolates, and provided a proof of concept that this variation impacts on the sensitivity of a number of RDTs; • Demonstration of a prozone effect. My results showed that no complete negative RDT result could be produced by parasitemia as high as 10 %, however a strengthening of the band intensity does occur following dilution of the parasite-infected blood sample; • Demonstration of a “blocking” effect. Incubating a hyperimmune patient serum containing anti-PfHRP 2 antibody with soluble parasite antigen and parasitized red blood cells blocked the detection of parasites on a number of PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs. This thesis has contributed to scientific knowledge of the genetic variation on a global scale of pfhrp 2, and transcription and protein expression level variation of PfHRP 2 throughout the intraerythrocytic lifecycle and between different strains. The results suggest that a number of parasite genetic and protein factors may contribute to the sensitivity of the RDTs, findings which are not due to the quality of the tests. The outcomes have been incorporated by WHO into its Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test Performance program by using a panel of 100 geographically variant parasite isolates with characterized pfhrp 2 in its most recent (Round 2, 2009) malaria RDT product testing. This is the first report of an antibody blocking effect impairing the sensitivity of PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs for malaria. The work outlined in this thesis has importance in its contribution to public health through identifying factors which can contribute to the variable sensitivity of RDTs for malaria. The work presents challenges for manufacturers and scientists in future work on PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs for malaria, to develop better antibodies against less-variable epitopes of PfHRP 2 with a minimum level of protein expression, or innovative diagnostic products to detect less-variable antigens. It would also be important to improve the lysis buffer in the RDT kits so antigen-antibody complexes can be interrupted prior to the test completion. As falciparum malaria has the potential to kill very quickly, it is imperative that an RDT be as sensitive as possible to ensure people receive the treatment they need. An RDT also needs to be as specific as possible to ensure negative cases are investigated for other causes of illness. This is particularly important for public health in malarious areas without concurrent microscopy, or microscopy skills that are not optimal, so that patients who are symptomatic and parasitemic will be detected. The outcomes of this thesis will contribute to the work of the WHO, to achieve its Millennium Development Goal of reversing the incidence of malaria and the number of malaria deaths. Through correct diagnosis and treatment of all cases, control and elimination can be achieved with the best use of resources, of particular importance to developing countries...|$|E
