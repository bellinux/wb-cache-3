5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires <b>parental</b> <b>consent</b> for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing <b>parental</b> <b>consent</b> requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require <b>parental</b> <b>consent</b> to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the <b>parental</b> <b>consent</b> provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E

25|$|In Medieval Europe, a woman's {{parents could}} {{forcibly}} marry {{her to a}} stranger without her consent, and, once she was married, {{she could no longer}} refuse to consent to sex: the medieval concept of rape did not allow for the possibility of being raped by one's husband. In 1563, the Council of Trent expressly declared that legal Catholic marriages had to be done with consent of both parties, but did not require <b>parental</b> <b>consent,</b> essentially declaring forced marriages invalid. This was not universally accepted: for example, in France, women were not granted the right to marry without <b>parental</b> <b>consent</b> until 1793.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. <b>Parental</b> {{acceptance}} and <b>consent</b> are important parameters in selecting the required behavior management technique during pediatric dental treatment. The present {{study sought to}} assess the effect of three different informing methods on the <b>parental</b> acceptance, <b>consent</b> and concern regarding the pharmacological and invasive behavior management techniques used in pediatric dentistry. Materials and methods. Ninety mothers of 3 - 6 -year-old uncooperative children were selected and randomly assigned to three study groups. The parents in each group were initially asked to answer three questions related to their levels of ‘acceptance’, ‘consent’, and ‘concern’ toward the five behavior management techniques. Then, {{the information about the}} techniques was presented through a piece of writing in group I, verbal presentation in group II and showing a film in group III. At last, the parents answered the same three questions again. Score changes were analyzed by using ANOVA, correlations, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis methods. Results. There were no statistically significant differences in score changes of <b>parental</b> acceptance, <b>consent</b> and concern between the three groups, overall and in relation to each behaviour management technique (P > 0. 05). Mothers with academic education revealed more statistically significant concern following presentation of information by film (P < 0. 05). Conclusion. None of the presentation methods had a significant preference over the others; in selecting the behavioral management techniques, it is advisable to observe individual factors, such as the level of education of the mothers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of games and training programs offered at the Ball school (Ballschule Heidelberg), on ball-coordination among first and second grade students. For this purpose, 38 students from 13 schools covered by the Ball school (Heidelberg Balschule), were chosen as the experimental group (non-random); in the meantime the consent of the students’ parents were also received. Forty students as well as a control group (non-random) of eight normal schools were selected with <b>parental</b> <b>consents.</b> Then through using ball-coordination tests [BKT (BallKoordinationstests). Ball Coordination’s Tests], the level of the ball skills among both groups were measured in the pre-test and Post-test. Tests included kicking ball against the wall (under five conditions). The research methods were semi-experimental with experimental and control groups. Independent variables were also applied to the experimental group and the means and standard deviations were calculated through descriptive statistics. And then, a T-test for statistical analysis of data in related groups were applied.

30|$|We {{reported}} {{the use of}} rFVIIa in a child complicated with persistent bleeding after cardiac surgery under CPB. Because massive transfusion of FFP and platelets failed to control post-CPB bleeding, we decided to use rFVIIa though we knew that post-CPB coagulopathy was not a licensed indication. In this case, rFVIIa was administrated without previous <b>parental</b> informed <b>consent</b> for its use. The administration of rFVIIa dramatically improved his coagulation data and reduced blood loss.|$|R

40|$|Background. Adolescents {{living with}} HIV are an {{emerging}} {{group in the}} global HIV/AIDS epidemic.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDAll {{research}} involving {{human subjects}} {{should be conducted}} in accordance to the general ethical principles of autonomy or respect for persons, beneficence and justice. Competent adults can exercise their autonomy and can choose to take on risk {{for the sake of}} others, therefore are able to protect their own interests while in the pediatric research the ‗best interests of the child‘ takes precedence over autonomy. In other words giving informed consent in the pediatric context, is not ‗who decides‟ but „what is the best decision for the child‟. Due to lack of consensus gold standard to guide researchers and assess the quality of <b>parental</b> informed <b>consent</b> in Botswana, the practical and ethical challenges posed in obtaining <b>parental</b> informed <b>consent</b> for child enrolment in pediatric HIV clinical trials were examined.
