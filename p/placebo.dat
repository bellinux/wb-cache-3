40|$|Increasingly a {{focus of}} {{research}} as well as media reports and online forums, the use of <b>placebos</b> in clinical medicine extends beyond sugar pills and saline injections. Physician surveys conducted in various countries invariably report that <b>placebos</b> are routinely used clinically, impure <b>placebos</b> more frequently than the pure ones, and that physicians consider them to be of legitimate therapeutic value. Inconsistent study methodologies and physician conceptualisations of <b>placebos</b> may complicate the interpretation of survey data, but hardly negate the valuable insights these research findings provide. Because impure <b>placebos</b> are often not recognised as such by practitioners, they remain at the fringe of many placebo-related debates, hence quietly absent from discussions concerning policy and regulation. The apparent popularity of impure <b>placebos</b> used in clinical practice thus presents unresolved ethical concerns and should direct future discussion and research...|$|R

25|$|The <b>placebo</b> effect {{makes it}} more {{difficult}} to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a <b>placebo.</b> If a person is given a <b>placebo</b> under one name, and they respond, they will respond in the same way on a later occasion to that <b>placebo</b> under that name but not if under another.|$|E
25|$|Another {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} 79% of depressed patients receiving <b>placebo</b> remained well (for 12 weeks {{after an initial}} 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants. In the continuation phase however, patients on <b>placebo</b> relapsed significantly more often than patients on antidepressants. A 2009 meta-analysis reported that in 2005 68% {{of the effects of}} antidepressants was due to the <b>placebo</b> effect, which was more than double the <b>placebo</b> response rate in 1980.|$|E

The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to <b>placebo,</b> showing a 71% reduction. 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on <b>placebo.</b> 88% of patients treated with valaciclovir had no recognized signs or symptoms versus 77% for <b>placebo.</b>|$|E
