2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E
