50|$|The Harahan Bridge was to {{be located}} 200 feet north of the Frisco Bridge. Use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> had been used on the Frisco and other major bridges; this did not {{eliminate}} the dangers involved. The Harahan <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> were constructed on shore out of wood. The walls were 3 feet thick, with heavy caulking and tar to make them airtight. The caisson was 40 feet wide x 90 feet long x 60 feet tall. In reality, {{it was a large}} wooden box, open at the bottom. The chamber {{at the bottom of the}} caisson had a 7-foot ceiling for the sandhogs to work.|$|R
5000|$|The Eads Bridge {{was also}} the first bridge to be built using {{cantilever}} support methods exclusively, {{and one of the first}} to make use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons.</b> The Eads Bridge caissons, still among the deepest ever sunk, were responsible for one of the first major outbreaks of [...] "caisson disease" [...] (also known as [...] "the bends" [...] or decompression sickness). Fifteen workers died, two other workers were permanently disabled, and 77 were severely afflicted.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} of the project {{involved}} building massive willow mats. These mats were constructed on the river. When completed, they measured 200 feet x 300 feet. They were floated {{to the location of}} the piers (held in place by barges) and sunk {{to the bottom of the}} river with rip-rap and stone. The purposed of the willow mats was to reduce scouring, keeping the river bed in place as the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> were dug into the river bed.|$|R

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} in 1883 using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> engineering. The light replaced an earlier 1868 light. Conimicut Lighthouse was automated in the 1960s {{and was one of}} the last acetylene gas powered lights to switch to electricity. The City of Warwick acquired the light in 2004. Initially the city planned to restore the lighthouse, but a federal grant for this purpose failed to come through. Subsequently, the city is considering various plans, including leasing it to a tourism company to be converted into a bed-and-breakfast inn.|$|E
50|$|The bridge has two outer span of {{reinforced}} {{pre-stressed concrete}} box beams {{which are the}} widest {{of the world for}} this type of bridge. The towers are located on a huge <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> foundation system, a modern construction technology first applied in Vietnam on this project. The bridge was constructed using a balanced cantilever technology, wherein the bridge beams reaching out over the water and the aligned ends connect at a head height of 50 m above the water level. This technique assured that vessels could still operate normally during the construction process.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built to {{transport}} heavy equipment across the Columbia river during {{the construction of the}} dam, and thereafter as permanent highway bridge. As such, it was designed to carry a heavier load than was typical. The bridge is supported by two concrete piers, about 150 ft high. During construction, one of the piers began to tilt, probably due to fine glacial material under the gravel. Additional supports were added as a temporary measure. The piers were later taken down to the bedrock using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Possibly {{inspired}} by Weldon's caisson lock, William Congreve in 1813 patented a [...] "hydro-pneumatic double balance lock" [...] {{in which two}} adjacent locks containing <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other. In about 1817 the Regents Canal Company built one of these locks {{at the site of}} the present-day Camden Lock, north London. [...] Here the motivation was, again, water supply problems. [...] The company insisted on various modifications to Congreve's design; the resulting installation proved to be unsatisfactory, and was soon replaced by conventional locks.|$|R
50|$|Pier {{foundations}} for the bridge spans were of 7 ft base diameter cast iron cylinders, which tapered to 5.5 ft diameter {{at the high}} water level, each column was around 90 ft long. The piers were sunk into the river alluvium using a mass placed on them, {{and then by the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>Caisson</b> process until bedrock was reached. The tubes were then filled with Portland cement concrete to within 20 ft of the top, the final fill was with brickwork with a top course of granite. The river abuttments were of brick with stone dressing.|$|E
5000|$|Fourteen Foot Bank Light is a {{lighthouse}} in the Delaware Bay near Bowers Beach, Delaware. Built in 1885-1886 {{at the south}} end of Joe Flogger Shoal, it was the first lighthouse to be built using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson.</b> The wooden caisson structure was excavated to a depth of 23 ft below the seabed, then filled with [...] of concrete. A cast-iron base was meanwhile erected on the caisson as it sank. A house-like structure was built on top of the base, designed by H.A. Ramsay and Son of Baltimore. Engineers for the structure were Anderson and Barr, and the contractor was D.P. Heap.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> engineering. A granite base was added in 1922. The light was deactivated in 1941 {{when the first}} Jamestown Bridge was built. The light became dilapidated until 1999 when the Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse received ownership of the lighthouse. The lighthouse is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2003 the Plum Beach Lighthouse's exterior was completely restored and its beacon re-activated soon after and is now licensed as a Coast Guard Private Aid to Navigation. The Friends of the Plum Beach Lighthouse designed, submitted and introduced an official License Plate to be distributed to any Rhode Island private passenger registration. The extremely popular plates have sold over 7000 sets since they were released in July 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The Empire Building at 71 Broadway on {{the corner}} of Rector Street in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City is a 21-story (69.3 m) steel framed curtain-wall {{skyscraper}} designed by Kimball & Thompson in the Classical Revival style and built by Marc Eidlitz & Son from 1895-98. [...] It is one of the earliest skyscrapers built on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> and one of the oldest still standing today. [...] The building was the home of United States Steel Corporation from its founding in 1901 to 1976. [...] Since 1997, it has served as an apartment building. [...] It was designated a New York City landmark in 1996 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|R
500|$|Efforts {{were made}} to improve the {{processes}} for erecting skyscrapers, largely through the work of general contractors such as Louis Horowitz and Frank Gilbreth, who in turn drew on recent work by efficiency specialist Frederick Taylor. Time schedules were devised for all the work to be undertaken, with costs carefully monitored and reports produced each day. The results were demonstrated on the Woolworth Building construction project, where [...] of steel were assembled in only six days, a record for the period. Improved windbracing techniques were introduced. The use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> in skyscraper foundations grew more advanced; {{in the construction of}} the 1908 Manhattan Municipal Building they were successfully sunk [...] below the surface, with specially conditioned workers operating in shifts with constant medical support.|$|R
50|$|Shallow {{caissons}} may {{be open to}} the air, whereas <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons,</b> which penetrate soft mud, {{are sealed}} at the top and filled with compressed air to keep water and mud out at depth. An airlock allows access to the chamber. Workers move mud and rock debris (called muck) {{from the edge of the}} workspace to a water-filled pit, connected by a tube (called the muck tube) to the surface. A crane at the surface removes the soil with a clamshell bucket. The water pressure in the tube balances the air pressure, with excess air escaping up the muck tube. The pressurized air flow must be constant to ensure regular air changes for the workers and prevent excessive inflow of mud or water at the base of the caisson.|$|R
50|$|Masonry piers {{were built}} to heights of almost 120 ft, about {{the height of}} a ten-story building. About 78 ft of that span was driven through the sandy {{riverbed}} until it hit bedrock. Eads implemented a building method that he had observed in Europe, whereby masonry was set atop a metal chamber filled with compressed air. Stone was added to the chamber, which caused the caisson to sink. Workers then dove into the caisson to shovel sand into a pump that shot it out into the air so the masonry could be sunk into the riverbed. Thirteen men died during this process and two were paralyzed, suffering from what we now know as the bends. Still today, the Eads Bridge is built on the deepest <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> ever constructed.|$|E
50|$|The first {{request for}} funds to {{construct}} this light came in 1891; funds were not appropriated, however, until 1901. Due to the exposed location a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> base was used. This was constructed in 1902 and towed to the site in April 1903, when it was secured to a temporary pier. As with construction of Baltimore Light, a series of mishaps followed. First, the temporary pier collapsed, breaking off two courses of iron plates from the caisson and releasing it from its mooring. The caisson was retrieved and repaired, and in October of that year was set in place. However, in February 1904 the temporary pier was again destroyed, this time by moving ice. The caisson survived without damage, and the light was first shown on April 24, 1905.|$|E
5000|$|Built on a 55-ground plot, the {{building}} was of enclosed construction with glass facings at front and rear. The building consists of 15 floors—13 levels with 2 basement floors. The building is of RCC-framed construction designed for central air conditioning, designed {{in the shape of}} well-proportioned box with strip glass façade. The air conditioning plant is in the sub-basement floor. The top floor of {{the building}} reaches a height of 44 meters, and the total height of the building is 177 feet. The total floor area of the building is 1,26,000 sq ft. The building stands on 521 <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> piles that run to a depth of 35 ft below the ground. The building was built at a cost of [...] 8.7 million in 1959. The building consumed about 26,000 sq ft of special glass that was treated with infra-red rays, stove enameled and made water resistant with synthetic enamel paint. About 1,000 tons of steel and 3,000 tons of cement were used {{in the construction of the}} building.|$|E
2500|$|From mid-1865 to 1867, Roebling {{worked with}} his father on the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge (now the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge). While {{traveling}} in Europe to research wire mills, bridges and caisson foundations, his only son, John A. Roebling, II, was born. After returning in 1868, Washington became assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge, and was named chief engineer after his father's death in mid-1869. He made several important improvements on the bridge design and further developed bridge building techniques. Thus, he designed the two large <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caissons</b> that became the foundations for the two towers. In 1870, fire broke out {{in one of the}} caissons; from within the caisson, Roebling directed the efforts to extinguish the flames. Working in compressed air in these caissons under the river caused him to get decompression sickness ("the bends") shattering his health and rendering him unable to visit the site, yet he continued to oversee the Brooklyn project to successful completion in 1883. Besides the bends, he may have had additional afflictions, possible neurasthenia, side effects of treatments, and secondary drug addiction. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who had taken it upon herself to learn bridge construction, became his nurse, companion, and confidant and took over much of the chief engineer's duties including day-to-day supervision and project management. [...] Although husband and wife jointly planned the bridge's continued construction, Emily successfully lobbied for formal retention of Washington as chief engineer. McCullough remarked that [...] "nowhere in the history of great undertakings is there anything comparable" [...] to Roebling conducting the largest and most difficult engineering project ever [...] "in absentia." ...|$|R
50|$|Construction on {{the bridge}} began on 24 May 1935, with the first sod being turned by the then Premier of Queensland, William Forgan Smith. Components for the bridge were {{fabricated}} in a purpose-built factory at Rocklea. Work sometimes continued 24 hours per day. The bridge has only one pier on the northern bank but two piers on the lower southern bank, one to bear the weight (the main pier) and, further to the south, one to prevent the bridge from twisting (the anchor pier). There {{was no need for}} an anchor pier on the northern bank as the bridge was anchored into schist cliff face. The major challenge in constructing the bridge was the southern foundations that went 40 metres below ground level. It was not possible to excavate to that level as water from the level would rapidly seep in. So a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> technique had to be used. As men were working under pressures of up to 4 times normal air pressure, a decompression period of almost 2 hours was needed {{at the end of each}} shift to avoid the bends. An on-site air lock hospital successfully treated the 65 cases of the bends that occurred. On 28 October 1939 the gap between the two sides was closed. A concrete decking was then laid, covered by a Trinidad pitch topping. The bridge was painted and sodium lighting was installed. The bridge approaches were also prepared.|$|E
40|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method (NPC) is {{applicable}} in {{any type of}} ground and permits the ground being excavated to be observed directly, hence it provides a reliable foundation. However, since the working chamber is put under high pressure, high temperature, and high humidity, this method requires robust, experienced workers. However, the aging of skilled workers and the shortage of younger workers have become a social problem in recent years. This is especially serious in foundation work using the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method which involves hard work under high pressure. In view of the above situation, the Ministry of Construction conducted a joint research with several private companies on technology for automatically removing excavated materials in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method {{as part of its}} comprehensive technical development project and {{has come up with a}} new <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method. ...|$|E

40|$|The lock {{complex at}} Terneuzen {{is the main}} {{entrance}} for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The {{construction of a new}} large lock at the lock complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between the existing locks. The ground level is situated at NAP + 6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP - 2. 85 meter. The new lock will have larger dimensions than the current locks. It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must {{be able to use the}} lock tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new lock head. (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete lock head including the gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the lock head has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson.</b> On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the lock head, is the best conceivable option.

40|$|Recently compressed-air {{engineering}} work mostly employs <b>pneumatic</b> <b>caisson</b> method {{and tends to}} use higher working pressures in accordance with mechanization of shield works. Under the circumstances, the present author totaled results of five years' surveys on development of decompression sickness (DCS) and compared the results with former research findings. For this comparison, the control data was chosen among those which had been comprised by the same procedures as ours (Mano & Shibayama, 1987). It is commonly said that DCS could not be developed under a condition of working pressures less than 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2. Although we experienced seven patients with DCS development under 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 of the pressure, no case was observed in the present survey conducted {{with a total of}} 12, 503 exposures of compressed-air works. Total number of compressed-air works with over 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 pressures include: 3, 822 more exposures found in 1986 or later than before 1986; 9, 649 more exposures observed in 1985 or former with working pressures of 1. 0 - 2. 0 kg/cm^ 2; and, with higher pressures over 2. 0 kg/cm^ 2, the number of the works showed rapid increase in 1986 or later (Table 1). This means that deep excavation works, which need higher working pressures than before, are becoming popular for today's compressed-air works. In other words, working circumstances became more strict in these years, therefore, more precise safety supervision should be required. When decompression control is carried out basing on the current decompression table, development rate of DCS increases in line with enlargement of working pressures. This was also observed in the present study. Comparing onset rates of DCS during these five years with those observed before the years, the results of these five years show lower rates, based on the working pressures divided by each 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 group, than those seen before the five years (Table 1). This supposedly indicates that more strict decompression control is carrying out today than before...|$|E
