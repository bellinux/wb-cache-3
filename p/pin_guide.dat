30|$|Despite the authors’ search efforts, {{the fallen}} cover {{could not be}} found. According to our {{interview}} to the anesthesiologists and the clinical engineers in our hospital at a later date, nobody noticed this situation. So, the proximate cause of the break is unclear. As only 8  months had passed since the operating room was built, the manufacturer had not made an annual periodic inspection. At a later date, engineers of the system’s manufacturer produced a specialized jig that was capable of grasping the outer periphery of the plastic <b>pin</b> <b>guide</b> and then measured the external vertical force required to dislodge it. This test revealed that the plastic <b>pin</b> <b>guide</b> could be dislodged by applying 29.4  N [18.6 – 54.175] (median [interquartile range]) of vertical force.|$|E
30|$|Wall-mounted pin-index {{medical gas}} {{pipeline}} {{systems have been}} sold in Japan since 1983. The design of such systems has barely changed {{since the start of}} their clinical use. According to the manufacturer, the incident described in this report was the first of its kind, and it was never suspected that such a situation could arise. In this system, there is no adhesive agent between the plastic (polyacetal) and metal components. Instead, three small ridges (height 0.3  mm, width 3.5  mm) inside the plastic component hook onto the metal base block. The required durability of such components is specified in JIS T 7101 (medical gas pipeline systems) based on International Standard Organization 9170 - 1 [2]. Although the manufacturer checked that the product met the JIS T 7101 regulations by repeatedly connecting and disconnecting gas pipes from the socket (10, 000 times, using a machine), an integrated structure composed of a metal <b>pin</b> <b>guide</b> and socket is preferred for safe clinical use. The national standards provide regulations about the test of the gas-specificity in section 9.4. 8 of JIS T 7101. They require that the manufacturer must try to connect each of the different gas pipelines sequentially. This test is inadequate for detecting to this type of malfunction. The national standards should be revised in this regard. Most of the products with a pin-index system have a metal socket with pin guides, unlike this product. Therefore, this error is the product-specific problem. It is our opinion that the design of the plastic component should be improved to prevent its unexpected detachment and that the design of the metal base block should be gas-specific. After discussion between authors and the manufacturer, they offered two solutions. First, they will make two small ridges around the outer periphery of the plastic <b>pin</b> <b>guide,</b> which is held by the front panel, so as not to dislodge. Second, they removed the versatility from the metal components. With these changes, the gas outlet remains foolproof if the plastic <b>pin</b> <b>guide</b> is lost.|$|E
30|$|The {{wall-mounted}} gas outlet {{used in our}} hospital (NSV outlet, CENTRAL UNI, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) contains multiple sockets, which {{connect to}} hoses with gas-specific pins. Each socket {{is covered with a}} gas-specific plastic <b>pin</b> <b>guide,</b> which is considered to make the system foolproof; i.e., to prevent misconnections. However, while checking an anesthesia machine in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists, an anesthesiologist found that one of the gas-specific plastic pin guides covering the wall-mounted gas outlets had disappeared; and hence, the gas outlet system was no longer foolproof. A subsequent verification test performed by engineers of the system’s manufacturer revealed that the plastic pin guides could be dislodged by applying 29.4  N of vertical force.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study firstly {{conducted}} measurement of load history profiles at brake <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> using strain gages subject to random road load history obtained from vehicle durability tests. Then, this study developed a {{simple mathematical model}} capable of estimating <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> load history using the principle of energy conservation for a given road load profile. The model took into account the effect of impact that occurs {{from a range of}} acceleration levels and frequency content of the road input. The mathematical model also utilized the measured stiffness of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> specimens and strain versus load relationship to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The estimated loads at a brake <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> subject to a given random road load history were then computed using the mathematical model and compared to the load history obtained from the measurement. This study also compared cumulative fatigue damages calculated using Smith-Watson-Topper equation with the measured and predicted load profiles at the <b>guide</b> <b>pin.</b> The comparison study showed that the developed simple model is applicable to predict load profiles for fatigue life calculation at brake <b>guide</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the process of}} design of a frame for a semi low loader for the transportation of oversize loads, especially wheeled and tracked machines. After considering different solutions of a frame, a central beam was chosen and an initial design was developed. The initial model of the frame was analyzed {{with the use of}} FEM and was then modified. Two final versions of the frame were prepared. One of them was used in a 4 axle trailer with a load deck that can be extended in length and width to carry oversize and heavy loads. An important advantage of the trailer is its versatility and the fact that in a non-extended state it meets the regulations for standard trailers and can carry loads without a special permission. The paper focuses on the application of FEM analysis {{in the design of the}} part of the beam where highest stresses were located.

30|$|In obese patients, lateral {{fluoroscopic}} {{visualization of}} the hip is sometimes poor with the patient positioned on the fracture table. On a radiolucent table, manipulation of the limb to obtain frog lateral images {{of the hip}} is not only more expeditious, but often provides a higher quality image on the lateral view than that obtained on a fracture table. However, manipulation of a large leg risks bending even the most stout <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> Special care is required to avoid bending the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> in all cases, especially as the girth of the leg increases. Protected rotation of the leg while holding the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> {{at the site of}} skin insertion will allow adequate external rotation to see the lateral trajectory. Forceful manipulation into the flexion–abduction frog position should be avoided while the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> is in place.

30|$|In {{cases where}} a {{cortical}} button is employed {{to secure the}} graft to the femur, our group has observed an unsteady movement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> that is not securely fixed in bone when over drilled with a cannulated femoral drill. This common scenario is presumed to occur when the drilling sequence produces the smaller cortical button drill hole before the larger graft tunnel socket. In this situation, the tunnel <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> would be loose within the cortical button drill hole. As a consequence of drilling over a loose <b>guide</b> <b>pin,</b> the drill might “wobble” and possibly alter the tunnel shape and aperture dimensions.

40|$|Grafts placed too {{anteriorly}} on the femur {{are reportedly}} {{a common cause}} of failure in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Some studies suggest more anatomic femoral tunnel placement improves kinematics. The ability of the transtibial technique and a tibial tunnel-independent technique (placed transfemorally outside-in) to place the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> {{near the center of}} the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament was compared in 12 cadavers. After arthroscopic placement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pins,</b> the femur was dissected and the three-dimensional geometry of the femur, anterior cruciate ligament footprint, and positions of each <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> were measured. The transtibial guide-pin placement was 7. 9  ±  2. 2  mm from the center of the footprint (near its anterior border), whereas the independent technique positioned the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> 1. 9  ±  1. 0  mm from the center. The center of the footprint was within 2  mm of an anteroposterior line through the most posterior border of the femoral cartilage in the notch and a proximodistal line through the proximal margin of the cartilage at the capsular reflection. More accurate placement of the femoral tunnel might reduce the incidence of graft failure and might reduce long-term degeneration observed after reconstruction although both would require clinical confirmation...|$|R

Following fluoroscopic confirmation of the position of these wires, the first pin is inserted through the empty guide in the clamp either using a drill or manually. At this stage of pin placement in the calcaneum, varus or valgus deformity may be corrected by inserting a pin at an angle through the clamp to act as a support. Again by using the pins as a joystick, it is possible to achieve proper alignment of the body of the calcaneus with the articular fragment fixed to the first clamp.|$|R
