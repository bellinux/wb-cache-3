5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>train</b> capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
25|$|From new, {{all members}} of the class were fitted with the Pullman style rubbing plate between the buffers {{allowing}} them to close couple with Southern Region electro-pneumatically controlled electric multiple units and diesel electric multiple units for <b>push-pull</b> <b>train</b> operation - the reason for retractable buffers.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1959, gallery {{cars on the}} Chicago and Northwestern were {{equipped}} with the AAR standard multiple-unit train control system and a control cab that allowed true high speed <b>push-pull</b> <b>train</b> operations without requiring any operators in the locomotive when operating in push mode. This combination of high passenger capacity, rapid turnaround (or flip-backs) and highly reliable push-pull operations has resulted in almost universal adoption of bilevel push-pull operations for commuter and non-electrified corridor services throughout North America.|$|E

25|$|The RBDe 560 (in the old naming style, the RBDe 4/4) and its {{derivatives}} provide {{motive power}} for S-Bahn, suburban, and regional {{traffic on the}} Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) network. The derivative versions belong to the SBB as well as various private railroads. The locomotive and its matching Bt model Steuerwagen (translation: control car/cab car/driving trailer) form compositions generally known as the Neuer Pendelzug (New <b>Push-pull</b> <b>Train),</b> which {{is the source of}} the acronym NPZ. An NPZ trainset usually includes one or more intermediate cars.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{trains are}} pulled using a locomotive. This {{involves}} {{one or more}} powered vehicles being located {{at the front of}} the train, providing sufficient tractive force to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A <b>push-pull</b> <b>train</b> has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A railroad car is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.|$|E

2500|$|The service {{spectrum}} of the (since 1968 as class 110 designated) locomotives was shifted {{more and more to}} local/regional service by the 1990s. [...] As part of this shift, during the third stage of the Bahn reform program the locomotives were assigned to the local service branch DB Regio, which practically meant the end of their service in the express area. [...] In order to use the machines more efficiently in regional service, from 1997 many of the units were equipped with <b>push-pull</b> <b>train</b> controls, partly using components of class 140 and class 141 units that were retired.|$|E
