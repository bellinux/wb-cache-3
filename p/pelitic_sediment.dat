Chemoherms in the foredeep are hosted in thick pelitic intervals, probably deposited in intrabasinal structural highs, which are entirely or partly involved in large slumps, in many cases associated with extrabasinal slides. Sediment textures in carbonates and in the enclosing foredeep <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> indicate a link between hydrocarbon-fluid venting, sediment deformation and mobilization, and tectonics. The intensity and style of fluid release phases directly influenced chemoherm typology, and also determined overpressure conditions in low shear strength <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments,</b> favouring sediment mobilization and influencing slope instability which widely affected the Apennine foredeep. Chemosynthetic carbonates are associated with sites of tectonically-fractured and compressed sediments in the Apennine foredeep-thrust belt system, thus indicanting a relation to the tectonic loading of the Apennine thrust-sheets which favoured fluid expulsion along forerunner faults. Possible gas hydrate contributions to fluid expulsion processes are discussed, based on sediment textures compared to modern vent areas.

40|$|Understanding {{the sulfur}} cycle in {{subduction}} zones is of crucial importance to quantify element fluxes {{in this context}} and also to assess the potential atmospheric impact of sulfur-rich gas emissions during major volcanic eruptions. Significant amounts of sulfur are present in subducting basaltic oceanic crust and its overlying sediments. Recent experimental studies suggest that geochemical specificities of arc magmas require sediment melting in the subduction zone (e. g., Johnson & Plank, 1999). On the same way, numerous petrological or geochemical {{studies suggest that the}} basaltic oceanic crust could melt in certain circumstances (young and hot slab), producing silicic melts termed adakites. The silicic melts produced by sediment or basalt melting at high pressure are both potential carrier of sulfur in the mantle wedge. However, experimental studies of sulfur solubilities in silicic melts have been mainly carried out at low pressures, i. e. below 400 MPa, most of the experimental data so far available being acquired at 200 MPa (e. g. Carroll and Rutherford, 1985, 1987, 1988; Luhr, 1990; Baker and Rutherford, 1996, Scaillet et al., 1998; Clemente et al., 1998). We have therefore started an experimental program to constrain the pressure dependence of sulfur solubility in hydrous silicate melts. Experiments have been performed in the pressure range 400 - 3000 MPa on a variety of melt compositions including the Pinatubo dacite (a representative example of natural Cenozoic adakites), a high silica rhyolite, a representative mid-ocean ridge basalt from the Juan de Fuca Ridge, a trondhjemitic melt produced by MORB melting at 3000 MPa and a <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediment</b> from the Barbados accretionary prism, Lesser Antilles.

Leached feldspars were used to derive original or ‘common ’ Pb ratios but Pb was unable to unequivocally evaluate the relative contributions of differing basement sources until combined with existing Nd data. With one exception, the initial Nd isotopic composition for the less evolved rocks show a limited range of Nd (εNd(t) =- 2. 7 to- 0. 7) and Pb (207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 55 to 15. 58), whereas the leucogranites are very heterogeneous (εNd(t) =- 6. 9 to- 0. 5; 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 55 to 15. 62).

40|$|Marine gas {{hydrates}} (clathrates) are ice-like solids composed predominantly {{of methane}} and water derived from methanogenic and thermogenic sources. Clathrates are readily destabilized {{by changes in}} pressure and /or temperature, which, in turn, are mainly due to tectonics, sea level change, sea-floor mass wasting and shallow geotherm raise (TREHU et al. 1999; KENNETT & FACKLER-ADAMS, 2000). During clathrate dissociation, the resultant methane and water become trapped by impermeable stratigraphic intervals (marlstones, mudstones and siltstones), producing overpressurization and associated low shear strength in <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments,</b> making them highly susceptible to soft sediment deformations, and triggering slumps, slope failures and sediment gravity flows (sediment instability). Methane-based chemosynthetic communities and authigenic methane-related carbonates (chemoherms) are frequently associated with <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> bearing gas hydrates, confirming a relationship between carbonate formation and gas hydrate decomposition (PAULL et al. 1995; SUESS et al. 1999). These carbonates show peculiar brecciated structures, irregular vuggy fabrics and dense networks of non-systematic fractures, induced by a process similar to hydrofracturing of semi-consolidated sediment, due to ascending gas bubbles and the deposition of irregular gas hydrate layers (BOHRMANN et al. 1998). The occurrence of pelitic intervals enclosing chemoherms, and intraformational and extraformational slides within the middle Miocene foredeep turbidites (Marnoso-arenacea Formation) of the northern Apennines rises many questions about relationships between tectonics and sedimentation. In this paper, the classical gravitational hypothesis is integrated with a more complex syndepositional model. Pelitic intervals are probably linked to thrust activity; structural highs affected the middle Miocene sedimentation, with <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> overlapping structural reliefs, which {{could be related to}} blind thrusts. Thrust faults may have interrupted the gas hydrates stability zone, promoting hydrate destabilization, upward flow and entrapment of methane and water in impermeable <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments.</b> Local inhomogeneity related to fractures contributed to seeping of fluids, random precipitation of authigenic carbonate, and chemosynthetic faunas. Development of fluid overpressures beneath pelitic structural reliefs may eventually undermine their stability causing deformation processes, sliding and slumping. Gas outburst is not only testified by chemoherm autobrecciated structures but also by the scraping off and mixing of the enclosing sediments (pelites and sandstones) during the rapid fluid rise along conduits or fractures (CONTI & FONTANA, 1999 a, 1999 b). Multiple phases of explosive breakage of micritic carbonates, slumping, sliding and reworking processes as debris flows or local turbiditic events are responsible of the chaoticization of wide portions of pelitic intervals. In this way, pelitic intervals with chemoherms reveal relationships between tectonics, cold seeps and sediment instability. In conclusion, pelitic intervals enclosing chemoherms are useful indicators of the advancing deformational front of the northern Apennines, thus heralding tectonic phases, as also demonstrated by the presence of extraformational slides of internal provenance (BERTI et al. 1994) ...|$|R
40|$|In the Miocene of the {{northern}} Apennines, methane-derived limestones from various geologic settings represent important examples of fossil chemoherms and {{provide a basis for}} more accurate interpretations of seepage systems. The systematic study of fossil chemoherms has allowed the definition of new field and compositional criteria for the recognition of these deposits, which were previously based almost exclusively on negative carbon isotope composition and peculiar chemosynthetic communities; this has constrained the relations between seepage and sedimentary and tectonic instability processes. We suggest that the peculiar brecciated structures associated with fossil chemoherms are related to diapirism or overpressured <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> due to fluid venting. Fluidization of sediments increases the instability of mudstones in which chemoherms are contained, thus favoring gravity slumping processes and the reworking of many chemoherms...|$|R

40|$|The {{two major}} {{lithology}} or gneiss {{components in the}} polycyclic granulite terrain of the Eastern Ghats, India, are the supracrustal rocks, commonly described as khondalites, and the charnockite-gneiss.

However, geochronological data do not corroborate the aforesaid relations. The field relations of the hornblende- mafic granulite with the two gneiss components together with geocronological data indicate that khondalite sediments were deposited on older mafic crustal rocks. We propose a different scenario: Mafic basement and supracrustal rocks were subsequently deformed and metamorphosed together at high to ultra-high temperatures – partial melting of mafic rocks producing the charnockitic melt; and partial melting of <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> producing the peraluminous granitoids.

40|$|The {{examination}} of about eighty exposures of lucinid deposits of the Apennine chain based on new field analyses and previous data, and the compositional study {{of one hundred}} samples representative of the different geological settings in which lucinid assemblages are found, enable us to distinguish four types of deposits. Type 1 and type 2 are primary (autochthonous) deposits whereas type 3 and type 4 are secondary (allochthonous) deposits. Type 1 deposits consist of marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or columnar bodies, jammed with articulated lucinid-like shells, usually belonging to oligotypic communities and grading into the surrounding <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments.</b> Most of the samples are made of homogeneous micrites, biomiocrites and fossiliferous micrites, containing variable amounts of biogenic particles, chiefly planktonic foraminifera. Type 2 deposits {{are made up of}} lucinid shells, either isolated or associated with a more diverse fauna, in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Type 3 deposits are constituted of carbonate olistoliths enclosed as blocks within chaotic horizons in turbiditic and hemipelagic formations of the Miocene foredeep. Type 4 deposits are represented by coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris. Samples of secondary deposits show a noticeable variety of lithologies and textures and are very heterogeneous even at the microscopic scale. The most common lithotypes include fine to medium grained arenites characterized by a loosely detrital fabric and by a pervasive micrite cement. Fossiliferous micrites and biomicrites with brecciated textures are common. The detrital framework show striking similarities to the composition of the host turbidites. Carbonate intraclasts and clasts deriving from lithotypes of the ligurian domain are present. Most of the type 1 and 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (chemoherms), with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid venting. Type 1 deposits occur only in thick <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> belonging to the satellite (Termina Formation of the epiligurian sequence) and to the foredeep basins (Vicchio and Letto Marls). Type 2 deposits are instead related to normal marine conditions, whereas the type 4 could have their source from all the other types of deposits. Secondary lucinid deposits occur {{in a wide range of}} different tectonic setting, from backland to foreland, with a concentration in the middle Miocene foredeep. The secondary lucinid deposits of the foredeep turbidites evidenced several different grades of allochthony and multiple provenances. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking, probably from the enclosed pelitic horizons or from adjacent slope pelites. The source of the oldest chemoherms seems to be represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and Cervarola foredeep probably originate from satellite basins or from methane-derived biological communities located in fine-grained horizons no longer preserved. The peculiar brecciated structures observed in many lucinid chemoherms are probably the result of a number of superimposed processes, involving fluidization of sediments and reworking for gravity mass transport. Mud diapirism and/or injection, related to overpressuring of sediments due to methanogenic fluid venting, could account for the formation of the brecciated structures resembling those related to gravity flow processes. Fluidization of sediments may also represent an important mechanism able to increase the instability of <b>pelitic</b> marly <b>sediments,</b> thus favouring gravity slumping processes...|$|R

40|$|Weathering and {{transportation}} {{studies of the}} chemical composition of sediments have determined how surface fractionation processes modify the elemental signature due to provenance and tectonic setting of siliciclastic rocks. Although {{the bulk of the}} exposed upper continental crust comprises granitoids, metamorphic rocks from the intermediate to lower crust may be, in some geological contexts, the provenance of siliciclastic sediments. A preferential enrichment of the LREE relative to the HREE is observed in weathered, garnet-rich, kinzigitic paragneisses from the Calabrian Arc, southern Italy. This fractionation is due mostly to the mineralogical control exerted by monazite, which is concentrated in the silt-size fraction of the soil. However, a significant part of HREE, released during garnet alteration, is trapped by secondary minerals in the clay-sized fraction of the soil, {{in a manner similar to}} Pb 2 + and Cs+, cations of some concern in environmental geochemistry. In the weathered material monazite is also important in controlling the Eu-anomaly, the negative size of which increases with increasing Th addition. The Eu-anomaly in the clay-sized fraction of the soil is very similar to that of the fresh rock, suggesting that the Eu/Eu* index in <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> deriving from the intermediate to lower crust may be regarded as a reliable indicator of parental affinity.

Autobreccias are notably missing. These characteristics are not consistent with turbu-lent flow, but clearly indicate conditions of laminar flow. If komatiitic flows were turbulent, they should commonly have scoured into substrate sediments {{through a variety of}} physical erosion processes, including foundering into underlying seafloor sediments, because of density inversion, and turbulence-induced scouring of sediments. These features are not commonly developed, also indicating that generally komatiites were emplaced under tranquil, laminar-flow conditions. Trough-like structures that com-monly host nickel sulfide mineralization have commonly been interpreted to originate by thermal erosion of substrate by the komatiitic lava. The evidence supporting thermal erosion is not strong, and commonly ambiguous. Trough structures at Kambalda, Western Australia, are fault bounded, as noted by several previous investigators. However, there is a common, but not universal, antithetic relationship between trough presence and sediment absence. Removal of sediment from troughs could be explained by physical erosion, with an initial narrow, turbulent flow-head scouring a channel in the underlying sediments. As the lava flows spread laterally, their flow-front velocity decreased, and flow became laminar, so explaining the conformable contacts wit...|$|R
40|$|The Burdigalian-Tortonian Epiligurian {{succession}} in the Val Marecchia area comprehends different lithostratigraphic units {{deposited in}} a wedge-top basin during the northeastern migration of the thrust belt. The succession includes shallow-water carbonates passing to mixed carbonatesiliciclastic and to fine-grained <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments,</b> capped by fluvio-deltaic coarse-grained deposits. Detailed field work and stratigraphy has allowed to characterize depositional units and unconformities and to delineate the sedimentary and tectonic {{evolution of the}} basin. Tectonics exerted a primary control at different stages. During the Burdigalian, a general uplift of the area allowed the onset of shelfal carbonate sedimentation on underlying Ligurian and Epiligurian deepwater sediments. At the Serravallian the sedimentation {{was influenced by the}} thrust reactivations which caused a marked asymmetry in the basin geometry and fill. The subsidence increase in the rear part of the basin determined the deposition of a thick succession of relatively deep fine-grained sediments (up to 800 m water-depth) (Serravallian, MNN 6 a through MNN 6 b subzones based on nannofossil biostratigraphy) and fossiliferous clays (lower Tortonian, biozones MNN 8 b-MNN 9). Conversely, uplift is activated in the frontal part of the basin, causing the partial erosion of the Burdigalian–Langhian shallow-water carbonates. A relevant amount of this carbonate detritus is delivered to the foredeep, supplying the Marnoso-arenacea Fm. A general uplift of the area in the late Tortonian leads to the deposition of fluvio-deltaic conglomerates supplied by emerged rear sectors of the basin...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} whether clay minerals or accessory phases control the REE pattern of the < 2 -mum fraction of <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments,</b> a set of samples from a borehole in the southern Apennines, Italy, was analysed for mineralogy and chemical composition (major elements, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb and REE). SEM analyses showed the presence of accessory phases such as Ti-oxides, apatite, zircon and pyrite. XRD procedures revealed that the < 2 -mum fraction essentially consists of illite, smectite, dickite, kaolinite and chlorite. Illite and smectite probably derived by leaching from a micaceous "biotite-like" mineral while dickite took origin from post-depositional, interstitial fluids. Only illite is correlated with REE, while a smectite-rich sample {{is characterized by the}} lowest content in REE. Strong correlations exist between REE and TiO 2, Nb, Zr and a less significant one with Sr; no correlations exist between these elements and Y. R-mode factor analysis indicated that three factors account for 87 % of the total variance. The first factor (Var = 43. 2 %) seems to express mainly the tendency of some resistate minerals to concentrate REE in the fine fraction. The second factor (Var = 30. 0 %) {{may be related to the}} effect of circulating fluids responsible for dickite genesis. The third factor may be linked to the weathering of micaceous phases. The REE do not have a significant weight in the second and third factors. Resistate minerals appear dominant in controlling, at least, the LREE and Nb. It is proposed that in the studied samples, illite likely conveyed REE via the included minerals...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} Li during high-grade metamorphism and the Li composition of the lower continental crust, the Li concentrations ([Li]) and isotopic compositions (δ 7 Li) of amphibolite- to granulite-facies metapelites, leucosomes and metabasites from the Ivrea–Verbano Zone, NW, Italy were determined. The average [Li] of amphibolite facies kinzigites (79 ± 69 μg/g, 2 σ) is {{higher than that of}} granulite facies stronalites (8 ± 6 μg/g, 2 σ) that experienced partial melting via biotite dehydration reactions. Biotite abundance and the [Li] in metapelites correlate positively, reflecting the importance of Mg-bearing phyllosilicates in controlling the Li budget of the metapelites. Despite the loss of Li following biotite breakdown, there is no significant change in δ 7 Li, which averages− 1. 4 ± 2. 0 (2 σ, excluding an anomalously light sample) in the kinzigites (amphibolite facies) and + 0. 9 ± 2. 9 (2 σ) in the stronalites (granulite facies). Both average δ 7 Li values are comparable with those of other <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> and likely reflect the δ 7 Li of their protoliths. An anomalous kinzigitic sample, with the lowest δ 7 Li (− 8. 4) and the highest [Li] (120 μg/g), has extremely low Ba and Sr concentrations and the highest CIA value, all indicators of a highly weathered protolith, which was likely isotopically light prior to significant metamorphism. This sample may also have experienced Li addition via diffusion, increasing [Li] and lowering δ 7 Li. The leucosomes in the kinzigites and stronalites are interpreted to have formed in different ways; the former precipitated from hydrotherma...|$|R
40|$|Tourmaline, {{a mineral}} often {{overlooked}} in petrologic studies, {{is shown to}} be a useful petrogenetic indicator mineral. Despite the large number of possible substitutions in tourmaline, generalizations relating tourmaline composition and rock type are made. Based on available literature data, distinct regions are defined within Al-Fe(tot) -Mg and Ca-Fe(tot) -Mg diagrams for tourmaline from different rock types. As an example of the utility of tourmaline in petrologic studies, the accessory tourmaline from staurolite-grade pelitic schists from NW Maine is investigated. These tourmaline grains typically display three general styles of chemical zoning: (1) a lack of zoning, (2) a continuous core-to-rim zonation attributed to growth during progressive metamorphism, and (3) a zonation marked by a distinct discontinuity apparently representing detrital tourmaline grains surrounded by metamorphic tourmaline overgrowths. All of the samples in this study contain si-, Al-, and Ti-saturating phases (quartz, staurolite, and ilmenite, respectively). Consequently, the substitutional complexities of tourmaline in equilibrium with the matrix are minimized. Systematic element partitioning suggests that chemical equilibrium has been attained among the rims of the tourmaline grains and matrix minerals. Tourmaline rims have the highest Mg/Fe and Na. /Ca ratios of any of the phases in the metapelites. The compositions of tourmaline cores that are presumed to be detrital in origin are optically and chemically distinct from their tourmaline overgrowths. In the Al-Fe(totl Mg and Ca-Fe(totfMg diagrams, the compositions of the detrital cores fall in the fields of rock types that are commonly found in the presumed source region for the <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Pantanal is the world's largest wetland {{presenting}} {{a variety of}} ecological sub-regions. The region is characterized by seasonal floods followed by long droughts. At this period, some areas rapidly dry, while others remain soaked. The study hypothesis {{was based on the}} statement that this phenomenon cannot be totally explained by small relief variations but by the <b>sediment</b> granulometry: the <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> allow the soil to retain moisture longer, implying that the vegetation has greater possibilities of continuing photosynthetically active even during the drought. It was developed based on the spectral behaviour of MODIS products, validated by previous fieldwork. Using MODIS, we studied a large scale patterns in spatial and seasonal dynamics of the vegetation in different regions of Pantanal. So, two indirect parameters of the local physical environment – sediment granulometry and water availability – potentially can be estimated. We calculated the NDVI from MOD 09 GQ for rainy and dry seasons, generating triplets (NDVI/NIR and Red bands) that allowed to identify vegetation changes in those periods. The 16 -days composites of NDVI (MOD 13 Q 1) were used to generate a 5 -year time-series for pixels associated with 161 locals sampled for granulometric analyses. The samples were taken in 10 different areas from the 20 geological and environmentally homologous areas delimited in this research. The clear tendency in the time-series confirms the working hypothesis, indicating that there is a high relationship between drought-related changes in vegetation extracted from NDVI and sediment texture, parameter that {{plays an important role in}} soil moisture, influencing the vegetation response to droughts...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of magmas in arc volcanism depends on sediment subduction. The mobilisation of the subducted sediments determines {{the extent of}} the transfer of materials from the slab to the mantle wedge and whether the transfer occurs as a fluid or a melt. Extensive research has already been done on the contribution of <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> to arc volcanism. However, the high amounts of sulphur emitted by some subduction volcanoes, cannot be explained by <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> only. For these reasons, this thesis describes experiments determining melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system, as very {{little is known about the}} influence of these evaporitic sediments in a subduction setting. Melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system were determined through high pressure and temperature experiments, using a piston cylinder apparatus at 10 and 35 kbar and over a temperature range from 900 to 1370 ºC. The main experiments were performed using a starting {{composition of}} 2 : 1 dolomite/anhydrite ratio, some were performed with the ratios: 4 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 dolomite/anhydrite and two experiments were performed with pure anhydrite. The resulting samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe. The onset of melting of the anhydrite-dolomite system occurs between 900 and 925 C at 10 kbar and between 975 en 1000 C at 35 kbar. The first melts formed in the 10 kbar experiment have a composition similar to a dolomite/anhydrite ratio of 2 : 1. Anhydrite and dolomite co-existed as residual solid phases during progressive melting, and disappeared 1000 and 1050 C in the 10 kbar experiments, leading with anhydrite. Above 1100 C, dolomite decomposes and periclase appears in the samples. In these experiments, the compositions of the melt and solids suggest that SO 3 was present in a fluid phase. Hence, next to dolomite decomposition and melting, some reaction occurred to transfer sulphur to a fluid phase. The melting point for pure anhydrite is probably higher than 1450 C at 10 kbar, due to impurities in the natural anhydrite used, experiments at 1400 and 1450 C yielded melt as well as primary crystals. Analysis of the experiments proved difficult due to the presence of CO 2, a fluid phase and quench crystals in the melt, therefore little can be said about trends in the compositions over the different experiments. Though the melting temperature of the mixture of dolomite and anhydrite proved about 100 C lower than that of the individual minerals, it is still too high to accommodate melting in an average subduction setting according to current models, unless a process like slab detachment plays a role and the inflow of hot asthenospheric mantle increases the temperature enough to accommodate melting. One example of a volcano in a subduction setting erupting sulphur- and CO 2 -rich magmas is Monte Vulture. During the Messinian salinity crisis evaporites, containing anhydrite and dolomite, were deposited on the Adriatic plate. This plate has since then been subducted underneath Italy. Slab detachment has occurred in the area, and the inflow of asthenospheric mantle has increased the temperatures to accommodate melting of the subducted evaporites. The involvement of the Messinian evaporites in the metasomatising agent of the mantle source beneath Monte Vulture could explain the high sulphur content, high  34 S value and high CO 2 content of the Vulture magmas. The findings in this thesis support that hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} more fully the surface charge characteristics of the end-member smectite in illite-smectite (I-S) mixed-layer phases found previously in <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> of the Molasse Basin in Austria. The smectite nd member was shown to have an unusually high interlayer charge (0. 58). Based on earlier work on pure smectites, it was hypothesized that this high charge represents the mean of a mixture of a higher- and lower-charged smectite component intermixed with illite. To test this hypothesis, the magnitude of the interlayer charge of the smectites was evaluated using 2 different methods: alkylammonium ion orientation and K-fixation by wetting and drying. Using 2 I-S samples of different I-S ratios, saturated with alkyammonium ions of chain lengths n c = 5 - 18, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) could be interpreted as representing a 3 -component system, con-sisting of randomly interlayered high- and low-charged smectite and illite. K-fixation, carried out by K-treatment and followed by 100 wetting and drying (WD) cycles, confirmed the presence of a high-charged smectite component admixed with low-charged smectite, both interlayered with illite. The wetting and drying of the K-treated samples led to interlayer collapse of the high-charged smectite component and to the production of illite layers stable against exchange with 0. 1 N SrC 12. The 2 smectites occur in the ratio of about 1 : 1 and consist of 1 phase with an interlayer charge of about 0. 76 and another phase with a normal charge of about 0. 40. During diagenesis, the 2 kinds of smectite are altering simultaneously to the same end-member illite along 2 different reaction paths...|$|R

Regional metamorphic rocks also occur, but they are restricted to {{the northern part of}} the area (Cinqueta de la Pez unit). The following lithostratigraphic units were distinguished in the preHercynian sedimentary rocks : The Cinqueta de la Pez complex, consisting of regional-metamorphic sandy and <b>pelitic</b> <b>sediments</b> which are generally attributed to the CambroOrdovician. The Vilados Formation, constituted by slates, hornfelses and quartzites, which represent the non- or thermally metamorphosed equivalent of the Cinqueta de la Pez complex. The Madera Formation consists of black coal-bearing shales with some dark limestones at the top. This unit is attributed to the Gotlandian and probably ranges into the Lower Devonian (Lower Gedinnian). It is overlain by an alternation of limestones and slates in which four formations are distinguished The Puyaresto Formation (an alternation of marly limestone and sandy slate). the Ardana Formation (massive limestones), the Sein Formation (sandy slates with a few marly limestones in the upper part) and the Barbarisa Formation (calc-schists, marly limestones and thin layers of sandy slate). This sequence probably ranges in age from the Lower Gedinnian into the Eifelian (Lower Devonian and lower Middle Devonian).

40|$|The Central Mediterranean {{region is}} one of the most {{important}} areas on Earth for studying subduction-related potassic and ultrapotassic magmatism, derived from partial melting of the metasomatised lithospheric mantle wedge. In this region, leucite-free (i. e., lamproite) and leucite-bearing (i. e., kamafugite, leucitite, and plagioleucitite) ultrapotassic rocks closely occur, in a time-related progression, linked to the evolution of both the mantle source and the regional tectonic regime. Time- and space-related magmatism migration followed the roll-back of the subducting slab and the anticlockwise drift of the Italian Peninsula. Leucite-free silica-rich lamproites are restricted to the early stage of magmatism and are associated with ultrapotassic shoshonites and high-K calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. Leucite-bearing (i. e., Roman Province) rocks are erupted consistently later than lamproite-like and associated shoshonitic rocks, with post-leucititic volcanism occurring in the late stage of volcanic activity with eruption of alkali-basaltic to latitic and trachytic rocks, often after major caldera-forming events. Present-day ultrapotassic volcanism is restricted to the Neapolitan area. Central Mediterranean potassic and ultrapotassic rocks are extremely enriched in incompatible trace elements with variable fractionation of Ta, Nb, and Ti in comparison to Th and large ion lithophile elements (LILE). They are also variably enriched in radiogenic Sr and Pb and unradiogenic Nd. The main geochemical and isotopic signatures are consistent with sediment recycling within the mantle wedge via subduction.
