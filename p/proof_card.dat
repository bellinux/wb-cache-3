50|$|Eight {{values were}} issued for the medium and high values {{featuring}} Malaysian birds. The values were 25 cents, 30 cents, 50 cents, 75 cents, $1, $2, $5 and $10 and were {{intended for use}} in any Malaysian State. As with the low values, they were printed in two panes of 100, 10 x 10 with cylinder numbers 1A and 1B for {{the left and right}} pane, watermarked 'Multiple PTM upright' perforated 14 1/2.Various proofs exist showing the individual colours and combined up to full colour proofs. In addition, each value was produced on Harrison <b>proof</b> <b>cards</b> in full colour.As with the low values, missing colours can be found on a few values and inverted watermarks on the 25 cents, 30 cents, 50 cents, $1, $2 and $5 values.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sheet stamps, two values, 10 cents and 15 cents, were produced as coil stamps {{for use in}} vending machines in several locations throughout Malaysia. The designs were similar to the state values, but produced with 'Malaysia' {{in place of a}} state name as they were for use in any state. These coils were printed by Harrison & Sons in photogravure. From the start, the coil stamp machines proved to be inefficient at dispensing the correct values for the money tendered, possibly due to humidity affecting the stamps. Due to these problems, the machines were dispensed with quite soon after they commenced their duty. As a result, commercially used examples of both values are scarce. During 2006 a variant of the gum was identified. It is brown, with a clear 'ribbing' effect. This may have been a trial to overcome some of the problems with the machines, the ribbing possibly helping to prevent curling of the individual stamps. Harrison <b>Proof</b> <b>Cards</b> exist for both values with an imperforate stamp in full colour on each.|$|R

He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|R

All these requirements fulfilled by biometric identification system. Biometrics employs physiological or behavioral characteristics to accurately identify each subject; commonly used biometric features include face, fingerprints, iris, hand geometry etc. But most reliable biometrics is the iris recognition because the richness and apparent stability of iris texture makes it robust biometric trait for personal authentication.

50|$|There is {{debate in}} these {{countries}} about whether such cards and their centralised database would constitute an infringement of privacy and civil liberties. Most criticism is directed towards the enhanced possibilities of extensive abuse of centralised and comprehensive databases storing sensitive data. A 2006 survey of UK Open University students concluded that the planned compulsory identity card under the Identity Cards Act 2006 coupled with a central government database generated the most negative attitudinal response among several alternative configurations. None of the countries listed above mandate possession of identity documents, but they have de facto equivalents since these countries still require proof of identity in many situations. For example, all vehicle drivers must have a driving licence, and young people may need to use specially issued <b>proof</b> of age <b>cards</b> when purchasing alcohol. In addition, and uniquely amongst native English speaking countries without ID cards, the USA require all its male residents {{between the ages of}} 18 and 25, including foreigners, to register for military conscription.|$|R
5000|$|Peggy {{works in}} a high {{security}} building that she accesses using a smart card in her purse. When she approaches {{the door of the}} building, the building detects the presence of a smart card and initiates an exchange of messages that constitute a zero-knowledge password <b>proof</b> that the <b>card</b> is Peggy's. The building then allows Peggy to enter. Mallory wants to break into the building. Mallory approaches the building with a device that simulates a smart card, and the building responds by initiating the exchange of messages. Mallory forwards the message to her accomplice Evelyn who is tailing Peggy as she runs errands in another part of town. Evelyn relays the message to Peggy's smart card, listens for the answer, and forwards the answer to Mallory, who relays it to the building. Continuing in this way, Mallory and Evelyn relay messages between the building and Peggy's smart card until the building is satisfied that it is communicating with Peggy's smart card. The building opens and Mallory enters.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two fare-collection entrances, one {{leading to a}} low {{platform}} station {{for use by the}} light rail Green and Blue Lines, and one leading to a high platform station for the heavy rail Red Line. Both entrances open from a lobby located on the lowest level of the Tower City shopping mall, and this lobby is accessible by escalators and elevators from the other levels of the mall. Each entrance has multiple fare gates along with two operator booths. The entrance for the Green and Blue Lines collects fares from passengers entering and leaving the station, since westbound passengers pay their fare upon leaving. The Red Line entrance collects fares from passengers entering the station and also requires arriving passengers to swipe their <b>proof</b> of payment <b>card</b> at the gate in order to exit the station. To transfer from the Red Line to the Green or Blue Lines, or vice versa, passengers must exit through the fare gates at one station entrance and enter through the other station entrance. The high and low platform portions of the station can also be reached from each other without going through the lobby by an access passageway located {{on each side of the}} lobby along the tracks; however, with the implementation of the proof of payment system on the Red Line, the passageway has been closed.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning around 1915 {{with the}} rise of the Agricultural Workers Organization, the field delegates for the IWW used {{itinerant}} workers' means of transportation, illegally hopping freight trains, to grow to their ranks. Delegates rode trains and demanded to see a Red <b>Card,</b> <b>proof</b> of membership in the IWW, from each hobo bound for the harvests. If a rider could not produce a card, he or she either had to purchase one from the delegate or get off the train. IWW organizer Harry Howard describes an instance of this in a 1916 letter to Solidarity, the union's national newspaper, writing, [...] "We left on the night of August 10th with twenty-five or thirty other fellow workers. We took charge of the train and ditched all unorganized men at stops north of Fargo." [...] In 1922, the U.S. Marshal to the Western District of Washington collected 19 affidavits from freight train riders in that state who admit seeing this practice. One reads, [...] "The IWW tried to make me take out a card in North Dakota but I refused. When in the State of Washington… I was forced to take out a card or be thrown off in a desolate country." [...] This tactic lost effectiveness as the automobile supplanted the freight train as the most popular form of transportation for itinerant laborers in the mid- to late-1920s.|$|R

According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his <b>proof</b> of insurance <b>card,</b> which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, 'OK', and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, 'Okay, don't reach for it, then.' Castile responded, 'I'm not pulling it out,' and Reynolds also said, 'He's not pulling it out.' Yanez screamed, 'Don't pull it out!' Yanez quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand while he reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. Reynolds yelled, 'You just killed my boyfriend!' Castile moaned and said, 'I wasn't reaching for it.' Reynolds loudly said, 'He wasn't reaching for it.' Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, 'Don't pull it out!' Reynolds responded, 'He wasn't.' Yanez yelled, 'Don't move! Fuck!' Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|R
