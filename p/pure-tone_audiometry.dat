50|$|Hearing loss is {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. <b>Pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of hearing loss in each ear.

Mild hearing loss is thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate hearing loss is thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe hearing loss is thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound hearing loss thresholds are greater than 85 dB.|$|E
5000|$|Speech {{audiometry}} is {{a diagnostic}} hearing test designed to test word or speech recognition. It {{has become a}} fundamental tool in hearing-loss assessment. In conjunction with <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry,</b> it can aid in determining the degree and type of hearing loss. Speech audiometry also provides information regarding discomfort or tolerance to speech stimuli and information on word recognition abilities. In addition, information gained by speech audiometry can help determine proper gain and maximum output of hearing aids and other amplifying devices for patients with significant hearing losses and help assess how well they hear in noise. Speech audiometry also facilitates audiological rehabilitation management.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} whether call center dispatchers wearing headsets {{are subject to}} auditory fatigue {{at the end of}} a work shift. Material and Methods Data was gathered at times when call centers were busiest. All call operators wore a headset for up to 12 h. Acoustic environment and noise exposure under the headset were continuously recorded during the entire work shift. Variations in auditory parameters were assessed using <b>pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> and an objective test based on distortion product otoacoustic emissions – contralateral suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes (EchoScan test). Thirty-nine operators and 16 controls, all volunteers, were selected from 3 call centers (sales, assistance, and emergency) where all cognitive tasks were accomplished by phone and on computers. Results No acoustic shock was detected during the investigation. The highest normalized noise exposure (daily noise exposure level – L EX, 8 h) measured was 75. 5 dBA. No significant variation in auditory performances was detected with either <b>pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> or the EchoScan test. Nevertheless, dispatchers expressed a feeling of tiredness. Conclusions For an equivalent diffuse field noise exposure, the use of a headset does not seem to worsen auditory fatigue for call center operators. The dispatcher’s fatigue was probably due to the duration of the work shift or to the tasks they performed rather than to the noise exposure under a headset.

40|$|Despite the {{different}} epidemiological, neurophysiological and morphological studies {{published in the}} literature, {{it is still not}} known for sure whether there is a relation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and peripheral hearing loss. In this work we conduct an auditory study in patients with AD and in volunteer controls in order to investigate this possible relationship. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample studied consisted of 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (age: 79 Y 6 years) and 14 volunteers (age: 76 Y 5 years) who visited the Clinica Universidad de Navarra. After applying a set of thorough criteria to preclude any previous hearing problems, all the participants underwent a subjective hearing assessment by means of <b>pure-tone</b> threshold <b>audiometry</b> and vocal audiometry and an objective auditory assessment using a tympanometry study, stapedial reflex, otoacoustic emissions and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. For the analysis, patients with AD and controls were paired homogenously by sex and age. RESULTS: The main obstacle hindering the study was to recruit the participants, {{due to the fact that}} they did not see any direct benefit from the study and it demanded an excessive amount of their time. <b>Pure-tone</b> threshold <b>audiometry</b> showed that patients with AD had a pattern of greater hearing loss for acute frequencies, with statistically significant differences. No significant differences were found in the analysis of the rest of the subjective and objective hearing tests.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{sensitive}} audiometric protocol for identifying ototoxicity in children, a retrospective study of 16 children treated with cisplatin and/or carboplatin was performed. Audiometric testing was done by means of <b>pure-tone</b> threshold <b>audiometry</b> (PTA), high-frequency audiometry (HFA), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Cisplatin caused a sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss in the study group compared to the controls (p < 0. 01). Sixty-six percent of the cisplatin patients had a grade 2 or 3 ototoxicity. However, ototoxicity was {{not found in the}} patients treated with carboplatin. An excellent correlation was found between DPOAE levels and results obtained by audiometry (r = 0. 82). Patients exposed to cisplatin are at significant risk for the development of drug-induced sensorineural hearing loss. Because of the several advantages of DPOAEs (noninvasive, objective, rapid, easy to use, sensitive) this method should be added in the audiological follow-up in infants and toddlers...|$|R
50|$|Fixation of the stapes {{within the}} oval window causes a {{conductive}} hearing loss. In <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry,</b> this manifests as air-bone gaps on the audiogram (i.e. {{a difference of}} more than 10 dB between the air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds at a given test frequency). However, medial fixation of the ossicular chain impairs both the inertial and osseotympanic modes of bone conduction, increasing the bone-conduction thresholds between 500 Hz and 4 kHz, and reducing the size of air-bone gaps. As 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the ossicular chain, the largest increase in bone-conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency - the resultant notch is called Carhart's notch and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.|$|E
5000|$|Considerations when {{determining}} {{an effective}} school-based screening protocol {{in developing countries}} includes hearing loss criteria, screening tools, and an appropriate referral pathway. In regards to the pass/fail criteria for hearing screenings, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) guidelines use a >20 dB HL cut-off intensity (Roush, 1990) {{though there is a}} growing tendency for audiologists in developed countries to use a >15 dB HL criteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) criterion for [...] "priority for hearing aids" [...] in children is an average hearing loss in the 31 to 80 dB HL range in the better ear (WHO, 2004). However, if there is a local capacity to provide appropriate hearing health care, according to McPherson and Olusanya (2008), then this does not preclude screening that also targets milder degrees of hearing loss. Research has shown that even minimal intervention such as preferential seating in the classroom may improve educational outcomes for children with slight and mild hearing loss and unilateral hearing loss (McPherson & Holborow, 1985; Olusanya et al., 2004).The three recommended tests in school-based-screenings for developing countries are otoscopy, <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> screening, and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Otoscopy is useful in the examination of the external ear, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Otoscopic examination is useful in ruling out impacted cerumen. According to Rao et al. (2002), Lyn et al. (1998), and Swart et al. (1995), impacted cerumen {{is one of the most}} common ear diseases and causes of hearing loss, with prevalence rate between 7.4% and 63%. Additionally, otoscopy does not require a great deal of expertise beyond basic training and is useful to refer a child when the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized due to occlusion of the external auditory meatus by cerumen.Pure-tone audiometry screening, in which there is typically no attempt to find threshold, has been found to accurately assess hearing status in children six years and older, when trained health workers in the community of rural Bangladeshi village used a simple condition play response procedure (Berg et al., 2006 [...] ). Recommended test frequencies are 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, at 20 dB HL according to the ASHA (1997) guidelines for screening audiometry. However, 500 Hz has been found to identify the auditory impact of otitis media with effusion in children and should be included at 25 dB HL when permitted by ambient noise levels (WHO, 1997). [...] In regards to equipment, noise-excluding earphones are advisable in order to limit external noise factors. If possible, though costly, an effective way to reduce background noise is through the use of a mobile hearing screening facility. Examples of such a facility include the use of a 4x4 vehicles in the HARK Project of South Africa (Ogilvy & Michelson, 2003). These facilities incorporate a sound-treated environment for hearing screening. Lastly, in order to reduce operator errors, Roeser and Clark (2004) recommend a minimum training program of no less than five days while WHO recommends an initial three-week training program (WHO, 2004) for ‘primary ear health workers.’Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) can be in both newborns and child based hearing screenings. OAEs are an objective tool that can be used to measure the integrity of the outer hair cells in the cochlear; however, test results below 2000 Hz can be adversely affected by high levels of ambient noise in the school environment (Nozza, 2001 [...] ). OAEs can be used in populations where responses to <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> are either unable to be obtained or results are unreliable. OAEs may be particularly useful in the screening of preschool age children.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) before and after shooting and comparison with conventional <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Thirteen young male police officers were exposed to impulse noise from shooting, without using earplugs. Standard <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry,</b> tympanometry, and DPOAEs were performed before exposure and at 1 and 24 h postexposure. DPOAEs were measured as DP-grams. In the 1 -h postexposure testing DPOAE levels were reduced significantly, at all measured frequencies. However, after the final test, DPOAE levels obtained full recovery in most frequencies, with partial recovery in the 5, 000 - 6, 000 Hz frequency range. Parallel changes were observed in <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> and comparison of the two methods showed similar sensitivity. Most ears were affected at the frequency of 4, 000 Hz in <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> and 3, 000 Hz in DPOAE testing. These data suggest that besides behavioral testing, DPOAEs may play a role as a sensitive screening method for monitoring military personnel exposed to noise because it is fast, objective, and easy to perform. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> {{has become}} the {{foundation}} of hearing assessment. The audiometer, {{and in particular the}} earphones used with it, need to be calibrated to ensure measurement traceability. Hearing threshold measurements are then referred to established reference levels to then judge if any hearing loss is present. Ear simulators are used in this process to provide an objective means of determining the sound pressure level presented during a test. At present ISO 389 - 1 requires the IEC reference coupler to be used for the calibration of a limited number of supra aural earphone configurations and the IEC artificial ear to be used for all other types. In this part of a collaborative project with ISVR, this report suggests that the artificial ear be used universally and shows that users of these devices have responded positively to this recommendation. It thus goes on to propose to ISO that the sole use of the artificial ear and its RETSPL values be the basis for a revision of ISO 389 - 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNoise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pervasive}} hazards in the workplace. Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is <b>pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss. Objective: In this study, we assess one-day auditory fatigue using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs). Design: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the LEX, 8 h was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day. Study sample: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study. Results: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth. Conclusion: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program...|$|R

Aim: The main goal {{of this paper was}} to establish the role of <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions in the detection of small temporary auditory changes after exposure to high sound pressure levels. Study Design: a cross-sectional cohort study. Material and Methods: 30 otologically normal subjects aged between 20 and 35 years were submitted to <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> and evoked transiente otoacoustic emissions before and after 5 hours of exposure to high sound pressure levels (betweeen 80 and 90 dB). Results: For <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> the largest changes occurred at high frequencies - from 3 KHz to 8 KHz after exposure. The evoked transient otoacoustic emissions showed reduced reproductibility from 1 KHz to 4 KHz after exposure to noise.

30|$|We {{ensured that}} {{participants}} met specific criteria {{to enter the}} study: they were not on medication, did not report any neurological or psychological problem, and had normal hearing according to the audiological assessment. <b>Pure-tone</b> threshold <b>audiometry</b> was conducted according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) guidelines (ASHA, 1978). Air-conduction thresholds were measured for each ear at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 [*]kHz. The participants with thresholds up to 25 [*]dB in all the given frequencies were considered without hearing loss (Davis & Silverman, 1978). In addition, speech audiometry was conducted to assess speech recognition threshold (SRT) and speech discrimination score (Pereira & Schochat, 1997; Santos & Russo, 1986). An SRT value up to 10 [*]dB above the participant pure-tone threshold was considered within normality.

40|$|<b>Pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> (PTA) is the {{reference}} clinical test used in Europe and the United States {{to measure the}} extent of hearing loss. It is a subjective, behavioral test, which measures thresholds of hearing sensations and perceptions based on patient responses to frequency-specific pure-tone stimuli. PTA can detect hearing problems due to cochlear or retro-cochlear impairment, without identifying {{the source of the}} problem. In contrast, cubic distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) detect inner-ear dysfunctions, particularly those involving the outer hair cells sensitive to noise and ototoxicants. Recently, ototoxicants were shown to have an action on the central nuclei driving the middle-ear acoustic reflex. Therefore, a new device, called EchoScan, was conceived to collect and measure performance both in the middle- and inner-ear. Its originality: the use of a battery of DPOAE measurements associated with contra-lateral acoustic stimulation. Changes in DPOAE amplitude due to ageing and gender were incidentally detected and EchoScan was more sensitive than impedancemetry to detect the stapedial reflex. EchoScan can be used both in clinical investigations and in occupational medicine, especially for the auditory follow-up of people exposed to noise or ototoxic agents. EchoScan could be promising to assess early detection in programs to prevent hearing loss...|$|R

METHODS This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3, 130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. <b>Pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6, 000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods > 5, 000 flight hours and > 10 years of flight service. RESULTS A total of 29. 3 % pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12. 8 % and predominant in the left ear (23. 7 %).

40|$|Objective and {{importance}} The candidacy for cochlear implant {{has changed over}} time and includes people with lesser degrees of hearing loss. Candidacy {{is based on the}} <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> thresholds and aided speech testing. The audiogram does not reflect the actual problems faced by an individual with and without hearing aids. The variability in the actual functional hearing and the pure-tone thresholds makes it difficult for the patients whose audiogram is borderline for cochlear implantation and they are not deriving enough benefit from hearing aids. Case presentation Retrospective report of the audiological findings of two patients whose cochlear implant funding was refused based on their audiogram. In both instances, they were not deriving benefit from hearing aids and the <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> results were just outside the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines at 4 kHz. Conclusions Cochlear implant candidacy should be individually based and needs to take into account other factors such as work, quality of life, and social impact rather than just adhering to the <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> guidelines. These guidelines should not be considered as strict criteria nor used to deny the benefit of a cochlear implant at the earliest possible opportunity. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reinvestigate many of the claims in the {{literature}} about hearing loss in patients with Meniere's disease, We carried this out on a well-defined group of patients under well-controlled circumstances. Thus, we were able to find support for sonic claims and none for many others. As part of a diagnostic protocol, <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> was performed on 111 patients with Meniere's disease according to the 'Definition Meniere Groningen'. This was a prospective clinical cohort study. Affected ears of patients suffering from Meniere's disease show reduced hearing, both in pure-tone and in speech audiometry. A classification method was devised to determine audiogram shape in an objective manner. The results of this method indicate that affected ears more frequently show 'low' or 'low + high' hearing losses (P= 0. 006). The shape of the hearing loss does not depend on the duration of the affection of the disease. In combination with the fact that the average hearing loss does not correlate with the duration of the disease, this leads to the conclusion that, if a classification of the hearing loss in Menieres disease is possible, such a classification cannot be connected to the duration. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that no relationship is found between the duration of the disease and the classification of the hearing loss over the 3 months before hospital admission, as given by the patients in a questionnaire. A relationship between the (objective) audiometric data and the (subjective) classification of the hearing loss by the patient seems to be present, but is not very strong. Correlations between <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> are present as in non-Meniere ears (r = 0. 899, P < 0. 001). and no indications are found of reduced speech discrimination relative to the expectation based on pure-tone loss.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To assess prevalence, {{type and}} {{risk factors for}} hearing {{impairment}} in children in Nairobi slum areas. Methods: Cross-sectional clinical study conducted in 2006 with complete clinical otological examination, tympanometry and <b>pure-tone</b> air-conduction <b>audiometry</b> assessment in children from four slum areas south east of Nairobi. Results: Children between three and 15 years were included (N= 152). Uni- or bilateral hearing loss above 25 dB HL was found in 21 % (n= 32) of the children; 8 % (n= 12) conductive and 13 % (n= 20) sensorineural. Bilateral hearing loss grade I or II was found in 8 %(n= 12). Earlier ear pain and ear discharge were reported by 11 of 12 children with conductive hearing loss. Prior to investigation 28 % (n= 43) had impacted cerumen. Positive and negative predictive value of subjective feeling of hearing loss was 56 % and 89 % when pure-tone air-conduction threshold of 26 dB HL was the gold standard. Corresponding values for ear discharge to differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss was 73 % and 94 %. Two children had atticus retraction, three ear drum perforation and nine children no tympanic mobility. In 75 % (n= 15) of the children with sensorineural hearing loss, high frequency pure-tone air-conduction threshold was above 25 dB HL at 8000 Hz. Hearing loss was significantly more common in slum areas with the best living conditions compared to lower living conditions, ORadj = 12. 0 (95 % confidence interval 3. 8 to 37. 7). The bivariate tendency that female gender and earlier hospitalization were risk factors for hearing loss did not remain significant after adjustment. Conclusion: Hearing impairment, middle ear pathology and impacted cerumen was common in the Nairobi slum. The association between better living conditions and hearing loss {{may be due to}} ototoxic drugs or family clustering of sensorineural hearing loss...|$|R

Preoperative and postoperative aided and unaided <b>pure-tone</b> and free-field <b>audiometry</b> and Freiburg monosyllabic word test {{were used to assess}} hearing outcome. Results: Functional hearing gain obtained in patients with mixed and conductive hearing loss who underwent modified coupling was 39 dB. Patients with pure sensorineural hearing loss who received conventional incus coupling showed a func-tional hearing gain of 25 dB. Average functional gain was 41 dB in the oval window group, 45 dB in the round window group, and 30 dB in the promontory fenestration window group.

40|$|AbstractAuditory {{neuropathy}} spectrum disorder (ANSD) {{is characterized}} by impairment of the auditory nerve associated with preservation of outer hair cell function. ObjectiveTo establish the prevalence of ANSD in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). MethodThis retrospective study was carried out between 2010 and 2012 and included the charts of 2, 292 individuals with SNHL. Data from otolaryngological and audiological examinations based on <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry,</b> impedance tests, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were collected. Inclusion criteria: presence of OAEs and/or cochlear microphonic (CM); absent or altered BAEPs, and normal MRI scans of the brain. ResultsTwenty-seven (1. 2 %) of the 2, 292 subjects with SNHL had ANSD (37 % males; 63 % females). Mild SNHL was seen in 29. 6 % of the individuals with ANSD; 55. 5 % had moderate SNHL; 7. 4 % had severe SNHL; and 7. 5 % had profound SNHL. In terms of age, 14. 8 % were aged between zero and 20 years, 44. 1 % were 41 to 60 years old, and 7. 4 % were above the age of 60. ConclusionANSD was seen in 1. 2 % of the individuals with SNHL included in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hyperacusis {{is mainly}} a {{consequence}} of the noise level in the twenty-first century, owing to dramatic changes in people's lifestyles. Of every 100 people with otological com-plaints (e. g., tinnitus and hyperacusis), 20 are affected by hyperacusis. Because of its high incidence, this symptom has long been the subject of investigation. Nine patients (eight female, one male) with sensorineural tinnitus voluntarily participated in this study. Among the evaluated patients, three were between 25 and 40 years of age and six were between 41 and 60 years. The patients did not report a history of acoustic trauma, use of drugs, or otological diseases. The duration of complaints at the time the study began varied from 3 months to 8 years. The patients answered a questionnaire, submitted to an ear, nose, and throat examination, and were evaluated by <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> and oto-acoustic emissions and laboratory tests. In all patients, ear, nose, and throat assessments and audiological tests were within the normal ranges. Of the nine subjects in our study, 100 % had tinnitus, and 89 % (n = 8) had hyperacusis as an associated symptom. Six subjects (67 %) had severe tinnitus; among them, four had moder-ate hyperacusis, one had severe hyperacusis, and one was not affected by hyperacusis. In tw...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} compare the distortion-product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) with the <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> and to analyze the changes in participants exposed to noise. The results show a prevalence of participants with impaired DPOAEs higher than the prevalence of participants with impaired audiometries in the total sample, in men, and in outdoor workers and a prevalence of impaired DPOAEs and of impaired audiometries in men higher than in women and in outdoor workers higher than in indoor workers. The comparison of mean values between outdoor and indoor workers shows a significant difference only on some frequencies, in the DP-gram. The results suggest a higher effectiveness of DPOAEs compared with the <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> in identifying the presence of any damage in individuals exposed to noise at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} audiologic side effects {{highlights}} the reduced {{trauma of the}} piezoelectric cut, demonstrates {{the superiority of the}} Piezosurgery device in terms of safety and protection of anatomical structures and confirms its applicability in all the otologic techniques tested. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the effect of Piezosurgery on the cochlea and in particular on the cochlear outer hair cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 60 patients with a history of otologic surgery with Piezosurgery. Before and 6 months after surgery, all the patients underwent the following instrumental examinations: <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry,</b> tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). RESULTS: Piezosurgery showed its safety on the inner ear and in particular on the cochlear outer hair cells: for each instrumental examination (<b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry,</b> tympanometry, TEOAE, DPOAEs and ABR), no patients presented postoperative worsenin...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the validity of}} three single questions used to assess self-reported hearing loss as compared to <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> in an adult population. METHODS: A validity study was performed with a random sub-sample of 188 subjects aged 30 to 65 years, drawn from the fourth wave of a population-based cohort study carried out in Salvador, Northeastern Brazil. Data were collected in household visits using questionnaires. Three questions were used to separately assess self-reported hearing loss: Q 1, "Do you feel you have a hearing loss?"; Q 2, "In general, would you say your hearing is 'excellent,' 'very good,' 'good,' 'fair,' 'poor'?"; Q 3, "Currently, {{do you think you}} can hear 'the same as before', 'less than before only in the right ear', 'less than before only in the left ear', 'less than before in both ears'?". Measures of accuracy were estimated through seven measures including Youden index. Responses to each question were compared to the results of <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> to estimate accuracy measures. RESULTS: The estimated sensitivity and specificity were 79. 6 %, 77. 4 % for Q 1; 66. 9 %, 85. 1 % for Q 2; and 81. 5 %, 76. 4 % for Q 3, respectively. The Youden index ranged from 51. 9 % (Q 2) to 57. 0 % (Q 1) and 57. 9 % (Q 3). CONCLUSIONS: Each of all three questions provides responses accurate enough to support their use to assess self-reported hearing loss in epidemiological studies with adult populations when <b>pure-tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> is not feasible...|$|E
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study aimed {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of the Esteem ® middle ear implant in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of different degree as well as to compare it with that obtained with conventional hearing aids. Fifteen out of 30 adults patients who received an Esteem ® middle ear device for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss met the primary eligibility criterion of prior, continuous use of conventional hearing aids. Study population included moderate-to-severe SNHL (8 patients) and severe-to-profound SNHL (7 patients). Audiometric measurements included free-field <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> in Esteem ®-aided, HA-aided, and baseline threshold. For speech audiometry, speech reception threshold (SRT) and word recognition score (WRS) were assessed. Subjective benefit was evaluated by Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire. In all the subjects, SRT and WRS showed improvement both with conventional HA and Esteem® in respect to the unaided situation. Although not statistically significant, a slight prevalence of the Esteem® performances was recorded both audiometrically and as subjective satisfaction score. The Esteem® middle ear device demonstrated appreciable benefit for rehabilitation of SNHL of different degree, comparable to what can be achieved by conventional hearing aids. In addition, this rehabilitative process may enable also individuals presenting with severe-to-profound SNHL to achieve remarkable functional outcomes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{long-term}} benefit of ultra-high-frequency masking with the UltraQuiet device. A commercial product, UltraQuiet provides {{a new form of}} high-fre-quency bone conduction therapy. To assess its effectiveness in tinnitus treatment, we selected 15 patients with problematic tinnitus and randomly assigned them to three variations of the medical-audiological tinnitus patient protocol modified for the UltraQuiet study. We assessed tinnitus relief by questionnaires directed at weighing patient response to overall effectiveness, tinnitus loudness, tinnitus severity, and tinnitus annoyance. Additionally, we performed audi-ological measures (including <b>pure-tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry,</b> minimal masking levels, pitch and loudness matching, and residual inhibition). All patients showed some long-term gains, and most exhibited relief in at least one measurement parameter, providing support for the use of high-frequency vibration in the treatment of tinnitus. Key Words: high-frequency bone conduction; minimal masking levels; positron emission tomography; tinnitus questionnaires; ultra-high frequency his study {{reports on the}} long-term benefit of ultra-high-frequency masking with the Ultra-Quiet (UQ) device. Most nonpulsatile tinnitus is characterized as high-pitched. Logically, high-frequency masking should provide effective relief in persons with severe problematic tinnitus. However, such an assump-tion is valid for only perhaps one-third of tinnitus pa-tients; one possible explanation for the lack of masking in the majority of tinnitus cases is the unavailability of very high-frequency masking energy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The Occupational Earcheck (OEC) is {{an online}} {{internet}} test to detect high-frequency hearing {{loss for the}} purposes of occupational hearing screening. In this study, we evaluated the OEC in an occupational setting in order to assess test sensitivity, specificity, and validity. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015, in which the optimized OEC was evaluated on 94 employees from the army and three different companies in construction and manufacturing. Subjects underwent OEC in an office-like room. <b>Pure-tone</b> air conduction <b>audiometry</b> was performed as a reference test. The OEC was repeated for a subset of subjects (N= 19). Important test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity, test validity, and test-retest reliability) were assessed. Results When analyzed on the individual level, the sensitivity and specificity of OEC were 90 % and 77 %, respectively. The speech reception threshold results correlated strongly with the pure-tone average of the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, reflecting good test validity (r= 0. 79). The difference between test and retest was not significant. The intra-class correlation coefficient was moderate (r= 0. 57), indicating a reasonable agreement between test and retest. Conclusions The OEC appears to be a suitable test for the detection of high-frequency hearing loss among noise-exposed employees, with good sensitivity and specificity values, even when performed in a semi-controlled occupational setting, though a possible learning effect should be taken into accoun...|$|R
