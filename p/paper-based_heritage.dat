In particular, the following contrast speaksfor itself: 1. All the books ever written represent 50 billion bytes. 2. The information produced in 2006 represents 150 quintillion (150 x 1018) bytes. That is to say, during 2006 alone, the world produced three milliontimes the informational content of all the books ever written. 3. Things continue in this way at high speed: the only internet track of May 2009 has generated 500 billion bytes. Thus, our <b>paper-based</b> <b>heritage</b> is already a tiny fraction of what the human race has produced and this fraction decreases, relatively, every day. Viewingthese data, the conception of a digitization enterprise should be thought of and considered by humanists as enlarged. The narrow acceptance of theproject – the view that it is merely a technical process of converting our paper-borne heritage into electronic form – is dramatically insufficient. Toparaphrase Clemenceau’s famous words about war and militaries, digitization may be too serious a thing to be left to the digitizers alone. Scholarsmust face the issue and understand it {{as one of the most}} important problems they have to deal with and, as I will argue, as a real opportunity to renewtheir practices and disciplines...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{degradation}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} mechanisms of paper decay resulting in physical and chemical changes. As such, it is of major concern for the preservation of our <b>paper-based</b> <b>heritage.</b> Although it is known that the rate of oxidation is slowed under anoxic environments, these conditions are expensive to achieve and maintain for whole collections. This research, in collaboration with the British Library, has evaluated the effect of various reduced-oxygen atmospheres (1 - 20 %) on the kinetics of oxidative degradation, and has shown that significant rate reductions can be achieved. Oxidative reactions in artificially aged paper have been remotely monitored under a range of environments using transition metal redox reactions as colorimetric indicators. Samples of Iron (III) chloride-doped Whatman paper were heat-sealed in food-grade barrier film bags, with VOC absorbent carbon cloths added. The package was flushed with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen (1 - 20 % oxygen) and exposed to accelerated ageing conditions for up to 105 days. The colorimetric change was measured through the barrier film and monitored every 100 h (approx.). As part of the design of their new high density storage facility, the British Library has utilised OxyReduct® technology - a reduced oxygen fire-suppression system (14. 8 % oxygen). The research has shown that even at these oxygen concentrations, the rate of paper degradation is significantly reduced. These results have implications for future design of large-scale storage for paper-based collections, indicating that fire-suppressant technologies like OxyReduct® may also be used as a preventative tool...|$|E
40|$|The ageing {{of paper}} and {{cellulose}} has been studied for about the last hundred years. This {{is not only to}} understand the mechanisms behind the degradation, but also to develop methods for stopping or slowing it down, in order to save <b>paper-based</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> world-wide. Four large scale research programmes have provided input of new initiatives: The Swedish Research Programme on Paper Conservation (FoU Projektet fõr Papperkonservering), the Dutch programme on the effects of air pollutants (ACBAM), the European Project on the effects of pollutants on the accelerated ageing of paper (EU-STEP), and the ASTM programme on the ageing of printing and writing paper. Research related to paper ageing often leads to establishing new preservation activities. It also stimulates development and application of new analytical tools...|$|R
40|$|<b>Paper-based</b> {{cultural}} <b>heritage</b> {{objects are}} subject to natural deterioration due to internal and external factors, that is, the presence of heavy metals, incorrect conservation, humidity, exposure of the artifacts to pollutants, light, and high temperatures. To contrast the decay of the original objects, {{it is necessary to}} study and apply innovative specific techniques, set up novel preservation methodologies, and implement or synthesize new products. As the nanomaterial science field developed over the last decades, the usage of nanomaterials in cultural heritage gained a prominent role. Such an excitement for the novel materials opened the path for an uncontrolled transfer of nanoparticles developed for different applications to paper restoration, neglecting all their possible interactions with the support or the graphic media. The aim of this work was to synthesize new nanomaterials expressly conceived for the treatment of library materials. To evaluate their possible insertion in the official conservation treatments that are subjected to validation by Istituto Centrale Restauro e Conservazione Patrimonio Archivistico e Librario, the new nanomaterials were tested both on laboratory paper samples and on original documents. This work presents the results of these studies (some of which still preliminary) stressing the positive and extremely promising outcomes of this research...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims {{to study}} the role of network into open {{innovation}} route, viewed as key strategic trend. The description of a “thematic network”, formed by a partnership involved in a cultural heritage exploitation project, identifies those integration competencies {{that need to be}} generated and/or expanded in the main activities (diagnosis, conservation, storage, fruition). Their knowledge and development can help to prescribe appropriate behaviours to each network’s actor. They often encourage their partners through information exchanges and the dissemination of best practices, since the boundaries between them are porous. Briefly, this study shows that network-based approach is evolving toward a new physiognomy that gives value to open innovation model. With regard to the empirical check, it studied a thematic network, so called MIP (Transitional Metals in Paper). It dealt with the exchange of knowledge in the fields of development of technologies and solutions assessment for preservation of the European <b>paper-based</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> that is affected with corrosion caused by transitional metals. The empirical evidence involved board of network’s participants through semi-structured interviews conducted with project’s participants, who possess detailed knowledge on the development of preservation method and the new competencies. So, activities, roles, resources and configuration selected are identified and reviewed. The interaction between autonomous subjects exalts the innovative capacity and the ability to use and to diffuse accumulated competence. It allows a jointed growth of the complementary resources necessary to a whole network value systems viewed as a temporary association of firms to develop, test, deliver solutions/applications. Thus, to develop innovative knowledge/competence, they must identify external sources of distinctive resources. In coherence to the above, “thematic network” may be effectively expressed with the metaphor of complex network, where the potential energy generated by different sources must be put in circle and addressed towards specific solutions/applications. The value produced by the “thematic networks” depends on the integration of the individual competencies rather than on the management of every single organization. In fact, each one of actors analysed to forge new alliances and to respond more efficiently to market changes, interacts with various third parties during the innovation process to create a circuit of knowledge and trust resource. Therefore, lessons learned by open innovation route is that approaching a problem from "outside of own black box" will yield creative platform/architecture as there is a large source of untapped competencies globally available...|$|R
30|$|Within Europe, {{research}} {{on the effects of}} air pollutants on the degradation of organic materials constituting cultural heritage has been carried out for decades in specialized museums, universities, research institutes and by environmental agencies, which managed to establish several collaboration projects at the European level. Within the EU Third Framework Programme (FP 3) (1990) two research projects initiated the field on interactions of air pollutants and organic cultural heritage; namely the EU STEP “Leather project” and the STEP “Paper project” [56]. In 1996, within FP 4, the second EU project on leather deterioration was completed. Other EU projects relating to the subject “indoor air pollution monitoring and chemical interactions” are the following: IDAP, AER, IMPACT, LIDO, MIMIC, MASTER, MIP, ERA, SENSORGAN, PAPYLUM, SURVENIR, INKCOR, PAPERTREAT, PARELA, CARAMEL, MULTIENCODE, VIDRIO, MODHT, PROPAINT, and MEMORI [57]. As already mentioned, IDAP [25] has been dedicated to damage assessment of parchment (damage due to environment). The IDAP project, Improved Damage Assessment of Parchment 2002 - 2005, was funded by the EC under the fifth framework program: Energy, environment and sustainable development (EESD). AER, [58] has been concerned with the assessment of indoor air quality at museums in order to discover the impact of the building and artificial air-control {{on the quality of the}} collection. IMPACT, LIDO, MIMIC and MASTER developed forecasting models, advanced sensor technology and prototypes using for instance lasers to monitor the indoor impact on cultural objects of pollution, exposure to light or fluctuations in humidity and temperature caused by human presence in particular. The IMPACT-project, aimed to develop models of the behavior of pollution such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone, [59] on museum and building materials. Both MIMIC and MASTER were related to dosimeters for the assessment of the museum environment. The LiDo-project, focused in the impact of light on artworks. Within the EU network MIP Working Group 4 is dedicated to preventive conservation. The problem to be solved by the network is to respond collectively to specific threats to the European <b>paper-based</b> cultural <b>heritage.</b> These risks include the deterioration, conservation and storage of paper and ligno-cellulosic objects that have been affected by metal-tannin corrosion throughout, many of which are stored in archives, libraries and museums. Furthermore, the ERA project (Environmental Research for Art Conservation) [60] has to be mentioned here. This project was studying the effect of environment (light, thermal and pollution) on the deterioration of physical and chemical conditions of paintings. Also within this project, spectroscopic techniques such as NIR and mass spectrometry were applied to understand the effects of the environment on the deterioration. Because of the extensive number of EU projects, collaborations on an individual basis also exist and networks such as the IAQ-network are operational. Participants in these projects took an active role during the preparation of the COST Action [2]. The CEN TC 346 (Standardization Conservation of Cultural Property) can be seen as the main existing network seeking collaboration with the COST Action. The CEN TC 346 Working Group 4 dealing with standardization of indoor environment is especially interested in gaining knowledge of the chemical interactions between cultural heritage objects and air pollutants. The International Council of Museums and the Committee for Conservation with their working groups on preventive conservation, chemical analyzes and scientific {{research on}} art objects would be interested in establishing a close cooperation with the COST Action.|$|R
