5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any <b>preliminary</b> <b>drawing.</b> Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} is, most likely, partially {{influenced by}} the cartoon (term referring to a two-dimensional <b>preliminary</b> <b>drawing)</b> for Leonardo da Vinci’s The Virgin and Child with St. Anne. Like this earlier 'cartoon', Michelangelo’s figures seem to be compacted into very little pictorial space and a similar bilaterally symmetrical triangular composition is employed. [...] Michelangelo saw the drawing in 1501 while in Florence working on the David.|$|E

2500|$|Efi Foundoulaki {{insists on}} the [...] "activity of the {{triangle}} Picasso-Cézanne-El Greco, which is established in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon". Foundoulaki analyzes the Opening of the Fifth Seal and states that the clothed figure in the left part of the painting and the naked figures to the right showed the contradiction between profane and divine love. According to Rolf Laesse, {{this may have been}} the original inspiration of Picasso who in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>drawing</b> of the Demoiselles depicted a medical student holding a skull or a book and entering a room where there is a sailor among nude women. Richardson, however, conjectures that Picasso knew the interpretation by Cossio concerning the Opening of the Fifth Seal and based his theory extensively on this conjecture.|$|E
