The values of the resistors are selected such that R1 gives the highest load resistance, R1||R2 gives the nominal load resistance and either R1||R2||R3 or R2||R3 gives the lowest load resistance.

50|$|The voltage-fed {{inverter}} {{features a}} filter capacitor on the input to the inverter {{and a series}} resonant output circuits. The voltage-fed system is extremely popular {{and can be used}} with either SCRs up to frequencies of 10 kHz, IGBTs to 100 kHz and MOSFETs up to 3 MHz.
