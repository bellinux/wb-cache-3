5|$|Snow {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of a coloration or {{pattern for}} effective camouflage in winter, often combined with a different summer camouflage. Summer <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> typically disruptively patterned combinations of shades of browns and greys, up to black, while winter <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> dominated by white to match snowy landscapes.|$|E

These <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571–1596, but in few other places.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} method {{used in this}} study is descriptive quantitative with cost calculation pattern method that include incremental costs like the cost of labor turnover, cost savings, overtime costs, and subcontrack costs for each product like bricks, culverts, and hexagon pavingblocks. The study found that total cost to produced bricks paving using using moderat production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 338. 000, total cost using wavy <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 242. 000, and constant <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp 30. 400.

Total cost to produced hexagon pavingblocks using moderat production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 730. 000, total cost using wavy production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 450. 000, and total cost using constant <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 125. 000.

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E

Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at Qazvin, Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> rare in Turkey.|$|E

MethodsThis was a multicenter cross-sectional study in which children of both sexes, aged 1 – 6 years, attending private and public daycare centers and preschools in Brazil, were evaluated (n= 2979). Demographic, socioeconomic and dietary data (weighed food records and estimated food records) <b>were</b> collected. Dietary <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> derived by factor analysis from 36 food groups. ResultsFour dietary <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> identified inside school, and three outside. Inside school, the “traditional” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated to low income and presented high nutritional quality. The “dual” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with low income and with high intake of added sugar and glycemic load. The “snack” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with children enrolled at private schools and with high intake of added sugar and glycemic load. The “bread and butter” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with high intake of added sugar and trans fat. Outside school, the “traditional” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with high intake of saturated fat, trans fats, sodium, and total fiber. The “bread and butter” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with high intake of trans fats and glycemic load, whereas the “snack” <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> associated with overweight, private schools, high income, and high intake of trans fats, sodium, and total fiber.

For example, a row of isosceles triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head. However, pasung and dhlorong are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as buketan (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.|$|E
