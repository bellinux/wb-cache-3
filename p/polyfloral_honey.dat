40|$|The {{problem of}} {{availability}} of veterinary medicines to treat honeybees is discussed extensively worldwide. An uncontrolled administration of antibiotics {{may lead to}} contamination of beehive products and contributes {{to the problem of}} food safety. In this study, the kinetics of tetracycline (TC) degradation in honey was studied for samples provided by four sideline beekeepers located in the west region of Romania. The samples of honey were stored in the dark at room temperature for 30 days and subsamples were analyzed every 3 days by Elisa method. The results of the study revealed that the level of tetracycline decreases in time for all honey samples. The tetracycline degradation follows a first-order kinetic model with reaction rate constants between 1. 2 • 10 - 3 - 2 • 10 - 3 days- 1. The half-life time of tetracycline in monofloral honeys: acacia and lime was 251 and 232 days respectively. Tetracycline degradation in <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> was accelerated since τ 1 / 2 of TC was 151 days...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} approaches, spectroscopic and electrochemical, {{were applied}} for rough determination of antioxidative potential of honey samples. Honey samples of diverse botanical origin {{were collected in}} different geographical regions in Serbia. Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method. Cyclic voltammograms on a glassy carbon electrode in KCl supporting electrolyte were used to check electrode sensitivity {{to the presence of}} honey. In order to calculate Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of studied honey, cyclic voltammograms were recorded for Trolox standard. The results were expressed as μmol of Trolox Equivalents per kg of sample (μmol TE kg- 1). Good correlations were observed between cyclic voltammetry data and total phenolic content (TPC) determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method and radical scavenging activity (RSA) determined using DPPH•(1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical) test. Cyclic voltammetry appears to be a highly attractive alternative method for rapid estimation of antioxidative potential of honeys. It was found that <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> samples had the highest, whereas acacia honey showed the lowest values of TPC.

25|$|A 2008 Italian study {{determined}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy {{can be used to}} distinguish between different honey types, and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced. Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys</b> by the differing proportions of fructose and sucrose, as well as differing levels of aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. This ability allows greater ease of selecting compatible stocks.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the main}} honey {{producing}} countries require accurate labeling of honey before commercialization, including floral classification. Traditionally, this classification {{is made by}} melissopalynology analysis, an accurate but time-consuming task requiring laborious sample pre-treatment and high-skilled technicians. In this work the potential use of a potentiometric electronic tongue for pollinic assessment is evaluated, using monofloral and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys.</b> The results showed that after splitting honeys according to color (white, amber and dark), the novel methodology enabled quantifying the relative percentage of the main pollens (Castanea sp., Echium sp., Erica sp., Eucaliptus sp., Lavandula sp., Prunus sp., Rubus sp. and Trifolium sp.). Multiple linear regression models were established {{for each type of}} pollen, based on the best sensors sub-sets selected using the simulated annealing algorithm. To minimize the overfitting risk, a repeated K-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented, ensuring that at least 10 - 20 % of the honeys were used for internal validation. With this approach, a minimum average determination coefficient of 0. 91 ± 0. 15 was obtained. Also, the proposed technique enabled the correct classification of 92 % and 100 % of monofloral and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys,</b> respectively. The quite satisfactory performance of the novel procedure for quantifying the relative pollen frequency may envisage its applicability for honey labeling and geographical origin identification. Nevertheless, this approach is not a full alternative to the traditional melissopalynologic analysis; it may be seen as a practical complementary tool for preliminary honey floral classification, leaving only problematic cases for pollinic evaluation. This work was co-financed by FCT/MEC and FEDER under Programme PT 2020 (Project UID/EQU/ 50020 / 2013); and under the strategic funding of UID/BIO/ 04469 / 2013 unit...|$|R
40|$|Studies of unifloral honeys {{are rare}} in Finland, and thus {{there are no}} common traits {{accepted}} for their characterization. In our study lingonberry and mire were characterized. The physico-chemical, organoleptic and melissopalynological properties and phenolic composition of the honeys were analysed and the floral origin of the mire honey was considered. Lingonberry honey is reddish and has a flavour of toffee, whereas mire honey has very strong aroma and reddish colour. Both honeys have high electrical conductivity and pH when compared to Finnish <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys.</b> They are both rich in fructose, {{while the number of}} disaccharides in lingonberry honey is four and in mire honey six. Lingonberry honey has three unifloral specific phenolic compounds. Mire honey has no unifloral-specific phenolic compounds, and its floral origin is not clearly defined...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a remarkably}} precise, simple, and {{objective}} definition of monofloral and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> based on NMR metabolomics is proposed. The spectra of organic extracts of 983 samples of 16 botanical origins {{were used to}} derive oneversus- all OPLS-DA classification models. The predictive components of the statistical models reveal not only the principal but also the secondary floral origins present {{in a sample of}} honey, a novel feature with respect to the methods present in the literature that are able to confirm the authenticity of monofloral honeys but not to characterize a mixture of honey types. This result descends from the peculiar features of the chloroform spectra that show diagnostic resonances for almost each botanical origin, making these NMR spectra suitable fingerprints. The reliability of the method was tested with an additional 120 samples, and the class assignments were compared with those obtained by traditional analysis. The two approaches are in excellent agreement in identifying the floral species present in honeys and in the botanical classification. Therefore, this NMR method may prove to be a valid solution to the huge limitations of traditional classification, which is very demanding and complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the presence of antibiotic residues in honey sold for human consumption. Specific objectives relates to the determination of residues of streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin in 18 samples of different types of honey, such as: acacia honey, linden honey and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey.</b> Honey was purchased from Bacau County, in 2012, from the following localities: Moineşti, Onesti and Bacău. Antibiotic residues were determined with the RIA - Charm II test. The results revealed the existence of streptomycin residues in all samples of analyzed honey, above the permissible limits (40 ppb), except linden honey samples from Bacău. Tetracycline residues were found in all samples, the limits were exceeded only for acacia honey from Moineşti and linden honey from Oneşti. Erythromycin residues have not exceeded the limits admitted to any sample, but they showed great variability. In conclusion, at the county level, all types of honey often contain residues of antibiotics, although European rules on consumer safety forbid adding them for prevention. The danger of toxicity is evidenced by the existence of several types of antibiotics in the same batch of honey, regardless of their concentration, due to their potential synergistic effect...|$|E
40|$|Honey {{quality is}} clearly {{defined in the}} EU Directive 2001 / 110 /EC, and by Codex Alimentarius (Codex Stan 12 - 1981) and the International Honey Commission (IHC, 2002). Our {{investigation}} aimed to characterize the physicochemical properties of honey produced on a small island, Gozo which is situated near Malta.   Ten randomly collected honey samples were analysed for moisture content, pH, free acidity, water insoluble content, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and total phenolic compounds.   Moisture content, pH, free acidity, water insoluble content, and HMF content were within the range specified in standards but the electrical conductivity was generally higher than 0. 800 mS cm - 1. This {{may be the result}} of the relatively high atmospheric and soil salinity on this small island. All the samples analysed were within the 40 mg kg - 1 HMF limit, which is an indicator of honey quality. The total phenolic compounds, which represent some of the constituents derived from the nectar and pollen obtained during foraging, ranged between 236. 555 and 294. 209 GAE kg - 1 honey.

40|$|Melissopalynological {{analysis}} of honey samples from Požega valley {{was used to}} determine the botanical origin of honey. The analysis showed the presence of 34 different pollen types, derived from plant taxa belonging to 18 families. The most represented plant families were Asteraceae (6 taxa), Fabaceae (5 taxa), Rosaceae (4 taxa) and Fagaceae (3 taxa), while the pollen types that appeared in most samples derived from Brassica spp., Robinia pseudoacacia, Prunus spp. and Populus spp. According to pollen spectra, two monofloral brassica honeys, as well as one chestnut and black locust honey, were determined, while other samples were considered as <b>polyfloral.</b> Three <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys</b> had a large portion of Brassica spp. pollen, while two had a high amount of Amorpha fruticosa pollen.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of tracing the botanical and geographical {{origin of products}} such as honey has become more important because of market globalization. As a consequence, numerous analytical methods have been applied to the determination of honey authenticity. The scope of the present work is to chromatographically purify and characterize 23 compounds from organic extracts of unifloral (chestnut, linden, orange, acacia, eucalyptus, honeydew) and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honeys.</b> Of these compounds, 17 were identified as specific markers and were used for botanical discrimination in a previous study based on multivariate statistical analysis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H- 1 NMR) data. Together with the botanical markers, 6 other substances were isolated and characterized using NMR and mass spectrometry. These phytochemicals belong to several classes, that is, terpenes, organic acids, flavonoids, and others. For the first time, a diacylglyceryl ether and 5 other compounds present in different types of honey were identified and characterized...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sources of}} {{micro-organisms}} (yeasts and fungi) found in honey are nectar and pollen, honey processing areas, equipments {{that have not}} been properly cleaned or wrappings. There are few types of yeast in honey and the most common are Saccharomyces melis, which grows in media with water content over 20 - 25 % and Saccharomyces rosei, which can ferment in media with 60 % carbohydrates. Yeasts can produce microbiological faults in honey with more than 10 2 cells /g honey, stored at temperatures over 15 0 C (Şindilar, E., 2000). Fungi can come from dust contamination, from the water with which installations or containers are washed and to a smaller degree, they can come from the honeybees. If they are found in honey in a vegetative state, they can metabolise carbohydrates, amino-acids and even pollen, causing various organoleptic changes (taste and smell of mildew). The present paper is a comparative microbiological and physical-chemical analysis of various types of <b>honey</b> (<b>polyfloral,</b> tilia, acacia, sunflower, and honeydew) collected from beekeepers The results have enabled us to make correlations between moisture, acidity, pH and the microbiological characteristics of the tested honey samples and processors...|$|R
40|$|Total phenol (TPh) and {{flavonoid}} (TFd) contents, antioxidant and sensorial {{properties of}} polyfloral (PH), and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> {{after one year}} of storage (PHs) with dried apricots (20, 30, and 40 %) were evaluated. In comparison to honey, TPh increased 1. 86 times for PH 40. After storage time, TPh of PH 40 s increased slightly lower (1. 77 times), compared to PHs. TFd slightly increased, approximately 3. 23 -fold, from PH to PH 40, while PHs showed increase of 5. 15 -fold for PH 40 s. Antioxidant activity increased with increasing concentration of apricots in honey. EC 50 OH varied from 3. 36 for PH to 2. 29 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 and from 3. 48 for PHs to 2. 68 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 s; EC 50 DPPH ranged from 30. 60 for PH to 14. 95 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 and from 31. 22 for PHs to 17. 43 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 s; RP 0. 5 ranged from 66. 37 for PH to 31. 83 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 and from 67. 99 for PHs to 35. 03 [*]mg/mL for PH 40 s. Statistical analysis suggested that TPh and TFd were associated with antioxidant activity and colour. Sensory parameters, before and after storage, indicated very good sensory qualities. Phenolic composition, antioxidant capacity, and sensory properties were promoted after addition of dried apricots and these parameters stayed improved, since antioxidant compounds present in dried apricots aided in maintenance of honey properties along one year of storage...|$|E
40|$|Honeybee colonies {{offer an}} {{excellent}} environment for microbial pathogen development. The highest virulent, colony killing, bacterial agents are Paenibacillus larvae causing American foulbrood (AFB), and European foulbrood (EFB) associated bacteria. Besides the innate immune defense, honeybees evolved behavioral defenses to combat infections. Foraging of antimicrobial plant compounds {{plays a key}} role for this “social immunity” behavior. Secondary plant metabolites in floral nectar are known for their antimicrobial effects. Yet, these compounds are highly plant specific, and the effects on bee health will depend on the floral origin of the honey produced. As worker bees not only feed themselves, but also the larvae and other colony members, honey is a prime candidate acting as self-medication agent in honeybee colonies to prevent or decrease infections. Here, we test eight AFB and EFB bacterial strains and the growth inhibitory activity of three honey types. Using a high-throughput cell growth assay, we show that all honeys have high growth inhibitory activity and the two monofloral honeys appeared to be strain specific. The specificity of the monofloral honeys and the strong antimicrobial potential of the <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> suggest that the diversity of honeys in the honey stores of a colony may be highly adaptive for its “social immunity” against the highly diverse suite of pathogens encountered in nature. This ecological diversity may therefore operate similar to the well-known effects of host genetic variance in the arms race between host and parasite.

40|$|The major {{compounds}} in honey are carbohydrates such as monosaccharides and disaccharides. The same compounds {{are found in}} cane-sugar concentrates. Unfortunately when sugar concentrate is added to honey, laboratory assessments {{are found to be}} ineffective in detecting this adulteration. Unlike tracing heavy metals in honey, sugar adulterated honey is much trickier and harder to detect, and traditionally it has been very challenging {{to come up with a}} suitable method to prove the presence of adulterants in honey products. This paper proposes a combination of array sensing and multi-modality sensor fusion that can effectively discriminate the samples not only based on the compounds present in the sample but also mimic the way humans perceive flavours and aromas. Conversely, analytical instruments are based on chemical separations which may alter the properties of the volatiles or flavours of a particular honey. The present work is focused on classifying 18 samples of different honeys, sugar syrups and adulterated samples using data fusion of electronic nose (e-nose) and electronic tongue (e-tongue) measurements. Each group of samples was evaluated separately by the e-nose and e-tongue. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were able to separately discriminate monofloral honey from sugar syrup, and <b>polyfloral</b> <b>honey</b> from sugar and adulterated samples using the e-nose and e-tongue. The e-nose was observed to give better separation compared to e-tongue assessment, particularly when LDA was applied. However, when all samples were combined in one classification analysis, neither PCA nor LDA were able to discriminate between honeys of different floral origins, sugar syrup and adulterated samples. By applying a sensor fusion technique, the classification for the 18 different samples was improved. Significant improvement was observed using PCA, while LDA not only improved the discrimination but also gave better classification. An improvement in performance was also observed using a Probabilistic Neural Network classifier when the e-nose and e-tongue data were fused...|$|E

40|$|In Europe {{there is}} an {{increasing}} emphasis on the quality control of honey, especially on maximum limits of veterinary drug residues (particularly antibiotics) permitted in it. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in apiculture to protect bees against a variety of brood diseases. Romanian authorities have included it in the National Monitoring Program for honey manufacturers. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening test was validated as a detection method of streptomycin residues in honey. The ELISA experimental results were compared to those obtained by using an HPLC method. The values generated by the two methods were very close to each other. This fact certifies that ELISA method can be successfully used for quantitative detection {{of the amount of}} streptomycin in honey samples. Following validation, three types of <b>honey</b> (<b>polyfloral,</b> lime and acacia) were analyzed for streptomycin content after exposure to 4, 22, 30, 40 or 70 °C for 20 weeks.
