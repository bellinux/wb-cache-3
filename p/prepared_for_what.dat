5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{was seen as}} an imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{was seen as an}} {{inevitable}} British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|E

Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> the story looked like. Nor do I think her characterization of my interview was fair." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} year of the war, the Allies <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> was {{anticipated}} to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a U.S. conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, which was eight days after Adolf Hitler committed suicide. The Japanese were facing the same fate but refused to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender, and the war in the Pacific Theatre continued. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being [...] "prompt and utter destruction". The Japanese ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.|$|E

500|$|The Third Test was {{abandoned}} without a ball being bowled due to rain, and Hassett <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{would be the}} decisive Fourth Test by scoring 94 and 127 in consecutive matches against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The match at Headingley in Leeds was Australia's only Test victory, which was enough to ensure a drawn series and the retention of The Ashes. In a low-scoring match in a batsman-friendly series, Australia, chasing a target of only 105 runs to win, had slumped to 3/50 when Hassett came to the crease as an approaching storm threatened to either end the game or make the pitch difficult to bat on. Hassett calmly hit 33 runs from 36 balls, to guide the tourists to a five-wicket victory, much to the relief of his captain Don Bradman, who was so nervous about the outcome {{that he could not}} watch the play. The innings earned Hassett a reputation of being calm under pressure, and Bradman later wrote that Hassett was a [...] "masterful player" [...] in a crisis.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 February 1645, Sir John Meldrum {{took the}} town from the Royalists, cutting off any escape routes by land or sea and {{delivering}} the port for Parliament. The same day, Cholmley retreated into the castle {{and refused to}} give in, so the Parliamentarians <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> would be a five-month siege – {{one of the most}} bloody of the Civil War, with almost continuous fighting. The Parliamentary forces set up what was then the largest cannon in the country, the Cannon Royal, in the 12th-century St. Mary's Church below the castle, and proceeded to fire [...] cannonballs that pounded the castle's defences. In turn, the church was extensively damaged over the three days of fighting. The bombardment partially destroyed the castle keep, but the outer walls were not breached. The Parliamentary forces were unable to take the castle and there followed a period of particularly bloody hand-to-hand fighting around the barbican gateway in which Sir John Meldrum was killed.|$|E
