5000|$|Dot gain {{is caused}} by ink {{spreading}} around halftone dots. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As <b>printing</b> <b>pressure</b> can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called [...] "rimming". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing). Finally, halation of the printing film during exposure can contribute to dot gain.|$|E

However, these hydrogel biomaterials were often developed {{to be easily}} pipetted and cast into well plates and other molds. Altering the composition of these hydrogels to permit filament formation is necessary for their translation as bioprintable materials. However, the unique properties of bioinks offer new challenges in characterizing material printability. Unlike traditional 3D printing materials such as thermoplastics that are essentially ‘fixed’ once they are printed, bioinks are a dynamic system due to their high water contains and often non-crystalline structure. The shape fidelity of the bioink after filament deposition must also be characterized. Finally, the <b>printing</b> <b>pressure</b> and nozzle diameter {{must be taken into}} account to minimize the shear stresses placed on the bioink and on any cells within the bioink during the printing process. Too high shear forces may damage or lyse cells, adversely affecting cell viability.|$|E
5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output.

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a process}} that employs a flexible printing form and low viscous ink, often water-based. The flexible printing form is favourable for printing on rough surfaces, but the high surface tension of the ink may cause printability problems. This work has focused on the interaction between paper/paperboard coating and water-based flexographic ink, aimed at increasing the knowledge about the printing process in form of physical/chemical parameters that are important for ink setting. The effects of printing conditions on print quality, such as <b>printing</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature, have also been in focus. The work has shown that fluids of different polarities, i. e. different dipole moments, behave differently when being absorbed by a coating layer. Due to their chemical compatibility to the coating layer, fluids with large dipole moment fill the pore matrix of the coating to a lesser extent but penetrate further into the coating than fluids with small dipole moments. On the other hand, polarity of the coating layer also affects the print. When printing on coatings with different polarities, higher print densities was obtained on the more polar substrates. As a tentative explanation, it is proposed that the ink builds different layer structures during drying depending on the coating polarity. Print gloss is related to the ink setting which, in turn, is affected by the solvent retaining capacity of the ink. Large water holding capacity allows the ink components to smoothen out before the structure is set, resulting in a higher print gloss. The rheology of inks is affected by temperature; at a higher temperature the viscosity is reduced. The reduction in ink viscosity at higher temperature has been shown to affect the print quality, e. g., print density and dot gain. It is suggested that a thicker layer is immobilised during impression due to the lower viscosity and that it is an explanation of the higher print density at a higher printing temperature. The influence of impression pressure on dot gain has been experimentally evaluated and mathematically modelled with good agreement. The dot gain is shown to respond non-linearly to the applied <b>printing</b> <b>pressure.</b> Studies based on pilot coated and printed paperboards is also reported, and it is shown that the print quality, e. g. print density, print gloss and dot gain, is largely dependent on the type of ink chosen and on the coating characteristics.

The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly interesting for busbarless solar cells with wire-interconnection like Meyer Burger's SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). This study intends to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the general feasibility for this approach. Fundamental printing tests are carried out to investigate important influence parameters like the flexible printing plate and the correlation between <b>printing</b> <b>pressure</b> and contact finger width. We found out that contact finger elements on elastomer printing plates down to an actual width of wf = 7 ± 2 μm can be realized using a high-resolution laser-engraving process. Furthermore, we show that printed contact finger width increases by approx. Δwf ≈ 10 μm for each Δploc = 0. 05 MPa of pressure increase and thus has a strong impact on the contact grid.

The busbar consumes additional 19. 5 mg Ag paste. We obtain average finger heights from 5. 9 μm up to 24. 3 μm for 55 μm to 65 μm wide fingers. The resulting PERC solar cells show an average efficiency of 20. 2 % for finger paste consumptions above 60 mg. In contrast, a strong reduction of the conversion efficiency with less than 60 mg finger paste consumption is observed since the increased series resistance reduces the FF. By analytical modelling, we compare the calculated series resistance to the experimental data and observe a good accordance for more than 40 mg finger paste consumption whereas the experimental series resistance slightly exceed the modelled values below 40 mg. In addition, we use numerical simulations to investigate the series resistance dependence on the finger height which shows higher experimental values for finger height below 10 μm. The deviation of the measured series resistance and the two modelled cases is mostly due to inhomogeneous distribution of finger height profiles and finger interruptions on the solar cells with front finger paste consumption of less than 40 mg. For finger paste consumption below 60 mg, we find that also the specific contact resistance increases. A physical model of the root cause for this dependence still has to be found...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a trend towards {{combining}} multiple forms of additive manufacturing together for increased functionality, freedom and efficiency. In this work, two forms of multiple-material additive manufacturing technologies - inkjet and direct-ink writing - are combined in a hybrid system. Several advantages are realized due to the increased material library and geometric freedom as a result of new printing modalities. Initially, models of each process are reviewed and the processes are evaluated for compatibility. Then, the precision machine design of a passively-indexed, carousel-style, syringe tool holder is completed. An error budget employing Homogeneous Transformation Matrices was maintained to estimate the tooltip errors. In order to register these two non-contact printing processes, a unique approach to their registration to a common global origin was necessary. A single non-contact optical CCD micrometer is used to register the three spatial coordinates of the syringe tooltip. Measurements are performed to characterize the repeatability of the nozzle registration scheme and the constructed gantry and carousel system, which well exceeds the requirements and the predictions from the conservative error budget. This novel system can print with a wide array of inks, including those that solidify via polymerization or crosslinking, two part chemistries, solvent evaporation or sintering, as well as liquids, gels and pastes. These materials can have a wide range of mechanical properties and functionalities, for example electrical conductivity or force sensitive resistivity. Models for the extrudate flow rate are used alongside experimental determination of the extrudate cross-section to ensure accurate process congruence. Finally, printed results demonstrate the various printing techniques, highlight the expanded material library, and display novel assemblies not possible with conventional additive processes.

40|$|At the Iggesund mill {{there are}} several methods and {{equipments}} in laboratory scale that simulate the offset printing process in order to evaluate mottle tendency or ink tack for instance. However, {{it is not possible}} to study the effect of pre-damping prior to printing on these properties, which mostly is the case in industrial printing. The purpose of this work was therefore to develop a method for pre-damp application used prior to laboratory offset printing in order to learn more about the ink/fountain solution/substrate interaction. This method was used to study the effect of pre-damp on ink tack measurements and on water interference mottle tendency in laboratory scale. The initial trials were focused on ink tack measurements without pre-damp in order to achieve knowledge about this type of measurement. The effect of different parameters used within the ink tack measurements was also investigated. The ink tack measurements were rather sensitive to the method of ink distribution procedure, the positioning of the tack disc and the fastening of the paperboard sample. Additionally, the printing speed, the <b>printing</b> <b>pressure</b> and the hold time affected the measurements. However, measurements in the cross direction and the machine direction of the paperboard were compared, and did not show a significant difference. Different levels of tackiness of the ink were also tested. For instance, an ink that previously had caused delamination failure in industrial offset printing showed a relatively high ink tack. Four different paperboard qualities were also compared. The small differences in ink tack between the samples were explained by the differences in coating characteristic resulting in different ink absorption. The same paperboard qualities were also used in an inter-comparison between different laboratories measuring ink tack (Iggesund, STFI and Imerys). The same machine settings and the same type of ink was used in the investigation. Although the four qualities always were ranged in the same order, both the level and the shape of the ink tack curve differed in between the three laboratories. One explanation given was that different tack discs were used in the investigation. The method developed for pre-damp application was based on condensation of a water film on a cooled down metal disc. The effect of the temperature on the metal disc surface (inside a fridge), the dwell time inside a desiccator and the time for condensation in a conditioned room on the amount of water developed on the disc surface was investigated. The amount of water developed and transferred could be related to the resulting print density or transferred ink amount. A lower print density or transferred ink amount implied a larger amount of water applied to the sample. The experiments showed that this procedure is rather uncertain and that the tests are difficult to reproduce. However, a lower temperature of the damp disc inside the fridge in general resulted in a larger amount of water developed onto the disc surface. The pre-damp application was used prior to printing and ink tack measurements. The maximum and the shape of the ink tack curve only changed slightly when using pre-damp in comparison to the measurements without pre- damp. In general, the ink tack curve in the later phase was lowered when using pre-damp, indicating a faster ink setting and drying. This may be attributed to that the viscosity of the ink decreases when blended with water. Another explanation given was that penetration of water into the substrate leads to swelling and consequently a rougher surface and a lower ink tack. A lower amount of ink transferred in some cases may be another explanation. The pre-damp was also applied prior to printing in Prüfbau in mottle evaluations, creating water interference mottle. Two paperboard samples with different levels of performance in industrial printing were compared. The sample with less good performance also appeared worse in this investigation with respect to mottle, both with and without pre-damp before printing. This sample had lower coat weight according to burn out pictures and also a lower contact angle in comparison to the better sample. A correlation was also achieved between the water interference mottle tendency obtained in laboratory printing and in a full scale printing trial, respectively. Only three qualities were included in this investigation. Further experiments must be performed to really see the correlation between these two methods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Whilst bottom electrodes and P(VDF-TrFE) are printed on a 25 μm thick polyamide (PI) substrate, the top electrodes with force concentrator posts on backside are printed {{on a separate}} polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and the two are then adhered with good alignment. Each sensor module consists of 4 × 4 sensors array, with each sensor having 1 × 1 mm 2 sensitive area, and interconnection lines for expandability of the cells. Capacitance-voltage analysis at varying frequency and piezoelectric response of the sensor is presented. Whole package of foldable pressure sensor realized is completely developed by screen printing technology and is targeted towards realizing low-cost electronic skin. The sensors arrays have also been compared with similar sensors structures that were realized with spin coating...|$|R

40|$|Striping is {{the most}} common print {{non-uniformity}} on corrugated board. It is defined as periodic print density and/or print gloss variations parallel to the flutes. Corrugated boards are mainly printed with flexography, making striping a major concern for the flexographic post-printing industry. In spite of its long history, the basic mechanisms of striping have not been fully understood, and no concrete solution has been provided. The objective of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind and a solution to striping. Both experimental and numerical approaches have been taken in thiswork. Nonlinear finite element models have been constructed in both corrugated board and halftone dot scales to determine the pressure distributions in the printing nip. Ink transfer experiments have been performed to determine the <b>print</b> density vs. <b>pressure</b> relations. Parametric studies have been done for the effects of printing system variables and deformations. The results showed that striping is predominantly print density variations caused by pressure variations in the <b>printing</b> nip. The <b>pressure</b> variations are inherent to the corrugated board structure. Washboarding was shown to play a minor part in causing print density variations, but might contribute to gloss striping. A new printing plate design has been proposed to eliminate the pressure variations and hence the print density striping...|$|R
