40|$|The {{presence}} of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Halyomorpha halys Stål (Heteroptera, Pentatomidae) is signaled {{for the first time}} in Romania, in the Botanical Garden of Bucarest. This polyphagous bug, native to Asia, is recorded as an extremely invasive pest of many agricultural crops in the countries where it has been introduced (USA, Italy). The current distribution and pest status, morphology and biology are described. Although the majority of individuals were collected from the Botanical Garden, several other H. halys were observed in the urban area, several kilometers away, suggesting that this species is already spread out in the city, and that its presence in Romania could date back to at least 1 - 2 years ago. Considering the <b>potential</b> <b>serious</b> <b>risk</b> for agriculture in Romania, the necessity to develop a monitoring strategy in field crops for early detection is suggested...|$|E

40|$|Background: Anal intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} {{is associated}} with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) as a precursor to anal cancer. However, factors other than hrHPV {{are likely to be}} involved and further study of cofactors is required because of the possibility of syndemic interactions. Methods: Three hundred and fourteen patients underwent 457 operations. Histopathology and hrHPV testing using the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) method were performed. Demographic factors and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) were recorded. Results: Results showed that hrHPV alone was associated with HSIL (OR = 4. 65, p < 0. 001). None of the other STIs were alone associated with HSIL but amplification of risk was found when hrHPV infection occurred with HIV (OR = 11. 1); syphilis (OR = 5. 58); HSV 2 (OR = 7. 85); gonorrhoea (OR = 6. 45) and some other infections. Conclusions: These results suggest that hrHPV is a sufficient cause of anal HSIL. Seropositivity for HIV, HSV 2, T. pallidum, HBV and HCV and a history of gonorrhoea or chlamydia exert a powerful amplifying factor increasing the risk of HSIL above the risk with hrHPV alone. Other co-factors which are associated with an increased risk of HSIL are increased age, male gender, MSM behaviour and self-reported history of more than 50 sexual partners.

40|$|The risk-assessment {{report on}} the {{synthetic}} drug TMA- 2 was submitted by the EMCDDA to the European Council and Commission on 4 April 2003. The report was drawn up {{at a meeting in}} Lisbon from 31 March to 1 April under the auspices of an enlarged EMCDDA Scientific Committee. The drug was singled out by the Council of the EU for risk assessment on 12 December 2002 under the 1997 Joint action on new synthetic drugs. The report concludes that, due to its structural features, TMA- 2 is a potent hallucinogen/stimulant, similar to substances already classified under Schedules I and II of the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It also notes that the substance has no current medical or industrial use. The report recommends that, due to a <b>potential</b> <b>serious</b> health <b>risk,</b> TMA- 2 should be a controlled substance, although some experts consider that insufficient scientific evidence exists to support such a decision.

Granular soil insecticides applied via boxes on corn planters tend to break down within weeks as a result of soil microbial activity. Because properly applied granular insecticides are buried in the soil, exposure to non-target organisms is limited, although poorly operated or calibrated planting equipment can result in grains of insecticide remaining on the soil surface, posing a <b>serious</b> <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> to some bird species. A significant portion of the foliar insecticides applied per hectare for ECB control never hit its plant target, and a portion of the insecticide that does land and lodge on plant tissues is washed off within hours, days, or weeks during rainfall events. This is why insecticide residues are rarely detected in corn grain and silage at harvest time, and why conventional insecticide applications on corn pose little or no human dietary risk.|$|R
40|$|The vasovagal {{response}} {{is characterized by}} an inappropriate combination of bradycardia and paradoxical vasodilation. During a general or neuraxial anesthesia-induced sympathectomy, a sudden vagal activation and/or an acute reduction in sympathetic tone can cause serious vasovagal responses. Neuraxial anesthesia for Cesarean section may trigger vasovagal response, due to multiple risk factors; high neuraxial block, sudden hemorrhage, aortocarval compression, peritoneal manipulation, and emotional stress. A 39 -year-old pregnant woman, at 38 weeks of gestation with episodes of non-sustained ventricular arrhythmia and newly developed vasovagal syncope during pregnancy, was scheduled to undergo a spinal anesthesia for an elective Cesarean section.

Using a papoose board to temporarily and safely limit movement is often preferable to medical sedation, which presents <b>serious</b> <b>potential</b> <b>risks,</b> including death. As a result, restraint is preferred by some parents as an alternative to sedation, behavior management/anxiety reduction techniques, better pain management or a low risk anxyiolytic such as nitrous oxide. Informed consent from a parent or guardian is usually required before a papoose board can be used. If assent from the child is required, then in most cases, the papoose board would be prohibited as it is unlikely that a child would agree to restraint and not struggle. In some countries, the papoose board is banned and considered a serious breach of ethics. (U.K., for example).|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of melanin production {{is important for}} managing skin darkness and hyperpigmentary disorders. Numerous anti-melanogenic agents that target tyrosinase activity/stability, melanosome maturation/transfer, or melanogenesis-related signaling pathways have been developed. As a rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis, tyrosinase {{has been the most}} attractive target, but tyrosinase-targeted treatments still pose <b>serious</b> <b>potential</b> <b>risks,</b> indicating the necessity of developing lower-risk anti-melanogenic agents. Sugars are ubiquitous natural compounds found in humans and other organisms. Here, we review the recent advances in research on the roles of sugars and sugar-related agents in melanogenesis and in the development of sugar-based anti-melanogenic agents. The proposed mechanisms of action of these agents include: (a) (natural sugars) disturbing proper melanosome maturation by inducing osmotic stress and inhibiting the PI 3 kinase pathway and (b) (sugar derivatives) inhibiting tyrosinase maturation by blocking N-glycosylation. Finally, we propose an alternative strategy for developing anti-melanogenic sugars that theoretically reduce melanosomal pH by inhibiting a sucrose transporter and reduce tyrosinase activity by inhibiting copper incorporation into an active site. These studies provide evidence of the utility of sugar-based anti-melanogenic agents in managing skin darkness and curing pigmentary disorders and suggest a future direction for the development of physiologically favorable anti-melanogenic agents...|$|R
