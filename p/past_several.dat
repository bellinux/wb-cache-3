5|$|On the {{opposite}} riverbank, the route turns eastward {{to follow the}} eastern bank of the Schroon River through an undeveloped portion of Warrensburg comprising little more than forests. The route winds along the bank of river to the hamlet of Warrensburg, where the route becomes River Street and heads <b>past</b> <b>several</b> blocks of houses. At Alden Avenue, the route curves to the northeast, mirroring the curvature of the river through Warrensburg. It continues along the waterway to the junction of Ridge and River Streets, where NY418 turns north onto Richards Avenue and finally crosses the river on a truss bridge. The route meets Water Street (CR9) on {{the opposite}} bank before continuing northward <b>past</b> <b>several</b> commercial properties {{to the center of}} Warrensburg, where NY418 ends at an intersection with US9 (Main Street).|$|E
5|$|RE 8 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with TX 72 {{south of the}} unincorporated community of Calliham. The highway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward toward Calliham. As it travels through mainly rural areas, the route intersects a small dirt road before entering the southern portion of Calliham. The road intersects Fletcher Street and continues <b>past</b> <b>several</b> houses, traveling parallel to Naylor Street for a short distance before it intersects Ritcher Street, where it bends northeastward and continues. The road passes a large RV park and intersects Deer Trail before continuing <b>past</b> <b>several</b> houses. It proceeds to its northern terminus, an intersection with Quail Run Road {{at the edge of}} Choke Canyon State Park. A long park road continues north into the park, providing access to several campgrounds and recreational areas.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{geomagnetic}} field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated in the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago.

5|$|Dean's small force {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the city <b>past</b> <b>several</b> North Korean roadblocks. Just outside the city Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded US soldiers in a wrecked truck in the ditch.

In the confusion, Dean was separated from the group.|$|E
5|$|In his {{withdrawal}} {{instructions for}} the 7th Cavalry, Colonel Cecil Nist, the regimental commander, ordered the 2nd Battalion to disengage from the North Koreans to its front and attack to its rear to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment.

5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter {{at a distance of}} about 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by the}} past influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io; in the <b>past,</b> <b>several</b> mean-motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe's orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe's orbit.|$|E
5|$|After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY179 {{continues}} eastward as Mile Strip Road, {{entering a}} large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit56), which connects via trumpet interchange. After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane commercial street, passing {{north and south}} of several strip malls until an intersection with County Route204 (CR204; McKinley Parkway). After CR204, NY179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard <b>past</b> <b>several</b> residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park.|$|E

At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues <b>past</b> <b>several</b> blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E

5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E
