There would {{be as many as}} 1000 to 1500 Chinese people living in Locke. Farmhands shared rooms in the boarding houses. Chinese residents living in the homes behind Main Street also took in Chinese farm laborers. Chinese immigrants in Locke started patterns in California agriculture that are continued today in the Sacramento-San Joaquin region, including contracted labor, tenant farming, sharecropping, and the <b>piece</b> <b>wage</b> system. A community garden existed in the back and there was a special oven to make roast pigs on Sundays. Chinese communities congregated in solidarity under difficult labor and social conditions fostered by legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, creating community gardens that maintained cultural relevancy in the form of growing Chinese cabbage, snow peas, leafy vegetables, winter melon, and tomatoes. Baptist missionary Dr. Charles Shepherd would bring in his Chungmei home boys for the pear harvest at the end of July. Life in Locke {{had a great deal of}} accord. The Chinese mothers took care of each other's children when another mother had to go to work at the cannery across the River Road next to the riverboat docks of the Sacramento River.|$|E

2500|$|A {{businessman}} {{looks at}} the deployment of labor in a different way, but faces a similar analytical problem. All labor produces something, {{but it does not}} necessarily help to create profit for one reason or another. What interests a businessman in a financial sense, is the cost of labor which directly creates the product or service that generates profit, versus the cost of labor that is effectively only a necessary overhead expense for his own business. The general aim is, to maximize productive labor in this sense, and minimize unproductive costs. That is the efficiency principle that guides the development of the division of labor organizationally. Ideally speaking, everything the employee does would directly contribute to profit for the enterprise (but in reality it usually doesn't). If employers paid <b>piece</b> <b>wages</b> then, in theory, they would incur costs, [...] "only if" [...] their employees created new value for them. Marx believed that <b>piece</b> <b>wages</b> – whether paid on an individual or team basis – were, in the long term, the most favorable form of remuneration for capitalist labor-exploitation, although he recognized that often workers earning piece-wages could initially earn more than workers on time-wages.|$|R

40|$|During {{the years}} of the slow {{economic}} growth of Japan since the oil shock in the fall of 1973, localized or regioally based industries (jiba sangyo) have cotinued to play a more important role. They are not only the backbone of the small-scale sector, but afford employment to a large number of workers in local areas and contribute immensely to the local economy. If the industry of Nara Prefecture is classified in major two groups as the light and the heavy and chemical industries, it would largely consist of the light industry of which the localized industry roughly has a share of 65 per cent. Nara Prefecture takes up the measure for the promotion of the localized industry as one of important items of the administration for the activation of the local economy and in the line of a national policy. In an actual investigation on Nara Prefecture's localized industry in 1980, 5, 120 firms and 39 　categories by industry were selected among all manufacturing industries as the localized industry under the concept of the localized industry provided by Smaller Enterprise Agency. To be called the localized industry scientifically, the following three attributes at least must be present. First, those industries consist of small-scale firms and are concentrated in a given geographical locale. Secondly, each of those industries involves a locally defined division of labor. Thirdly, such industries have been organized and run by local enterprisers with locally generated capital. The concept mentioned above adequately contains those three attributes. The writers make a general survey of the localized industry based on "An Actual Investigation Report on the Localized Industry of Nara Prefecture in 1981 ". Most of localized industries are founded in Nara basin. Some categories by industry such as knitting, lumbering and so on tend to be clustered together or separately {{in various parts of the}} basin. Other several categories by industry such as the machine and metal industry spread out almost widely. Some famous traditional industries locate in Nara city. A large number of localized industries consist of subcontracting processors linked to wholesalers, contractors and trading companies in Osaka.

The choice of taking a long-term perspective has been made to highlight the relationship between continuity and ruptures in regards to wages. The formation of piece work occurred at the same time – in the 1880 s – as the semi-artisan production structure of wooden shipbuilding gave way to the industrial system of iron and steel. The workers in the old production system worked for a daily salary governed by customs and work ethics that were rooted in the tradition of shipbuilding. The transition replaced these professions with skilled industrial workers from the mechanical and metallurgical industries where where remuneration at piece rates piece rates had already been an established practice for at least three decades. The central hypothesis of this research, which i will attempt to explain {{in the course of this}} paper, is that of the relative continuity of the forms of piece work.

40|$|Managers, {{politicians}} and scientists frequently {{use the term}} ‘incentive’ in their explanations of human action. At the same time, individuals in {{the public and private}} sectors are now governed with the help of incentives. In this thesis, I study the incentive from a theoretical and normative perspective inspired by the work of the French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault. More in particular, I study three successive attempts to demarcate the ‘incentivizable subject’ as an object of knowledge and to design the techniques of power with which that subject could be governed. American engineers were the first professional authority in matters of incentives. For them, the incentivization of employees was synonymous with the introduction of a variant of <b>piece</b> <b>wages.</b> From the 1920 s onward, the authority of the engineers was challenged by management scientists with a background in psychology, sociology and anthropology. They developed different explanations for employee behavior and developed a set of alternative techniques to increase productivity. It took until the 1970 s for the third rationalization of governing with the help of incentives to emerge. This time, mathematically trained economists forged a link between incentives and information. Finally, I analyze the delimitation of the role granted to the governor and the governed; the contrast between incentives and discipline as rival techniques of power; and the things that are taken for granted in the use of the carrot and the stick as twin elements in a comprehensive program for wielding power over people...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{has played}} a {{profound}} and unique role in humanity's development. We are dependent on agriculture {{for the vast majority}} of our food supply, and have so far been successful at increasing agricultural production to meet rising demand. At the same time, agriculture is the largest and most direct way that humans have altered our planet's landscape and natural environment. Indeed, over half of all land in the United States is used for some agricultural purpose. In this dissertation, I explore three different aspects of human-environmental-agricultural interdependency in the United States. In the first chapter, I study agricultural workers' wage-responsiveness under different environmental conditions on California blueberry farms. In the second chapter, Fiona Burlig and I study the effect of human social networks on agricultural technology adoption in three upper-Midwestern states. Finally, in the third chapter, I study how the location of ethanol refineries in the US Corn Belt affects crop choice decisions and nutrient runoff. Each of these chapters highlights a different interaction between human economic systems (wages, social networks, renewable fuel policy), environmental conditions (temperature, nitrogen application/runoff), and agricultural enterprises (specialty crop labor productivity, adoption of fertilizer, crop rotations). I utilize a similar empirical strategy in each chapter, employing fixed effects and other panel data techniques to control for time-invariant determinants of productivity, technology adoption, and optimal crop choice, respectively. This dissertation highlights the benefits of panel data methods in agriculture, especially in the modern era of abundant micro-level data. In the first chapter, I study how agricultural laborers' productivity responds to changes in the <b>piece</b> rate <b>wage</b> they are paid: a wage paid per unit of output rather than per unit of time. Specifically, I exploit quasi-experimental variation to estimate the elasticity of labor productivity with respect to <b>piece</b> rate <b>wages</b> by analyzing a high-frequency panel of over 2, 000 blueberry pickers on two California farms over three years. To account for endogeneity in the <b>piece</b> rate <b>wage,</b> I use the market price for blueberries as an instrumental variable. I find that picker productivity is very inelastic on average, and I can reject even modest elasticities of up to 0. 7. However, this average masks important heterogeneity across outdoor working conditions. Specifically, at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, I find that higher <b>piece</b> rate <b>wages</b> do in fact induce increases in labor productivity. This is suggestive evidence consistent with a model where at moderate to hot temperatures, workers face binding physiological constraints that prevent them from exerting additional effort in response to higher wages. This insight has important implications for understanding how climate change will affect the agricultural labor sector. In the second chapter, Fiona Burlig and I use historical data and a natural experiment to study the effect of social networks on agricultural technology adoption. We present a model of the effects of social network size on information and technology take-up and test its implications using a unique natural experiment in the mid- 20 th century US Midwest. We find that social network expansions, in the form of mergers between congregations of the American Lutheran Church, led to increased rates of agricultural technology adoption among farmers. In counties that experienced a merger, the number of farms using nitrogen fertilizer increased by over 7 % and the total fertilized acreage increased by over 13 % relative to counties without a merger. We provide evidence that these effects are driven by increased information sharing between farmers as a result of these congregational mergers. In the third chapter, I study how the location of ethanol refineries within the US Corn Belt affects farmers' land use decisions. Ethanol production in the United States, driven by federal renewable fuel policy, has exploded over the past two decades and has prompted the construction of many ethanol refineries throughout the US Corn Belt. These refineries have introduced a new inelastic demand for corn in the areas where they were built, reducing basis for nearby farmers and effectively subsidizing local corn production. I explore whether and to what extent the construction of new ethanol refineries has actually increased local corn acreage. I also explore some environmental effects of this acreage increase. Using a thirteen year panel of over two million field-level observations in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska, I estimate a net increase of nearly 300, 000 acres of corn in 2014 relative to 2002 that can be attributed to the placements of new ethanol refineries. This increase comprises approximately 0. 75 % of the total 2014 corn acreage within my dataset. Furthermore, this effect is separate from the general equilibrium effect of ethanol policy increasing aggregate demand for corn. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that over 21, 000 tons of the nitrogen applied to fields in my sample in 2014 can be attributed to refinery location effects. Essentially all of these observed effects occur only in areas within 30 miles of an ethanol refinery, suggesting that refineries have meaningful localized impacts on land use and environmental quality such as nitrate runoff...|$|R

40|$|In an {{exploration}} of the joint concerns of economic development, namely efficiency and equality, I employ experimental methods to consider several issues regarding entrepreneurship and regulation with particular applications in developing countries. Entrepreneurship programs in developing countries may not take hold in rural populations if people there tend to shy away from competitive and uncertain economic opportunities, thus contributing to the systematic underdevelopment of rural areas. In a field experiment conducted among potential entrepreneurs in rural and urban Ghana, we found that rural subjects were 20 percent less likely than their urban counterparts to select an all-or-nothing tournament compensation scheme over a <b>piece</b> rate <b>wage</b> to per- form a simple matching task. The difference between the rural and urban tournament choice was driven by subjects who believed their own performance was the best within their group; urban subjects were twice as likely as their rural counterparts to believe that they had scored in first place and were thus more likely to select the tournament compensation. To examine behavior in a tax setting, we develop a simple tax evasion model as a signaling game between a taxpayer and an auditor that includes a non-strategic, always compliant taxpayer. In addition to the taxpayer's income report to the auditor, he has the option to send a costly message, a donation to charity that may serve as an indirect signal to the auditor of the taxpayer's ethical type. In the case where the taxpayer has misreported his income and is audited, he must pay unpaid taxes and a penalty. We establish a Perfect Bayesian equilibrium where taxpayers will use the charitable donation to signal honesty, thereby reducing the probability of audit. Auditors will optimally audit reports without charity donations more frequently than those with donations. To test our theoretical predictions, we use a two-sided signaling experiment where the taxpayer voluntarily reports his income to determine his tax liability and can make an observable and verifiable charity donation. Our aggregate experimental results indicate players employ mixed strategies in line with theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The type {{of payment}} {{is one of the}} {{important}} factors that has an effect on the health of employees, as a basic working condition. In the conventional research field of occupational safety and health, only the physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic factors are treated as the main hazardous factors. Managerial factors and basic working conditions such as working hours and the {{type of payment}} are neglected. This paper aimed to investigate the association of the type of payment and the exposure to the various hazardous factors as an heuristic study. Methods: The third Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS) by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute in 2011 was used for this study. Among the total sample of 50, 032 economically active persons, 34, 788 employees were considered for analysis. This study examined the relation between the three types of payment such as basic fixed salary and <b>wage,</b> <b>piece</b> rate, and extra payment for bad and dangerous working conditions and exposure to hazardous factors like vibration, noise, temperature, chemical contact, and working at very high speeds. Multivariate regression analysis was used to measure the effect of the type of payment on working hours exposed to hazards. Results: The result showed that the proportion of employees with a basic fixed salary was 94. 5 %, the proportion with piece rates was 38. 6 %, and the proportion who received extra payment for hazardous working conditions was 11. 7 %. Conclusion: The piece rate was associated with exposure to working with tight deadlines and stressful jobs. This study had some limitations because KWCS was a cross-sectional survey...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three independent chapters. The first two chapters investigate the effect of unemployment insurance on job search behavior using laboratory experiments. The third chapter uses survey data to study the impact of unemployment insurance on alcohol use and abuse following job loss. ^ In the first chapter, I study the effect of changes in unemployment insurance benefit generosity on search for vertically differentiated jobs. I use a laboratory experiment to observe search effort and outcomes under four treatments that differ in benefit level and benefit exhaustion rate. Two job opportunities differ in the probability of finding a job conditional on effort, and the wage. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the results show {{a positive relationship between}} benefit generosity and the propensity of subjects to search for a job which pays a higher wage but is more difficult to find. However, subjects are less responsive to changes in benefits than predicted; and the propensity to search for the good job declines over time even in a stationary environment. Last, I provide insight into why search is suboptimal and evaluate the implications of suboptimal search for the design of UI programs and subsequent matching of workers and employers. ^ In the second chapter, I use a laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of labor market policies on job search and the resulting productivity of the employer-employee match. Job offers consist of one of two possible real effort tasks, intermediate level math or verbal questions, and a <b>piece</b> rate <b>wage.</b> Unemployed subjects receive job offers and must accept or reject the offer. The subject 2 ̆ 7 s ability in each task is used as a measure of idiosyncratic productivity. I find evidence that unemployment insurance benefits increase the productivity of a worker-firm match by increasing worker selectivity which allows subjects to more often accept a job that matches their skills. ^ In the third chapter, joint work with Robert Lantis, we investigate potential unintended consequences of unemployment insurance (UI) policy on alcohol use and abuse. Using NLSY data supplemented with Geocode data, we estimate the effect of benefit replacement rates on changes in individual alcohol consumption following job loss. Identification relies on variation in replacement rates across states and over time. Benefits provide income to the unemployed which enables individuals to smooth consumption and also may reduce the stress and anxiety of job loss. Results indicate higher levels of benefits increase the amount of alcohol unemployed individuals consume. Moreover, a higher level of benefits increases the likelihood an individual abuses alcohol following job loss.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the wage curve with Finnish metal {{industry}} panel {{data from the}} period 1991 - 95. Three different measures of hourly wage are used as dependent variables. As the unemployment variable we use the unemployment rate of the regional county. In order to controls {{for the effects of}} long-term unemployent we split the unemployment rate into shortand long-term unemployment. We also control for the effect of active labour market policies by augmenting the wage equation with a variable for subsidised employment schemes. Results indicate that hourly wages are responsive to regional labour market conditions. The estimated unemployment-elasticity of wages in the Finnish metal industry is somewhat smaller than the elasticities reported by other studies. Long-term unemployment increases wages and subsidised employment schemes decrease them. Their combined effect is zero. This elasticity in the wages is due to the sensitivity of the fixed personal hourly <b>wages.</b> <b>Piece</b> rates are insensitive to the changes in unemployment rates. Our candidate for the estimated slope of the wage curve in the Finnish metal industry is - 0. 04 from an equation where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the fixed hourly wage and the unemployment variable is corrected so that the long-term unemployed are removed from the pool of unemployed and the labour force and the workers in subsidised employment schemes are considered as unemployed. There appears to be a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the slope of the wage curve between different subpopulations. Hourly wages of men are more responsive to changes in unemployment than those of women. The elasticity of hourly wages also tends to decrease as the workers get older. Wages are clearly more elastic in the densely populated areas than in the sparsely populated areas. Both regional and individual unobservable effects are controlled for as well as the common group bias in the estimates of the standard errors. The specification of the functional form is discussed by adding non-linear terms and polynomial structures of unemployment rate to the equation. We also control for the possible endogeneity of the unemployment rate with different instrumental variables. The study contains a short survey on the wage curve literature. The wage setting in the Finnish metal industry is also briefly discussed. Finally, we discuss different theoretical interpretations of the wage curve and as an example present the efficiency wage model by Blanchflower and Oswald (1994). Endast sammandrag.
