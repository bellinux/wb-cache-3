Aim To clarify what factors led to precautions among general workers who displayed <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> against radiation following the nuclear disasters in Fukushima. Methods Descriptive study of <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> among general workers 3 e 5 months following the nuclear disasters. The subjects were 1394 regular workers {{who took part in}} radiation seminars conducted by the Fukushima Occupational Health Promotion Center between July and August 2011. Of 1217 responses, 1110 eligible responses were included in this study. This anonymous questionnaire survey was asking for characteristics and questions on <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> following the nuclear disasters. The authors assessed the contribution of each variable by a logistic regression analysis. Results Keeping track of environmental radiation levels and washing hands and gargling were significantly more frequent among female subjects, older age and workers residing up to approximately 80 km away from the power plants. Washing hands and gargling were also related with living with children. Wearing a mask when leaving home and buying bottled water were significantly more often observed with female subjects and workers residing up to 80 km. Refraining from going outdoors was positively associated with workers residing up to 80 km and workers living with children.

Total utility yielded by risk affecting goods is the sum of that derived from the use value of the good, if any, and that from reduced anxiety which results from reduced risk. Many risk affecting goods are consumed mainly for their use value. An examination of the nature of risk affecting goods is presented, followed by an analysis of the factors that determine the anxiety associated with unwanted outcomes.

40|$|Health-related {{behaviour}} {{has become}} a major focus of public concern because of the realisation that lifestyle factors are important in the etiology of many of today's illnesses. The present study was designed to increase the understanding and prediction of <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> by investigating individual health beliefs. As a result of major theoretical and methodological shortcomings, previous research has not been entirely consistent in this area. However, overall trends suggest that the locus of control beliefs construct, which deals with individual perceptions of the causality of outcomes, is an important variable in the prediction of <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> although the amount of variance explained by these factors in past studies has not been very large. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the locus of control construct, in conjunction with the value an individual places on his/her health, {{have a significant effect on}} <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour.</b> A questionaire which included the Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (Wallston, Wallston and DeVellis 1978), was administered to a sample of first year university students. A comprehensive range of <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviours</b> was measured in order to obtain an accurate index of <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> participation. The perceived efficacy of the <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviours</b> was also measured as research into the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock 1966) suggests that it is an important factor in the prediction of health-related behaviours. Comparisons were made between those subjects who valued their health highly and those for whom health had a lower priority. Results confirm the hypothesis that health locus of control beliefs, in conjunction with health value, account for a significant proportion of the variance in <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour.</b> Furthermore, when only those preventive health actions which were perceived by subjects as being very healthy were considered, the ability of health locus of control beliefs and health value to predict <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> increased. The results of this study indicate the importance of measuring locus of control beliefs in conjunction with the value placed upon health, when assessing their ability to predict <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviour.</b> The study also highlights the importance of measuring a comprehensive range of <b>preventive</b> health <b>behaviours</b> which subjects perceive as being effective in health promotion, rather than a small number of preventive health beliefs with no measure of their perceived efficacy.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of obesity and overweight is highest among ethnic minority groups in Western countries. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the contribution of ethnicity and beliefs of parents about overweight <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> to their child’s outdoor play and snack intake, and to the parents’ intention to monitor these behaviours. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among parents of native Dutch children and children from a large minority population (Turks) at primary schools, sampled from Youth Health Care registers. Results Native Dutch parents observed more outdoor play and lower snack intake in their child and had stronger intentions to monitor these behaviours than parents of Turkish descent. In the multivariate analyses, the parents’ attitude and social norm were the main contributing factors to the parental intention to monitor the child’s outdoor play and snack intake. Parental perceived behavioural control contributed to the child’s outdoor play and, in parents who perceived their child to be overweight, to snacking behaviour. The associations between parents’ behavioural cognitions and overweight related <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> were not modified by ethnicity, except for perceived social norm. The relationship between social norm and intention to monitor outdoor play was stronger in Dutch parents than in Turkish parents. Conclusions As the overweight related <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> of both children and parents did differ between the native and ethnic minority populations of this study, it is advised that interventions pay attention to cultural aspects of the targeted population. Further research is recommended into parental behavioural cognitions regarding overweight prevention and management for different ethnicities. </p...|$|R

The database comprised subsamples of the Austrian Micro-Census, including individuals aged 65 years and older, for the years 1983, 1991, 1999, and subsamples of the ATHIS (Austrian Health Interview Survey) 2007. A trend analysis was conducted for four health-related variables with the year of the survey and education as predictors. The analysis was stratified by sex. We found a general trend towards better self-rated health, better preventive and less risk behaviour among the elderly, while the body mass index has been increasing over the years. There are indeed gender differences regarding the trend in smoking behaviour. While the prevalence of male smoking has been steadily decreasing, female smoking prevalence has not changed. At all points in time, individuals with higher education had significantly better self-rated health than those with lower education but the association between education and <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> significantly decreased over the years.

Australia {{has the highest}} incidence of skin {{cancer in the world}} despite intensive publicity in the last 30 years aimed at prevention. AIM. This study set out to assess risk factors, knowledge and <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> relevant to skin cancer in general practice patients in South Australia, and to investigate the relationship between risk, knowledge and behaviour. METHOD. A questionnaire on skin cancer was distributed to 980 patients aged 16 years and over attending general practitioners' surgeries in South Australia. A total of 810 questionnaires were analysed (83 %). RESULTS. There was a high overall level of knowledge and awareness of skin cancer. However, the majority of respondents were unaware of the risks of blue eyes (87 %), fair hair (83 %) or red hair (68 %). A third of respondents were unaware that having lots of moles and freckles was a risk factor for skin cancer. A considerable minority were unaware of the risk of a fair complexion (26 %), getting sunburnt (14 %) or prolonged exposure to the sun (11 %). Sunscreen cream was the most popular <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> (use reported by 74 %), followed by clothing (54 %), shade (16 %) and timed sun exposure (13 %). The most common number of methods of prevention used was two, but 16 % were not able to mention anything that they did to prevent skin cancer. The correlations between presence of risk factors, knowledge and <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> were poor. CONCLUSION. There was a high overall level of knowledge and awareness of skin cancer in South Australia but despite intense publicity, important areas of ignorance were still found to exist. The simpler methods of skin cancer prevention appeared to be neglected in favour of sunscreen cream. Those at high risk did not know more about skin cancer and reported doing little more to prevent it than those at low risk. There is a need to target those at high risk for education and screening. General practitioners, with adequate training, could have an important part to play in the primary and secondary prevention of mortality and morbidity from skin cancer...|$|E

What are the associations between {{the quality of}} communication and the improvement of secondary <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours?</b> How does gender influence these relationships? Methods: 1, 289 patients who underwent a coronary angiography in 2008 / 09 in Luxembourg completed a self-administered questionnaire {{at the time of}} the visit, and at a five-year follow-up. The probability of improving each <b>preventive</b> eating <b>behaviour</b> (decrease of salt, sugar, fat consumption and increase of fruits/vegetables), and the quality of doctor-patient communication (5 -item scale) were evaluated using logistic regression models. Sex was introduced in interaction with the communication score. Findings: Among hypertensive respondents, a higher quality of communication was associated with a higher probability of decreasing the salt intake in women (OR [95 % CI]: 1. 139 [1. 060; 1. 223]) whereas in men, the OR was only 1. 086 [1. 017; 1. 159]. ORs were also higher in women among patients with hypertension, overweight and hypercholesterolemia regarding the increase of fruits/vegetables consumption; among patients with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia regarding sugar decrease or cessation; and among patients with overweight and hypercholesterolemia regarding fat reduction or stop. ORs were slightly higher among men only among diabetic and obese patients, regarding the increase of fruits/vegetables consumption.

40|$|Melioidosis, {{an often}} fatal {{infectious}} disease in Northeast Thailand, {{is caused by}} skin inoculation, inhalation or ingestion of the environmental bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei. The major underlying risk factor for melioidosis is diabetes mellitus. Recommendations for melioidosis prevention include using protective gear such as rubber boots and gloves when {{in direct contact with}} soil and environmental water, and consuming bottled or boiled water. Only a small proportion of people follow such recommendations. Nine focus group discussions were conducted to evaluate barriers to adopting recommended <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> A total of 76 diabetic patients from northeast Thailand participated in focus group sessions. Barriers to adopting the recommended <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and future intervention strategies were identified using two frameworks: the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Barriers were identified in the following five domains: (i) knowledge, (ii) beliefs about consequences, (iii) intention and goals, (iv) environmental context and resources, and (v) social influence. Of 76 participants, 72 (95 %) had never heard of melioidosis. Most participants saw no harm in not adopting recommended <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and perceived rubber boots and gloves to be hot and uncomfortable while working in muddy rice fields. Participants reported that they normally followed the behaviour of friends, family and their community, the majority of whom did not wear boots while working in rice fields and did not boil water before drinking. Eight intervention functions were identified as relevant for the intervention: (i) education, (ii) persuasion, (iii) incentivisation, (iv) coercion, (v) modeling, (vi) environmental restructuring, (vii) training, and (viii) enablement. Participants noted that input from role models in the form of physicians, diabetic clinics, friends and families, and from the government via mass media would be required for them to change their behaviours.

This paper reports on a study of the impact of self-efficacy on dengue knowledge and dengue <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> We recruited 280 adults from 27 post-outbreak villages in the state of Terengganu, east coast of Malaysia. Measures of health promotion and educational intervention activities and types of communication during outbreak, level of dengue knowledge, level and strength of self-efficacy and dengue <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> were obtained via face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. A structural equation model was tested and fitted the data well (χ(2) = 71. 659, df = 40, p = 0. 002, RMSEA = 0. 053, CFI = 0. 973, TLI = 0. 963).

Level and strength of self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship between knowledge of dengue and dengue preventive behaviours. Strength of self-efficacy acted as partial mediator in the relationship between knowledge of dengue and dengue preventive behaviours. To control and prevent dengue outbreaks by behavioural measures, health promotion and educational interventions during outbreaks should now focus on those approaches that are most likely to increase the level and strength of self-efficacy...|$|E

These studies were conducted among both {{the general public and}} specific risk groups in the Netherlands (including parents of young children and patients with a known aortic aneurysm or vascular prosthesis). This thesis describes trends over time and regional/(sub) national differences in risk perception and behaviour of the public during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, as well as determinants of <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour</b> or strong intention to comply with preventive measures. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for optimizing risk communication during future emerging infectious diseases outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 1177 / 1359105305053441 The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{influences on the}} decision-making processes relevant to sun-damage <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> namely sunscreen use. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a positive, a negative or a control group and underwent two successive experimental manipulations: (1) information and (2) focus. They made pre-experimental, post-information and post-focus ratings of likelihood of using sunscreen and susceptibility to skin cancer. The results suggested that decision making changes {{as a function of the}} information present, and the information which individuals focus on at the time of decision making. The findings are described with particular emphasis on the implications for future intervention strategies.

40|$|Around one {{thousand}} Australians die from skin cancer every year making skin cancer prevention a key objective {{for public health}} promotion and education. Adopting <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> is seen as crucial to {{reducing the risk of}} skin cancer. As the key determinants for adopting <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> include basic beliefs, attitudes and intentions we examined these within the framework of Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980) theory of reasoned action. The basic premise of this theory is that the intention to perform a behaviour is determined by one's attitude toward the behaviour and subjective norm. One hundred and eighty-seven male and female high school students responded to a questionnaire about their intentions to minimize sun exposure. While attitude toward minimizing exposure to the sun was positive for 77 % of participants, only 61 % reported that they intended to actually do this. The basic determinants, attitude toward the behaviour and subjective norm, while significant predictors of intention, only accounted for 30 % of the variance. In addition, attitude toward having a suntan, a variable considered to be external to the model, significantly increased the prediction of intention. We discuss possible reasons why the theory of reasoned action may not have predicted intention to the expected extent in this behavioural domain and discuss the crucial effect on the model of one of the key outcomes of sun exposure, the suntan.

40|$|Good {{oral health}} can be {{achieved}} by <b>preventive</b> dental <b>behaviours</b> such as regular dental visits as well as practising adequate selfcare by means of proper and frequent tooth brushing methods. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the influence of socio-economic parameters (occupation, education and income) according to modified Kuppuswamy's scale on <b>preventive</b> dental <b>behaviours</b> such as frequency of dental visits and tooth brushing with paste. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire based cross sectional survey was conducted to determine the influence of socio- economic status on Dental visits and frequency of tooth brushing in patients visiting the O. P. D (Out Patient Department) at I. T. S Dental College, Greater Noida. A total of 327 patients from 18 to 74 years were included from both the genders. A fifteen item closed ended questionnaire was prepared, which had information regarding the Chief complaint along with Age, Gender, Socioeconomic Status, intervals of dental visits and frequency of brushing. Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic classification, which includes monthly income, education level and occupation, was used to classify the socioeconomic status (SES) of the patients. RESULTS:There was no statistically significant difference reported between various levels of education, socio-economic status and gender when correlated with the frequency of dental visits. However, the results show that with increase in the level of education and socio-economic status the frequency of tooth brushing was positively correlated. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that groups with low education and socio-economic status are important targets to enhance dental <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis Prevention in Premenopausal Women and Children Maximising peak bone mass, and {{reducing}} premenopausal bone loss are both potential approaches {{for the long-term}} prevention of osteoporosis and fracture. However, {{little is known about}} how to improve osteoporosis <b>preventive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in either premenopausal women or children. We performed a randomised controlled trial of individualised bone density feedback combined with either a leaflet or group education (the Osteoporosis Prevention and Self-management Course ((OPSMC)) in 467 healthy premenopausal women. Outcomes measured included changes in calcium intake; physical activity and fitness; BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine; osteoporosis knowledge and self-efficacy; and, maternal report of changing children's calcium intake and physical activity...|$|R
