5|$|According to the Constitution and the PEA, {{there must}} be between three and six MPs in a GRC. The precise number of MPs in each GRC is {{declared}} by the <b>President</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet's direction prior to a general election. For {{the purposes of the}} 2015 general election, there were 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs, and each GRC had between four and six MPs.|$|E

5|$|Goldschmidt {{was born}} in Eugene, in Oregon's Willamette Valley, on June 16, 1940, to Lester H. Goldschmidt and Annette Levin. He {{graduated}} from South Eugene High School.

He served as student body <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school before graduating in 1963 with a Bachelor's degree in political science.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 2004, Thatcher (against doctor's orders) {{attended}} the state funeral service for Ronald Reagan.

5|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{skirted the}} Ineligibility Clause {{during its first}} year, when Nixon named Representative Donald Rumsfeld as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as Assistant to the <b>President</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same $42,500 salary, a position presumably {{outside the scope of}} the Clause.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Breckinridge {{political}} family, in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, {{he was the first}} Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Eline struck Mozambique, {{there was already}} {{incoming}} assistance from the international community, responding to the earlier flooding. Mozambique's <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after the storm struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By the end of February 2000, various countries had pledged $13.5 million to Mozambique, well short of the required needs, but that rose to nearly $119 million by March 17. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various relief goods reached the country, to be distributed from the towns of Bilene and Magul. The supplies nearly overwhelmed the small airport at Maputo, as lack of distribution caused food to decay in the sun.|$|E
5|$|Captains Scarlet and Brown are {{assigned}} to escort the President to the Spectrum Maximum Security Building in New York City. However, both officers are killed when the Mysterons use their powers over matter to engineer the crash of their Spectrum Patrol Car (SPC). From Scarlet and Brown's corpses, the Mysterons create two reconstructions, which are capable of perfectly imitating their biological templates and whose only programmed purpose is to execute the threat against the President. As a first assassination attempt, Brown's duplicate physically explodes after arriving with the <b>President</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Maximum Security Building; although the tower is completely destroyed, the President escapes with his life by activating an emergency door seconds before the detonation.|$|E
5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war. Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for {{two days}} before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death {{prompted}} the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey, the sitting Vice <b>President</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time and also a presidential candidate, later {{went on to win}} the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{stepped down}} as ANC <b>President</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too {{inflexible}} and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.|$|E

5|$|Menem ran for Governor of La Rioja in August 2007, but was defeated. He {{finished}} {{in third place}} with about 22% of the vote.

Following this defeat in his home province, he withdrew his candidacy for <b>president.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of 2009 he announced that he intended to run for the presidency again in the 2011 elections. but ran for a new term as senator instead.|$|E
5|$|Raúl Alfonsín was the {{president}} of Argentina from 1983 to 1989. He died on March 31, 2009, aged 82. He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice president Julio Cobos, the acting <b>president</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, arranged three days of national mourning and a state funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Alfonsín was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; people from other countries also voiced their respect for him. A military escort took his coffin to the La Recoleta Cemetery, and left him at the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park.|$|E
