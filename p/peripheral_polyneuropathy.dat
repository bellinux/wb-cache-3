Also no relation between <b>peripheral</b> sensorimotor <b>polyneuropathy</b> and electrophysiologic autonomic impairment was found. Plantar SSR was absent in 80 % of diabetics with orthostatic hypotension (p~ 0. 019).

Remarkable absence of palmar SSR in diabetics with orthostatic hypotension can be due to its sympathetic origin.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A polineuropatia periférica é uma das 19 síndromes neuropsiquiátricas do lúpus eritematoso sistêmico, segundo os critérios de classificação propostos pelo Colégio Americano de Reumatologia (ACR) para síndromes neuropsiquiátricas. No entanto, há descrições raras dessa manifestação, particularmente em populações de lúpus eritematoso sistêmico juvenil (LESJ). MÉTODOS: De 1983 a 2007, 5. 079 pacientes foram acompanhados na Unidade de Reumatologia Pediátrica do ICr-HC-FMUSP, e o diagnóstico de LESJ segundo os critérios do ACR foi estabelecido em 228 casos (4, 5 %). Polineuropatia periférica foi diagnosticada de acordo com as síndromes neuropsiquiátricas do ACR. RESULTADOS: Dos 228 pacientes com LESJ, cinco (2, 2 %) desenvolveram polineuropatia periférica e foram retrospectivamente descritos. O diagnóstico foi confirmado por eletroneuromiografia, que evidenciou polineuropatia periférica distal, sensitiva e/ou motora, envolvendo quatro membros em dois pacientes e membros inferiores nos demais. Três eram pacientes do sexo feminino e todos tiveram a polineuropatia periférica após o diagnóstico de LESJ. A mediana de idade de início da doença foi de 14 anos, e a mediana de tempo entre o início de LESJ e o diagnóstico da polineuropatia periférica foi de 23 meses. As apresentações clínicas mais comuns foram fraqueza muscular e hiporreflexia. Todos os pacientes apresentavam anticorpos antifosfolípides. O tratamento foi realizado com corticosteroides em todos os pacientes, associado com ciclofosfamida endovenosa em três. Um paciente evoluiu com incapacitação funcional, presença de paresia de membros inferiores e necessidade de cadeira de rodas. Uma paciente faleceu por sepse grave. CONCLUSÕES: A polineuropatia periférica é uma manifestação rara no LESJ, grave, por vezes incapacitante e habitualmente associada a anticorpos antifosfolípides. INTRODUCTION: <b>Peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> {{is one of}} 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes seen in {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus, {{according to}} the classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for neuropsychiatric syndromes. However, this manifestation has not been reported very often, especially in patients with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 2007, 5, 079 patients were seen at the Pediatric Rheumatology Unit of the ICr-HC-FMUSP; 228 (4. 5 %) patients were diagnosed with JSLE according to the criteria of the ACR. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> was diagnosed according to the criteria for neuropsychiatric syndromes of the ACR. RESULTS: Five (2. 2 %) out of 228 patients with JSLE developed <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> and were described retrospectively. The diagnosis was confirmed by electroneuromyography, which showed the presence of distal <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathy,</b> sensorial and/or motor, involving all four limbs, in two patients, and the lower limbs, in three patients. Three of those patients were females, and peripheral neuropathy developed after the diagnosis of JSLE. The mean age of onset of the disease was 14 years, and the mean time between the onset of JSLE and the diagnosis of <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> was 23 months. The most common clinical presentations included muscular weakness and hyporeflexia. Antiphospholipid antibodies were present in all patients. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids in all patients, associated with intravenous cyclophosphamide in three patients. One patient evolved to functional disability and paresis of the lower limbs, requiring a wheelchair. One female patient died of severe sepsis.

Antibodies to {{sulfatide}} {{have been}} reported in various demyelinating <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathies.</b> We have investigated the diagnostic value of these antibodies in leprosy. Anti-sulfatide IgM in leprosy patients was not significantly elevated. High anti-sulfatide IgG titers were observed in individuals from endemic areas, irrespective of their leprosy status, while western European controls were negative. No significant correlation was found between IgM or IgG antibody titers and leprosy classification, although multibacillary patients had higher anti-sulfatide IgM titers than paucibacillary patients. In addition, 23 patients developing leprosy reactions were followed longitudinally. Antibody titers in these patients fluctuated slightly during the follow-up period. There was no association with the occurrence of leprosy reactions or treatment. Thus, IgG titers against sulfatides are high in both leprosy patients and healthy controls in endemic areas, whereas such antibodies are not found in western European controls, suggesting that these antibodies are induced by environmental factors, such as microorganisms.

Alternative RNA splicing in the NH 2 -terminal region produces high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) isoforms of slow TnT. Normal adult slow muscle fibers express mainly HMW slow TnT. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) {{is a group}} of inherited <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathies</b> caused by various neuronal defects. We found in the present study that LMW slow TnT was significantly upregulated in demyelination form type 1 CMT (CMT 1) but not axonal form type 2 CMT (CMT 2) muscles. Contractility analysis showed an increased specific force in single fibers isolated from CMT 1 but not CMT 2 muscles compared with control muscles. However, an in vitro motility assay showed normal velocity of the myosin motor isolated from CMT 1 and CMT 2 muscle biopsies, consistent with their unchanged myosin isoform contents. Supporting a role of slow TnT isoform regulation in contractility change, LMW and HMW slow TnT isoforms showed differences in the molecular conformation in conserved central and COOH-terminal regions with changed binding affinity for troponin I and tropomyosin. In addition to providing a biochemical marker for the differential diagnosis of CMT, the upregulation of LMW slow TnT isoforms under the distinct pathophysiology of CMT 1 demonstrates an adaptation of muscle function to neurological disorders by alternative splicing modification of myofilament proteins...|$|R

Using electromyographic recording of the trigeminal reflexes and motor responses, we sought trigeminal dysfunction in 50 patients with peripheral neuropathy, and tried to gain pathophysiological information on the mechanisms provoking trigeminal damage. Trigeminal reflex recordings (early and late blink reflex after supraorbital stimulation, early and late masseter inhibitory reflex after mental stimulation, and jaw jerk) disclosed abnormalities caused by sensory trigeminal neuropathy in 8 out of 15 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 13 out of 23 patients with severe diabetic polyneuropathy, and in none of 12 patients with mild diabetic polyneuropathy. Six patients had abnormal motor responses in facial or masseter muscles. The response affected most frequently was the masseter early inhibitory reflex (also called first silent period, SP 1) after mental nerve stimulation, its latency being strongly delayed. We found these long delays not only in patients with CIDP, but also in diabetic patients with severe polyneuropathy. We conclude that <b>peripheral</b> <b>polyneuropathies</b> often cause subclinical damage to the trigeminal nerve, especially to its mandibular branch.

When the roots were compared with the peripheral nerves, myelin deficiencies appeared more severe at the radicular levels, in particular the ventral roots. Decreased numbers of large calibre axons were a prominent feature in the motor branches of both strains of PMP 22 -mutant mice, and these axonal deficits were more severe distally. Active axonal damage was only observed in the nerves of PMP 22 (0 / 0) mice.
