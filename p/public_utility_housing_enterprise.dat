50|$|The Horseshoe Estate is {{strongly}} associated with Bruno Taut (1880-1938). Taut {{was not only the}} chief architect of the Horseshoe Estate, but also acted as the chief architect of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>housing</b> <b>enterprise</b> GEHAG, was part of the Deutscher Werkbund and had a decisive influence on the architecture of the “Neues Bauen” (New Building) movement in Berlin. Four out of six estates that gained the UNESCO World Heritage status were developed under his responsibility. Bruno Taut was accompanied by Martin Wagner (1885-1957), who acted as an outstanding political organiser and networker and is regarded as the key figure in the construction of Berlin’s housing estates. Showing considerable vision, he created the logistical and political foundations for “Neues Bauen” in Berlin. He initiated the founding of GEHAG (a non-profit building society and housing cooperative), was a co-founder of the “Deutsche Bauhütte” and the director of various influential professional associations. Initially responsible as the second architect for the Stavenhagener Straße section of the Horseshoe Estate, Martin Wagner was appointed in 1926 to the position of city planning director of Greater Berlin, which had been created in 1920. Taut and Wagner were supported by Leberecht Migge (1881-1935), a freelance landscape architect who is regarded as a pioneer of social and nature-oriented garden design and who draw the first designs for the green and open spaces of the Horseshoe Estate. However, only some of these designs were implemented by Ottokar Wagler, the director of the parks and gardens department in the district of Berlin-Neukölln.|$|E
50|$|This {{enormous}} {{influx of}} people {{was confronted with}} an extreme lack of housing. Particularly in working class districts like Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg or Wedding the hygienic conditions were catastrophic. During the interwar period high-quality architecture was built {{on a large scale}} by the city of Berlin for broad sections of the population. From 1924 to 1931 alone 140,000 flats were built. In particular the Berlin housing estates built before the beginning of National Socialism set standards worldwide and are seen right up to today as a major political and organisational achievement. In order to provide an appropriate organizational body for the construction of these estates <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>housing</b> <b>enterprises</b> were founded. One of these enterprises, the 1924 founded GEHAG (Gemeinnützige Heimstätten-, Spar- und Bau-Aktiengesellschaft) hired Bruno Taut to act as the chief architect and was responsible for the construction of the estate. Together with five further building projects, the Horseshoe Estate was given UNESCO world heritage status in 2008 as one of six Berlin Modernism Housing Estates, which underscores its international architectural importance.The heritage protected part of the Hufeisensiedlung, which was built between 1925 and 1930, extends over a total of six building sections and an area of around 29 hectares. It consists of 1,285 flats, which are in three-storey buildings aligned with the street, and 679 terraced houses, each with a garden and a small terrace. A further, seventh building section {{is not part of the}} world heritage site. It is south-east of the junction between Fritz-Reuter-Allee and Parchimer Allee and was built without the involvement of Bruno Taut. Especially interesting from the point of view of architectural history is a comparison between the first two building sections and the sixth section, which is located opposite. Here, unlike in any other place in Berlin, it is possible to see all together and at first hand the architectural concepts of that time - Garden city movement, large-scale housing development, and Neues Bauen.|$|R

40|$|Research {{purpose is}} {{identification}} of sales problems of energy saving actions for residential sector of economy, including {{with use of}} the power service contract. The choice of {{the object of the}} study is related to the general issues on energy saving of residential facilities and increasing the number of unresolved problems. Unfortunately, the efficiency of energy consumption of housing stock is extremely low that directly leads to an increase in citizens’ payments for <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> (<b>housing</b> and communal services). There are many problems associated with the aging of fixed assets: it becomes especially evident in winter seasons. The level of quality of delivery, distribution and consumption of expensive heat resources that has the greatest impact on a residence comfort and sometimes human life and health, is very low. Our population faces to year overheating or freezing, to leakages through worn pipes and the subsequent disconnection of water and heat. Despite the public declaration of the of the active processes of modernization of the housing municipal economy in the Russian Federation, the implementation of the necessary energy-saving elements in the housing sector is evolving very slowly. The article presents conceptual positions, which will bring the issues related to energy saving and efficiency to a new level...|$|R

50|$|Little Wobby was {{originally}} {{occupied by the}} Commonwealth Military Forces during the Second World War. Several buildings were erected along the shoreline to house artillery batteries {{in case of a}} Japanese invasion through Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury River. A submarine net was also put in place across the river. Two of these buildings still exist as dwellings, into which they were converted after the war. In the 1970s a plan was mooted for the State government to purchase all of the properties along the shore and demolish the houses in order to rehabilitate the land and return it to being part of the national park. This never went ahead. The only <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> the <b>houses</b> enjoy are telephone and electricity.

40|$|Interior space {{conditioning}} means heating or cooling building interior space to pro- vide comfort to occupants. In the modern world, the thermostat {{is a popular}} form utilized in residential and commercial buildings. Although the thermostat industry has recently matured, {{the development of new}} technology provides new opportunities to interior {{space conditioning}}. Motivated by the energy crisis, a demand response- enabled interior space conditioning system is designed for residential users. The feature of completely autonomous controls improves the acceptability and usability of the system. Built on low-cost, low-power wireless technology, the system uses a disaggregated set of sensors and actuators. The software adopts a hierarchical layered structure, providing modularization of functions and semi-independent design. User interfaces provide easy and instructive interaction to users. The system interacts with the <b>public</b> <b>utility,</b> <b>houses</b> and their HVAC systems, users and outside climates. Robust adaptive control is used to address system uncertainties. Validation tools were developed to evaluate the system. As the major contribution of this research to interior space conditioning, super- visory controls were developed to locate the optimal control settings. Adopting a hierarchical structure, supervisory controls determine control modes, control strate- gies/states, and control settings. To meet users' various requirements on utility cost and thermal comfort, four control strategies/states were designed: the normal strat- egy, the pre-cooling/pre-heating strategy, the pre-conditioning strategy and the over- lapping strategy. The supervisory control strategies were realized by hybrid methods. Expert systems were utilized to choose control mode and control state. Model-based methods or performance-based methods were adopted in each state to seek optimal control settings. Results from computer simulations and field tests indicate that the system responds automatically to price signals with appropriate behavior of energy saving and load shifting. By identifying dynamic signatures of individual houses, the system is able to adapt its control strategies to a house and its HVAC systems {{as well as to the}} ever-changing outdoor conditions. In conclusion, the thesis successfully demonstrates an intelligent, adaptive and autonomous interior space conditioning system under the context of demand response for residential buildings...|$|R

The calculation is based on spreadsheets calculation, very easy to develop on most PC´s now a days. Construction works, are a field where the evaluation of Cash Flow can be and should be applied. Decisions about cash flow in construction are decisions with long-term impact and long-term memory.

40|$|In Belarus, {{divestiture}} {{of social}} assets, a misnomer for fringe benefits that comprise {{a part of}} wages, is needed to transform enterprises so they can function appropriately in a market economy. Maintaining supply of these services after enterprise divestiture is an important public policy problem in transition economies. These fringe benefits, issued mainly {{in the form of}} housing and kindergarten services, were cut by at least two-thirds as a proportion of employee remuneration between 1994 and 1995 because of the economic downturn. This report debates whether most of these fringe benefits should continue to be subsidized or receive preferential tax treatment. A strong case is made for some government funding of the public health and kindergarten services, and <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> and <b>housing</b> services divested by enterprises. The reasons for assigning services such as education and health to local governments is debated and financing arrangements such as revenue sharing are examined. Among the problems cited with the latter are interregional imbalances caused by unequal resources distribution, tax breaks given to agriculture which has reduced payments to rural local governments, the absence of close links between beneficiaries and payers justifying extrabudgetary funding, and inadequate subnational government taxation raising insignificant amounts of revenue. Where transfers to local governments are required, formula financing is suggested for unconditional grants to low-income local governments and conditional grants to support specific objectives.
