The monolayers {{are found to}} undergo a transition from a phase with alkyl chains tilted toward nearest neighbors (NN) to a phase with chains tilted toward next-nearest neighbors (NNN) upon monolayer compression. This transition {{gives rise to a}} sudden reorientation of the molecules that is determined by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). At T > 15 °C, <b>palmityl</b> acetate monolayers undergo a first-order transition from a fluid phase to a condensed phase indicated by a plateau region in the π−A isotherm. The transition pressure increases with increasing temperature. At low temperatures a phase with alkyl chains tilted toward nearest neighbors is formed from the fluid phase. The critical pressure for the transition between the tilted phases changes only slightly with temperature. Consequently, a phase with chains tilted toward next-nearest neighbors is formed directly from the fluid phase at high temperatures. Then no reorientation of molecules is observed by BAM. The textures of the condensed-phase domains formed during the transition from a fluid phase to a condensed phase are temperature-dependent. Some domains are subdivided into six segments of different orientation. In such domains the molecular chains are tilted along the bisector of the segments at T 24 °C.

The properties of the thiourea dendrimers have been studied by IR and H- 1 NMR, including relaxation (T 1, T 2) measurements. The thiourea dendrimers are used as multivalent hosts {{for a number of}} guest molecules containing a terminal urea-glycine unit in organic solvents. The host-guest interactions have been investigated using 1 D- and NOESY-NMR. These investigations show that the guest molecules bind to the dendritic host via thiourea (host) -urea (guest) hydrogen bonding, and ionic bonding between the terminal guest carboxylate moiety and the outer shell tertiary amines of the dendrimer. The ability to bind guest molecules of the adamantyl- and palmitylthiourea dendrimers has been compared with their respective urea containing dendrimer analogues, by NMR-titration, and competition experiments. Upon complexation, the thiourea dendrimer hosts show a larger downfield NH. shift than the corresponding urea dendrimer hosts, indicative of stronger hydrogen bonding in the complexed state. Furthermore, microcalorimetry has been used to determine binding constants for formation of the host-guest complexes; the binding constants are typically in the order of 10 (4) M- 1.

40|$|Wax esters are esters of {{long-chain}} {{fatty acids}} and long-chain fatty alcohols which are of considerable commercial importance and are produced {{on a scale}} of 3 million tons per year. The oil from the jojoba plant (Simmondsia chinensis) is the main biological source of wax esters. Although it has a multitude of potential applications, the use of jojoba oil is restricted, due to its high price. In this study, we describe the establishment of heterologous wax ester biosynthesis in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain by coexpression of a fatty alcohol-producing bifunctional acyl-coenzyme A reductase from the jojoba plant and a bacterial wax ester synthase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP 1, catalyzing the esterification of fatty alcohols and coenzyme A thioesters of fatty acids.

40|$|Results of {{previous}} research on whole-cell cultures of Penicillium chrysogenum have suggested that acetyl CoA, without being converted to malonyl CoA, supplies the two carbon units for the elongation of palmitic acid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the mode of elongation of 1 -t 4 C <b>palmityl</b> CoA by a 20, 000 x g mitochondrial pellet from P. chrysogenum. Acetyl CoA or malonyl CoA was incubated with radioactivelylabeled <b>palmityl</b> CoA for 20 minutes. Avidin was added to some experimental reaction mixtures. The resulting fatty acids were saponified, extracted with hexane, methylated with diazomethane, and purified by thin layer chromatography. The methyl esters were separated and identified by gas-liquid chromatography. The radioactivity of each methyl ester was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Elongation of <b>palmityl</b> CoA was observed in the presence of acetyl CoA, but not in the presence of malonyl CoA. The addition avidin produced a greater proportion of short-chained fatty acidsthe expense of palmitic acid, but did not decrease the percentage of long-chained fatty acids produced. A high proportion of label was recovered in the C 18 : 3 fatty acid, linolenic acid. This suggested that two pathways of linolenic acid synthesis may be operating in this organism. Methods for detection and control of cancer encompass a large area of today's research. Recent use of granulomas as a model for such detection and control may be a promising field, especially for monitoring tumor antigens and immune responses. These granuloma systems are increasingly becoming vehicles in the study of tumor immunology. Although granulomas may be induced naturally by means of foreign bodies i. e. viral, fungal, or bacterial agents, new methods are being established to produce artificial granuloma systems. These systems include chemical or foreign body implantations followed by tumor vaccine challenges. The research presented here involved the use of a golf ball-induced granuloma for the purpose of establishment of a detection system for immune responses. The use of a golf ball-induced granuloma provided a closed system for monitoring cell-mediated and humoral responses to tumor antigens. Immune responses were monitored by means of hematocrits (packed blood cell counts), white blood cell differential counts, and electrophoretic results. Hematocrit results indicated no great immune response to the closed vaccine injected granulomasystems. Observations made on differential white blood cell counts indicated decreasing neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios for cellular immune responses. Electrophoretic results for granuloma fluids indicated decreases in albumin levels concurrent with increases in peak two,and complete loss of peak three following vaccination. Responses to tumor specific antigens in the form of cell-mediated immune responses are indicated by the results presented in this research. Utilization of the golf ball-induced granuloma system provided a means of separating the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Tumor specific antigens elicited various immune responses and provide hope for future identification of tumors by this method. Future development and utilization of the golf ball-induced granuloma system may be potential means of monitoring cell-mediated immune responses to tumor malignancies. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|E

Of the sterols identified, β-sitosterol {{was found to be}} the major compound together with minor amounts of cholesterol, ergosterol, stigmasterol, and stigmastanol. <b>Palmityl</b> palmitate and oleyl palmitate were identified as the major components in waxes. The steryl esters analyzed were composed of steryl laurate, steryl myristate, steryl palmitate, steryl heptadecanoate, and steryl oleate. Tripalmitin, dipalmitoyl-oleoylglycerol, and triolein were the major components of the triglycerides.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a sustained (7 -day) decrease in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations on insulin action and intramyocellular long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs), we studied {{the effect of a}}cipimox, a potent inhibitor of lipolysis, in seven type 2 diabetic patients (age 53 3 years, BMI 30. 2 2. 0 kg/m 2, fasting plasma glucose 8. 5 0. 8 mmol/l, HbA 1 c 7. 5 0. 4 %). Subjects received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 120 -min euglyce-mic insulin (80 mU/m 2 per min) clamp with 3 -[3 H]glucose/ vastus lateralis muscle biopsies to quantitate rates of insulin-mediated whole-body glucose disposal (Rd) and intramyocellular LCFA-CoAs before and after acipimox (250 mg every 6 h for 7 days). Acipimox significantly reduced fasting plasma FFAs (from 563 74 to 230 33 mol/l; P 0. 05). Basal EGP did not change after acipimox (1. 9 0. 2 vs. 1. 9 0. 2 mg kg 1 min 1). Total muscle LCFA-CoA content decreased after acipimox treatment (from 7. 26 0. 58 to 5. 64 0. 79 nmol/g; P < 0. 05). Decreases were also seen in muscle <b>palmityl</b> CoA (16 : 0; from 1. 06 0. 10 to 0. 75 0. 11 nmol/g...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of acetate}} on energy {{metabolism}} and {{function in the}} isolated perfused rat heart. Impairment of cardiac contractile function {{is an important component}} of acetate associated hypotension during hemodialysis treatments. We examined the effect of acetate on cardiac energy metabolism using the isovolumic isolated perfused heart model. In this preparation, acetate (10 M) caused decreases in tissue ATP concentrations (12. 3 ± 0. 8 vs. 15. 6 ± 1. 0 µmol/g dry at 30 min, P < 0. 05) as well as marked impairment of systolic function (dpdt = 863 ± 135 vs. 1288 ± 166 mm Hg/second at 30 min, P < 0. 05). Although altering perfusate calcium concentrations (0. 6, 1. 2 and 2. 4 mM) affected physiological responses to acetate (5 and 10 mM), the reductions in tissue ATP concentrations were similar. In isolated heart mitochondria, acetate (100 µM - 10 mM) selectively impaired octanoate and <b>palmityl</b> carnitine supported State 3 respiration in a dose dependent fashion (P < 0. 01), but did not affect respiration when succinate, pyruvate/malate or malate/glutamate was used as substrate. We suggest that high concentrations of acetate selectively impair fatty acid metabolism in heart issue. This in turn leads to decreases in ATP production and tissue ATP concentrations that ultimately result in impaired contractile function. As this occurs at relatively low concentrations of acetate, this finding may be relevant to other parenterally-administered acetate containing fluids...|$|E
