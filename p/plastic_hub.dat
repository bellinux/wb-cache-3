50|$|A pen needle {{consists}} of a hollow needle which is embedded in a <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> and attaches to injection pens. Pen needles {{come in a variety}} of needle lengths and diameters and are used by health professionals and patients for injection of a variety of medications. They are commonly used by people with diabetes who often require multiple daily insulin.|$|E

We describe a curved and a straight version consisting of <b>plastic</b> <b>hubs,</b> 20 gauge proximal and 25 gauge distal stainless steel hypodermic tubing, and soft and flexible silicone tubing overmounts. Both these cannulas facilitate atraumatic drainage of subretinal fluid through pre-existing retinal holes and tears or through a retinotomy performed during vitreoretinal microsurgery...|$|R
5000|$|Each Clickfine pen needle {{attaches}} to an insulin pen through a <b>plastic</b> needle <b>hub.</b> These hubs are specially {{designed to allow}} a click-on or screw-on attachment to the pen, depending on the user’s preference. Each pen needle features two protective caps {{as well as a}} layer of foil to protect the user and ensure sterility.|$|R
5000|$|Norev plastic {{models were}} {{known for their}} bright body colors and their red (sometimes black) <b>plastic</b> <b>hubs</b> with white tires. Some of the {{attention}} to detail is notable, such as with the Citroen DS sedan, on the real car the roof section was separate and made of plastic. The Norev toy also made the roof a separate plastic section. Unfortunately, when that plastic {{came in contact with}} the body, a chemical reaction often caused discoloration (Ralston 2008, p. 32). Most models were available in both free-wheeling and friction motor versions (Ralston 2008, pp. 26, 31). Early bases were unpainted and shiny - later they were painted black (Ralston 2008, p. 30). Detail and proportion were very good and though the early models lacked windows (the Citroen DS was the first model to sport them), they were very successful and cheaper than the diecast metal competition (read that 'Dinky'; Ralston 2008, p. 25).|$|R
50|$|Those brakes use {{brake drums}} {{attached}} to the wheel with the 5 wheel-screws (Scrub). They are cheap and brake rigidly but get extremely hot and tend to melt the <b>plastic</b> <b>hub.</b> Good emergency brakes only, not any good for long steep hills. There is currently no heat resistant hub where they would attach to, which could however be easily made of e.g. alloy.|$|E
50|$|Each pen needle is {{embedded}} in a <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> that can attach to the pen {{by means of a}} twist-on fitting or a click-on. Two protective caps (outer and inner caps) protect the user and the needle. The peel foil protects the sterility of the needle and holds information such as lot number, and needle length and gauge. Pen needles vary by needle length and diameter(gauge).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} safety, {{technical}} efficacy, and histopathology of the {{ethylene vinyl alcohol}} copolymer (EV AL) embolic mixture in an animal model. METHODS: Microcatheterization of the rete was performed in 29 swine. The clinical, angiographic, and histopathologic consequences of superselective injection of the two principal embolic mixture components (EVAL and dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) were evaluated. Necropsy and standard histologic preparation were used for pathologic analysis. RESULTS: Significant technical difficulties and adverse outcomes occurred. The EV AL mixture was difficult to see under fluoroscopy and prematurely polymerized during one embolization, resulting in catheter occlusion. However, polymerized EVAL did not adhere to the catheter. DMSO damaged the <b>plastic</b> <b>hubs</b> of the microcatheters. Infusions of DMSO always caused immediate, moderate to severe vasospasm and frequently caused either subarachnoid hemorrhage or stroke. Histopathologic findings of both DMSO and DMSO plus EVAL were similar, producing variable endothelial denuding, thrombosis, and disruption of internal elastic lamina in the acute stage. An intense, mixed inflammatory response, organized thrombus, and transmural necrosis with extravasation were seen in the subacute and chronic stages. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having some desirable features as an embolic agent, significant problems were encountere...|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{are made}} up of <b>plastic</b> or metal <b>hubs</b> and {{pneumatic}} tires ranging in size of 8-13 inches. The 8" [...] wheel has evolved into the best choice for freestyle riding, and also an all purpose wheel for general riding. Larger wheels (generally 9" [...] and 10") are more useful to the downhill rider; granting the rider access to high-speed runs and more stability when travelling at speed.|$|R
50|$|A {{quick change}} system is {{commonly}} used with disc type coated abrasives. A <b>plastic</b> or metal <b>hub</b> is bonded {{to one of the}} faces, which is threaded. This then mates directly to the sander/grinder or to a mandrel that can be mounted in a sander, grinder, or drill. The advantage is that the disc can be quickly replaced when needed. Quick change discs range in sizes from 50 mm to no upper limit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{durability and}} reliability of DECtape was underscored when {{the design of the}} tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a retaining spring was replaced by a lower cost single-piece <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> with 6 flexible arms in a [...] "starfish" [...] or [...] "flower" [...] shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that tape and wind it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an Engineering Change Order (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case where the {{hypodermic}} needle used to administer the local anaesthetic broke off from the <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> during the administration of a penile block in an adult and migrated 15 cm to the left groin. This prompted a review of the manufacturer’s technical data and biomechanical studies. On the basis of these, we recommend that utmost care be taken to maintain control of the needle during injection, particularly to prevent buckling forces that might lead to breakage...|$|E
30|$|There are {{costs to}} {{processing}} these additional specimens, though these costs are relatively low. There are {{risks to the}} surgeon as well. The use of an 18 -gauge spinal needle to penetrate cortical bone of the ilium and proximal femur may not be ideal. Placing a gauze sponge or sterile towel between the surgeon’s glove and the <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> of the spinal needle should prevent injury {{from the base of}} the needle, potentially exposed should the hub ride up the shaft while attempting to twist the spinal needle into bone. Alternative sampling needles such as a Jamshidi needle might be preferable, though their effectiveness has not been examined.|$|E

50|$|By 1968 or 1969 interiors, {{steering}} wheels, opening hoods {{and engine}} detail {{had all been}} added on various models (Force 1991, p. 149). Earlier engine detail was painted silver and later, chromed. For example, the Simca 1100 sedan had an opening hood and tail gate. Some models experienced glue distortion under roofs or warping of bodies over time, which is unusual for styrene. Early tires were solid white <b>plastic</b> with solid <b>hubs</b> or with different colored hubs (say beige or dark red) while later tires were a slightly softer polyurethane with simple metal hubs similar to Tekno or Corgi (Ralston 2007, pp. 34-35). Some plastic wheels were done in a wire style, sometimes in chrome, sometimes just in simple body color. By the 1970s, bodies were better formed with pieces fitting together much better (Force 1991, p. 150).|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{shortcomings}} with the jewel case. The case is hinged on two brittle plastic arms, which often break if the case receives shock or stress due to being dropped. The teeth of the hub holding the disc are also prone to failure by snapping. There is a problem with the tabs ("half-moons") which hold the liner notes in place; sometimes, especially with larger booklets, the tabs grip the booklet too tightly, leading to tearing. When replacing the booklet, it can get snagged and crumple or rip. As noted above, some CD releases have only two tabs, which allows the booklet to be more easily removed and replaced (with the disadvantage of the booklet sometimes falling out if held the wrong way). Replacement jewel cases can be purchased, to replace those that have broken <b>plastic</b> arms or <b>hub</b> teeth.|$|R
40|$|Certain {{types of}} {{stainless}} steel needles with metal hubs, and also a fistula set with projecting internal edges, were used at the venous end of the haemodialysis circuit and {{found to be associated}} with undesirable rises in extracorporeal pressure in 56 to 64 % of dialyses. These increases in pressure are likely {{to be the result of}} platelet thrombus formation at the hub of the needle brought about by turbulent flow. The use of a plastic cannula and a stainless steel needle with a <b>plastic</b> <b>hub,</b> both of which have smooth internal surfaces, resulted in increases in pressure in only 4 to 12 % of dialyses...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} report of direct intrajejunal feeding in 1858 by Busch, ’ feeding jejunostomy has {{undergone}} sev-eral modifications. Delany et aF, 3 used a commercially available catheter marketed for central venous cannula-tion for creating the recent modification of feeding jeju-nostomy termed, needle catheter jejunostomy (NCJ). According to their technique, a seromuscular tunnel is created by inserting a 14 -gauge needle into {{the wall of the}} bowel through a 3 - 0 silk purse-string suture. The needle is then turned into the lumen of the bowel and approximately 10 inches of 16 -gauge Polyvinyl catheter is threaded down the jejunal lumen. After withdrawing the metal needle, the purse string is secured. At this stage the <b>plastic</b> <b>hub</b> of the catheter is amputated to enable the removal of the needle.

5000|$|The first {{magnetic}} tapes were manufactured by BASF in Germany in 1932. They were designed with iron carbonyl as the magnetic pigment mixed into the cellulose acetate carrier. Production soon moved to iron oxide coated onto cellulose acetate rolls cut into uniform strips wound onto <b>plastic</b> or metal <b>hubs.</b> Recordists began recording sound on magnetic {{media in the}} twenties {{in the form of}} magnetic wire. After World War II, the advantages of tape in terms of sturdiness and the ability to edit by cutting and splicing made tape preferable to wire as the magnetic medium of choice. Tape consists of a coating of a magnetic pigment, typically iron oxide (Fe2O3), on a long strip of polyester (polyethelyne terephthalate) base film. This base film has been used since the mid-sixties as a replacement for acetate bases film that was prone to chemical instability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diameter}} of the needle is indicated by the needle gauge. Various needle lengths are available for any given gauge. There {{are a number of}} systems for gauging needles, including the Stubs Needle Gauge and the French Catheter Scale. Needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge (the largest) to 33 (the smallest) on the Stubs scale. 21-gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes, and 16- or 17-gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation, as the resulting lower pressure is less harmful to red blood cells (it also allows more blood to be collected in a shorter time). Although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications, disposable needles are far more common in medicine. Disposable needles are embedded in a <b>plastic</b> or aluminium <b>hub</b> that attaches to the syringe barrel by means of a press-fit or twist-on fitting. These are sometimes referred to as [...] "Luer Lock" [...] connections, referring to the trademark Luer-Lok.|$|R
40|$|Wind energy {{applications}} have rapidly {{increased in}} the world, so the efficiency of wind energy constructions is gaining importance. Using small wind turbines, farmers, ranchers, and homeowners can reduce their utility bills, stabilize their electricity supplies, {{and contribute to the}} nation's energy supply, and thus {{play an important role in}} securing our energy future. Distributed wind electric systems represent an opportunity for some nations in particular. This study aims (i) to investigate the efficiency differences between three bladed glass reinforced <b>plastics</b> (GRP) rigid <b>hubs,</b> three bladed steel rigid hubs and twelve bladed steel rigid hubs experimentally, and (ii) to improve the performance of the small wind turbine system (SWTSs) installed at the Solar Energy Institute of Ege University (latitude 38. 24 Â° N, longitude 27. 50 Â° E), Izmir, Turkey. NACA 4415 (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) series blades are preferred to others in this experiment, because of the fact that this profile has shown excellent properties for small wind turbine blades and their average power coefficients are higher than those of other blades. In this study, the performance parameters of the SWTSs are given first. An experimental study is then presented. Finally, the results obtained from the present study are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication, and characterization {{of a second}} generation biomimetic jellyfish robot that uses ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) as flexible actuators for propulsion. The shape and swimming style of this underwater vehicle {{are based on the}} Aurelia aurita jellyfish, which has an average swimming speed of 13 mm/s and which is known for a high swimming efficiency. The critical components of the vehicle include the flexible bell that provides the overall shape and dimensions of the jellyfish, a central hub used to provide electrical connections and mechanical support to the actuators, and flexible IPMC actuators that extend radially from the central hub. In order to provide increased shape holding ability and reduced weight, the bell is fabricated from a commercially available heat-shrinkable polymer film. A new lightweight hub has been designed and was fabricated by 3 D printing using ABS <b>plastic</b> material. The <b>hub</b> features internal electrical contacts for providing voltage to the individual IPMC actuators. Finally, a new set of IPMC actuators are manufactured using the Direct Assembly Process (DAP). The IPMC actuators constructed for this study demonstrated peak-to-peak strains of ∼ 0. 7 % in water across a frequency range of 0. 1 – 1. 0 Hz. By tailoring the applied voltage waveform and the flexibility of the bell, the completed robotic jellyfish swam at maximum speed of 1. 5 mm/s. N/...|$|R
