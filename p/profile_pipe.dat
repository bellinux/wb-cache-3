40|$|The {{intention}} {{with this}} thesis was to evaluate how much pickling {{that have been}} achieved on aluminium details in the pickling bath before the anodization in an anodization process. As there were no earlier studies to use around pickling before anodization, statistical experimental design was chosen as planning tool. Statistical experimental design was used to plan the experiments in an organized way and to evaluate how the pickling process works together with the main effects and the interaction effects. Detailed scientific studies were performed on how aluminium is prepared and how the anodization process works. The studies were performed in reference books. Three different methods were designed. The first method, method 1, {{was based on a}} fractional factorial design with four design variables, temperature, sodium hydroxide and aluminium concentrations and the time the details was submerged into the pickling bath. The aluminium details was made from a square <b>profile</b> <b>pipe.</b> There was nine experiments performed in method 1. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the pickled surface and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the square profile pipes. The control showed that the standard deviation was 11 µm. Method 2 was based on a complete factorial design where the design variables was temperature and the time the details was submerged into the pickling bath. All aluminium details were homogenous. There were seven experiments performed in method 2. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the pickled surface and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the homogenous details. The control showed that the standard deviation was 14 µm. Method 3 was designed in a different way than method 1 and 2. In method 3 one experiment was performed and the design variable which was changed was the time when the details was submerged into the pickling bath. The aluminium details had the form of homogenous cubes. The measurements on the pickling was performed by measuring the weight of the details on an analytical scale before and after the pickling, and then calculate the pickling in µm in two different ways. The first way was to use the atomic radius of aluminium and the second way was to use the size of the unit cell of aluminium. The two first methods gave very different results than the third method. The result for method 1 showed very random values with great dispersion which resulted in a non-detectable pickling. The result for method 2 was very similar to the result from method 1, very random values with great dispersion and no pickling was detectable with any confidence. The result from method 3 gave a theoretical calculated result for the pickling, when the aluminium details was submerged in the pickling bath for 1 minute, and based on the atomic radius of aluminium, of 1, 52 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 1, 62 µm. When the aluminium details were submerged in the pickling bath for 3 minutes, the theoretical calculation with the atomic radius of aluminium gave that the pickling was 4, 51 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 4, 79 µm...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoplastic pipes {{are often}} {{manufactured}} with profiled walls to max-imize the flexural stiffness {{of the pipe}} for a given amount of polymer. Thin elements in the profile can buckle {{under the influence of}} large earth pressures associated with deep burial or other extreme loading conditions. Earth load tests have been conducted on high density polyethylene pipes with a number of different wall <b>profiles.</b> Two high-pressure <b>pipe</b> test cells have been used to conduct these tests. Observations of local buckling in the internal liners of these products have been examined and compared to stability assessments based on the conventional equation for buckling in stiffened plate structures (following modification of that equation to an equation that defines critical strain instead of critical stress). The strain levels that develop in the liner are, however, dependent on three-dimensional bending within the <b>pipe</b> <b>profile.</b> Provided the effects of three-dimensional bending in the <b>pipe</b> <b>profile</b> are considered, the modified Bryan equa-tion appears to be a useful tool for quantifying liner stability and should be considere...|$|R

40|$|To {{minimize}} disruptions {{of economic}} and social activities on the ground surface in urban areas, trenchless techniques such as pipe bursting are often considered for underground pipeline construction, rehabilitation, and renewal of existing utility services. Pipe bursting, however, inevitably induces outward displacements of surrounding soil, and subsequently leads to potential damages to adjacent structures and utilities. This paper carries out finite element (FE) analyses to investigate effects of the static pipe bursting-induced ground displacements on adjacent pipelines. In total 760 FE parametric studies are performed to encompass various combinations of ground settlement <b>profiles,</b> <b>pipe</b> dimensions, material properties, and soil properties that are typical of utility pipelines and pipe bursting in urban areas. The FE parametric results are summarized in a dimensionless plot of relative pipe-soil stiffness versus ratio of maximum pipe curvature to maximum ground curvature, which can be used to directly estimate the maximum pipe bending strain and (or) directly evaluate pipeline responses to adjacent pipe bursting. A worked example is provided to illustrate usage of the dimensionless plot. It is further found that the pipe-soil interaction is similar for pipe bursting and tunneling, and the effects of both pipe bursting and tunneling on adjacent pipelines can be assessed using a unified dimensionless plot. Effects of the intersection angle between the pipe bursting centerline and adjacent pipeline are explored. The pipe responses are shown to be underestimated or unconservative when only the perpendicular case is considered in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate a computational method for assessing the allowable depth of fill of a buried thermoplastic profile wall (corrugated) plastic pipe and compare the results to the recently adopted AASHTO design method. The computational method is demonstrated for a 1500 mm (60 in.) diameter HDPE <b>profile</b> wall <b>pipe,</b> but is applicable to all <b>profile</b> wall thermoplastic <b>pipe</b> that exhibit local buckling limit states. The computational model compares strain demands predicted from a two-dimensional plane strain finite element model of buried pipe in the embankment condition with strain capacity predicted from a three-dimensional finite element model of a pipe-soil segment undergoing thrust and/or positive and negative bending. The strain demands indicate the dominance of thrust strains, as opposed to bending strains, in the overall behavior, particularly for intermediate to larger fill depths. In the profile, the ultimate strain capacity is limited by local buckling for thrust strains and/or positive bending (crest in compression), and inward radial movement of the crest for negative bending (liner in compression). Depth of fill predictions between the new AASHTO design method for thermoplastic pipe and the computational method agree within 10 % of one another when uniform soil distribution is considered, and withi...|$|R
