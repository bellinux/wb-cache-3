40|$|Higher order {{thinking}} skills (HOTS) is an imperative aspect {{in teaching and}} learning especially at higher education institutions. Students with higher order {{thinking skills}} are able {{to find new ways to}} solve their daily problems and make appropriate decisions. Hence, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of HOTS for generating idea among technical students. This quantitative approach research used the quasi-experimental design with one treatment groups and one control group comprising 81 students. Marzano HOTS was used for generating idea in this research. Meanwhile, individual assignment evaluation rubric was modified to assess the level of achievement on the students’ assignments. The findings showed that there was significant differences between treatment group and control group on the overall individual <b>post</b> <b>assignment</b> result. There were significant differences between treatment group and control group on the five evaluation criteria of individual <b>post</b> <b>assignment</b> result. Besides that, the findings revealed that treatment group have significant differences between individual pre and <b>post</b> <b>assignment</b> on overall and five evaluation criteria result. Consequently, learning HOTS by using self-instructional manual approach for generating ideas is significantly effective...|$|R

40|$|Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) {{is arguably}} the most {{well-known}} and widely used assignment rule. Although it returns an ex <b>post</b> efficient <b>assignment,</b> Bogomolnaia and Moulin (A new solution to the random assignment problem, J. Econ.

The result raises the following question: under what conditions is RSD not SD-efficient? In this comment, we give a detailed argument that the RSD assignment is not SD-efficient if and only if an ex <b>post</b> <b>assignment</b> exists that is not SD-efficient.

Other forms of evaluation of promptness are presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear programming {{formulation of the}} dynamic user-equilibrium assignment problem (DUE) for urban road networks with multiple trip origins and destinations. DUE is a temporal generalization of the static user-equilibrium assignment problem (SUE) with additional constraints to insure temporally continuous paths of flow. In DUE, the full <b>assignment</b> <b>period</b> of several hours is discretized into shorter time intervals of 10 - 15 minutes each for which trip departure matrices {{are assumed to be}} known. This formulation of DUE includes SUE as a special case in which there is only one time interval for the full <b>assignment</b> <b>period.</b> The assumption of steady-state flows allows SUE to have all linear constraints, but DUE requires nonlinear flow continuity constraints. Whereas SUE is typically solved by methods of linear combinations, these methods create temporally discontinuous flows if applied to DUE. A dynamic traffic assignment heuristic (DTA) is presented that generates approximate solutions to DUE in an efficient manner for large networks. DTA is not a convergent solution algorithm for DUE, but was designed instead to produce assignments that approximate the DUE optimality conditions. An overview of alternative dynamic assignment approaches is given, including the limitations of other optimization and simulation approaches. Test results presented in this paper show that DTA generates both static and dynamic assignments that approximately satisfy the user-equilibrium conditions of these problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Distance {{education}} has {{at its disposal}} new technologies such as the telecommunications data bases. In this article a comparison of these alternatives is presented. Distance education students are geographically separated from their lecturers so that the interactive communication, which the internal student enjoys with the lecturer, can be limited, slow, expensive and frustrating. The traditional mode of communication has been by <b>post,</b> centred around <b>assignments</b> which {{gave rise to the}} term correspondence education. Allowing for marking and internal handling, very few students would receive a reply to a <b>posted</b> <b>assignment</b> within a week and turnaround times of several weeks are not uncommon, which provides little chance for remedial feedback in a semester as short as fourteen weeks. The most popular alternative has been the telephone, which is quite expensive at day-time rates, can be frustrating when "the lecturer is never in his office " and is unable to handle larger messages like essays. Alternative communication media are worthy of investigation since research indicates that the frequency and quality of interaction between the lecturer and student does influence the student's chances of succeeding with the course.

40|$|Abstract—Almost all {{universities}} {{include some}} form of assignment in their courses. The assignments are either carried out in either in groups or individually. To effectively manage these submitted assignments, a well-designed assignment submission system is needed, hence {{the need for an}} online assignment submission system to facilitate the distribution, and collection of assignments on due dates. The objective of such system is to facilitate interaction of lecturers and students for assessment and grading purposes. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a web based online assignment submission system for University of Mauritius. The system was created to eliminate the traditional process of giving an assignment and collecting the answers for the assignment. Lecturers can also create automated assessment to assess the students online. Moreover, the online submission system consists of an automatic mailing system which acts as a reminder for students about the deadlines of the <b>posted</b> <b>assignments.</b> System was tested to measure its acceptance rate among both student and lecturers.

40|$|Using content {{analysis}} of written narratives, this qualitative study explored the mental representations pharmacy students used to explain their own negative health behaviors. In a behavioral pharmacy recitation class, 150 students wrote narratives {{in response to a}} question about their own negative health behaviors. Each narrative was content analyzed. The top three adverse health behaviors were poor diet, smoking and alcohol consumption. The three most common modifications included generalized knowledge acquisition or education, being committed to making a conscious effort to change negative behaviors (i. e., will power), and not responding to peer pressure. It appears that students believe they have good reasons for continuing bad behaviors. However, behavior modifications appeared to be too general to be effective. Students offered prescriptive solutions to negative health behaviors. <b>Post</b> <b>assignment</b> student evaluation showed that most students believed that further training in self-awareness (metacognition) in the pharmacy curriculum, would enhance both personal growth and professional abilities as future pharmacists...|$|R
