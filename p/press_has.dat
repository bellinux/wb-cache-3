50|$|Another {{classification}} is single-acting presses versus double- (seldom triple) acting <b>presses.</b> Single-acting <b>presses</b> <b>have</b> {{one single}} ram. Double-acting <b>presses</b> <b>have</b> a subdivided ram, to manage, for example, blank holding (to avoid wrinkles) with one ram segment and the forming operation {{with the second}} ram segment.|$|R

5|$|The Freedom Press Bookshop is on Angel Alley, No.84b Whitechapel High Street, and was {{established}} in the 1880s by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson as the first publishing house to deal with anarchism and radical publications. The <b>press</b> <b>has</b> been controversial, and was fire-bombed in 2013, but quickly reopened. The Whitechapel Art Gallery on Whitechapel High Street opened in 1899. It was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in 1895 and was the first major art gallery in East London. It has shown works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and David Hockney. It continues to be the centre of the arts scene in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative <b>press</b> <b>has</b> led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rear}} of the main {{entrance}} hall is a series of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history. The first diorama shows various forms of communication and news-sharing in pre-colonial Indonesia. The second diorama shows the press in the colonial period, including the first newspaper in the Indies under the Dutch East India Company, Memories der Nouvelles (1615); the first printed newspaper in the Indies, the Bataviasche Nouvelles (1744), and the first Javanese newspaper in the Indies, Bromartani (1855). The third diorama depicts the press during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts the press during the National Revolution– including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of the press during the New Order under President Suharto, a time of great press censorship. The final diorama depicts the press after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of the <b>press</b> <b>has</b> been granted.|$|E

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic <b>press</b> <b>has</b> six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
