60|$|It {{appeared}} {{that instead of}} Dick having forced Fortune to stand and deliver, he had been held up himself, and made to give hostages to the enemy. That is, as his letter disclosed, {{he was on the}} point of <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to check. All that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter, nineteen years old, as per invoice, whom he was shipping East, charges prepaid, for Jerome to clothe, feed, educate, comfort, and cherish {{for the rest of her}} natural life or until matrimony should them part.|$|E

(After aome private {{instructions}} too [...] intimate to read, he goes on): 'Goodbye--I am not at [...] all afraid of the end, but sad to miss many a simple [...] pleasure which I had planned for the future in our long [...] marches. [...] . We are in a desperate state--feet [...] frozen, etc., no fuel, and a long way from food, but it [...] would do your heart good to be in our tent, to hear our [...] songs and our cheery conversation.

We did intend to finish ourselves [...] when things proved like this, but we have decided to die [...] naturally without.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{found myself}} {{questioning}} that. I {{see now that}} to Margaret it must have seemed the perversest carping against manifest things, {{but at the time}} I was concentrated simply upon the elucidation of her view and my own; I wanted to get at her conception in the sharpest, hardest lines that were possible. It was perfectly clear that she saw Toryism as the diabolical element in affairs. The thing showed in its hopeless untruth all the clearer for the fine, clean emotion with which she gave it out to me. My sleeping peer in the library at Stamford Court and Evesham talking luminously behind the Hartstein flowers embodied the devil, and my replete citizen sucking at his cigar in the National Liberal Club, Willie Crampton discussing the care and management of the stomach over a specially hygienic lemonade, and Dr. Tumpany in his aggressive frock-coat <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> a sort of copyright in Socialism, were the centre and wings of the angelic side. It was nonsense. But how was I to put the truth to her? ...|$|E

60|$|To {{this she}} {{answered}} {{there were other}} sorts, and she had seen one with her own eyes. She had gone one day alone to the next bay, and, perhaps, got too near {{the margin of the}} bad place. The boughs of the high bush overshadowed her from the cant of the hill, but she herself was outside on a flat place, very stony and growing full of young mummy-apples four and five feet high. It was a dark day in the rainy season, and now there came squalls that tore off the leaves and sent them flying, and now it was all still as in a house. It was in one of these still times that a whole gang of birds and flying foxes came <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> of the bush like creatures frightened. Presently after she heard a rustle nearer hand, and saw, coming out of the margin of the trees, among the mummy-apples, the appearance of a lean grey old boar. It seemed to think as it came, like a person; and all of a sudden, as she looked at it coming, she was aware it was no boar but a thing that was a man with a man’s thoughts. At that she ran, and the pig after her, and as the pig ran it holla’d aloud, so that the place rang with it.|$|E
50|$|By chance, in 1883 {{one of the}} {{boundary}} riders, Charles Rasp, discovered mineral samples on the property and pegged out a claim. McCulloch immediately held {{a meeting with the}} station hands and it was agreed to form a Syndicate of Seven <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> a further six blocks of mining leases which were amalgamated to form the privately owned 'Broken Hill Mining Company'. In 1885 silver was discovered, and in order to bring in more capital {{for the development of the}} mine, the original company was floated into the Broken Hill Proprietary Mining Company Ltd.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 Patrick Alexander {{offered his}} {{telescope}} to the War Office, again including {{an offer to}} pay for the construction of an observatory. The offer was accepted and a site was chosen. Building work commenced with <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> in 1906 with the bulk of the work being carried out by local labour. Work proceeded apace until a long, accurate straight edge was required so that the dome could be correctly positioned. Finding such an edge proved difficult and attracted some publicity at the time. The problem was soon overcome. On 26 August 1906 the dome, which also had been designed by Grubb, was installed and over the next three months, the telescope was put in place and final construction work was completed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} used as {{background}} music on two Surf commercials animated by Airside and first broadcast in 2004. The first one depicting an anthropomorphic sock trying {{to escape from the}} washing basket until the lady successfully and finally shoves it into the washing machine. When the lady picks up the empty washing basket, we see another lifelike sock hiding underneath, intent on escaping. The other one (which was slightly more popular than the first one) depicts a red and flushed robin who sees a curly-haired lady <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> washing, flies onto the washing line, inhales the fresh scents from the detergent, and exhales, becoming white again and flying away, whistling. These two commercials ended in the catchphrase [...] "Look on the bright side".|$|E
50|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} to oversee the project, the 'Cavaliers of the Devizes Millennium White Horse', and members of the public were invited to join. The group was also formed to support its future maintenance. Alan Truscott, of Sarsens Housing, joined the committee as the member in charge of the surveying and <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> of the figure of the horse on the hill, alongside did Keith Saunders of Pearce Civil Engineering, who joined to provide the machinery and manpower to complete the clearing of the top soil and the infilling of the chalk following the cutting of the outline, the cutting of which was done by hand by various groups and individuals from the local community. 200 people helped cut the figure. It was anticipated that this project will promote Devizes, its ancient heritage and the attractive countryside surrounding it, as well as to be an additional feature to the tourist map of the area.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 {{minerals}} {{were found}} which suggested {{the presence of}} diamonds. A joint venture was set up with CRA Exploration which they called the Ashton Joint Venture. This was masterminded by Rees Towie, managing director of Northern Mining. In 1979, Maureen married Towie's son John, she became pregnant and she discovered diamond samples in the flood plains surrounding Smoke Creek, a small stream in East Kimberley that drained into Lake Argyle. At the time word had got out {{that there might be}} diamonds and rival exploration teams were in the area. To put them off the scent, CRA put it about that Maureen had gone on maternity leave while in fact she was tracing the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek and <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> the boundaries of her claim. This {{turned out to be the}} world's largest known diamond deposit, larger than all the rest put together. Today these diamonds are among the world's rarest gems and the mine produces one third of global output.|$|E

40|$|Geographical {{position}} of the Chora Pharos (nowadays Starogradsko polje), climate conditions and brief historical development of colonization {{on the island of}} Hvar are described in the paper. Also described is how Greek from the island of Paros established the town Pharos (today’s Stari Grad) and how they constructed Chora Pharos (today’s Starogradsko polje). They divided the field Starogradsko polje into rectangular parcels with dimensions 1 Greek stage × 5 Greek stage (181 m × 905 m). The large project “Starogradsko polje” demonstrated that one Pharos foot equals 0. 3026 m. They used the groma for <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> orthogonal angles. Finally, there is a photograph of the boundary stone from the Chora Pharos (Starogradsko polje) from the 4 th century before Christ which is deposited in the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb.

40|$|Possibly 800 {{people were}} {{present on the}} opening day of the new goldfield, most of who wanted to acquire mining claims or {{residence}} and business sites. The excitement meant they were up early in the morning, and, after struggling up the steep Prospectors’ Spur, following the reading of the proclamation the shots to indicate that <b>pegging</b> <b>out</b> could commence were fired at 10. 00. As several parties marked out the same ground or overlapped others’ claims, Harry Kenrick and his officials readied themselves to resolve disputes. About 60 claims were pegged out, but Kenrick believed that, once these were surveyed, the real number of claims would be much less; his behaviour and recommendations were much praised. In the township rush, 54 sites were competed for, again with rival claims to ownership. Compared with previous rushes, this opening day won accolades for its orderliness, and the new regulations required claims to be fully manned. The names chosen for claims revealed something about their owners, who, like everyone else, hoped for a prosperous field, for it had the potential to benefit the whole region...|$|E
