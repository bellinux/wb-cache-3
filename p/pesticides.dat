5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} <b>pesticides</b> in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible <b>pesticides</b> simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different <b>pesticides</b> at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to <b>pesticides</b> occurred.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pesticides</b> {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by <b>pesticides</b> is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no <b>pesticides</b> are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of <b>pesticides</b> may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Pesticide</b> {{poisoning}} is {{an important}} health problem among Chinese farm workers, {{but there is a}} paucity of <b>pesticide</b> poisoning data from China. Using the WHO standard case definition of a possible acute <b>pesticide</b> poisoning, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of acute work-related <b>pesticide</b> poisoning among farmers in Southern China. Methods A stratified sample of 910 <b>pesticide</b> applicators from two villages in southern China participated in face-to-face interviews. Respondents who self-reported having two or more of a list of sixty-six symptoms within 24 hours after <b>pesticide</b> application were categorized as having suffered acute <b>pesticide</b> poisoning. The association between the composite behavioral risk score and <b>pesticide</b> poisoning were assessed in a multivariate logistic model. Results A total of 80 (8. 8 %) <b>pesticide</b> applicators reported an acute work-related <b>pesticide</b> poisoning. The most frequent symptoms among applicators were dermal (11. 6 %) and nervous system (10. 7 %) symptoms. Poisoning was more common among women, farmers in poor areas, and applicators without safety training (all p 2 = 0. 9246). Conclusions This study found that 8. 8 % of Chinese <b>pesticide</b> applicators suffered acute <b>pesticide</b> poisoning and suggests that <b>pesticide</b> safety training, safe application methods, and precautionary behavioral measures could be effective in reducing the risk of <b>pesticide</b> poisoning. </p...|$|R

5|$|Today, poison is {{used for}} {{a wider variety of}} {{purposes}} than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as <b>pesticides,</b> have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of <b>pesticides</b> has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial <b>pesticides</b> are used each year.

5|$|A 2013 {{study found}} that p-Coumaric acid, which is {{normally}} present in honey, assists bees in detoxifying certain <b>pesticides.</b> Its absence in artificial nutrients fed to bees may therefore contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} <b>pesticides</b> in wax and pollen, but the amounts of <b>pesticides</b> were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of <b>pesticides.</b> However, <b>pesticides</b> have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with <b>pesticides.</b> One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using <b>pesticides</b> or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} <b>pesticides,</b> possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>pesticide</b> misapplication, {{it is necessary to}} establish support systems for appropriate <b>pesticide</b> use by applying information technology (IT) based on prior risk management. This paper introduces the concept of the Navigation System for Appropriate <b>Pesticide</b> Use (Nouyaku-navi), the state of development of the system, functions of the latest system and the results of the demonstration experiment. The latest Nouyaku-navi comprises various functions, as follows: support functions for creating guidelines on pest control, support functions for creating <b>pesticide</b> use plans, judgment functions for the <b>pesticide</b> use plans, on-site warning functions for <b>pesticide</b> application and functions for on-site registration of <b>pesticide</b> application records. Users of the system can create <b>pesticide</b> use plans by means of a personal computer and easily judge their propriety using the Nouyaku-navi judgment server. Also, users can easily use a cellular phone to determine the propriety of <b>pesticide</b> application from farming fields or agrochemical storage lockers just before the application. If the plan has no problem, data on the <b>pesticide</b> application can be simultaneously registered on the system as a <b>pesticide</b> application record.

40|$|Reducing <b>pesticide</b> use in {{agriculture}} {{is a major}} challenge to improve sustainability of cropping systems. It is critical to identify effective integrated farming strategies able to decrease substantially <b>pesticide</b> use. This study {{is based on a}} unique French national network of 1012 arable commercial farms involved in a <b>pesticide</b> reduction program. These farms displayed contrasting levels of <b>pesticide</b> use, and covered a large diversity of environmental characteristics and farming practices. Our objective was to identify profiles of management strategies showing contrasting <b>pesticide</b> use levels in France. Two categories of factors potentially related to <b>pesticide</b> use were considered successively, namely factors describing production situations and factors describing management strategies. Regression tree methods were applied to the dataset to identify combinations of factors associated with low vs. high <b>pesticide</b> use levels. Results showed that, among the factors describing production situations, the presence of livestock, climate conditions, {{and to a lesser extent}} soil characteristics were able to discriminate groups of farms with contrasting <b>pesticide</b> use levels. Among the factors describing management strategies, the crop sequence, the crop diversity, the <b>pesticide</b> spraying techniques, and soil tillage were frequently selected for discriminating farms characterised by low vs. high <b>pesticide</b> use levels, whereas specific factors such as mechanical weeding, crop cultivars and sowing dates were related with <b>pesticide</b> use in some production situations only. Across production situations, several contrasting strategies led to low levels of <b>pesticide</b> use. Besides, within each considered production situation, different strategies appeared associated with low levels of <b>pesticide</b> use. Our results reveal that a large diversity of strategies exists for controlling pests, weeds and diseases without high levels of <b>pesticide</b> use...|$|R
