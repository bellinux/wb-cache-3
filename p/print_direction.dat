(Left) Support structures resulting from default orientation. (Middle) Result by Autodesk MeshMixer. (Right) Our result. This paper introduces a perceptual model for determining 3 D print-ing orientations. Additive manufacturing methods involving low-cost 3 D printers often require robust branching support structures to prevent material collapse at overhangs. Although the designed shape can successfully be made by adding supports, residual ma-terial remains at the contact points after the supports have been re-moved, resulting in unsightly surface artifacts. Moreover, fine sur-face details on the fabricated model can easily be damaged while removing supports. To prevent the visual impact of these artifacts, we present a method to find <b>printing</b> <b>directions</b> that avoid placing supports in perceptually significant regions. Our model for prefer-ence in 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>direction</b> is formulated as a combination of met-rics including area of support, visual saliency, preferred viewpoint and smoothness preservation.

For characterizing banding based on transmission error measurement, specific frequency-domain signal processing, i. e., order analysis, was applied to help identify possible disturbance sources with certain gear components. For characterizing banding based on absorptance measurement on printed images, {{it was pointed out}} that a good metric should incorporate appropriate nonlinear operator that characterizes the human visual system. This proposition was supported by simulation results obtained from a three-stage visual model. For modeling banding, a more comprehensive EP model was developed to include transmission parameters such as laser scanning frequency, gear dimension, and angular velocity. Simulation study was performed on the simplified version of the derived model, which demonstrated close correlation between halftone banding and transmission quality. This motivates control of the motor/gear transmission system for reducing banding artifact in EP processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} is the derivation, development, {{and evaluation of}} novel hybrid algorithms for process control that use {{a limited number of}} measurements and that are suitable to operate in the presence of large amounts of process noise. As an initial step, affine and neural network statistical process models are developed in order to simulate the steady-state system behavior. Such models are vitally important in the evaluation, testing, and improvement of all other process controllers referred to in this work. Afterwards, fuzzy logic controller rules are assimilated into a mathematical characterization of a model that includes the modes and mode transition rules that define a hybrid hierarchical process control. The main processing entity in such framework is a closed-loop control algorithm that performs global and then local optimizations in order to asymptotically reach minimum bias error; this is done while requiring a minimum number of iterations in order to promptly reach a desired operational window. The results of this research are applied to surface mount technology manufacturing-lines yield optimization.

40|$|Rationale: Driving is a {{fundamental}} instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) and occupational therapists need practical, effective tools to evaluate clients’ fitness to drive. To be proficient at driving, one needs competency on the operational (manipulating pedals, steering wheel), tactical (negotiating obstacles), and strategic (navigation) levels. Few studies explore the strategic level. It is beneficial {{to determine if the}} strategic level of driving can be evaluated without an expensive, lengthy on-road test. Purpose: This study compared on-road driving performance during wayfinding using paper directions compared to GPS. A second question compared performance between on-road driving and driving in an interactive driving simulator (IDS). Typical clinical assessments tools, specifically the Trail Making Test B, Assessment of Motor & Process Skills (AMPS), and Useful Field of View (UFOV ®) were also compared with driving outcomes. Design: Counterbalancing testing order of simulated driving and on-road driving of two unfamiliar routes yielded eight conditions. Participants: Participants were 24 volunteer drivers, ages 18 - 45 years. Methods: Each participant was assessed by the clinical assessments, navigated via <b>printed</b> <b>directions</b> on the driving simulator, and drove two routes on the road using either GPS guidance and <b>printed</b> <b>directions.</b> Driving performance was measured by the same evaluator using the same measuring tool. Analysis: Driving performance were compared with box plots, scatter plots, and a paired t-test with a 95 % confidence interval. Clinical assessment scores were compared to driving scores on the simulator and on-road assessments using scatter plots. The two independent sample t-tests comparing groups defined by order was not statistically significant (p=. 734; p=. 805; p=. 690). Results: The means of scores of participants wayfinding on road with GPS were significantly better than when using <b>printed</b> <b>directions</b> (p =. 024; 95 % CI = 1. 58 - 20. 7 points). Nineteen of 24 participants had better driving performance scores when using GPS. For participants using <b>printed</b> <b>directions,</b> the difference in mean scores for those driving in the simulator compared to on-road was not statistically significant (p= 0. 058). Outcomes of the clinical assessments did not have a strong relationship with any driving performance. Discussion: Performance using a GPS for wayfinding results in improved driving performance over <b>printed</b> <b>directions.</b> Overall, driving performance during wayfinding on an interactive driving simulator was similar to on-road driving performance, although there was individual variation. Limitations included a homogenous group of healthy participants and the driving simulator wayfinding was not a duplication of the on road route. This study suggests that wayfinding can be evaluated on an interactive driving simulator, offering opportunity for assessment of multiple client factors in a controlled environment and potentially reduce the number of individuals who need to proceed to an on road evaluation.

This study examines the feasibility of a process for rapid creation of a solder paste stencil using thermoplastic material. CNC laser cutting of the stencil geometry is replacing traditional use of chemical etching on metal sheets to produce stencils. Laser cutting has been used to improve process speed, accuracy, and cost. This research attempts to continue to simplify and reduce costs in the stencil making process by proposing as the stencil material a common thermoplastic that can be cut easily and quickly using a low-power rapid-prototyping laser process. The effects of several variables on the success of the process are experimentally tested to determine a feasible solution. Various solder pastes and solder material characteristics are studied for their effect on the new material. Stencil dimensions, including thickness and aperture characteristics, are examined. Several key process factors are also varied in the tests to determine recommendations for settings such as <b>print</b> <b>direction,</b> alignment procedures, squeegee pressure and attack angle, print speed, and stencil release method.

40|$|A problem {{arises when}} {{different}} printing systems {{are used to}} print images. Different systems have considerably different contrast and resolution capabilities while an individual printing system might have a low resolution capability, the system may {{have the ability to}} render low contrast detail. Similarly, if a printing system has a high resolution capability, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} such a system has the ability to render low contrast detail well. Such contrast and resolution restrictions may be attributed to the capabilities of the PostScript interpreter, the screening method used by the RIP, the image transfer method of the output device, the substrate used, or a combination of these factors. The RIT Contrast Resolution Test Target has been developed to measure the relationship between contrast and resolution of a printing system. The target measures the contrast-resolution capability of the printing system in both the horizontal and vertical <b>print</b> <b>direction</b> of the printing device. A graph can be plotted to show the Contrast Sensitivity (CS) for the printing system. From this distribution, a contrastresolution- volume (CRV) can be calculated to produce a quantitative contrast-resolution measurement for an individual printing system. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the RIT Contrast Resolution Test Target can provide a method of discriminating the CRV of marking engines and screening methods by using analysis methods intended for use with the target. The target was printed on several printing systems. 12 observers were used to measure the target. The observers were given instruction on proper target reading, and their observations were recorded as CRV measurements. The CRV values for all colors from each system were averaged for each observer. The averaged data was entered into a two-way ANOVA test, where the two dimensions in the test were systems and observers. The results of the ANOVA test showed that there was significant variance in the average CRV values from each system, and the hypothesis of this thesis was accepted. In addition, the ANOVA test indicated that there was significant variance between the observers readings. Although each observer used a different judging criteria, it was concluded that the observers evaluated the different systems relative to one and other in almost the same sequence...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to modeling, identification, control, and {{performance}} improvement for a class of electrophotography (EP) -based imaging systems, which are commercially known as laser printers. For this type of systems, halftone banding is a well-known artifact that causes periodic density variation perpendicular to the <b>print</b> <b>direction</b> on printed images. It is known that gear eccentricity and tooth profile error are main contributors to scanline spacing variation, which introduces density variation. Using frequency domain method, {{we were able to}} identify the density variation of a certain frequency with the corresponding gear component(s). Furthermore, we developed a model to quantitatively relate printer parameters (optical, electrical, and mechanical) to halftone banding. To further characterize perceived banding, a three-stage approach was proposed, which includes a nonlinear filtering process that emulates human visual system. Preliminary results that support the proposed filtering process were presented. ^ Another focus of the work is to propose and investigate the designs of repetitive control based systems for the image formation system of EP processes. The repetitive controller was successfully incorporated into or combined with the design framework of other linear robust controllers, e. g., H ∞ control. Furthermore, human contrast sensitivity function (CSF) was incorporated as the performance weighting. For sensor and actuator requirement, it was argued that sensors should be placed as close to intermediate images as possible. The number of actuators should at least equal to the number of imaging components. These arguments were supported by experimental and analytical results for a system with non-ideal sensor placement and another with an under-actuated motion subsystem. For the system with an under-actuated motion subsystem, banding reduction was attained by introducing a nonlinear feedforward control by modulating the laser exposure, which complemented the feedback control of the motion subsystem. ^ To preserve the performance of the repetitive control for motion subsystems subject to spatially periodic disturbances, we reformulated the temporal domain system with respect to a spatial coordinate, e. g., photosensitive drum angular position, which resulted in a nonlinear position invariant (NPI) system. Several controller design approaches were suggested. By viewing the angular velocity and the ratio between actuator input and output as varying parameters, the nonlinear system with actuator saturation can be treated as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system, for which an LPV gain-scheduling repetitive controller (LPVRC) with anti-windup design was performed. Experimental results were presented to verify the effectiveness of the LPVRC design. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{advent of}} {{clinically}} successful moulded RHC III corneal substitutes has paved a possible path for additive manufacturing {{to expand into}} ophthalmology. The cornea {{has a number of}} advantages over other tissues for additive biomanufacturing, being a relatively homogeneous and avascular tissue. However, collagen has had limited success in additive manufacturing, and is used most often in composite inks alongside other hydrogels with better gelation kinetics. In this work, we present an additive manufacturing as a technique to produce thin RHC III films and explore its potential for mimicking corneal tissue. Materials and Methods: RHC III was deposited in multiple layers by nebulizing a 3. 4 mg/ml RHCIII solution via sonication and accelerating it through a small nozzle of 100 µm - 300 µm diameter towards a substrate with an inert gas. The <b>print</b> <b>direction</b> imparted a pattern on the sample, which was exploited to lay orthogonal layers with small rotations in order to achieve isotropy. The samples were subsequently crosslinked using EDC (1 -[3 -(Dimethylamino) propyl]- 3 -ethylcarbodiimide methiodide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide). Gel electrophoresis was used to investigate the effect of the nebulization process on the material. Human corneal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded at a density of 1000 cells per 6. 5 mm diameter sample and imaged using an IncuCyte ZOOM Live cell imaging system. Results: Thin RHC III films were produced using this method with resolution as low as 10 µm, a layer thickness under 1 µm and different printed patterns (see Fig. 1 a-b-c). Gel electrophoresis showed that the α- 1 chains of the RHC III stayed intact throughout sonication. The RHC III films showed improved stability and handling after crosslinking. Human corneal MSCs attached to the RHC III films two hours after seeding and did so in an aligned fashion, following the print lines (see Fig 1 d). Discussion: Despite the limited use of collagen as stand-alone structural material, we demonstrate the use of combining nebulizing additive manufacturing techniques and cross-linking to produce thin RHC III films with customized patterns. No denaturation of the collagen was observed due to the nebulization process. Early following seeding, we observed that the MSCs preferentially attached to the surface and proliferated following the RHCIII print pattern. At this stage, MSCs could potentially be induced to differentiate into keratocytes influencing them to deposit their extracellular matrix in an aligned manner. Further experiments are required to substantiate this. Conclusion: These results show promise for the combined use of printing techniques and cross-linking procedures in the fabrication of RHC III corneal scaffold which can be seeded with mesenchymal stem cells to produce a tissue engineered corneal substitute. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Additive manufacturing, or 3 D printing, {{encompasses}} {{manufacturing processes}} that construct a geometry by depositing or solidifying material only {{where it is}} needed {{in the absence of}} a mold. The ability to manufacture complex geometries on demand directly from a digital file, as well as the decreasing equipment costs due to increased competition in the market, have resulted in the AM industry experiencing rapid growth in the past decade. Many companies have emerged with novel technologies well suited to improve products and/or save costs in various industries. ^ Until recently, the applications of polymer additive manufacturing have been mainly limited to prototyping. This can be attributed to multiple factors, namely the high cost of the machines and materials, long print times, and anisotropy of printed parts. In addition, the low unit cost and cycle time of competing processes such as injection molding further skew the economics in favor of other processes. The addition of fiber-reinforcement into polymers used in additive manufacturing processes significantly increases the strength of parts, and also allows larger parts to be manufactured. In 2014, large-scale additive manufacturing of fiber-reinforced polymers was pioneered, and has generated significant attention from both academia and industry. Commercial machines that incorporate high throughput extruders on gantry systems are now available. New applications that require high temperature polymers with low coefficients of thermal expansion and high stiffness are being targeted, for example tooling used in the manufacturing of composite components. The state of the art of this new paradigm in additive manufacturing as well as the target applications will be discussed in detail. ^ Many new challenges arise as AM scales and reinforced polymers are incorporated. One of the most notable challenges is the presence of large temperature gradients induced in parts during the manufacturing process, which lead to residual stresses and sometimes detrimental warpage. The current solution to this problem has been to print faster in order to lessen the temperature gradients, however very high extrusion speeds are likely not ideal for achieving optimal material properties. The high shear rates induce further damage to fibers, and entrapped air during the extrusion process may not escape, leading to high void content. Another significant challenge is overcoming the anisotropy in printed parts, which arises due to the stiff reinforcing fibers orienting primarily in the <b>print</b> <b>direction.</b> This complicates the use in demanding applications such as composite tooling, where high stiffness and low CTE are desirable in all directions. ^ In 2014, a group of graduate students at Purdue University was formed to develop a better understanding of large-scale additive manufacturing processes incorporating high temperature and high fiber content polymer composites. The team spent more than one year designing, developing, and optimizing a lab-scale system that offers full control over all processing parameters, and has begun studying the relevant phenomena and developing models to predict the outcome of printing processes. ^ This thesis will summarizes the system development process, printing process, composite tooling applications, as well as the mechanical, structural, and viscoelastic properties of printed materials, making it one of the most comprehensive documents written in large-scale additive manufacturing of fiber-reinforced polymers to date. The properties of 50 weight percent carbon fiber-reinforced PPS, a material of high interest in the field, will be presented in detail. The viscoelastic properties will be measured and discussed in the context of both stress relaxation during the printing process and the required performance metrics of composite tooling.
