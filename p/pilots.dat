5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 <b>pilots</b> adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American <b>pilots,</b> who were mostly pre-war airline <b>pilots,</b> not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 <b>pilots</b> can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with <b>pilots</b> of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of <b>pilots</b> and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 <b>pilots</b> and 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit <b>pilots,</b> and the quality of <b>pilots</b> overall. The number of unfit <b>pilots</b> was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were <b>pilots,</b> other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. <b>Pilots</b> {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all <b>pilots</b> destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands.

5|$|During the Korean War, USAF fighter <b>pilots</b> were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet <b>pilots.</b> Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, {{designed}} and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, {{as well as}} a novel pilot ejection system.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced <b>pilots.</b> In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational <b>pilots</b> against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%.

Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid pilot-aided channel estimation technique for mitigating {{the effect of}} <b>pilot</b> contamination for the uplink of multi-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems. The proposed hybrid <b>pilot</b> is designed such that it enjoys the complementary advantages between time-multiplexed (TM) <b>pilot</b> and time-superimposed (TS) <b>pilot,</b> and thereby, allows superior solution to the conventional <b>pilot</b> schemes. We mathematically characterize the impact of hybrid <b>pilot</b> on the massive MIMO uplink by deriving a closed-form approximation for the uplink achievable rate. In large-number-of-antennas regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solution for hybrid <b>pilot</b> by jointly designing the TM <b>pilot</b> and the TS <b>pilot.</b> It is shown that either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot</b> has the advantages for large frame-size and limited frame-size transmission, respectively, while the hybrid <b>pilot</b> scheme can offer a superior performance to that employing either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot.</b> Numerical results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed design.

5|$|Evolution of Tappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned <b>pilots</b> {{found in}} {{northern}} Japan, with similar characteristics to the whales found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, have been {{indicated that the}} geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned <b>pilots</b> in north Pacific in the 12th century where Magondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned <b>pilots,</b> adapting and colonizing into colder waters. Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively called Shiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned <b>pilots</b> but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around the oceanic front off Chōshi, Chiba.|$|E
