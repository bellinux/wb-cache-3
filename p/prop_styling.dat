For example, both Cornell University and the University of Florida offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.|$|E
5000|$|Late 19th century [...] - [...] Early 20th century [...] - [...] North AmericaIn the USA the {{popularity}} of variety shows and vaudeville shows created great demand for professional jugglers. To distinguish them from other entertainers, jugglers were constantly developing new tricks, <b>props,</b> <b>styles</b> and characters, many of which survive to this day.|$|R
50|$|The contestants {{were judged}} on three categories: Performance (worth 40 points), voice quality (40) and clarity of lyrics (20), {{for a total}} 100. The {{lightning}} round performances in later seasons were judged out of ten. While points were not awarded for <b>props</b> and <b>style,</b> attire and stage presence have proven somewhat important in the judging of KTV.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone {{said of the}} soundtrack, [...] "Judgment Nights bracing rap rock is {{like the}} wedding of hillbilly and race music that started {{the whole thing in}} the first place....Its an {{aspiring}} re-birth".

Q Magazine said the soundtrack [...] "suggests that the future for both metal and rap as a kind of agit <b>prop</b> soapbox <b>style</b> is secure".|$|R
50|$|Raymond's health {{began to}} fail in 1979, {{and he died}} in late 1981 from cancer. After his death, he was succeeded by Mike Gersher, who had {{assisted}} him for about 17 years. All Blondie artists since that time have stuck closely to the style that Jim Raymond refined, with small modifications to keep <b>props</b> and clothing <b>styles</b> contemporary.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{consisted}} of numerous comedic skits. The half-hour shows themselves often {{seemed to have}} themes (or at least they repeated the use of sets, costumes, characters and <b>props).</b> Its comedic <b>styling</b> was reminiscent of many classic Australian sketch comedies, like Full Frontal and Fast Forward, sharing common elements such as self-deprecating humour, low-cost props and effects.|$|R
50|$|Boon {{was born}} in Gdańsk, Poland. At the age of sixteen, she went to art school in Gdynia Orłowo Poland (Zespół Szkół Plastycznych w Gdyni) to study {{photography}} and fine arts. While studying, {{she was able to}} form her own grunge and punk-rock band Energia in which she practiced and developed her songwriting and vocal abilities. Later on in life, her early knowledge of visual arts helped her create costumes, on stage <b>props</b> and <b>styling.</b> Until now, she gets heavily involved in her video production and stage presence. Boon performed at a well known Polish Jarocin Festival as a vocalist of band Out Of Site. At this festival she met Muniek Staszczyk from the band, T-Love who confirmed her determination of pursuing a music path.|$|R
50|$|As {{you enter}} the House, the upper stair area is {{mirrored}} with flashes of trees. The stairs remain unchanged from the previous series. In the living area, grey sofas are in a square pattern, and a red mirror, significant to the series, is in {{the centre of the}} living area wall. The dining table is lipstick red, with fairy tale <b>style</b> <b>props</b> gracing the top. The kitchen is in a square corner with white marble counters and the latest appliances. The bedroom is dark and forest like, with a large owl watching over the Housemates. The garden is largely unchanged, except for the redecorated pod and new hot tub with seating area. No pool is present. Back inside, the bathroom is very chic with a large black bathtub. The diary room is in the style of a spooky purple/blue forest. The chair itself is faux wolf fur, blending into the background.|$|R
50|$|The {{visually}} rich production features various symbols, uniforms, weapons, {{and vehicles}} that draw openly from the aesthetic of the Third Reich {{as depicted in}} Nazi propaganda (especially Triumph of the Will) and war films. At the same time, obvious care is put into diluting and mixing the Nazi references with recognizable British and American uniform <b>styles,</b> <b>props,</b> and visual motifs. The resulting military uniforms, for instance, range from completely Allied in cases of positive characters to almost completely SS {{in the case of}} Richard's entourage. Another example of this balanced approach to production design is the choice of tanks for battle scenes between Richmond's and Richard's armies: both use Soviet tanks (T-55s and T-34s respectively), mixed with German, American, and British World War II-era vehicles. To convey the out-of-place nature of the common-born Queen Elizabeth, she is reconfigured as an American socialite similar to Wallis Simpson, and she and her brother are treated with marked disapproval by members of the Court.|$|R
50|$|The {{neglect of}} {{aesthetic}} theory {{to consider the}} role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by Katya Mandoki who in 1994 coined the word Prosaics (drawing a distinction from Aristotle’s Poetics focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in face-to-face and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture (2007) consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to {{the whole range of}} sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and <b>props,</b> intonation and <b>styles</b> of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.|$|R
