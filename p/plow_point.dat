50|$|Allen, {{and later}} his son Florenze, was {{proprietor}} of an iron foundry that produced stove plates, <b>plow</b> <b>points,</b> and kettles. Subsequently, unlike most {{homes of the}} era, Allen designed Dorset House without open hearths and used closed iron stoves to heat the building instead.|$|R
50|$|The iron furnace was {{established}} here in 1805, by owners of another nearby furnace whose ore sources were played out. The {{success of this}} location was such that the town of Bennington was forced to improve its roads to the area, and at its peak the operators employed 150-200 workers. It produced 7 tons of pig iron, and also had a facility for producing utilitarian iron products, such as cauldrons, fireboxes, cooking stoves, <b>plow</b> <b>points,</b> and machinery parts. The furnace closed in 1842, unable to compete with larger and more advantageously placed businesses, and hampered by issues with its ore sources. In {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the property was transformed into a summer country retreat.|$|R
40|$|Small, {{practically}} unproductive areas, {{known locally}} as “push” soils, are of rather common occurrence in some sections of southern Iowa. They are found on hillsides, usually about midway down the slope, and the name “push” soil seems to have risen because {{of the behavior of}} the soil during plowing. The surface soil is shallow and the underlying material is such a heavy, impervious clay that the <b>plow</b> <b>points</b> will not readily cut it, but tend to pass over the surface, “pushing” the thin top soil aside. The individual areas of these “push” soils are not large, varying from one-tenth of an acre to one or two acres in size, but they are quite unproductive, usually growing nothing but a native grass which is useless for feeding, and their occurrence in otherwise productive areas, as well as the difficulty in cultivating, makes them objectionable. It is quite desirable that such spots be reclaimed, and the work reported in the following pages was undertaken to determine the best methods of making “push” soils productive...|$|R
50|$|By 1880 {{the town}} had two churches, a common school, a steam-cotton gin, a sawmill, a post office (founded in 1851), a {{telegraph}} office and its own newspaper weekly, The <b>Plow</b> Boy. East <b>Point</b> ranked as a grain and cotton-growing center. With its pleasant upland climate and proximity to the railway, it was a popular summer resort for people {{from the city of}} Atlanta.|$|R
40|$|Combination chisel plows {{are used}} {{extensively}} in crop production {{areas in the}} United States as part of conventional, reduced, and mulch-tillage systems. Use of combination chisel plows in corn residue can reduce surface residue cover to levels that afford little protection from soil erosion processes. Changes in the operation and setup of the equipment, however, can significantly affect the amount of residue that is incorporated into the soil. The objective of this project was to evaluate operational effects of a combination chisel plow equipped with coulter gangs on corn residue cover. Variables included timing of chisel <b>plowing,</b> chisel <b>point</b> selection, speed and depth of chiseling, and coulter gang engagement. Fall chisel plowing left higher levels of residue cover than did spring chiseling. The difference was negated, however, when overwintering losses following fall chiseling were accounted for. Only three of eight treatments during spring chiseling left residue cover greater than 30...|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by <b>plowing,</b> although 20 <b>points</b> and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|R

40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in these studies}} are summarized as follows: 1. The S. T. Y. Wearing Tester of the authors {{has proven to be}} a reasonable tester for studies of the wear of shares of the ordinary Japanese plows. 2. From the viewpoint of wear of shares, the soil is advisably classified into three types; sand-, loam- and clay-types. 3. Studies on the wear of shares should be based on the comparison of the {{results obtained}} with the soil of the same type. 4. There exists a critical point of the ratio of contained water in the soil that effects a sudden change in the wear of shares of the ordinary Japanese <b>plows.</b> The critical <b>points</b> of the soil of loam-type and of sand-type are 20 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. 1. 著者等の考案試作したS・T・Y式磨耗試験機によつて合理的な犂先・材質の磨耗に関する比較研究が出来る. 2. 犂先ご材質の磨耗に対する土壌型としでは, 砂質土型・壌土質型及び粘質土型の三つに分けて考えるが便利である. 3. 犂先・材質の磨耗を比較研究するには, 同一の土壌型で使用して検討すべきである. 4. 土壌の含水量には犂先の磨耗を変化せしめる臨界点があつて, 壌土質型では含水量 20 %附近に, 砂質土型では含水量 14 %附近に臨界点が存在する...|$|R
5000|$|Another problem {{common to}} cast iron plow bottoms {{was the lack}} of {{soundness}} and uniformity in the metal's molecular structure, which meant that some cast iron bottoms would have soft spots in the hardened surface, reducing the wearability of the plow bottom. Improvements made by James Oliver to his casting process overcame this problem also. Consequently, on June 30, 1857, James Oliver obtained his first patent from the United States government for his chilled plow shares and in February 1869, he obtained another patent for his process. What Oliver accomplished by this invention is sometimes referred to as chill hardening, or simply chilling. The purpose of chilling, whether it be a plowpoint or a wheel for a railroad car, is to produce an extremely hard and durable exterior of the object. This is done by including [...] "chills", pieces of metal, into the sand mold, such that when the molten iron is poured into the mould, the portion next to the chill cools rapidly, hardening in a way akin to quenching. This chilled area forms the exterior of the plowpoint. This metal cools more quickly than the metal which forms the other portion of the plowshare, and effectively becomes case hardened. Also, the vapors which arise as the molten metal comes in contract with the mould are expelled through a spout. Had these vapors been trapped in the mould, they would have caused impurities and would have weakened the plowpoint at the place where it should have been the hardest. To harden the plowpoints, Oliver arranged his moulding apparatus in such manner that the surface of the chill was in a position so that the melted metal first came into contact with the chill {{at the edge of the}} plowshare. This insured a hard <b>plow</b> cutting <b>point.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{minimization}} of {{the applied}} tidal volume (VT) during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) {{reduces the risk}} of alveolar shear stress, it can also result in insufficient CO 2 -elimination with severe respiratory acidosis. We hypothesized that in a model of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) the application of high oscillatory frequencies requires the combination of HFOV with arteriovenous extracorporeal lung assist (av-ECLA) in order to maintain or reestablish normocapnia. Methods After induction of ARDS in eight female pigs (56. 5 ± 4. 4 kg), a recruitment manoeuvre was performed and intratracheal mean airway pressure (mPaw) was adjusted 3 cmH 2 O above the lower inflection <b>point</b> (<b>Plow)</b> of the pressure-volume curve. All animals were ventilated with oscillatory frequencies ranging from 3 – 15 Hz. The pressure amplitude was fixed at 60 cmH 2 O. At each frequency gas exchange and hemodynamic measurements were obtained with a clamped and de-clamped av-ECLA. Whenever the av-ECLA was de-clamped, the oxygen sweep gas flow through the membrane lung was adjusted aiming at normocapnia. Results Lung recruitment and adjustment of the mPaw above Plow resulted in a significant improvement of oxygenation (p Conclusion In this animal model of ARDS, maximization of oscillatory frequencies with subsequent minimization of VT leads to hypercapnia that can only be reversed by adding av-ECLA. When combined with a recruitment strategy, these high frequencies do not impair oxygenation</p...|$|R
5000|$|... "Insanity reigned. * * *"Tobacco is {{harvested}} in {{six to seven}} primings, as the leaves on a plant mature from bottom to top. Each priming is normally three leaves. In past years and under normal circumstances, what is left is the corona, or top, of the plant. These are very small leaves heavily laden with nicotine. The corona was often sold to chewing tobacco companies who flavored this nicotine-laden tobacco and then sold it under names like Mail Pouch, Red Man, and others... If the corona remained unsold, then it and the stalk would be plowed under to provide soil-enriching nitrogen for next year's crop."During the Cigar Boom years, this practice all but disappeared! Why? Because during the priming cycle the tobacco stalks would have a secondary growth of tiny leaves much like the sucker branches you might see on a tree limb. The shortages of tobacco were so ferocious that everyone began harvesting these tiny second-growth leaves, called capadura, to use as filler tobaccos, and brokers started to sell capadura, the same stuff that used to get <b>plowed</b> under. The <b>point</b> being that every single conceivable scrap of anything that would pass for cigar leaf was being courted by manufacturers large and small, new and old, {{to meet the demand}} for cigars {{in the first half of}} the 1990s." ...|$|R
