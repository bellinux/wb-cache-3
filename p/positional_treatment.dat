40|$|Many infants do regurgitate. The {{recommended}} therapeutic approach {{starts with}} postural and dietary measures, followed by antacids and prokinetics.

40|$|In {{all fields}} of medicine, major efforts are {{currently}} dedicated {{to improve the}} clinical, physiological and therapeutic understanding of disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is no exception. The personalised medicine approach is relevant for OSA, given its complex pathophysiology and variable clinical presentation, the interactions with comorbid conditions and its possible contribution to poor outcomes. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective, but CPAP is poorly tolerated or not accepted in a considerable proportion of OSA patients. This review summarises the available studies on the physiological phenotypes of upper airway response to obstruction during sleep, and the clinical presentations of OSA (phenotypes and clusters) with a special focus on our changing attitudes towards approaches to treatment. Such major efforts are likely to change and expand treatment options for OSA beyond the most common current choices (i. e. CPAP, mandibular advancement devices, <b>positional</b> <b>treatment,</b> lifestyle changes or upper airway surgery). More importantly, treatment for OSA may become more effective, being tailored to each patient's need...|$|E

40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is {{a common}} medical {{disorder}} that affects up to 24 % of men and 9 % of women (Young, Palta et al. 1993). Between 50 - 60 % of patients with OSA who present to sleep clinics for overnight polysomnography experience twice as many respiratory events in supine sleep compared to lateral sleep (Pevernagie and Shepard 1992, Oksenberg, Silverberg et al. 1997, Richard, Kox et al. 2006, Joosten, Hamza et al. 2012), while approximately 25 - 30 % of the same population experience respiratory events exclusively in the supine position (Mador, Kufel et al. 2005, Gillman, Roebuck et al. 2012, Joosten, Hamza et al. 2012). The cause of the observed preponderance of respiratory events in the supine sleeping position remains elusive. Certainly several studies have demonstrated a less collapsible airway in the lateral compared to the supine position in male OSA patients (Boudewyns, Punjabi et al. 2000, Penzel, Moller et al. 2001, Ong, Touyz et al. 2011); that is, a more negative pressure needs {{to be applied to}} the airway lumen to cause the airway to collapse when lateral – with the collapsing pressure referred to as the pharyngeal critical closing pressure (Pcrit). However, the reason for the fall in Pcrit is unclear with a postulated role for upper airway size and shape changes with body position. Recent advances in the understanding of OSA pathogenesis have revealed that non-anatomical factors such as ventilatory control instability and arousal threshold {{play an important role in}} airway obstruction in a significant proportion of OSA patients (Eckert, White et al. 2013). Importantly, there are no studies that examine the role of body position on ventilatory control instability, arousal threshold or active Pcrit (the pharyngeal critical closing pressure when airway muscles are activated) and there are no studies that examine upper airway size and shape, and lung volume in supine related OSA patients compared to matched controls. For patients with supine related OSA, the use of positional therapy can be an effective treatment. A number of positional modification devices have been demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing supine sleep and thus reducing the overall apnoea and hypopnoea index (AHI) (Jokic, Klimaszewski et al. 1999, Loord and Hultcrantz 2007, Permut, Diaz-Abad et al. 2010, Bignold, Mercer et al. 2011). Indeed, the use of positional modification devices for supine related OSA constitutes the most common form of individualised treatment for OSA sufferers. Despite the common occurrence of supine related OSA, and a seemingly cheap and readily available treatment, there remain a number of important unanswered questions that this thesis addresses. SELECTING PATIENTS FOR THE USE OF POSITIONAL MODIFICATION DEVICES The use of positional modification devices in the treatment of supine related OSA relies on three assumptions. Firstly, that the supine AHI is high from night-to-night (i. e. that there is a problem that warrants intervention), secondly, and partly related, that supine sleep time remains sufficient from night-to-night to warrant treatment, and thirdly that the lateral AHI remains low from night-to-night (i. e. that the intervention will be effective ongoing). Because these assumptions have never been tested, and because there is a recognised variability in the AHI from night-to-night (Le Bon, Hoffmann et al. 2000, Bittencourt, Suchecki et al. 2001) coupled with poor treatment compliance with traditional discomfort based treatments the take-up of positional modification by clinicians is poor. Chapter 2 delivers important information that will help guide clinicians’ use of positional modification devices. We demonstrate for the first time that male subjects with four times as many respiratory events in supine sleep compared to lateral sleep have a repeatable phenotype of supine related OSA. In addition, we show that a low lateral AHI is repeatable from night-to-night, thus giving clinicians confidence when using positional modification in selected patients. UPPER AIRWAY SHAPE AND LUNG VOLUME The observed fall in passive Pcrit (the Pcrit when upper airway muscles are relaxed) when subjects move from the supine to lateral position is frequently attributed to less favourable airway shape and size in the supine position. However, many studies show no significant change in upper airway cross-sectional area when subjects move from supine to lateral (Jan, Marshall et al. 1994, Martin, Marshall et al. 1995, Pevernagie, Stanson et al. 1995, Walsh, Leigh et al. 2008), whilst there are conflicting results on the effect of body position on airway shape. Importantly, no studies compare patients with supine related OSA to controls matched for key potential confounders such as age, gender, degree of obesity and body mass distribution. Another potential mechanism by which passive Pcrit may be reduced in lateral sleep is a change in lung volume. Previous studies have demonstrated that a reduced lung volume raises the Pcrit (Stanchina, Malhotra et al. 2003, Jordan, White et al. 2009) and that body position can affect lung volume with a reduced lung volume in the supine position in normal subjects. Chapter 3 clarifies some of the confusion present in the upper airway imaging literature. We have demonstrated that there are no significant differences between supine OSA patients and matched controls with regard to airway cross sectional area and shape when moving from supine to lateral position. However, there was a significant improvement in lung volume in the lateral position. This suggests that lung volume is likely to, at least in part, explain the consistently observed fall in passive Pcrit in the lateral position in OSA patients. THE EFFECT OF BODY POSITION ON PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION The effect of body position on active Pcrit, ventilatory control stability and arousal threshold Recent advances in the understanding of OSA pathogenesis have highlighted a number of important contributors including: the ability of the upper airway muscles to stiffen and dilate the airway (McGinley, Schwartz et al. 2008, Edwards and White 2011), ventilatory control instability (i. e. a high loop gain) (Wellman, Jordan et al. 2004) and arousal threshold (Younes 2004). Despite the clear contribution of these factors to OSA, how they are affected by body position is not known. By applying a recently developed method for measuring these parameters in a non-invasive manner (Wellman, Edwards et al. 2013) we have been able to demonstrate that lateral positioning improves the ability of the airway to stiffen and dilate with no significant effect on arousal threshold or ventilatory control instability. The important findings in Chapter 4 highlight the enticing prospects for combination treatments for OSA that could include positional modification to improve passive Pcrit and the ability of the upper airway to stiffen and dilate, together with treatments that improve ventilatory control instability and arousal threshold, such as acetazolamide (Edwards, Sands et al. 2012) and non-muscle relaxant sedatives (Eckert, Owens et al. 2011). CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS The work in this doctoral thesis demonstrates that there is a sub-population of OSA patients with a repeatable form of supine related OSA and a reliably low lateral AHI who are likely to benefit from positional modification. We have shed light on the mechanism by which lateral positioning reduces Pcrit by showing that supine related OSA patients have an improvement in lung volume in the lateral position compared to matched controls, without any significant differences in upper airway size and shape. By applying a recently developed method for measuring the traits contributing to OSA we have demonstrated important improvements in the passive and active airway anatomy in the lateral position, with no significant improvement in ventilatory control instability or arousal threshold. This raises the possibility of future treatments that combine <b>positional</b> <b>treatment</b> with treatments known to reduce loop gain and raise the arousal threshold...|$|E
40|$|A 58 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to Kagoshima University Hospital after developing acute-onset abdominal distension. He had experienced anorexia and had lost 2 kg over the previous 3 months. An upper GI series and abdominal CT suggested duodenal obstruction with superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) and total situs inversus (TSI). As obstructive symptoms were refractory to conservative treatment with naso-gastric decompression and <b>positional</b> change, surgical <b>treatment</b> was performed 14 days after his admission. At laparotomy, complete transposition of the abdominal organs was observed. Although malrotation of the jejunum was not identified, a fibrotic stricture of the Treitz ligament was found.

Symptoms improved after surgery and the patient was discharged after 30 days, with no postoperative complications. 　　SMA syndrome is very rarely associated with TSI, and to our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report in the literature written by English. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a Working Group on Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux {{discusses}} {{recommendations for}} the first line diagnostic and therapeutic approach of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants and children. All members of the Working Group agreed that infants with uncomplicated gastro-oesophageal reflux can be safely treated before performing (expensive and often unnecessary) complementary investigations. However, the latter are mandatory if symptoms persist despite appropriate treatment. Oesophageal pH monitoring of long duration (18 - 24 h) is recommended as the investigation technique of choice in infants and children with atypical presentations of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy in a specialised centre is the technique of choice in infants and children presenting with symptoms suggestive of peptic oesophagitis. Prokinetics, still a relatively new drug family, have already obtained a definitive place {{in the treatment of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in infants and children, especially if "non-drug" <b>treatment</b> (<b>positional</b> therapy, dietary recommendations, etc.) was unsuccessful.

40|$|A rice GWAS {{panel of}} 281 accessions of japonica rice was phenotypically {{characterized}} for 26 traits related to phenology, plant and seed morphology, physiology and yield for 2 years in field conditions under permanent flooding (PF) and limited water (LW). A genome-wide analysis uncovered {{a total of}} 160 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs), of which 32 were LW-specific, 59 were PF-specific, and 69 were in common between the two water management systems. LW-specific associations were identified for several agronomic traits including days to maturation, days from flowering to maturation, leaf traits, plant height, panicle and seed traits, hundred grain weight, yield and tillering. Significant MTAs were detected across all the 12 rice chromosomes, while clusters of effects influencing different traits under LW or in both watering conditions were, respectively, observed on chromosomes 4, 8, and 12 and on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. The analysis of genes annotated in the Nipponbare reference sequence and included in the regions associated to traits related to plant morphology, grain yield, and physiological parameters allowed the identification of genes that were demonstrated to affect the respective traits. Among these, three (OsOFP 2, Dlf 1, OsMADS 56) and seven (SUI 1, Sd 1, OsCOL 4, Nal 1, OsphyB, GW 5, Ehd 1) candidate genes were, respectively, identified to co-localize with LW-specific associations and associations in common between the two water treatments.
