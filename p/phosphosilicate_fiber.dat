This methodology combines testing experiments on these devices with particle swarm optimization (PSO) calculations. The composition of Er/Yb-doped <b>phosphosilicate</b> <b>fibers</b> was improved by introducing Cerium inside their cores. Such composition strongly reduces the amplifier radiation sensitivity, limiting its degradation: we observed a gain decreasing from 19 dB to 18 dB after 50 krad whereas previous studies reported higher degradations up to 0 °dB at such doses. PSO calculations, taking only into account the radiation effects on the absorption efficiency around the pump and emission wavelengths, correctly reproduce the general trends of experimental results. This calculation tool {{has been used to}} study the influence of the amplifier design on its radiation response. The fiber length used to ensure the optimal amplification before irradiation may be rather defined and adjusted to optimize the amplifier performance over the whole space mission profile rather than before integration in the harsh environments. Both forward and backward pumping schemes lead to the same kind of degradation with our active fibers.

Temporal evolution of excess background loss, in VIS and NIR regions, even after stopping the 488 nm irradiation, was also observed, using white light source, 638. 7 nm laser diode source, He-Ne source and 1285 nm LED based OTDR accordingly.

Variation of this post-irradiation loss dynamics with external heating was also studied. NIR pump induced photodarkening was also studied to a certain extent and a bluish fluorescence from the fibers was observed, which could be related to Yb ion-pair effect.

We show that the addition of Ce strongly impacts the Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA) of both types of fibers. In the first case the radiation induced losses increase, whereas in the second one decrease. By combining the online RIA measurements with the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) ones, we are able to infer the basic microscopic mechanisms taking place under irradiation, which involve the cerium codopant and some of the known Ge-related or P-related defects. More precisely, we found that part of the Ce atoms are incorporated in the glass matrix as Ce 3 + ions by the production process and act as electron donor centers under irradiation. Consequently, the concentrations of radiation induced hole centers of Ge and P are drastically reduced. The reported results give an insight into possible ways of exploiting Ce codoping to control the radiation sensitivity of the OFs.
