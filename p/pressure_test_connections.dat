The classification of water <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> results is usually carried out by expert geologists. This paper presents a method for the automatic classification of water <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> curves. After discussing the features extracted from the test curves the fuzzy rule base used for classification is described. Some results are presented which show that an automatic classification of water <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> curves is possible...|$|R

30|$|Pipeline joints {{were tested}} for {{probable}} leaks {{after completion of}} processing of the air injector connecting system. The connected one-way valve should be leak-free along with the spool piece during the <b>pressure</b> <b>test.</b> This {{is an important part}} of the test for system safety issues. Generally, two dedicated casing male connectors are plugged into the sealed air injection connectors at both ends, which are then injected into the water with hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> for <b>test</b> trials. The underground pressure may reach as high as 20  MPa. <b>Pressure</b> <b>test</b> ensures the tightness of the special one-way valve and reverse the operational reliability of the air injection connector. The test will make sure there is no leak and thus prevents future losses during drilling. <b>Pressure</b> <b>test</b> is the most important step of process and loss control during the manufacturing of the tools.|$|R

A concentric steel contact structure (CS), installed over the SCV model and separated at a nominally uniform distance from it, provided a simplified representation of a reactor shield building in the actual plant.
