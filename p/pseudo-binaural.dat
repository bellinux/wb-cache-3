40|$|Manfred R. Schroeder made {{influential}} {{contributions to}} acoustics by applying number theory. He introduced number-theory sequences in room impulse response measurements, applied number-theoretical sequences to shape wall surfaces for diffuse sound reflections. Another area Manfred Schroeder made broad impact is invention of an artificial reverberator using all-pass transfer- function properties to create colorless reverberation using a simple algorithm. Vast research activities and engineering developments over past decades have extended Schroederâ€™s work involving artificial reverberators, artificial stereo and applications of maximum-length sequences. This chapter briefs {{a number of}} recent applications of maximum-length and quadratic-residue sequences, such as simultaneous dual/multiple sources measurements in acoustical tomography, in artificial <b>pseudo-binaural</b> reverberation, in decorrelation for spatial audio signals, and room acoustic diffuser design...|$|E
