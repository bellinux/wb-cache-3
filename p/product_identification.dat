40|$|Furfural, a {{valuable}} platform chemical {{that has the}} potential to replace a variety of oil/coal/gas derived materials and chemical products, is produced by the dehydration of o-xylose, which in turn is obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. Herein, the conversion of xylose in the presence of nanocrystalline zeolite beta in the H+-form, using water as solvent, was investigated. Detailed batch kinetic studies and <b>products</b> <b>identifications</b> techniques (H- 1, C- 13 NMR and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS)) provided mechanistic insights into the overall reaction process. The conversion of xylose to furfural is accompanied by several side reactions, forming complex reaction mixtures. A pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model was proposed that fitted quite well the experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
