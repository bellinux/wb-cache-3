5|$|The Texian {{bodies were}} stacked and burned. The only {{exception}} was {{the body of}} Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna's army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial. The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837, when Juan Seguín returned to Béxar to examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett, and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres. According to a March 28, 1837, article in the Telegraph and Texas Register, Seguín buried the coffin under a <b>peach</b> <b>tree</b> grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified. Seguín later claimed that he had placed the coffin {{in front of the}} altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton, it is unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of uniforms were found in the coffin, and it is known that the Alamo defenders did not wear uniforms.|$|E

25|$|In 1655, though, the {{settlers}} again came in fatal {{conflict with the}} native population in The <b>Peach</b> <b>Tree</b> War. According to popular belief, it started when a young Indian girl was shot by a Dutchman as she attempted to pluck fruit from a <b>peach</b> <b>tree</b> in an orchard on Manhattan. Her murder elicited calls for revenge from the native population, who did a house-to-house search of New Amsterdam. At the time, Stuyvesant and his troops were on an expedition to the Zuydt Rivier (Delaware Bay), where they had forced the colony of New Sweden to submit to rule by his government. Five hundred Indians attacked Pavonia, killing 100 settlers. One hundred fifty hostages were taken and held at Paulus Hook. When later ransomed they returned to New Amsterdam, and once again the settlements on the west shore of the Noort Rivier were evacuated.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} flowers on a <b>peach</b> <b>tree</b> are {{typically}} thinned out, {{because if the}} full number of peaches mature on a branch, they are undersized and lacking in flavor. Fruits are thinned midway in the season by commercial growers. Fresh peaches are easily bruised, and do not store well. They are most flavorful when they ripen on the tree and are eaten the day of harvest.|$|E

The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens.
