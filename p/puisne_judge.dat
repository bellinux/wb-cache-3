25|$|The Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements was {{abolished}} in 1868 {{and replaced}} by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements. The Supreme Court was reorganized in 1873 to consist of the Chief Justice, the Judge at Penang, and a Senior and Junior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge.</b> By this time Singapore had become the centre of government and trade in the Straits Settlements, so the Chief Justice and Senior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> resided in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> were stationed in Penang. The Supreme Court was also given jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal. As a result of legislation passed in 1885, the Supreme Court consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. The Court was significantly altered in 1907. It now had two divisions, one exercising original civil and criminal jurisdiction and the other appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, the Supreme Court was reconstituted {{to consist}} of the Chief Justice and the Judge at Penang {{as well as a}} Senior and a Junior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge.</b> There were two {{divisions}} of the court, one at Singapore and Malacca and the other at Penang. As Singapore had become the Straits Settlements' centre of government and trade, the Chief Justice and Senior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> were required to reside in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> resided in Penang. The Supreme Court was also conferred with jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal in civil matters. Following changes in the court structure in England, in 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court. The first hierarchy of courts was also established, consisting of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Courts of Request, Courts of Two Magistrates, Magistrates' Courts, Coroners' Courts and Justices of the Peace. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and then to Her Majesty in Council, the latter appeals being heard by the Judicial Committee of Her Britannic Majesty's Privy Council.|$|E

The Supreme Court also administers all the Intermediate Courts, Industrial Court and District Courts.|$|E
25|$|Pollock was {{substantially}} {{valued by}} the local society not long after his arrival to the colony. For six months from September 1888 to March 1889, he had been appointed by the government as acting Police Magistrate. In 1891, he was appointed unofficial Justice of Peace, and later in 1892, he had served as acting <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> for the government for half a year. In 1894, Hong Kong was suffered from a severe plague which caused thousands of deaths. Pollock was noted {{for his work on}} relief during the plague and was awarded a gold medal by the government afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} predecessor of the Supreme Court was the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island (now Penang), Singapore and Malacca, {{which was}} established by the Second Charter of Justice, issued by the Crown as letters patent dated 27 November 1826. The Court was presided over by the Governor of the Straits Settlements and Resident Councillor of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the Recorder. The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 reorganized the Court, providing the Straits Settlements with two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales' Island {{and the other for}} Singapore and Malacca. Following the reconstitution of the Straits Settlements as a Crown colony with effect from 1 April 1867, the Court of Judicature was replaced by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements. The Governor and Resident Councillors ceased to be judges of the Court. Further changes to the Court's constitution were made in 1873. It now consisted of two divisions – the Chief Justice and the Senior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> formed the Singapore and Malacca division of the Court, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> formed the Penang division. The Supreme Court also received jurisdiction to sit as an Court of Appeal in civil matters. In 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay first to the Court of Appeal and then to the Queen-in-Council, the latter appeals being heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|E

Senior <b>Puisne</b> <b>Judge</b> Gloria Smith stated that no further adjournments of the case would be permitted, ordering the Director of Public Prosecutions to make full disclosure to the defence, and insisting that the trial must start on May 19. In her words, [...] "This case {{has been going on}} for far too long and has reached the point where something must happen." [...] However, on that date the trial was postponed again due to the unavailability of a courtroom, being rescheduled for June 1. At that date it was again postponed, this time due to a shortage of available jurors, with the new date being set for July 7.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{goal was}} {{motivated}} by the concerns among some Company officials about being seen as foreign rulers. [...] They argued that the Company should try to win over its subjects by outdoing the region's previous rulers in the support of indigenous learning. [...] Guided by this belief, the Benares Sanskrit College was founded in Varanasi in 1791 during the administration of Lord Cornwallis. [...] The promotion of knowledge of Asia had attracted scholars as well to the Company's service. [...] Earlier, in 1784, the Asiatick Society had been founded in Calcutta by William Jones, a <b>puisne</b> <b>judge</b> in the newly established Supreme Court of Bengal. Soon, Jones was to advance his famous thesis on the common origin of Indo-European languages.|$|E
2500|$|Pontifex {{graduated}} from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854 and {{was called to}} the bar in the same year. He played in some amateur cricket games after Cambridge, but only three of them, in successive seasons from 1858 and all for the Gentlemen of Kent side, were rated as first-class. In 1872, he was appointed as a <b>puisne</b> <b>judge</b> on the High Court of Bengal in India [...] "with every prospect of becoming Chief Justice", according to his Times obituary; in the event, a change of government in the UK appointed Richard Garth, also a first-class cricketer, and Pontifex remained on the judges' bench for 10 years. In 1882, he was recalled to London to become a special legal adviser to the Marquess of Hartington, Secretary of State for India and he remained in this post until he retired in 1892, at which point he was knighted.|$|E

By the defects of your education you are more disqualified to be a working man than to be the ruler of an empire.

60|$|We {{will now}} change {{the scene to}} Noningsby, the judge's country seat, near Alston, at which a party was {{assembled}} for the Christmas holidays. The judge was there of course,--without his wig; in which guise I am inclined to think that judges spend the more comfortable hours of their existence; and there also was Lady Staveley, her presence at home being altogether a matter of course, inasmuch as she had no other home than Noningsby. For many years past, ever since the happy day on which Noningsby had been acquired, she had repudiated London; and the poor judge, when called upon by his duties to reside there, was compelled to live like a bachelor, in lodgings. Lady Staveley was a good, motherly, warm-hearted woman, who thought {{a great deal about}} her flowers and fruit, believing that no one else had them so excellent,--much also about her butter and eggs, which in other houses were, in her opinion, generally unfit to be eaten; she thought also a great deal about her children, who were all swans,--though, as she often observed with a happy sigh, those of her neighbours were so uncommonly like geese. But she thought most of all of her husband, who in her eyes was the perfection of all manly virtues. She had made up her mind that the position of a <b>puisne</b> <b>judge</b> in England was the highest which could fall to the lot of any mere mortal. To become a Lord Chancellor, or a Lord Chief Justice, or a Chief Baron, a man must dabble with Parliament, politics, and dirt; but the bench-fellows of these politicians were selected for their wisdom, high conduct, knowledge, and discretion. Of all such selections, that made by the late king when he chose her husband, was the one which had done most honour to England, and had been in all its results most beneficial to Englishmen. Such was her creed with reference to domestic matters.|$|E
