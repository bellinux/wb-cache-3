40|$|The article {{describes}} an experiment {{designed to enhance}} the viewing comprehension {{of a group of}} advanced level ESL learners by means of the prior activation of text-relevant schemata. The subject population, Belgian university students of business administration, were divided into three groups, two receiving an experimental treat ment geared to the activation of either formal or content schemata, and a control group which received no <b>pre-viewing</b> treatment. The target video sequence was an off-air recording on an economic topic. The formal treatment involved the presentation of the problem- solution model (Hoey, 1979) and a learner-based practice activity in the use of this model on a topic other than that of the target se quence. The content treatment involved provision of information on culturally-specific referential elements occurring in the target se quence and a learner-based activity on the general topic of the se quence, privatisation. Experimental effect was monitored by means of summary writing and a set of comprehension questions, the latter being given directly after viewing and again a week later to monitor for recall. Both <b>pre-viewing</b> groups showed significant levels of com prehension facilitation on all monitoring measures. Levels of im provement attained by the formal schemata group were higher than those of the content schemata group, although the difference was less marked on the recall than on the immediate measures. © 1991, Sage Publications.

Later, Canon extended its more sophisticated DSLR ExpSim LV all shooting light conditions like its Powershot digicams. The most significant advances and difference in DSLR version of ES-LV was simulating exposure changes effects with chosen aperture changes without stopping down the aperture. The ES-LV of its Powershot digicams always kept its apertures stopped down, so no 'aperture exposure simulation' was needed, and briefly opened aperture to assess focus with shutter button partially depressed before a shot is taken. The ExpSim LV of its EOS lens DSLRs could achieve the same 'exposure simulation' effect in both aperture stop-down mode and aperture wide open of its EOS lenses, even if the aperture selection was narrower than widest diameter (wide open).|$|E

They worked with 105 first graders in two schools, using “little books”—easy to read tiny paperbacks that serve as leveled practice materials for beginning readers.

The five studies in this special issue are then <b>pre-viewed</b> with respect to the following themes that run across them: (1) the potential for bilingual synergies and transformations in language awareness activities and crosslinguistic knowledge construction; (2) the role of multi-literacies and multimodality in mediated learning; and (3) the interplay of positioning, identity, and agency in language learning by immigrant youth.

40|$|This article reports two experiments, {{in which}} the effects of visual {{information}} on EFL students’ word-association, comprehension, and hypothesis-forming were examined. In the first experiment, two viewing conditions, i. e., “visual information only” and “visual plus audio (in English) information”, were compared in terms of word-association and comprehension. In the second experiment, a comparison was made in terms of hypothesis-forming between “video plus a short summary” and “video only” conditions. The video in this experiment contained both visual and audio (in English) information. Presenting a short summary (in Japanese) was a <b>pre-viewing</b> activity designed to activate viewers’ schema. The results of these two experiments indicate 1) visual information promotes the process of association-making, while audio information limits the process; and 2) the schema-activating procedure, when used with the video, dose promote the forming of right hypothesis about the contents, though it dose not restrict the forming of wrong ones.
