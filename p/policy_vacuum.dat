The new instrumentation changes the composition of action and it creates the possibility of actions and arrangements that were not possible before. Ethical analysis has not traditionally or explicitly focused on the instrumentation of action. Human action instrumented with computer technology is, nevertheless, human action. The ethical issues that arise can be understood in traditional moral terms though they often have features that are new and unusual.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{assertion}} {{that there is a}} lack of well understood and developed rules and models for ethical behaviour in e-business. The paper identifies a brand of radical criticism, which suggests that in our ‘network society’, the very foundations of ethical behaviour are being shaken. It has been argued by computer ethicists that the rapid creation and diffusion of information technology creates ethical and <b>policy</b> <b>vacuums.</b> For example, a number of ethical issues associated with e-business cluster around trust and social justice. In order to develop rules and models for ethical behaviour and to aid policy making in electronic environments it seems important to clarify the nature of such absences. A framework is proposed to evaluate the extent to which types of moral wrongdoing are related specifically to the technologies used. It identifies four categories of ethical issues: those related to electronic environments; those dependent on electronic environments; those determined by electronic environments; and those specific to electronic environments. The paper concludes that the extent, to which ethical issues are new and distinctive, may be exaggerated and the steps needed to address the varieties of moral wrong doing in electronic environments may already be part of our repertoire of policies in regulating the business environment or in promoting ethical cultures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how adult {{education}} can be part of an international response in societies recovering from conflict, which can stabilize rather than de-stabilize, thus enhancing security. The guiding hypothesis was that there has been a failure to recognize the contribution adult education can make in building a secure society, resulting in <b>policy</b> <b>vacuums</b> and under-funding of the sector. The three countries studied were Cambodia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq. The study relied primarily on documentary research, but also on opportunistic data collection during periods of work in each of the three countries. By identifying common themes and practices in each specific scenario, it has been possible to determine the links between adult education and security. The findings supported the guiding hypothesis and affirmed that adult education can play a key role in stabilizing a post-conflict society. The resultant understanding of the links between adult education and societal development underpin a new framework for adult education in such societies, which balances short-term security issues with community values and the longer term requirements of society, reducing the potential for future conflict. An analytical tool and a checklist for adult education practitioners were developed as part of that framework. These could potentially inform decision making within the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom government and the British military...|$|R
40|$|The {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that we in the Computer Ethics community have been perhaps held captive for too long by the rhetoric of revolutionary technological change. It may be worthwhile re-examining this canonical assumption that ethical concerns are necessarily about radical novelty especially given that the theme of this conference is ‘the backwards, forwards and sideways changes of ICT’. The revolutionary view is, of course, metaphorical and metaphors are notorious for their properties of bewitchment. Hannah Arendt reminds us that the original meaning of the metaphor of revolution was ‘return’, a backward revolving motion, suggesting the lawfulness of rotating, cyclic movement of astronomical bodies. The new metaphor denoting novelty, beginning and violence can be dated to the time of the French Revolution (Arendt, 1963, p. 41). The danger of revolutionary rhetoric is that it suggests a kind of irresistibility, a quasi-Marxist view, in which the force of computing transforms society so we have variously ‘the cybernetic’, ‘the computer’, ‘the information’, ‘the virtual’ ‘the digital’, and so on, revolution. These revolutions are then meant to usher in their corresponding societies: the cybernetic, the computer, the information, the virtual, the digital etc. (Winner, 1986; Graham; 1999). In Jim Moor’s now widely accepted standard account of Computer Ethics, as an independent field of theoretical and practical endeavours, the stress is precisely on the need to address the <b>policy</b> <b>vacuums</b> and conceptual muddles thrown up by the radical novelty of revolutionary advances in computing. Moor summarises the argument in this way: “The revolutionary feature of computers is their logical malleability. Logical malleability assures the enormous application of computer technology. This will (sic) bring about the computer revolution. During the Computer Revolution many of our human activities and social institutions will be transformed. These transformations will leave us with <b>policy</b> and conceptual <b>vacuums</b> about how to use computer technology. Such <b>policy</b> and conceptual <b>vacuums</b> are the marks of basic problems within computer ethics. Therefore computer ethics is a field of substantial practical importance. " (Moor, 1985 p. 272) A further part of this standard account is that we must not only fill the <b>policy</b> <b>vacuums</b> retrospectively but attempt to anticipate the future direction of technological travel in order to produce a prospective ethical assessment of likely <b>policy</b> <b>vacuums.</b> I wish to differentiate this revolutionary or ‘innovation-centric’ picture from, what seems to me, a broader and cogent picture, a ‘technology-in-use’ view. David Edgerton in The Shock of the Old: Technology and Global History since 1900, (2006) argues that this innovation-centric picture generally tends to ignore those technologies which are mature and currently in use – their histories and continuing significance. Why should we assume these no longer present ethical problems? Social values change; what once seemed uncontentious may now be contentious and vice versa: “Time was always jumbled up, in the pre-modern era, the post-modern era and the modern era. We worked with old and new things, with hammers and electric drills. In use-centred history technologies do not only appear, they also reappear, and mix and match across the centuries. Since the late 1960 s many more bicycles were produced globally each year than cars. The guillotine made a gruesome return in the 1940 s. Cable TV declined in the 1950 s to reappear in the 1980 s’ (Edgerton, 2006, xii). In its picture of revolutionary irresistibility, innovation-centric view tends to ignore the innovations that failed; it tends to ignore the technology that developed only slowly and not exponentially; it ignores the counterfactuals that is how, for example, the different ways in which information and communication technologies might have developed given different policies, regulatory regimes and social values. Old technologies re-emerge whilst we find emergent limits to new technologies. I will aim in the paper to illustrate this argument by an analysis of Jonathan Zittrain’s recent account of the growth and possible future of the Internet, The Future of the Internet: And How to Stop It (2009). Zittrain’s approach has much in common with that of Jim Moor. He refers, for example, to ‘the modern information revolution’ and considers both the PC and the Internet as revolutionary. If for Jim Moor the revolutionary attribute of computing is ‘logical malleability’ then for Jonathan Zittrain the concept of ‘generativity’ is the revolutionary attribute of PCs and the Internet. Zittrain writes that: “Today the same qualities that led to their successes are causing the Internet and the PC to falter. As ubiquitous as Internet technologies are today, the pieces are in place for a wholesale shift away from the original chaotic design that has given rise to the modern information revolution. This counterrevolution would push mainstream users away from a generative Internet fosters innovation and disruption, to an applanicized network that incorporates some of the most powerful features of today’s Internet while greatly limiting its innovative capacity – and for better or worse, heightening its regulability. ” (Zittrain, 2009, p 8) What I will argue is that Zittrain’s account demonstrates that the innovation-centric approach with its emphasis on irresistibility and novelty misplaces the dynamic from the social to the technological. There was nothing pre-destined about the way the Internet emerged and continues to develop. It was the way in which certain developers and designers chose to instantiate logical malleability to produce generativity which is the key to its current characteristics. The analysis of the history of both the PC and the Internet with the emergence of generativity stems ultimately from the nature of social groups primarily involved in their development (academic researchers, hobbyists, etc.), the values they held and the choices that they made. What I propose is that Zittrain’s history shows that trust and openness were as important, if not more important, than any particular technical attributes. There is a clear link between design choices and the ethos of the Internet and this puts ideas of ‘the good’ at the centre of the discussion. At the same time the possibility of an applanicized network represents the re-emergence, if not of old technology, then of new technologies embedded in old business models and old methods of control. ...|$|R

The Advanced Light Source is a third generation synchrotron radiation source whose beam lifetime depends {{on the quality of}} the vacuum in the storage ring and the connecting beamlines. The storage ring and most of the beamlines share a common vacuum and are operated under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions. All endstations and beamline equipment must be operated so as to avoid contamination of beamline components, and must include proper safeguards to protect the storage ring vacuum from an accidental break in the beamline or endstation vacuum systems. The primary gas load during operation is due to thermal desorption and electron/photon induced desorption of contaminants from the interior of the vacuum vessel and its components. The desorption rates are considerably higher for hydrocarbon contamination, thus considerable emphasis is placed on eliminating these sources of contaminants. All vacuum components in a beamline and endstation must meet the ALS vacuum specifications. The vacuum design of both beamlines and endstations must be approved by the ALS Beamline Review Committee (BRC) before vacuum connections to the storage ring are made. The vacuum design is first checked during the Beamline Design Review (BDR) held before construction of the beamline equipment begins. Any deviation from the ALS vacuum specifications must be approved by the BRC prior to installation of the equipment on the ALS floor. Any modification that is incorporated into a vacuum assembly without the written approval of the BRC is done at the user`s risk and may lead to rejection of the whole assembly...|$|R

Genetic technology is becoming more advanced and sophisticated and is being used increasingly for both medical and non- medical purposes. If sufficient protections are not in place to prohibit the misuse or discriminatory use of genetic information by third parties (for example, employers and insurance companies) then such a legislative and <b>policy</b> <b>vacuum</b> could further setback the inclusion of persons with putative disabilities (and older persons) in the community.

40|$|Indigenous {{disadvantage}} {{and poverty}} have persisted and {{are set to}} continue into the future. Although {{a large amount of}} work describes the extent and nature of indigenous disadvantage and poverty, there is little evidence-based systems understanding of the mechanisms that keep many indigenous people in their current dire state. In such a <b>vacuum,</b> <b>policy</b> makers are left to make assumptions about the causal mechanisms. The persistence of inequality and poverty suffered by indigenous people is broadly consistent with the existence of dynamical traps as described in both the resilience and development literature. We reviewed and synthesized these bodies of literature on traps and found that although they give a good lead to a systemic and parsimonious way of exploring traps, the mechanisms suggested need significant rethinking for the indigenous context. Specifically, we recommend extending the concept of traps to encompass the possibility that they are highly resilient but undesirable states, in contrast to current notions of traps as low resilience states. We also highlight the need for close scrutiny of the boundaries of indigenous systems because of the historically public nature of indigenous lives as well as the possible conjoint existence and causal linkage between poverty- and rigidity-traps in the indigenous context...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of {{the debate on the}} foundations of Computer Ethics (CE). Starting from a discussion of Moor's classic interpretation of the need for CE caused by a <b>policy</b> and conceptual <b>vacuum,</b> five positions in the literature are identified and discussed: the "no resolution approach", according to which CE can have no foundation; the professional approach, according to which CE is solely a professional ethics; the radical approach, according to which CE deals with absolutely unique issues, in need of a unique approach; the conservative approach, according to which CE is only a particular applied ethics, discussing new species of traditional moral issues; and the innovative approach, according to which theoretical CE can expand the metaethical discourse with a substantially new perspective. In the course of the analysis, it is argued that, although CE issues are not uncontroversially unique, they are sufficiently novel to render inadequate the adoption of standard macroethics, such as Utilitarianism and Deontologism, as the foundation of CE and hence to prompt the search for a robust ethical theory. Information Ethics (IE) is proposed for that theory, as the satisfactory foundation for CE. IE is characterised as a biologically unbiased extension of environmental ethics, based on the concepts of information object /infosphere/entropy rather than life/ecosystem/pain. In light of the discussion provided in this paper, it is suggested that CE is worthy of independent study because it requires its own application-specific knowledge and is capable of supporting a methodological foundation, IE...|$|R
40|$|Malawi {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{maternal}} mortality ratios in the world. Unsafe abortions are an important contributor to Malawi’s maternal mortality and morbidity, where abortion is illegal except to save the woman’s life. Postabortion care (PAC) aims to reduce adverse consequences of unsafe abortions, in part by treating incomplete abortions. Although global and national PAC <b>policies</b> recommend manual <b>vacuum</b> aspiration (MVA) for treatment of incomplete abortion, usage in Malawi is low and appears to be decreasing, with sharp curettage being used in preference. There is limited evidence regarding what influences rejection of recommended PAC innovations. Hence, drawing on Greenhalgh et al. ’s (2004. Diffusion of innovations in service organizations: systematic review and recommendations. Milbank Quarterly 82 : 581 – 629.) diffusion of healthcare innovation framework, this qualitative study aimed to investigate factors contributing to the limited and declining use of MVA in Malawi. Semi-structured interviews with 17 PAC providers in a central hospital and a district hospital indicate that a range of factors coalesce and influence PAC and MVA use in Malawi. Factors pertain to four main domains: the system (shortages of material and human resources; lack of training, supervision and feedback), relationships (power dynamics; expected job roles), the health workers (attitudes towards abortion and PAC; prioritization of PAC) and the innovation (perceived risks and benefits of MVA use). Effective and sustainable PAC policy must adopt a broader people-centred health systems approach which considers all these factors, their interactions and the wider socio-cultural, legal and political context of abortion and PAC. The study showed the value of using Greenhalgh et al. ’s (2004. Diffusion of innovations in service organizations: systematic review and recommendations. Milbank Quarterly 82 : 581 – 629.) framework to consider the complex interaction of factors surrounding innovation use (or lack of), but provided more insights into rejections of innovations and, particularly, a low- and middle-income country perspective...|$|R
