40|$|Two changes {{happened}} in 1998 that affect pension planning in a Swedish municipality. In the first place, there were changes in laws that affect accounting for pensions: Accrued pension rights {{that have been}} earned from 1998 have to be entered as a liability in the balance sheet. Pension rights that are earned {{in a given year}} must appear as a cost in the income statement, and similarly for interest cost relating to the pension debt. Also, the budget of a municipality has to balance. That is, budgeted revenues have to exceed budgeted costs. The result of these law changes is to necessitate a strengthening of municipal balance sheets. More precisely, municipalities are required to start funding the pensions of their employees, as pensions rights are earned. In the second place, a new pension agreement was signed between municipalities and labor unions representing municipal employees. This agreement, named PFA 98, is based on annual pension dues that accrue over time until retirement and are then transferred into a monthly pension amount, rather than on a specific <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> that is given already at the time when the pension rights are earned. (That is, a <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> is only given when an employee retires.) It is hence fairly simple to simulate the evolution of the municipal pension debt under the PFA 98 agreement. This report undertakes such a simulation. It shows annual forecasts for municipal pension debt, pension costs, and pension payments until 2043, for the total set of municipalities in Sweden. The report also investigates the consequences of the changes in laws mentioned earlier as regards the asset side of a municipal balance sheet. For instance, due to {{the manner in which the}} relevant laws are written, there may arise an overfunding of the pension debt. The report also includes a comparison with pension foundations in private companies (these are one particular manner, with some associated tax advantages, of managing a portfolio of assets acquired as pension debt funding). It is also argued that the strengthening of municipal balance sheets mentioned earlier will probably to a large extent take place through the reduction of external debt.

We ask: does the state get value-for-money from these subsidies? To answer the question we introduce the fair value approach to value pension entitlements. The current regulatory regime is shown to be very weak, with the security of pension entitlements of those in private sector employment below that of investment grade debt (so the <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> if tradeable would have junk status). We suggest and analyse measures to improve members` security. We recommend that an explicit percentage of the fair value of pension entitlements be made a debt on the sponsoring employer and {{that there should be}} regular disclosure to members of the level of security backing their pension entitlement.

Over the last forty years, pension institutions have been facing major economic and demo-graphic challenges. This ‘affordability crisis ’ has slowly eroded the confidence of large segments of the population in the old pension contract, while paving the way for the anti-welfare rhetoric and in-itiatives of more than a conservative policy entrepreneur.

40|$|Most {{countries}} have separate pension plan for public sector employees. The future fiscal burden of these plans can be substantial {{as the government}} usually is the largest employer, pension promises {{in the public sector}} tend to be relatively generous, and future payments have to be paid out directly from government revenues (pay-as-you-go) or by funded plans (pension funds) which tend to be underfunded. The valuation and disclosure of these promises in some countries lacks transparency, which may be hiding potentially huge fiscal liabilities that are being passed on to future generations of workers. In order to arrive at a fair comparison between countries regarding the fiscal burden of their DB public sector pension plans, this paper gathers more evidence on public sector pension plans regarding the type of <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> and quantifies the future tax burden related to these pension promises. The reported liabilities are recalculated using both a fair value approach (local market discount rates) and a common, fixed discount rate across all countries which reflects projected growth in national income. We also estimate for a number of plans from a sample of OECD countries the size of the net unfunded liabilities in fair value terms as of the end of 2008. This fiscal burden can also be interpreted as the implicit pension debt in fair value terms. ...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has posed profound threats to pension welfare worldwide. This is particularly {{so in the}} United Kingdom with the closure of private defined benefit plans, and the heavy losses experienced by many defined contribution pension plan participants. Meeting these challenges has placed a premium on plan governance, given its link to fund performance. This paper begins by considering the academic literature on institutional change, including {{an analysis of the}} most common ways of responding to a changing environment. It is noted that the nature and scope of institutional response to a changing environment depends, in part, upon funds’ governance budgets, including time, expertise and common commitment. Our research on UK governance suggests that incremental adaptation has been the operative strategy augmented, in some cases, by the adoption of UK corporate governance practices. Three types of innovation in the governance of UK pension plans are identified: the transformation of decision-making, the pension buy-out and fiduciary management alongwith an emerging ‘new’ model of pension fund governance. In the penultimate section of this paper, lessons from UK best practice are drawn for institutions that face unprecedented challenges in realising the <b>pension</b> <b>promise.</b> Thereafter, we suggest a possible approach for regulators to strengthen the pension fund sector, based on improved disclosure, independent board chairs and the skills of board members...|$|E
40|$|This {{second edition}} of Pensions at a Glance updates all the {{important}} indicators of retirement-income systems developed for the first edition. The values of all pension system parameters reflect {{the situation in the}} year 2004. The general approach adopted is a “microeconomic” one, looking at prospective individual entitlements under all 30 of OECD member countries’ pension regimes. The report starts by showing the different schemes that together make up national retirement income provision, including a summary of the parameters and rules of pension systems. This is followed by eight main indicators of pension income that are calculated using the OECD pension models. This issue also contains two special analyses on pension reforms and private pensions, which use the OECD pension models to explore more deeply the central issues of pension policy in national debates. Finally, the report provides detailed background information on each of the 30 countries’ retirement-income arrangements. For workers at average earnings, the average for the OECD countries of the gross replacement rate, i. e. the ratio between pension benefit and pre-retirement earnings, from mandatory pensions is 58. 7 %. But taxes {{play an important role in}} old-age support. Pensioners often do not pay social security contributions and, as personal income taxes are progressive and pension entitlements are usually lower than earnings before retirement, they usually pay less taxes. For average earners, the net replacement rate across OECD countries is nearly 70 % on average, some 11 percentage points higher than the average gross replacement rate. For low earners, the average net replacement rate across OECD countries is 83 %. But there are regional differences: the Nordic countries offer a 95 % net replacement rate to workers on half average earnings while the Anglophone OECD countries pay 76 % of previous net earnings. What matters for governments, however, is not only the replacement rate but the value of the overall <b>pension</b> <b>promise.</b> This is measured by the indicator of pension wealth which takes life expectancy and the indexation of pensions in payment into account. Using this indicator, the <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> is most expensive in Luxembourg. On average, each male pensioner will receive the equivalent of USD 920 000 and each female retiree over USD 1 million. The Netherlands and Greece rank second and third on this measure. The most modest pension systems are those of Belgium, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States where pension wealth is around two-thirds of the average for OECD countries. The lowest ranking is occupied by Mexico where men and women are promised a pension equivalent to USD 34 000 and 32 000, respectively. Nearly all the 30 OECD countries have made at least some changes to their pension systems since 1990. As a result, the average <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> in the 16 countries - whose reforms are studied in this report - was cut by 22 %. For women, the reduction was 25 %. Only in two of the 16 countries – Hungary and the United Kingdom – were there increased pension promises on average. How will these changes affect different individuals? Some countries – such as France, Portugal and the United Kingdom – are moving towards greater targeting of public pensions on low earners thus bolstering the safety-net. Others – such as Poland and the Slovak Republic – have moved to tighten the link between pension entitlements and earnings, which may put low-earners at a higher risk of poverty. In Germany, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the Slovak Republic, for example, the net pension entitlement for a full-career worker with half average earnings was around 41 % of average earnings before reform, slightly below the average for the OECD as a whole. The reforms will cut this to just 32. 5 %. In contrast, Finland, France, Hungary, Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have protected low-income workers from cuts in benefit in their pension reforms. The intense reform activity in OECD countries means that today’s workers will have to do more on their own to prepare for tomorrow’s retirement. In some countries, the savings effort necessary to reach the OECD average replacement rate is substantial, even if workers save throughout their entire career. If young workers miss out on the first 10 or 15 years of their career because of other demands on their budget, reaching a sufficient pension level will become even more difficult. This report illustrates how important it is that workers start saving early and contribute regularly. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{private sector}} {{employers}} have {{moved away from}} providing final salary defined benefit (DB) pensions to their employees, attention has increasingly focused on the public sector's continued provision of such pensions {{and the value of}} these <b>pension</b> <b>promises</b> to public sector employees. The estimated underlying liabilities of such plans have increased sharply in recent years, at least in part due to unanticipated increases in longevity. This has led to reforms of all the major public sector pension schemes, the net result of which has been to reduce the level of benefits offered by the schemes (predominantly to new, rather than existing members). This paper examines, {{in the context of the}} Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS), how much the <b>pension</b> <b>promises</b> are worth and what effect the change in scheme rules has had on them. This paper also addresses a number of other issues that are important when valuing DB pension rights and their relation to overall remuneration. First, how increases in current pay feed through into pension values. Second, how the age profile of earnings affects the profile of pension accrual. Finally, how the value of pension rights in DB schemes compares to that in a stylised defined contribution (DC) scheme. The figures presented in this paper relate specifically to the composition of members and the specific scheme rules of the TPS. However, the issues raised apply equally to other DB schemes, both public and private sector. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two pension decisions which firms {{must make}} when {{they offer a}} defined benefit pension plan: how to pick the appropriate rate for discounting pension liabilities and how to allocate the assets in the pension plan. The correct allocation of assets must be driven by frictions which occur in real world financial markets. In the absence of market frictions, the asset allocation decision is irrelevant. The paper first reviews the theory which describes the optimal asset allocation {{in the presence of}} distortionary taxes and imperfect capital markets. This allows us to examine the role played by the pension plan in the financial structure of the firm. It also provides us the background for examining the actual asset allocation of defined benefit pension assets. The paper then turns to the choice of discount rates. If the goal is to value the pension liabilities, the correct discount rate should depend upon the type of risk inherent in the <b>pension</b> <b>promise.</b> The paper begins by developing the theory behind choosing the discount rate in a world without market frictions and then extends the analysis to the presence of market imperfections. I then compare the theory to the actual discount rates chosen by firms. I find that the discount rates are significantly lower than equivalent market rates and are very insensitive to changes in market rates. The framework of the paper provides a background for discussing the implications of the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension plans on capital markets [...] given the perceived difference in how these two types of plans invest their assets...|$|E
40|$|Reforming {{pensions}} {{looms large}} over the policy agenda of OECD countries. This {{is hardly surprising}} since public spending on pensions accounted on average for 7 per cent of OECD GDP in 2005; and this pension spending effort is set to increase significantly over the coming decades in response to population ageing. Pension policy is indeed challenging and controversial because it involves long-term decisions {{in the face of}} numerous short-term political pressures. However, the status quo does not always win out so far as pension reform in concerned: public finance crises and the looming threat of ageing populations have proved effective spurs for reform. As a result, much has been done since the early 1990 s to make pension systems fit for the future. Nearly all the 30 OECD countries have made at least some changes to their pension systems in that period. In 16 of them, there have been major reforms that will significantly affect future benefits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarise these reforms and highlight the main lessons. Section 1 looks at which countries reformed their pensions systems and which did not. It also examines the fiscal challenges posed by public pensions. Section 2 describes the measures in the reforms themselves. These include, among other things, increases in pension age, changes in the way benefits are calculated and smaller pension increases in retirement than in the past. Section 3 explores the impact of these reforms on future pension entitlements of today’s retirees, showing a clear trend to a lower <b>pension</b> <b>promise</b> for today’s workers than for past generations. This means that people will need to save more for their own retirement via private pension schemes, an issue examined in Section 4.

By comparing the Italian and German reform patterns, this thesis suggests that answering the puzzle requires focusing on two sets of interrelated transformations: the prominence of so-called 'systemic risks' and the changing ways of political representation. Risks hereby defined as 'systemic'first emerged in Western political economies in the 1970 s, only to turn into a recurring malaise during the following decades (Streeck 2011). Unlike the risks central to the post-war welfare state model, they far outreach the individual level, being borne by the community or by society as a whole. Furthermore, those risks proved somehow resilient to traditional means of public intervention and management. Systemic risks, in sum, have originated a distinctive combination of functional and political effects, ultimately providing a functional as well as a political rationale to risk shifting reforms. Again, since the 1970 s political representation has also changed. On the one side, the traditional mass party model has been replaced by new organisational forms, while new parties and party families have emerged, activating novel issues and cleavages. On the other side, industrial representation in the corporate arena changed as well, becoming less organised all over the industrialised world. Systemic risks, then, have further influenced transformations in both the electoral and the corporate arenas, further eroding the political consensus for expanding social responsibility and socialising risks. It was, in other words, the co-evolution of problems and politics (to put it in Kingdon's terms) to lead popular and strongly institutionalised pension systems to challenge the basic tenets of their pension promises, although this common story played out very differently across different countries {{as a result of the}} action of national institutional filters (policy legacies and the functioning of the electoral and corporate arenas) ...|$|E
