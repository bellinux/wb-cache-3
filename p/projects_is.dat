5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned <b>projects</b> <b>is</b> increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{developed}} means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as diphtheria), and genetic engineering.

25|$|As {{with all}} infrastructural {{investments}} in the energy sector, developing storage facilities is capital intensive. Investors usually use the return on investment as a financial measure for the viability of such projects. It {{has been estimated that}} investors require a rate or return between 12 percent to 15 percent for regulated projects, and close to 20 percent for unregulated projects. The higher expected return from unregulated <b>projects</b> <b>is</b> due to the higher perceived market risk. In addition significant expenses are accumulated during the planning and location of potential storage sites to determine its suitability, which further increases the risk.|$|E
25|$|As a tool {{applied to}} making an {{investment}} decision, {{to decide whether}} a project adds value or not, comparing the IRR of a single project with the required rate of return, in isolation from any other <b>projects,</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the NPV method. If the appropriate IRR (if such can be found correctly) {{is greater than the}} required rate of return, then using the required rate of return to discount cash flows to their present value, the NPV of that project will be positive, and vice versa. However, using IRR to sort projects in order of preference does not result in the same order as using NPV.|$|E
