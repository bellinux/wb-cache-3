40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} identify past efforts in providing control guidance for aircraft upset recovery including stall recovery. Because guidance is integrally linked to the intended function of aircraft attitude awareness and upset recognition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to consider these issues separately. This {{literature review}} covered the aspects of instrumentation and display symbologies for attitude awareness, aircraft upset recognition, upset and stall alerting, and control guidance. Many different forms of symbology have been investigated including, but not limited to, <b>pitch</b> scale depictions, <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> icons, horizon symbology, attitude recovery arrows, and pitch trim indicators. Past research on different visual and alerting strategies that provide advisories, cautions, and warnings to pilots before entering an unusual attitude (UA) are also discussed. Finally, potential control guidance for recovery from upset or unusual attitudes, including approach-to-stall and stall conditions, are reviewed. Recommendations for future research are made...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{may develop}} small [...] "precession" [...] errors, in pitch indication during {{extended periods of}} acceleration or deceleration and, in bank indication during extended periods in a turn, caused by the mechanism that normally keeps the gyro rotor properly erected. These errors develop very slowly (usually at not more than 2 or 3 degrees per minute) and are not significant in normal flying. Some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> can only tolerate a specific range of bank angles. If the aircraft rolls too steeply or achieves an extreme <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> — while performing aerobatics, for example — the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> can [...] "tumble" [...] (or [...] "topple") and become temporarily unusable. For this reason, some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> are fitted with a [...] "caging mechanism" [...] (a device to restore the gyroscope to an erect position). Some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> can be manually erected once the airplane is in level flight using the caging mechanism. Most modern instruments are designed to tolerate 360 degrees of rotation in pitch and roll without tumbling, although periods of violent aerobatics may tumble any gyro horizon. [...] Once tumbled, an instrument without a caging mechanism {{may not be able}} to re-erect itself until power is removed and the aircraft is in a level <b>pitch</b> and roll <b>attitude</b> for a long enough period that the gyro rotor comes to a stop.|$|R

40|$|A {{homemade}} {{peripheral vision}} horizon device (PVHD) made from an eight-ball <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> with a slit cut at the equator {{of the eight}} ball, and a light source at its center that was used on a I- 37 for several years is discussed. The instrument produced a sharp white line about one-fourth of an inch that extended completely across the cockpit from about the left to the right quarterpanels. The line remained parallel to the real horizon during all maneuvers. Its brightness and vertical distance from the horizon were adjustable in flight, as was the lateral center-of-rotation in later flights. Flight demonstrations were done on visual flight rules (VFR) moonless nights and over terrain with few lights. Pilot responses were mostly favorable to enthusiastic, with no negative reactions. Problem areas noted were the upright-inverted ambiguity; one pilot recovered inverted following an unusual attitude exercise and a general deterioration in the naturalness of cuing at bank angles greater than 60 deg or <b>pitch</b> <b>attitudes</b> greater than 30 deg...|$|R

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} of three head-down display (HDD) concepts with flight-director guidance superimposed on forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imagery {{was performed to}} evaluate the task of low-level, terrain-following (TF), manual helicopter flight. The three display concepts were examined {{for the purpose of}} finding ways by which aircraft flight-attitude and command symbols and FLIR imagery could be integrated onto one instrument. In all cases, the FLIR imagery was centered on the flight-path vector of the aircraft. The three displays were then characterized by having: (1) <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> conformal to the FLIR imagery; (2) <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> conformal to the FLIR imagery, but with an increase in the scaling; and (3) <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> nonconformal to the FLIR imagery with the same pitch scaling as in (2). The simulation was conducted on the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at Ames Research Center, using NASA and Air Force test pilots. The pilots indicated that the nonconformal <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> and FLIR display was the preferred way to display information because of the absence of pitch-attitude information on displays (1) and (2) during some portions of the operational flight envelope...|$|R

40|$|Recovery {{performance}} of a commuter-type aircraft in a microburst encounter is studied using a constant-pitch-attitude strategy and flight path optimization. Results obtained indicate that the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> which maximized climb rate in a wind shear condition {{is strongly dependent on}} whether the aircraft is subjected to a horizontal shear or a downdraft. The <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> which maximizes ground clearance depends on the altitude of the encounter, the strength of the microburst, and the initial position of the aircraft with respect to the downburst core. Best results are obtained at relatively low target pitch angles, in severe wind shear encounters at very low altitudes. A technique for maximizing ground clearance involves maintaining a low <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> early in the encounter, followed by a gradual pitch-up that ceases when the wind shear has been excited...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the lack}} of a direct link with the {{operations}} in short-range air combat, conventional aircraft flying qualities criteria are inappropriate to guide the design of a task-tailored flight control law. By applying the mission-oriented flying qualities evaluation approach, various aircraft with different control law parameters are evaluated on a ground-based simulator. This paper compares the evaluation results with several conventional flying qualities criteria, and discusses the appropriate parameter combination to reflect the flying qualities requirements of short-range air combat. The comparison and analysis show that a short-range air combat mission requires a higher minimum short period mode natural frequency and a smaller maximum roll mode time constant, and allows a lower minimum <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> bandwidth and a higher maximum short period mode damp ratio than those of conventional flying qualities criteria. Furthermore, a combination of the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> bandwidth, the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> magnitude at the bandwidth frequency, and the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> transfer function gain can define the flying qualities requirements of short-range air combat. The new metric can successfully predict the flying quality levels of aircraft in a short-range air combat mission...|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} the PFD usually {{contains}} an <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (AI), which gives the pilot information about the aircraft's pitch and roll characteristics, and {{the orientation of the}} aircraft with respect to the horizon. Unlike a traditional <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> however, the mechanical gyroscope is not contained within the panel itself, but is rather a separate device whose information is simply displayed on the PFD. The <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to look very much like traditional mechanical AIs. Other information {{that may or may not}} appear on or about the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> can include the stall angle, a runway diagram, ILS localizer and glide-path “needles”, and so on. Unlike mechanical instruments, this information can be dynamically updated as required; the stall angle, for example, can be adjusted in real time to reflect the calculated critical angle of attack of the aircraft in its current configuration (airspeed, etc.). The PFD may also show an indicator of the aircraft's future path (over the next few seconds), as calculated by onboard computers, making it easier for pilots to anticipate aircraft movements and reactions.|$|R
50|$|Boats with {{outboard}} engines will often have trim tabs {{attached to the}} lower unit of the engine. These are used to adjust the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> of the boat while underway.

The criteria are based on closed-loop techniques using <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude,</b> altitude rate at the pilot station, and altitude at the pilot station as dominating control parameters during this task.

50|$|The high <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> {{and loss}} of speed put the {{airplane}} in a stall situation.

50|$|The airplane’s {{aerodynamic}} performance subsequently deteriorated rapidly, {{especially as}} a result of the non-retraction of the gear, which added to the effect of maintaining a high <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude.</b> In addition, it should be emphasized that the high altitude of the aerodrome and the high temperature on the day, as well as a take-off weight close to the maximum also contributed to limiting the airplane’s performance. During the initial climb, the high <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> and the yaw induced by the failure of the left engine (which had the effect of increasing the drag at a critical moment), added to the factors previously mentioned.|$|R
50|$|The {{pilot of}} an {{aircraft}} with positive longitudinal stability, {{whether it is}} a human pilot or an autopilot, has an easy task to fly the aircraft and maintain the desired <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> which, in turn, makes it easy to control the speed, angle of attack and fuselage angle relative to the horizon. The pilot of an aircraft with negative longitudinal stability has a more difficult task to fly the aircraft.
