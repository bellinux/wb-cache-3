40|$|We {{describe}} the calculations used to design an aluminum foam protection layer for {{a stainless steel}} neutron exposure sample <b>case.</b> The layer <b>protects</b> the <b>case</b> from impulsive loads generated by a 20 MJ NIF capsule 10 cm from the sample case assembly. Impulse only from ablating x-rays and hohlraum plasma debris is considered. One dimensional CALE foam response calculations and analytic estimates are used to show that 1 cm of aluminum 6101 -T 6 foam 10 % of solid density is sufficient to attenuate the incoming peak pressure without complete melting on crush-up. Two dimensional DYNA calculations show that a 304 stainless steel spherical shell sample case with an inner radius of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 2 mm encased in 1 cm of foam does not yield to the pressure that is transmitted through the foam by a 220 Pa-sec (2. 2 ktap), 2 GPa (20 kbar) load due to recoil of x- ray ablation. An unprotected spherical shell case subjected to a gentler load with peak pressure reduced to 0. 2 GPa (2 kbar) not only yields but its effective plastic strain exceeds the failure point of 0. 4 in 304 stainless steel after 160 microseconds. Doubling the impulse for the <b>protected</b> <b>case</b> to approximately account for debris loading results in very localized yield and an effective plastic strain that does not exceed 0. 014.

40|$|Abstract—The {{distance}} protection mainly the impedance relay {{which is considered}} as the main protection for transmission lines can be subjected to impedance measurement error which is, mainly, due to the fault resistance and to the power fluctuation. Thus, the impedance relay may not operate for a short circuit {{at the far end}} of the <b>protected</b> line (<b>case</b> of the under reach) or operates for a fault beyond its <b>protected</b> zone (<b>case</b> of overreach). In this paper, an approach to fault detection by a {{distance protection}}, which distinguishes between the faulty conditions and the effect of overload operation mode, has been developed. This approach is based on the symmetrical components; mainly the negative sequence, and it is taking into account both the effect of fault resistance and the overload situation which both have an effect upon the reliability of the protection in terms of dependability for the former and security for the latter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Demand {{for fast}} failure {{recovery}} in modern IPbased networks has become compelling recently. Loop-Free Alternates {{is a simple}} IP Fast ReRoute specification proposed by the IETF that does not require profound changes to the network infrastructure before deployment. However this simplicity has a disadvantage, in that usually LFA does not provide complete protection for all possible failure cases in a general topology. The LFA graph extension problem asks for adding new links to the network {{in an attempt to}} improve the failure case coverage. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-complete. In this paper, we give a detailed graph model for this problem, for the first time formulating it both for the link and node <b>protecting</b> <b>cases,</b> and we propose several fast approximation algorithms to solve it. We compare the performance of the algorithms in extensive numerical studies and we conclude that the optimum can be approximated well in most cases relevant to practice.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} Hamiltonians describing low frequency edge states at the interface between materials characterized by different topological phases. We consider general as well as (fermionic) time reversal symmetric (TRS) models. In the former case, Hamiltonians are classified as Fredholm operators with possibly non-trivial index, while in the latter case, the classification involves a Z_ 2 index. These indices {{are related to the}} number of topologically protected edge states and are by construction immune to a large class of random perturbations. We introduce one dimensional scattering problems along the edge and show that the scattering matrix, modeling transmission and reflection transport along the edge, is very sensitive to the topology of the Hamiltonians. In topologically <b>protected</b> <b>cases,</b> we show that transmission is always possible, and hence that localization cannot occur. We show that the absence of backscattering is also topologically protected for specific propagating signals. Asymptotic results are obtained within the diffusion approximation of field propagation.
