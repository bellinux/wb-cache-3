5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to {{the shore of the}} loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (<b>pigeon</b> <b>house)</b> and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E
5|$|Dirleton Castle {{stands on}} a rocky outcrop, {{at the heart of}} the rich {{agricultural}} lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kaftin {{was noted}} for its {{numerous}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> where thousands of white pigeons would breed annually. In the 1790s English traveler William George Browne described the houses as [...] "remarkable." [...] When the young pigeons were able to fly, they would be collected and supplied to the markets of the nearby villages and Aleppo {{where they would be}} sold as valuable commodities. The <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> were tall and narrow buildings, some of them reaching a height of 50 feet, and they numbered 72, although at the time the majority of them were in ruins.|$|R

50|$|Among Göreme's {{historically}} important {{sites are}} Ortahane, Durmus Kadir, Yusuf Koc and Bezirhane churches, {{in addition to}} the richly decorated Tokali Kilise, the Apple Church, and a number of homes and <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> carved straight into the rock formations in the town.|$|R
5|$|The {{estate of}} Craigie is {{recorded}} {{as belonging to}} one John de Craigie in the reign of David I (1124–1153). In 1387 the estate passed by marriage to John Stewart, son of Sir Robert Stewart of Durisdeer. The Stewarts sold the estate, which by this time had a tower house, in 1643 to John Fairholm, treasurer to the City of Edinburgh. In 1682 John Fairholm's granddaughter Sophia, aged only 14, married William Johnstone, 2nd Earl of Annandale, and Craigiehall changed ownership again. Only two built features on the estate date from before this time; the 17th century east sundial, and the ruined doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> dated 1672. The east sundial {{is one of only}} 25 obelisk-type sundials in Scotland, and was re-erected to the east of the house in 1965, after being found in a field to the south of the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{street lamps}} {{on the square}} are of two {{different}} designs. Those on the outer sides, {{in front of the}} houses are seemingly of the style called The Scotch Standard, dating from 1903 to 1920 when Dublin streets were being electrically lit as part of the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House</b> scheme. On the inner (park) side of the street, a slightly more modest design is used, apparently consistent with a more recent 1940–50 design. These designs are all 9 metres tall.|$|E
25|$|The first avenue on the left, beyond Nutgrove avenue, is Whitehall Road where stands that curious {{structure}} {{known as}} the Bottle Tower or Hall's Barn. This was built by Major Hall in 1742 in imitation of the better constructed Wonderful Barn erected about the same period near Leixlip. The floors and other timber work have long disappeared and the winding stone steps are not considered safe to ascend. While the ground floor {{may have been used}} as a barn, the first and second floors appear to have been residential as they are both fitted with fireplaces. A smaller structure behind the barn, built on somewhat similar lines was a <b>pigeon</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mary's loft, {{located at}} the Exeter home of a {{shoemaker}} named Charlie Brewer who had become a loft keeper and intelligence agent during the war, was damaged during the Luftwaffe's 1942 raids on Exeter, killing many of the <b>pigeons</b> <b>housed</b> there. Mary, however, survived.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Houses</b> for <b>pigeons</b> are {{generally}} called lofts. <b>Pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> are also {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "coops" [...] although the word seems to have originally applied to the breeding pens inside the housing. [...] There are as many different kinds of enclosures used to <b>house</b> <b>pigeons</b> in as there are pigeon fanciers. [...] There are no real constraints on the design of <b>housing</b> for <b>pigeons</b> but {{there are some things that}} most fanciers find desirable.|$|R

[...] "In my country, we hang up dead corbies where living corbies haunt, {{but not in}} our gardens or <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses.</b> The very scent of the carrion--faugh--reached my {{nostrils}} at the distance where we stood." ...|$|R
25|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the road is Crannagh Park and Road, Rathfarnham Park and Ballytore Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named Tower Court in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> a relic of Lord Ely's occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A floor of more recent date has been inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.|$|E
500|$|Natural hybrids between B.s. var.spinulosa and B.ericifolia subsp.ericifolia {{have been}} {{recorded}} at <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House</b> Mountain in Morton National Park. Banksia [...] "Giant Candles" [...] was a chance garden hybrid between B.ericifolia and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii.|$|E
500|$|A 16th-century [...] "beehive" [...] shape doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> {{is located}} to the south, {{containing}} around 600 nesting boxes. The [...] structure rises in four steps, divided by [...] "rat courses"; projecting ribs which prevented rats from climbing inside.|$|E
2500|$|These <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> often contain {{specially}} constructed openings {{to allow}} the pigeon keeper to give his animals liberty for purposes of exercise while allowing them to re-enter the house without special assistance from the keeper. [...] At the same time these houses are constructed to keep the pigeons safe from predators and inclement weather and give them nesting places in which to raise their squabs.|$|R
50|$|The African harrier-hawk is omnivorous, {{eating the}} fruit of the oil palm as well as hunting small vertebrates. Its ability to climb, using wings as well as feet, and its long double-jointed legs, enable this bird to raid the nests of cavity-nesters such as barbets and woodhoopoes for fledglings. It has been known to prey on {{introduced}} species such as feral <b>pigeons,</b> <b>house</b> sparrows and eastern gray squirrels.|$|R
40|$|Chlamydiaceae are obligate {{intracellular}} Gram-negative bacteria {{found all}} over the world and known to cause various forms of disease in animals and humans. Urban pigeons are known to be an important reservoir of Chlamydia psittaci, the agent of human psittacosis. In this study, we examined the influence of <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> used to regulate pigeon populations and of melanin-based coloration on several epidemiological parameters of Chlamydiaceae in 708 urban pigeons in Paris. We also identified species and genotypes of Chlamydiaceae present in Parisian populations. First, our results revealed that pigeons roosting and breeding in <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> were equally infected by Chlamydiaceae as those that did not. Second, we found that dark melanic pigeons excreted more Chlamydiaceae than pale melanic ones. Finally, species and strain diversities were very low: all samples were of C. psittaci genotype B. Nevertheless, two atypical Chlamydiaceae were identified based on 16 S rRNA and ompA sequences. Our study thus highlights the importance of considering environmental and host phenotype when investigating the epidemiology of infectious diseases...|$|R
500|$|There is a well-preserved 16th-century beehive-shaped doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> in {{the castle}} grounds. The doocot is [...] high, and {{contains}} around 1000 nesting boxes for pigeons, which were {{an important source of}} food for the castle's inhabitants. To the north-east, now located outside the castle gardens, is a 16th-century gateway which formerly served the castle, but now serves the adjacent farm.|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{the curtain}} {{wall is a}} deep, rock-cut ditch, with a larger second ditch around [...] away, {{defining}} the [...] outer court of the castle. Within the outer ditch are two mounds, which Charles McKean suggests may conceal 16th-century caponiers, defensive positions allowing covering fire along the trench. McKean notes that Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, the King's Master of Works, and a noted military engineer who built Scotland's only known caponiers at Craignethan and Blackness, was present with the King during the 1528 siege, and worked at Tantallon afterwards. A stone-fronted mound formerly ran along {{the outside of the}} ditch, although only a [...] section of the outer wall survives, at the south end, terminating in a two-storey round tower. This tower, with several gun ports, was built prior to the siege of 1528, and may have been inspired by the new artillery defences at nearby Dunbar Castle. A 17th-century [...] "lectern" [...] type doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> is the only building within the outer court. Beyond the outer ditch is a 17th-century ravelin, a triangular earthen artillery defence, and the remains of a third, smaller, ditch.|$|E
500|$|The outer walls, {{dating from}} the early-mid 16th century, are smaller and less {{formidable}} than the inner walls, but they enclose a much larger area. A round tower at the north-east corner has gun holes and a doocot, or <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> upstairs. The family chapel was built around 1520, and dedicated to St Thomas Becket. It is now a roofless burial aisle, still used by the Gilmour family. Gardens occupied {{the east and west}} parts of the courtyard, with the western terrace overlooked by the large windows of the west range. The barn at the north-west of the courtyard was converted into a Presbyterian church, for the village of Liberton, in 1687. South of the castle were informal gardens and orchards, with the bases of 16th-century viewing towers remaining at the corners of this drystone-walled enclosure. The former fish pond, shaped like a letter P for Preston, is a nationally significant archaeological garden feature, due to its rarity. In the 1820s, a plan was drawn up to lay out picturesque landscape gardens between Inch House and the castle, which would have incorporated [...] "Queen Mary's Tree", a Sycamore supposedly planted by Mary, Queen of Scots. Much of the woodland within the castle estate dates from the early to mid 19th century.|$|E

50|$|His private {{documents}} mainly {{consist of}} sale and loan contracts, but {{also include the}} marriage contracts of his two daughters and other legal papers. He invested his income and became relatively wealthy. He owned building plots in the town as well as grain land, palm groves, vineyards, and even parts (shares) of <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses.</b> Parts of archives belonging to his relatives (including his brother Phibis and his cousin Panebchounis) also survive and together they provide information about social life in late Hellenistic Egypt.|$|R
25|$|In 1924 artist Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock {{introduced}} Montague to illustrator Coles Phillips, also {{a resident}} of New Rochelle. A noted pigeon fancier, Phillips suggested to Montague that {{they could make a}} substantial amount of money raising and selling squabs to restaurants and hotels. The breed chosen was the red carneau. Together they bought four acres of land on Webster Avenue near the Wykagyl Country Club, built a row of <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> and installed 4,000 birds. The result, called the Silver Ring Squab Farm, had set the two back a total of $15,000.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the field}} (now a {{recreation}} ground) {{to the west}} of the church is a 16th-century <b>pigeon</b> <b>house,</b> where pigeons were bred for food. [...] It has a curious northern doorway, which may have been brought from elsewhere. There are nesting places ('pigeon holes') for 216 pigeons. In later years it formed part of Place Farm and was used as a shelter for cattle. At the end of the 20th century it was cleaned out, repaired and secured.|$|E
2500|$|The {{present day}} Hawridge Court, a private property, {{contains}} {{the location of}} the original medieval manor house which was surrounded by a ringwork, now designated a Scheduled Monument. [...] The ringwork was most likely constructed shortly after the Norman Conquest though some archaeological features point to it having a much earlier, prehistoric origin. It is oval in shape measuring 60×50 metres in diameter, is bounded by a rampart 16 metres wide and between two and five metres high and an external ditch which includes a deep moat for part of its circumference. A gap and causeway marks the probable original entrance. On the outside there is a moat, also dated to the medieval period, which almost surrounds the ramparts The original manor house, built by 1223, was replaced by an 18th-century Grade II listed, timber-framed farmhouse. All that remains of the original manor buildings is a granary (or possibly <b>pigeon</b> <b>house)</b> relocated inside the plot and converted into a timber and brick cottage during the Tudor period. Additional barns were constructed in the 18th century. Hawridge Court was occupied periodically by the Lord of the Manors of Hawridge and Cholesbury.|$|E
60|$|It was {{too late}} and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House.</b> We had to be home before four o'clock lest our {{adventure}} should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.|$|E
50|$|Since {{their initial}} {{domestication}} by people, pigeons {{have been seen}} as a cheap source of good meat. The Romans certainly kept pigeons for food as evidenced {{by the fact that they}} were familiar with the practice of force feeding squabs in order to fatten the young pigeons faster. Pigeons were especially prized because they would produce fresh meat during the winter months when larger animals were unavailable as a food source. In the past wealthy landowners often had <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses</b> and kept <b>pigeons.</b> Strict laws were enacted to protect the inhabitants of these structures.|$|R
50|$|When {{eggs are}} removed in {{artificial}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>houses,</b> {{the interval between}} reproductive attempts is strongly reduced, which reduces {{the efficiency of the}} method. Dummy egg nesting programs have therefore been tested in some cities with mixed results. There, the eggs are removed and replaced with dummy eggs. The real eggs are then destroyed. Such structures are being used in New York City and also the Melbourne city centre by the Melbourne City Council at Batman Park The loft used in Melbourne is on stilts, with a cage door allowing access from beneath for accessing the structure at night when the pigeons are asleep.|$|R

6000|$|The summer {{holidays}} were near at hand when I {{made up my}} mind {{to break out of the}} weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day's miching. Each of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal Bridge. Mahony's big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House.</b> Leo Dillon was afraid we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House.</b> We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own sixpence. When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands, laughing, and Mahony said: ...|$|E
60|$|This great {{difficulty}} being settled, my Lord Bagwig lent my father his own yacht, then lying at the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House,</b> and the handsome Bell Brady was induced {{to run away}} with him to England, although her parents were against the match, and her lovers (as I have heard her tell many thousands of times) {{were among the most}} numerous and the most wealthy in all the kingdom of Ireland. They were married at the Savoy, and my grandfather dying very soon, Harry Barry, Esquire, took possession of his paternal property and supported our illustrious name with credit in London. He pinked the famous Count Tiercelin behind Montague House, {{he was a member of}} 'White's,' and a frequenter of all the chocolate-houses; and my mother, likewise, made no small figure. At length, after his great day of triumph before His Sacred Majesty at Newmarket, Harry's fortune was just on the point of being made, for the gracious monarch promised to provide for him. But alas! he was taken in charge by another monarch, whose will have no delay or denial,--by Death, namely, who seized upon my father at Chester races, leaving me a helpless orphan. Peace be to his ashes! He was not faultless, and dissipated all our princely family property; but he was as brave a fellow as ever tossed a bumper or called a main, and he drove his coach-and-six like a man of fashion.|$|E
60|$|As {{the next}} {{scene in the}} play, the State of South Carolina bombarded Fort Sumter. Was {{that to be the}} moment for a peaceable separation? Let us suppose that O'Connell had marched down to the <b>Pigeon</b> <b>House,</b> at Dublin, and had taken it, in 1843, let us say, would that have been an {{argument}} to us for allowing Ireland to set up for herself? Is that the way of men's minds, or of the minds of nations? The powers of the President were defined by law, as agreed upon among all the States of the Union, and against that power and against that law South Carolina raised her hand, and the other States joined her in rebellion. When circumstances had come to that, it was no longer possible that the North should shun the war. To my thinking the rights of rebellion are holy. Where would the world have been, or where would the world hope to be, without rebellion? But let rebellion look the truth in the face, and not blanch from its own consequences. She has to judge her own opportunities and to decide on her own fitness. Success is the test of her judgment. But rebellion can never be successful except by overcoming the power against which she raises herself. She has no right to expect bloodless triumphs; and if she be not the stronger in the encounter which she creates, she must bear the penalty of her rashness. Rebellion is justified by being better served than constituted authority, but cannot be justified otherwise. Now and again it may happen that rebellion's cause is so good that constituted authority will fall to the ground at the first glance of her sword. This was so the other day in Naples, when Garibaldi blew away the king's armies with a breath. But this is not so often. Rebellion knows that it must fight, and the legalized power against which rebels rise must of necessity fight also.|$|E
