40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Elmacayir Pasture, Yesilyurt County of Malatya/Turkey in 2002 - 2003 period. In order to {{determine}} pasture position, the parcel of pasture was established by soil analysis. Thus, botanical composition, hay yield and <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area was determined as well. In Hay yield, the percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area and the rate of good type pasture plant Elmacayir Pasture was divided into three regions as First, Second and Third Region. Hay yield, percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area and good type pasture of these three region were determined. In First region hay yield was determined as 1239. 4 kg ha - 1, percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area as 35 % and good type pasture plant rate as 20. 9 %. In Second region hay yield was determined as 1643. 1 kg ha - 1, percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area as 64 % and good type pasture plant rate 16. 3 %. In third region hay yield was determined as 1619. 9 kg ha - 1, percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>covered</b> area as 47 % and good pasture plant rate as 33. 4 %.

25|$|Al Baha is the {{homeland}} of the Ghamid and Zahran tribes and is divided geographically into three distinct parts: Sarah, which contains the high mountains characterized by temperate weather and rich <b>plant</b> <b>cover</b> due to relatively high annual rainfall, Tehama {{which is the}} lowland coastal area {{to the west of}} the Sarah characterized by very hot and humid weather and very little rainfall average, and the eastern hills characterized by an altitude of 1550 to 1900 meters above sea level with cool winters, hot summers and sparse <b>plant</b> <b>cover.</b> The largest city in the province, both in population and area, is Baljurashi (it was the first capital for the province), the second one is Almandaq. In Tehama, there are two major cities: Qilwah and Al-Mikhwah. The number of tribes are 18, branching from the main ones, Ghamid and Zahran. The province has 13 settled tribes (working in trades and agriculture) and 5 nomadic tribes.|$|E
25|$|Clearing {{is carried}} out by the grazing {{industry}} in an attempt to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} feed available for stock and to improve the management of livestock. The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available. Since stock carrying capacity is strongly correlated with herbage yield, there can be major financial benefits from the removal of trees, such as assisting with grazing management: regions of dense tree and shrub cover harbors predators, leading to increased stock losses, for example, while woody <b>plant</b> <b>cover</b> hinders mustering in both sheep and cattle areas.|$|E
25|$|Introduced grazing {{animals can}} also affect soil {{condition}} through physical compaction and break-up {{of the soil}} caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective <b>plant</b> <b>cover.</b> Such effects {{are most likely to}} occur on land subjected to repeated and heavy grazing. The effects of overstocking are often worst on soils of low fertility and in low rainfall areas below 500mm, as most soil nutrients in these areas tend to be concentrated in the surface so any movement of soils can lead to severe degradation. Alteration in soil structure and nutrient levels affects the establishment, growth and survival of plant species and in turn can lead to a change in woodland structure and composition.|$|E

[...] It consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft, fine-grained mudstone, siltstone, and claystone—much of which is bentonite—as well as harder sandstone and conglomerate, and limestone. Exposed to wind and water, the Chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs, gullies, mesas, buttes, and rounded hills. Its bentonite clay, which swells when wet and shrinks while drying, causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth. Lack of <b>plant</b> <b>cover</b> makes the Chinle especially susceptible to weathering.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{predation}} is a {{major cause}} of mortality of breeding waterfowl in the Prairie Pothole Region. However, little is known about how landscape features influence the ability of predators to find waterfowl nests. I analyzed the habitat selection and movement patterns of radiomarked red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) in two 41. 4 km 2 study areas with contrasting compositions of grassland (<b>planted</b> <b>cover,</b> pastureland and hayland). The study areas included either 10 [...] 15 % (Low Grassland Composition, LGC) or 40 [...] 50 % (High Grassland Composition, HGC) grassland. Edges of wetlands surrounded by cropland were consistently selected by fox and skunk on both types of landscape. Foxes frequently selected <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> (both edge and interior areas) in LGC landscapes, whereas they rarely selected the interior areas of <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> in HGC landscapes. Fractal analysis indicated that fox pathways were slightly straighter in LGC landscapes suggesting increased traveling behavior in the more prevalent cropland. However, there were more frequent sharp turns (characteristic of searching behavior) within <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> in LGC landscapes. Contrary to predictions, the rate of movement was not slower when animals where in <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> compared to when they were in cropland in either type of landscape. Furthermore, the frequency of turn angles was highly variable in cropland. In contrast, skunk pathways did not differ between LGC and HGC landscapes. They were more influenced by wetlands than by the landscape composition of grassland. Skunks spent more time in back and forth movement in all habitats. The rate of movement was faster in cropland than in <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> in LGC but not in HGC landscapes. When I simulated random combinations of predator movement and waterfowl nests there was essentially no relationship between <b>planted</b> <b>cover</b> patch size and the predicted proportion of nests that would be encountered by predators. However, the observed proportion of nests encountered by predators in intermediate sized patches (50 [...] 120 ha) was frequently greater than the proportion predicted by random activity. This study has led to a refined understanding of how predators perceive the landscape and is an important contribution to both predator landscape ecology and waterfowl management...|$|R

2500|$|Like plants, animals {{display a}} range of {{abilities}} to cope with fire, but they differ from plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit {{from being able to}} take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some birds are potentially responsible for intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. [...] Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud. Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril. Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but {{are more likely to be}} able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire. The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of <b>plant</b> <b>cover.</b> Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.|$|E
