25|$|This station {{opened on}} 1 May 1885 {{to serve the}} villages of Cadeleigh and Bickleigh and was {{therefore}} known as 'Cadeleigh and Bickleigh' until 1 May 1906 when it was changed to just 'Cadeleigh'. As a <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> it had two platforms and also a busy goods yard.

25|$|South of Brockweir {{the river}} makes a {{considerable}} westward loop, and a railway alignment directly serving Tintern {{would have been}} challenging. Instead the line provided a Tintern station some distance east of the community; {{it was the only}} <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> on the line. The route continued south, crossing the river, running through Tintern Tunnel, 182 yards, to penetrate the spur of the hill, and running on {{the eastern side of the}} Wye. Immediately south of the tunnel the Wireworks branch trailed in. It served the tinplate works at Abbey Hill and had its own substantial bridge of 69 yards span, crossing the Wye.|$|E
25|$|The station serving Thorverton village {{opened with}} the railway in 1885. Two {{platforms}} were provided {{as it was}} a <b>passing</b> <b>place.</b> The main buildings and goods yard were on the southbound side, while a wooden shelter was provided on the opposite platform for passengers travelling towards Tiverton. The station master had a house {{to the north of the}} station. The village was not on a main road and had no bus service with the result that the station was one of the best-used on the line and also generated a lot of freight due to nearby Thorverton Mill, a watermill that was connected to the station by a siding. Camp coaches were based here from 1936 to 1939 which provided accommodation for holiday visitors.|$|E

50|$|A {{single-track}} road or one-lane road is a {{road that}} permits two-way travel but is not wide enough in most places to allow vehicles to pass one another (although sometimes two compact cars can pass). This kind of road is common in rural areas across the United Kingdom and elsewhere. To accommodate two-way traffic, many single-track roads, especially those officially designated as such, are provided with <b>passing</b> <b>places</b> (United Kingdom) or pullouts or turnouts (United States), or simply wide spots in the road, which may be scarcely longer than a typical automobile using the road. The distance between <b>passing</b> <b>places</b> varies considerably, depending on the terrain and the volume of traffic on the road. The railway analog for <b>passing</b> <b>places</b> are <b>passing</b> loops.|$|R
25|$|Dulverton was a <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> for trains {{from the}} outset. The main buildings, {{including}} {{a house for}} the station master, were on the eastbound platform. This was connected by a covered footbridge to the westbound platform. A second track was added {{on the south side}} for the Tiverton service in 1902; initially a terminal track, it became a loop line in 1910. The goods shed was in a small yard {{on the north side of}} the line, but further sidings were added on the south side of the station, where there was also a small turntable. The first signal box was at the west end of the south-side sidings; it was replaced in 1908 by one on the eastbound platform next to the goods shed. Goods traffic ceased from 6 July 1964. The signal box was closed on 31 July 1966 and the old eastbound platform was then used for trains in both direction for the remaining two months before the line closed. The station buildings survived as part of the Caernarvon Arms Hotel.|$|E
500|$|Clifton Down {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Severn Beach Line, serving the {{district}} of Clifton in Bristol. The station {{is located on the}} busy shopping street Whiteladies Road, next door to a shopping centre. The wider area is largely residential. Bristol Zoo is under a mile away. The station is located [...] along the line from , and [...] from [...] It is the fifth station from Temple Meads. There are two running lines, roughly oriented east-west, but curving towards the north at both ends. There are two -long platforms to the north and south of the running lines, connected by a footbridge at the east end. The southern platform, Platform 1, serves trains towards , the northern platform, Platform 2, serves trains towards Temple Meads. The station is in an enclosed cutting, and runs under the road to the east. To the west is the Clifton Down Tunnel under Clifton Down, from which the station takes its name. The station {{is one of the few}} double track sections of the Severn Beach Line, and so is often used as a <b>passing</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Bampton station {{opened on}} 1 August 1884 {{on the west}} side of Bampton. South West England. It was a <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> so had two {{platforms}} for passengers and also a goods shed. It dispatched a lot of stone from local quarries. It was renamed [...] "Bampton (Devon)" [...] in June 1911 to avoid confusion with another GWR Bampton station in Oxfordshire. After the line closed the station was demolished, and the cutting in which it was situated was largely filled in.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 June 1874, {{a special}} road coach service was instigated between Hungerford and Devizes while the {{engineers}} converted the single track on this section to standard gauge. [...] The {{remainder of the}} line from Hungerford to Southcote Junction at Reading was worked as a single line with trains in both directions using the normal eastbound line with a <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> kept at Newbury while the westbound line was converted. [...] The last broad gauge train ran on 30 June and the following day the trains started {{to use the new}} standard gauge westbound line and ran through to Devizes again.

2500|$|The passing loop at South Molton in Devon was {{the most}} {{westerly}} <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> on the D line when it opened. Being close to the town centre {{it was much more}} convenient than South Molton Road which had opened on the North Devon Railway in 1854 but was [...] away. The station had a large building on the westbound platform comprising a station master's house and waiting rooms, a booking hall and offices. The up platform had only a small wooden shelter and there was no footbridge. There was also a goods yard {{to the west of the}} station, with a [...] goods shed and cranes. The passing loop was lengthened eastwards in 1907 and westward in 1937. The signal box was on the westbound platform, initially at the west end but this was replaced by one at the east end.|$|E

2500|$|The canal was 13m (43ft) {{wide and}} carried the Thames sailing barges common on both rivers. It was {{intended}} that the canal {{would be used for}} the transport of hops and other locally grown produce, {{but it was not a}} commercial success. It had locks at each end to protect the water level from tidal change, but the canal walls leaked and the water level dropped between every spring tide. A steam-driven pumping station was built [...] to rectify this. Complaints then came from barge-owners that the tunnel was slow to use, so in 1830 it was shut for two months while an open-air <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> was dug in the middle. This 100-yard long cutting divided the tunnel into a separate Higham tunnel and Strood tunnel. The canal tolls reflected these improvements, but if a boat missed the tide it would have to wait in the canal basin for longer than the journey round Hoo would have taken.|$|E

At this point {{there are four}} tracks, but this narrows to two before [...] Continuing north, the line passes under the old Midland Railway Bristol to Gloucester Line, passes through , then diverges west from the Cross Country Route at Narroways Hill Junction.

50|$|In Scotland, {{where most}} drivers are {{accustomed}} to single-track roads, it is customary for drivers to acknowledge {{each other with a}} wave, or flash of headlights at night. Generally in Scotland, if the <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> is to the right-hand side of a vehicle, the driver would never pull in to the <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> to let the other driver pass. Instead the driver would stop just short of the <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> on the road, to leave space for the oncoming vehicle to manoeuvre into the <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> which would be on their left. At night, if a driver were to see an oncoming vehicle in the distance and was reasonably close to a <b>passing</b> <b>place,</b> the driver would flash the headlights which would signal the other car to proceed forward while either the other vehicle reversed back to a <b>passing</b> <b>place,</b> or waited beside a <b>passing</b> <b>place</b> for the other car to arrive.
