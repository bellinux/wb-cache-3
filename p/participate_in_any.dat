5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League.

5|$|Tracing its lineage {{back to the}} 355th Engineer Regiment, {{the brigade}} assumed its predecessor's {{campaign}} participation credit and honors, which were received fighting in the European Theater of World War II.

After the Cold War, however, the brigade saw several deployments to the Middle East in a supporting role for US-led contingencies. These included Operation Desert Storm, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E

Two weeks later, a demoralized Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re-election. One month later, Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced he would seek the presidency. Humphrey did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates.

When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He did, however, consent to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates.

5|$|The 173rd Infantry Brigade was {{constituted}} on 5 August 1917 as an infantry brigade {{and organized}} on 25 August at Camp Pike, Arkansas, {{as an element}} of the 87th Division along with the 174th Infantry Brigade. The brigade deployed to France {{along with the rest of}} the division in September 1918, but it did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> campaigns and never saw combat, instead being utilized as a pool of laborers and reinforcements for frontline units. Four months later, the brigade returned to the United States, and was demobilized with the rest of the division in January 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{itself was}} considered {{to have been a}} military failure; not one of its members was ever awarded an Iron Cross while serving in it. Overall, it was better known for committing atrocities than for contributing to the German war effort. Its role in deporting Jews from Kosovo has been questioned by Albanian historian Shaban Sinani, who claims that the division did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> deportations on behalf of the Germans. During the 1998–99 Kosovo War, American journalist Chris Hedges alleged that some Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leaders were directly descended from members of the division and ideologically influenced by it. Malcolm has challenged this claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} reorganized and redesignated on 10 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Brigade, {{allowing}} it to command {{a larger number of}} military police units. On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior to the Iraq War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon to be deployed instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet to be deployed to a foreign theater of operations or <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> conflicts or contingencies.|$|E
