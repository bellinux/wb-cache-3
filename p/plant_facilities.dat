5|$|In the Republic of China, {{nuclear waste}} storage {{facility}} was {{built at the}} Southern tip of Orchid Island in Taitung County, offshore of Taiwan Island. The facility was built in 1982 and it is {{owned and operated by}} Taipower. The facility receives nuclear waste from Taipower's current three nuclear power plants.

5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power <b>plant,</b> <b>facilities</b> that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{economic}} collapse of 1929, Gladding, McBean & Co. saw its revenue decreasing due to the cessation of new construction, {{the main source of}} the demand for its ceramic products: roofing tile, sewer pipe, architectural terracotta, and brick. [...] To offset the loss of revenues from the sales of ceramic building materials, the Company began the manufacture of earthenware dinnerware and art ware in 1933 in the former Tropico Potteries factory. [...] Tropico Potteries was acquired by the company in 1923. The forty acre pottery, located at 2901 Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, bordered the city of Glendale. [...] Gladding, McBean & Co. had two <b>plant</b> <b>facilities</b> in Los Angeles, so the former Tropico pottery was named the Glendale plant.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis is {{an analysis of}} setup time considerations currently employed by the Power <b>Plant</b> <b>Facility</b> at the Naval Aviation Depot, North Island. The system is analyzed within a production context, citing present procedures that adversely affect lead time. To reduce lead time variability, reduction of setup time is targeted. This thesis examines the potential benefits available to the Power <b>Plant</b> <b>Facility</b> by applying Single-Minute-Exchange-of-Die (SMED) to reduce setup times. SMED's conceptual stages are first examined and then related to the Power <b>Plant</b> <b>Facility</b> to illustrate the applicability of SMED to a repairrebuild environment. Recommendations are made to reduce setup times in two work centers. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
