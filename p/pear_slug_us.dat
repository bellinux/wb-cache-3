50|$|The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> or cherry slug is the larva of the sawfly, Caliroa cerasi, {{a nearly}} {{worldwide}} pest. They are not slugs but are {{a kind of}} sawfly of the family Tenthredinidae. The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> is an important pest that eats leaves of cherry, pear, and plum trees, leaving behind a skeleton of veins. The larvae cover themselves in green slime, making themselves unpalatable to predators. When the larvae are fully grown, they drop off the tree on the ground and pupate underground. The adult sawfly emerges from the pupal case and climbs from the soil to mate and lays eggs on the leaves of the host plant, completing the lifecycle.|$|R

This {{is the first}} record of C. cerasi attacking {{any member of the}} genus Chaenomeles and the first confirmation of feeding on Cotoneaster in North America. Adult emergence, oviposition, and larval development were evaluated under both laboratory and field conditions. Females lay an average of 48 eggs, with about two-thirds of the oviposition occurring during their first 24 hours. A method for monitoring adult emergence in the field was developed...|$|R
50|$|Introduced insects {{have become}} pests. The green {{vegetable}} bug, {{shaped like a}} shield, dark green and 12 mm long, attacks tomatoes and beans. The green caterpillars of cabbage white butterflies eat brassicas. The codling moth caterpillar eats apples and pears. European earwigs eat leaves and petals. Fermentation flies eat rotting fruit. The Queensland fruit fly can be active in Canberra in late summer, eating apples, stone fruit, tomatoes and capsicums. Mandatory controls apply to infestations. Mealybugs have white hairs covered with a mealy coating. They are up to 8 mm across and suck sap from many plants, especially indoor plants. The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> or cherry slug is a sawfly larva. The larvae cover themselves with dark glossy slime to make themselves unpalatable. They skeletonize the leaves of cherry, pear, plum or hawthorn trees.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{codling moth}} {{insecticide}} programs have increasingly relied on pheromone mating disruption {{and the use}} of softer, pest-specific insecticides. The discontinued use of Guthion in some orchards has led to reduced pest pressure from some pests, such as mites and psylla, but it has also led to increases in secondary pests, such as leafrollers, leaf miners, and <b>pear</b> <b>slugs,</b> and possibly other non-pest insects, including predators and flies. Along with the softer insecticide programs in recent years have come fairly serious outbreaks of fire blight, particularly in May and June, after antibiotic sprays have ceased. Many growers and PCAs have questioned whether the increased presence of flies and other flying insects as a result of softer insecticide programs has led to increased potential for the spread of blight. Surround ® WP (kaolin clay) is used by several organic growers for control of codling moth and other insect pests. It works in part by repelling insects by making the surface of the fruit and foliage less hospitable. Surround was shown to strongly repel glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) nymphs and adults on lemon trees in the San Joaquin Valley (Puterka et al. 2003). In a related field study conducted in three vineyards, Surround WP was as effective as dimethoate and methomyl in the reduction of GWSS adult density and oviposition (Puterka et al. 2003) ...|$|R

2500|$|Since large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, {{many states}} have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, {{it is illegal to}} import snails (or <b>slugs)</b> into the <b>U.S.</b> without {{permission}} from the Plant Protection and Quarantine Division (PPQ), Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to [...] "import, release, or make interstate shipments of" [...] snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.|$|R

[...] Spruance said [...] "if we were doing something so important that we were attracting the enemy to us, we could afford to let him come—and take care of him when he arrived." [...] This was in stark contrast to the Battle of Midway in 1942, where Spruance advocated immediately attacking even when his own strike force wasn't fully assembled, as neutralizing enemy carriers before they could launch their planes was the key to the survival of his carriers.|$|R
40|$|We show in {{this paper}} {{that in the case}} of the slug of the {{cellular}} slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum the time which it takes for a new tip to regenerate at a given level can be used as a measure of positional information at that level. Our basic experiment consists of amputating slugs at various distances from the existing tip and thereby inducing the regeneration of a fresh tip; the time needed for regeneration is estimated by two independent methods. An identical operation, when performed in the anterior portion of a previously cut <b>slug,</b> tells <b>us</b> how this position-dependent regeneration time adjusts to a sudden change in the size of the slug. The reasons which lead us to conclude that tip regeneration times are in one-to-one correspon-dence with positional information are as follows, (i) Depending on their positions, the cells in a slug take different times to regenerate a new tip following amputation; (ii) regeneration times are scaled in relation to the total length of the slug and increase monotonically with the length cut off; and (iii) as judged by the regeneration time, cells can assess and remember their positions relative to the length of the slug. Our results highlight the importance of two rate processes. One might think of the slower process as being related to the setting up of a system of positional information in the slug, and the faster process as being a reflection of the kinetics of the positional value changing locally till it reaches the level appropriate to a tip...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{deals with}} slug pulling and methods and {{precautions}} against the effect in detail. Cutting, one of forming processes, can meet a few problems. One {{of them is}} slug pulling. Slug pulling is the concomitant effect of punching or blanking. Punching and blanking are similar operations differing only in the scrap and part understanding. Slug pulling occurs if a cut slug is caught to the punch face and afterward the punch pulls the slug up from the die. Slug pulling is a cause of problems at sheet metal cutting for instance press failure, time losses, financial losses and so on. Nowadays <b>slug</b> pulling trouble <b>us</b> {{more than in the}} past because of high cutting speeds, automation and robotization innovations, economization, price cutting, material costs savings, cost reduction etc. Causes of slug pulling are dependent on parameters of a punch, of a die, of relationship between the punch and the die, of material and of other cutting factors. Fortunately, there are several successful methods to remove the slug from the punch. The aim of the article is to give a review of the methods and precautions against this unpleasant effect. Foremost it is needed t...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{of cosmic}} {{structure}} formation outlines how stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale structures formed out of primordial density fluctuations. It presents us {{a picture of}} cosmic mass assembly, and places strong constraints on cosmological model. Both observations and theories suggest that structures formation follows a "bottom up" process, in which small, low-mass component form first, and gradually develop into larger, more massive systems. This dissertation focuses on three crucial stages of cosmic structure formation: first generation stars, quasar host galaxies and the large-scale galaxy overdensities. In Chapter 1, I present an overview of structure formation, acquainting readers with a general picture from first object in the Universe to large-scale structures at later epochs. In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, I derive strong constraints to the star formation rates (SFRs) of very massive Population III (Pop III) stars in two high redshift galaxies at z = 7. By probing the He II emission lines for both galaxies, I conclude that the contributions of very massive Pop III stars to total the SFRs are less than 3 %. In Chapter 4, I move to more massive systems, quasar host galaxies at z ~ 3. Using damped Lyman alpha absorption systems as natural coronagraphs, I report that rest-frame far-UV emission of quasar host galaxy correlates strongly with quasar luminosity. This result suggests a co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. In Chapter 5, I develop a novel method for searching the most massive protoclusters at z = 2 - 3, by utilizing intergalactic Lyman alpha absorption. My investigations suggest that large intergalactic Lyman alpha absorption systems effectively trace the most overdense regions at large scale of ~ 15 h⁻¹ Mpc. In Chapter 6, I present our imaging observations of an extreme galaxy overdensity (protocluster) BOSS 1441 + 4000, which is discovered using the techniques developed in Chapter 5. Furthermore, I report an intergalactic-scale Lyman alpha nebula detected at the density peak of BOSS 1441 + 4000. This discovery, together with previously discovered <b>Slug</b> nebula, provide <b>us</b> a first look of intergalactic medium in emission in the early Universe. In the Chapter 7, I give a summary of this dissertation and discuss several future prospects...|$|R
