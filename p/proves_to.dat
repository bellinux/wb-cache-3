40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes are <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be primitive recursive. The weak axiom system is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R

Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round garbage can at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> be a successful method of solving problems with pain, causing the chiropractic business decline until the chiropractors in town denounce the method and destroy the garbage can at the Simpsons' home.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu.

The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again.
