She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E

Tyrone reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath, but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain injuries that day, which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath's heavy-handedness. Canavan's injury was so severe that he was still feeling the effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he had been <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> broken foot.|$|E

With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{was called}} up to the Rangers in April 2014 to replace Chris Kreider, who {{suffered}} a left hand injury. <b>Playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Hagelin and Brad Richards, Fast played in New York's last three regular season games, as well as three post-season matches. He recorded his first career NHL playoff point with an assist in Game 1 of the Metropolitan Division Semifinal against the Philadelphia Flyers on April 17.

Bertuzzi had two assists while <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Näslund and Joe Sakic. Nearing {{the end of the}} 2003–04 season, Bertuzzi was indefinitely suspended by the NHL for punching Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind during a game on March 8, 2004. His actions were a retaliation to a hit from Moore on Näslund during a previous game. Sitting out the remainder of the regular season and playoffs due to his suspension, he finished 2003–04 with 60 points over 69 games. Vancouver replaced Bertuzzi on the team's top line with Matt Cooke and went on to their first Northwest Division title, before being eliminated {{in the first round of}} the 2004 playoffs by the Calgary Flames.|$|E

He set career highs in goals (25), assists (37), and points (62). During the year he tied a school record for points in a game with a seven-point performance against Ohio State. The scoring output helped him tie another school record when the two teams played the following day. Adding another three points in the second game, Breslin brought his two-game total to 10, tying the record for points in a series. Lake Superior State finished first in the CCHA, but was again defeated in the quarterfinals of the 1991 NCAA Tournament.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, in December 1993, Kariya {{left his}} college team, the Maine Black Bears, {{to join the}} Canadian {{national}} team {{in preparation for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the start of the tournament, Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites to do well. <b>Playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved, Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games, helping Canada to a silver medal. Tied with the Czech Republic 2–2 in the quarterfinal, Kariya scored the game-winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians advance. In the gold medal game, Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3–2 in a shootout to Sweden.

5|$|Rangers {{first moved}} to the Ibrox area later in 1887, <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> site {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} the current stadium. The first match at this stadium was an 8–1 defeat to English side Preston North End on 20 August 1887, watched by a capacity crowd of over 15,000. This inaugural match had to be abandoned after 70 minutes due to a pitch invasion. The first Ibrox Park was a success in the short term, as three Scotland international matches and the 1890 Scottish Cup Final were played at the ground. Celtic Park, built in 1892, was more advanced, however. Rangers opted to construct a new stadium, raising funds by forming a limited company. The last match at the old ground was played on 9 December 1899. The new Ibrox Park was formally opened with a 3–1 victory over Hearts on 30 December.|$|E
