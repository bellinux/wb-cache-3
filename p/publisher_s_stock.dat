40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{intrinsic}} differences between U. S. and non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> affect market participants and the market quality of non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> relative to U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> Using proprietary data on NYSE specialist trading, we find that, all else equal, specialist closing inventory positions for non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> are closer to zero than U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> The evidence on specialist participation and stabilization rates is mixed. Non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> from developed markets have higher specialist participation and stabilization rates than U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks,</b> while emerging market stocks have lower participation and stabilization rates than U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> With respect to market quality, we find that, all else equal, non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> have wider spreads, less depth, and greater transitory volatility than U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> We investigate the reasons behind the difference in liquidity and find that the larger non-U. S. spreads are primarily due to higher information asymmetry and increased adverse selection risk. We conclude that liquidity providers demand greater compensation for trading non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks,</b> but this additional compensation is necessary to offset the higher adverse selection risk. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the differences in}} market microstructure between U. S. and non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> cross-listed on the New York Stock Exchange using a sample of 316 pairs of matched stocks. We find that non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> have wider spreads and larger adverse-selection costs than U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> even after controlling for macro-level institutional differences. Regression analysis shows that spreads and adverse-selection costs are negatively correlated with institutional ownership and analyst followings. Thus, the higher spreads and adverse-selection costs for non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> can be partly explained by the lower institutional ownership and analyst following of non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> In addition, we find that although the spreads and adverse-selection costs for non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> are significantly higher before the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD), the differences become even greater after Regulation FD, suggesting that Regulation FD has improved the information environment for U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks.</b> 2005 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of changes in oil prices and oil price volatility on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns. The first essay tests whether the sign {{and the size of}} oil price shocks matter for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns. The results suggest a linear model provides a good approximation to the response of real stock returns to real oil price innovations. However, {{this is not the case}} when the model is specified in terms of the nominal price of crude oil. Using a modified structural VAR to accommodate GARCH-in-Mean errors, the second essay studies the direct effects of oil price uncertainty on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns at the aggregate and sectoral levels. We also simulate the response of U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns to positive and negative oil price shocks, to examine whether the responses to positive and negative shocks are symmetric. Estimation results suggest that there is no statistically significant effect of oil price volatility on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns. Moreover, the impulse responses indicate that oil price increases and decreases have symmetric effects on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns. Using high frequency data, thethird essay addresses the issue of uncertainty in oil prices and its effect on U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> returns, taking into account the day of the week effect. The results suggest that the-day-of-the-week effect is present in both the mean and volatility equations. The results also show that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market is sensitive to oil price variations not only at the aggregate level but also across some industries, such as chemicals, entertainment, and retail, where uncertainty in oil prices proves to have positive and statistically significant effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the U. <b>S.</b> S&P 500 <b>stock</b> market and purchases of U. <b>S.</b> corporation <b>stocks</b> by foreign investors. Estimations using monthly data from 1978 : 1 to 2008 : 7 under various methodologies show that, controlling for asset prices (interest rates and the yield curve) and inflation, purchases of U. <b>S.</b> <b>stocks</b> by foreign investors have a positive and statistically significant impact on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market performance. We also show that their relationship is time variant.

40|$|This paper {{implements}} a VAR-EGARCH model (Nelson, 1991; Koutmos, 1996) {{to explore}} the linkage between both the returns and volatility transmissions between the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market, the world gold market, and the Chinese stock market over the period from January 15, 1996, through August 31, 2015. The exponential component of the model allows us to capture significant asymmetric effects across financial markets and confirms {{the necessity of a}} VAR-EGARCH model over a VAR-GARCH model. Also, we find that reciprocal volatility transmission existed between the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market and the Chinese stock market over the period, while the transmissions from the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market to the Chinese stock market are more significant. Moreover, the past U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market returns can be used to predict current returns of the Chinese stock market and the world gold market. This suggests the predominant status of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>stock</b> market in the world. This paper further analyzes the model 2 Ì† 7 s results by comparing dynamic hedging to portfolio diversification strategy. We show that diversification is far more effective in reducing risks than the dynamic hedging strategy. Moreover, the results of portfolio diversification suggest that passive investors should hold an equal weight portfolio that contain indices or commodities from these three markets, while active investors should re-balance their minimum variance line portfolio and hold more gold future contracts...|$|R
