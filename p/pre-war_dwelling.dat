An area's social and spatial composition influences anti-social behaviour in built environments. However, social conditions can overrule spatial ones. A more adequate understanding of the relationship between an area's social and spatial composition requires studying a set of dwelling areas with and without social problems. For an according, exemplary investigation, four different types of dwelling areas were analysed. Two <b>pre-War</b> <b>dwelling</b> areas were chosen - one with large social problems (Ondiep in Utrecht) and one without (Hof van Delft in Delft). Similarly, two post-War urban areas were chosen - one with large social problems (Oosterwei in Gouda) and one without (Ommoord in Rotterdam). Static snapshots were taken in all four areas, during a whole day and evening on a week day and on a weekend day. The results were correlated with the following spatial configurative analyses: all-lines analyses and segment based angular analyses (in order to identify the main routes through cities). As it turns out, dwelling areas with a topological deep structure on their street net contribute to a separation of space use of various types of users. Group of youngsters tend to gather together in streets one topological step away from main streets or shopping centres with "blind" walls. The higher concentration of low income groups and immigrants, the larger the anti-social behaviour problems are in the dwelling areas in terms of vandalism and group forming of youngsters. Dwelling areas without main routes through them lacks a natural input of through travellers in which function as a social control for an area. Public spaces with low degree of inter-visibility of neighbours and few doors connected to streets affect an areaâ€™s degree of safety and street life. In Ondiep, the unsafest part is the street with few dwelling entrances connected to it. Likewise, inter-visibility is reduced by the way all inhabitants have their curtains closed most part of the time. As this initial investigation suggests, streets with high degree of inter-visibility and adjacent to main routes can contribute to create safe and vital dwelling areas.
