50|$|An e-reader, {{also known}} as an e-book reader, is a <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> that is {{designed}} primarily {{for the purpose of}} reading e-books and periodicals. E-readers have a similar form factor to a tablet and usually refers to devices that use electronic paper resulting in better screen readability, especially in bright sunlight, and longer battery life when compared to a tablet. An e-reader's battery will typically last for multiple weeks. In contrast to an e-reader, a tablet has a screen capable of higher refresh rates which make them more suitable for interaction such as playing a video game or watching a video clip.|$|E

Flexible supercapacitors (SCs), which have {{played a key role}} in medical treatment, military, entertainment, and industry, are considered as potential candidates for flexible and portable energy storage devices because of their high flexibility and light weight [6, 7, 8, 9]. Although SCs have desired properties such as fast charge–discharge rate, high power density, and cycling stability, the energy density of flexible SCs needs to be improved to meet the fast-growing market for <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> and the development of hybrid vehicles [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].|$|R

5000|$|A {{prototype}} of Scanadu’s first product, the Scanadu Scout, was unveiled on November 29, 2012. The Scanadu Scout is a <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> for consumer use {{designed to measure}} different physiological parameters, including temperature, heart rate, blood oxygenation, respiratory rate, ECG, and diastolic/systolic blood pressure. Scanadu’s goal {{was to make the}} Scanadu Scout available by March 2014 as an investigational device to those who participated in the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and agreed to participate in a research study, and afterwards, to general consumers by Q1 of 2015. Scanadu is seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the device before bringing it to market to ensure clinical-grade accuracy. Scanadu missed the initial shipping deadline; the devices finally began shipping in February 2015. In April 2016, Scanadu stated that the clinical trial with over 4,000 participants was ongoing, however in December 2016 they sent a message to the study subjects stating that the initial device has supported extensive data collection; and the Scout investigational device would only be supported {{until the end of the}} study, after which it would cease to function.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Teaching and Learning, Washington State UniversityThe use of {{technology}} such as <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is gaining increased research attention. The {{purpose of this study}} was twofold and guided by these questions: (1) What are the attitudes of parents of children with ASD toward the use {{of technology}}, specifically portable devices like iPad? and, (2) From a parent perspective to what extent do Saudi Arabian children with ASD use these technology and portable devices? In order to explore these questions, a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed in this study. Background research was reviewed by using many and different database and journals. Survey methods were used to collect data on the parents’ attitudes. Qualitative interview methods were used to explore parents’ attitudes about technology and ASD. The results of this study indicate that parents agreed about the positive possible benefits of technology and <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> related to their children’s various skills in different settings. This study supports the {{use of technology}} and <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> with children with ASD as a promising approach and intervention.
