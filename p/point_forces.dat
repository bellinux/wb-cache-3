25|$|The {{size of the}} Roman army amassed {{against the}} rebels was much larger than that {{commanded}} by Titus sixty years earlier - by that time nearly {{one third of the}} Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba. It is estimated that at that <b>point</b> <b>forces</b> from at least 10 Legions participated in Severus' campaign in Judea, including Legio X Fretensis, Legio VI Ferrata, Legio III Gallica, Legio III Cyrenaica, Legio II Traiana Fortis, Legio X Gemina, cohorts of Legio V Macedonica, cohorts of Legio XI Claudia, cohorts of Legio XII Fulminata and cohorts of Legio IV Flavia Felix and 30-50 auxilary units with a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar-Kokhba's rebels. Legio XXII Deiotariana was likely entirely lost during an earlier stage of the revolt. It is plausible that Legio IX Hispana also arrived in Judea and its demise occurred during the decisive campaign of Sextus Julius Severus, as Legio IX Hispana's disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the fundamental problem of the non-uniform subsonic motion of a <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and line forces in an unbounded, homogeneous, isotropic medium in analogy to the electromagnetic Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The exact closed-form solutions of the displacement and elastic fields produced by the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and line forces are calculated. The displacement fields can be identified with the elastodynamic Liénard-Wiechert tensor potentials. For a non-uniformly moving <b>point</b> <b>force,</b> we decompose the elastic fields into a radiation part and a non-radiation part. We show that the solution of a non-uniformly moving <b>point</b> <b>force</b> is the generalization of the Stokes solution towards the non-uniform motion. For line forces the mathematical solutions are given in the form of time-integrals and, therefore, their motion depends on the history. Comment: 13 pages, to appear in: Wave Motio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{location}} of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> {{is an important}} factor to influence sound radiation of underwater structure. A vibroacoustic model of a simply supported rectangular plate covered by decoupling coating is presented. The influences of the locations and the number of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> to sound radiation power insertion loss are analyzed. The results show that: 1) The {{location of}} <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> has much influence to sound radiation power insertion loss; 2) The average sound radiation power insertion loss is closer to convergence as the number of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> becomes larger; 3) When The location of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> is closer to the corner of plate, sound radiation power insertion loss compares well with that of multi-point average. When plate model is used to measure the performance of noise reduction of decoupling coating, the location of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> should be located of the position from a corner of the tested plate so that as many plate modes as possible are excited.

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} solution is derived {{and used for}} studying the effect of offneutral axis loading (<b>point</b> <b>force</b> excitation applied off the neutral axis of a rib) on ribbed-plate responses. Effects of off-neutral axis loading on ribbed-plate responses, in terms of input power and kinetic energy distribution in the component plates, {{are found to be}} significant except at frequencies where the beam flexural impedance is small (near the natural frequencies of the uncoupled beam). The negative input power component due to the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> or moment excitation is observed and explained in this analysis. Energy flow from the beam to the plates is dominated by the shear force coupling at the beam/ plate interface if the force excitation is applied on the neutral axis of the beam. As the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> excitation location shifts away from the neutral axis, the beam is excited by a force and a moment. These dual excitations involve both shear force and moment couplings at the interface. Thus, changes in the energy flow into the component plates are dependent on the relative phase between the individual induced responses by the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and moment excitations. This paper also discusses changes in the kinetic energy of the component plates due to changes in the energy flow...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the control of flexural waves in a beam using a tuned vibration absorber (TVA). The TVA may be located in the farfield or the nearfield of a time harmonic <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and it can be positioned to control both the downstream-transmitted power and that reflected upstream. Analytical and numerical investigations are presented. The effects of the incident evanescent wave on the optimal characteristics of the absorber are discussed when the TVA is located in the nearfield of the <b>point</b> <b>force.</b> If the TVA is located in the nearfield, the power transmitted past the TVA depends on four independent tuning parameters: the absorber frequency, the mass ratio, the structural damping of the TVA and the distance between the TVA and the <b>point</b> <b>force.</b> If the incident nearfield wave is insignificant, then this distance becomes unimportant in determining the optimal characteristics of the TVA. The net power propagating upstream is due to the superposition of the wave reflected from the TVA and that input by the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and depends on all four parameters. Attention is focussed on finding the frequencies at which the minimum power is transmitted or the maximum power absorbed by the TVA. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical predictions...|$|R

40|$|Spall {{may be a}} {{significant}} secondary source of seismic waves from underground explosions. The proper representation of spall as a seismic source is important for forward and inverse modeling of explosions for yield estimation and discrimination studies. We present a new derivation of a widely used <b>point</b> <b>force</b> representation for spall, {{which is based on}} a horizontal tension crack model. The derivation clarifies the relationship between <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and moment tensor representations of the tension crack. For wavelengths long compared with spall depth, the two repre-sentations are equivalent, and the moment tensor time history is propor-tional to the doubly integrated time history of the <b>point</b> <b>force.</b> Numerical experiments verify that, for regional seismic phases, this equivalence is valid for all frequencies for which the point-source (long wavelength) approximation is valid. Further analysis shows that the moment tensor and <b>point</b> <b>force</b> representations retain their validity for nonplanar spall surfaces, provided that the average dip of the surface is small. The equivalency of the two representations implies that a singular inverse problem will result from attempts to infer simultaneously the spectra of both of these source terms from seismic waveforms. If the spall moment tensor alone is estimated by inversion of waveform data, the inferred numerical values of its components will depend inversely upon the source depth that is assumed in the inversion formalism...|$|R

To numerically illustrate the power of elastodynamic transformations, we analyse the elastic response of an elliptic invisibility cloak surrounding a clamped obstacle {{in the presence of a}} cylindrical excitation i. e. a concentrated <b>point</b> <b>force.</b> Elliptic cloaking for flexural waves involves a density and an orthotropic Young's modulus which depend on the radial and azimuthal positions, as deduced from a coordinates transformation for circular cloaks in the spirit of Pendry et al.
