50|$|What is {{commonly}} called bark includes {{a number of}} different tissues. Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the <b>phellem.</b> The cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium.

At present, the molecular regulators of <b>phellem</b> differentiation are unknown. The previously documented involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of developmental processes, including secondary growth, motivated the search for these regulators in cork oak tissues. We performed deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction obtained from cork oak leaves and differentiating <b>phellem.</b> RNA sequences with lengths of 19 - 25 nt derived from the two libraries were analysed, leading to the identification of 41 families of conserved miRNAs, of which the most abundant were miR 167, miR 165 / 166, miR 396 and miR 159.

At the whole-tuber level, infection percentages were greatest when Streptomyces scabiei inoculation occurred early; at 2 weeks after tuberization (WAT) 68 % of tubers became infected, contrasting with late inoculation (8 WAT), when only 4 % infection occurred. The first-formed internodes were most susceptible to infection, whilst later-forming and slower-expanding internodes were less susceptible. Detailed tuber physiological examination of internode 2 showed that pathogen-induced changes, including increased <b>phellem</b> (periderm) thickness, cell layers and <b>phellem</b> suberization (key physiological features believed critical to S. scabiei infection) were promoted through S. scabiei inoculation. Sequential harvesting showed enhanced <b>phellem</b> suberization (28 % greater than the control) within 7 days of pathogen exposure, while <b>phellem</b> thickness and layer responses were also initiated early in the infection process (10 – 14 days after pathogen exposure) and these responses were independent of symptom expression.

40|$|To {{understand}} the pathway used by Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands {{to penetrate the}} bark of jarrah, the present study describes unwounded periderm and rhytidome development. Periderm formation is described from its initiation in 4 -week-old seedlings {{to the formation of}} rhytidome in saplings. Periderm in young seedlings consists of a single type of <b>phellem,</b> namely thin-walled suberised cells. In older seedlings where multiple layers of periderm have formed, layers of thick-walled lignified <b>phellem</b> cells in compacted bands alternate with thin-walled suberised cells. Rhytidome formation in older lignotuberous seedlings and in sapling jarrah occurs through the isolation of secondary phloem by periderm. The rhytidome consists of expanded and partially disintegrated secondary phloem tissue sandwiched between layers of <b>phellem</b> cells. Localised periderm formation beneath stomata results in the formation of lenticels, which are ephemeral features. Superficial periderms occur at sites of leaf and shoot abscission, and of lateral shoot emergence. Concealed axillary shoots lack cuticle on emergence. As the trees age, the internal production of lignified and suberised periderm and rhytidome results in an impenetrable barrier to invasion by P. cinnamomi. However, external sites including lenticels and leaf and shoot abscission and emergence areas, all provide points of ingress in unwounded stems...|$|E

To accomplish the objectives excised Douglas-fir cork was subjected to various chemical treatments (extraction with organic solvents, water, ammonium oxalate and sodium sulfite, saponification by an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and an ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution). At certain stages in the treatment samples were removed for such analyses as trace mineral, protein and specific gravity. Paralleling this microtomed sections of cork were similarly chemically treated and removed for observation with various types of microscopes. The microscopes used were light, ultraviolet, polarizing, scanning electron and transmission electron. The results of this study showed that the cell wall structure of the Douglas-fir <b>phellem</b> cell is composed of 4 zones or layers.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the bark of Agathis, Libocedrus, Dacrydium and Phyllocladus in New Zealand is described. Samples were {{collected}} from local areas in Canterbury, Buller and Northland, and examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In Libocedrus species, the sclerenchyma consists of thin and thick-walled fibres. In all other species, the sclerenchyma comprises fibres and sclereids. However, sclerenchyma is quite rare or sometimes absent in Dacrydium laxifolium. Crystals occur in the lumina {{and also in the}} wall (in the region of the middle lamella) of some phloem cells. Resin canals are present in the phloem, primary cortex and phelloderm of Agathis australis and in the primary cortex of all the three species of Phyllocladus. L and T-shaped parenchyma cells were found to be common in the phloem of Dacrydium cupressinum. These cells lie partly in the ray system and partly in the axial system, and are filled with tannin. Trabeculae were very common in the phloem in Libocedrus bidwillii. <b>Phellem</b> cells in Libocedrus species are very thin-walled and appear flimsy.

40|$|Acyltransferases are enzymes with an {{important}} role in the synthesis of both cutin and suberin which are part of the lipophilic barriers, such as epidermis and periderm that protect terrestrial plants against water loss and other external aggressions. During secondary growth in woody plants such as cork oak (Quercus suber L.), the epidermis is replaced by a suberized periderm that includes the <b>phellem</b> (cork), phellogen (cork cambium) and phelloderm tissues. In Q. suber the successive formation of <b>phellem</b> following removal at periodic intervals (every 9 years) allows for exploitation of cork oak on a sustainable basis. The main component of cork (45 - 50 %) is suberin, a complex polymer comprising both aliphatic and aromatic domains and associated waxes [1, 2]. Despite the physiological importance of suberin, its biosynthetic pathway as well as its deposition remains largely unknown. Since cork oak is a unique species among terrestrial plants due to its remarkable capacity for cork production, it is expected that suberin biosynthesis and deposition are tightly controlled mechanisms. As a first step to start unraveling these control mechanisms we intend to identify and characterize genes coding for the acyltransferases of the GPAT (glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase) family, involved in suberin and cutin synthesis in cork oak.

Here, we report on a potato NAC transcription factor gene, StNAC 103, induced in the tuber <b>phellem</b> (skin). The StNAC 103 promoter is active in cells undergoing suberization such as in the basal layer of the <b>phellem,</b> but also in the root apical meristem. Gene silencing in potato periderm correlates with an increase in the suberin and wax load, and specifically in alkanes, ω-hydroxyacids, diacids, ferulic acid, and primary alcohols. Concomitantly, silenced lines also showed up-regulation of key genes related to the biosynthesis and transport of suberin and wax in the tuber periderm.

In Fatshedera lizei periderm is produced by the monolayer of phellogen proper, whereas in Acer negundo sometimes cells in the immediate neighbourhood of phellogen proper, particularly the phelloderm participate in the formation of periderm. In Acer negundo at the boundary with the next annual <b>phellem</b> increment typical phelloid cells are present. Their thick walls contain pectins, cellulose and lignin, but do not contain suberin.

40|$|Common scab, {{caused by}} plant {{pathogenic}} Streptomyces sp., {{is a major}} soil and tuber borne bacterial disease of potato. Whilst the disease seldom affects tuber yield, infections produce unsightly blemishes on tubers that reduce their value. It causes significant economic losses in the fresh, processing and seed market sectors of the potato industry. Despite several decades of research activity, no single measure has been developed that is able to provide effective control of this disease and comhlon scab therefore remains {{a serious threat to}} the potato production throughout the potato growing areas of the world. This project investigated links between tuber structural attributes and susceptibility to infection, an area of study under-represented in the literature and offering potential to deliver new knowledge on common scab disease that may lead to improved approaches to disease management. A series of experiments was conducted under field, glasshouse and hydroponic conditions to investigate changes in morphology and anatomy of the potato tuber. Inoculation treatments were developed to investigate relationships between structural features at the time of inoculation and the subsequent levels of infection. A novel hydroponic system was developed that allowed inoculation of individual tubers at specific times or stages of development and permitted non-destructive observation of the development of common scab symptoms. A second novel system involved the use of netting in potting bags to separate tubers from the root zone and allowed inoculation at different times during plant growth. This system facilitated study of the pathogen infection window on the tubers, and pathogen-induced structural changes in the tubers, under glasshouse conditions. Field studies were undertaken in 12 commercial crops across a range of production environments, and utilised seed from a single source to allow assessment of site effects on tuber development and disease incidence. Many tuber anatomical and morphological features (stomata and lenticel number, periderm thickness, lenticel structure, pattern of suberisation and internode expansion rate on the tubers) were found to be highly variable under different field and glasshouse conditions, and significant variability within crops/treatments was also observed. Lenticel diameter was determined by growmg environment, but other structural features varied as much between tubers within sites or treatments as between sites or treatments. Given the sporadic nature of occurrence of common scab symptoms within and between crops, the observations of variation in structural features was sufficient to indicate that anatomical features could be playing a role in susceptibility to infection. Detailed study of lenticel development on tubers revealed that two pathways of lenticel formation exist in potato tubers. Formation of lenticels from stomata, the commonly accepted pathway in the literature, occurred on all tubers, but when tubers expanded rapidly, lenticels were found to have also formed directly from peridermal rupture. In most tubers, the majority of lenticels were concluded to have formed from this second pathway. The initiation of lenticel formation in both pathways was shown to be via localised zones of increased cell division in the <b>phellem</b> layer, placing pressure on the outer cell layers and leading to rupture of the periderm. Continued cell division and expansion under the rupture site creates the characteristic raised lenticular shaped structure of a mature lenticel. Suberization in lenticels was observed to occur very late m Luber development in most glasshouse and hydroponically grown tubers, and lenticels with no suberisation were found in mature tubers under all growing conditions in the project. No relationship was found between tuber anatomical features at the time of exposure to the pathogen and either incidence or severity of common scab symptoms. While trends were observed within trials, when data from all experiments were examined there was no structural attribute that was consistently present or absent in treatments that induced high levels of common scab symptoms. Under field conditions, suberisation in the periderm was noted in young tubers in crops that subsequently developed high incidence of common scab, but under glasshouse conditions nonsuberized tubers at the point of inoculation were found to be highly susceptible to the disease. No evidence was found of increased suberisation in lenticels during tuber maturation being associated with reduced susceptibility to infection, with the timing of suberisation varying markedly between trials and in many conditions not recorded until very late in tuber development. The window of tuber susceptibility to common scab disease infection was shown to vary with the season or conditions under which the plants were grown. In addition, the first direct evidence that different intemodes on tubers were susceptible to infection at different times during tuber development was produced. Basal intemodes, which are the first sections of the tuber to expand, are susceptible earliest in tuber development with apical intemodes only becoming susceptible later in tuber growth by which time the basal intemodes are no longer susceptible. Basal intemodes in older tubers, which were less susceptible to common scab infection, were shown to rapidly produce additional <b>phellem</b> cell layers when exposed to the pathogen, whereas the same internodes in young, susceptible tubers were slower to respond. A pathogen-induced suberin deposition in <b>phellem</b> and filling cells was observed in less susceptible tubers in addition to the increased thickness and number of cell layers in the <b>phellem.</b> This result suggested that the <b>phellem</b> layer rather than the lenticels may be involved in common scab infection, with infection occurring directly through the periderm, as suggested by Loria et al. (2003), rather than through the lenticels as suggested by most other authors. This project has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the role and relationships between pre-existing or induced structural features of the tuber and common scab disease infection of potato.

Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular marker has been used to determine the genetic diversity between these nine cultivars.

Here, we address this question by combining suppression subtractive hybridization together with cDNA microarrays, using as a model the external bark of the cork tree (Quercus suber), from which bottle cork is obtained.

We also show that both stress proteins are mainly located in the region of the quiescent center in root apex and in central meristem in the shoot apex. We emphasize that smHSPs and OLPs are expressed in cells growing under endogenous stress or facing long life-span. We discus...|$|E
40|$|The data of comparative-anatomical {{study of}} {{structure}} of stem bark of two vicarious species (Populus tremula L. and P. davidiana Dode) {{are represented in}} this article. Methodic {{of the study was}} traditional in anatomy of plants. It was established that having a great similarity {{in the structure of the}} bark, which is justified by belonging to the same genus of Populus L., nevertheless studied species differ clearly on the anatomical features of the bark. In particular, P. davidiana different from P. tremula by heterogeneous <b>phellem</b> in young stems, lack of sclereids in the primary bark, the formation of sclerenchyma already in the secondary phloem of one-year stem, as well as by lack of sclereids in secondary phloem in the bark of the trunk region...|$|E
40|$|Patatin {{is one of}} {{the major}} soluble {{proteins}} in potato tubers and is encoded by a multigene family. Based on structural considerations two classes of patatin genes are distinguished. The 5 ′-upstream regulatory region of a class I gene contained within a 1. 5 kb sequence is essential and sufficient to direct a high level of tuber-specific gene activity which was on average 100 - to 1000 -fold higher in tubers as compared to leaf, stem and roots in greenhouse grown transgenic potato plants when fused to the β-glucuronidase reporter gene. Histochemical analysis revealed this activity to be present in parenchymatic tissue but not in the peripheral <b>phellem</b> cells of transgenic tubers. Furthermore the promoter fragment can be activated in leaves under conditions that simulate the need for the accumulation of starch in storage organs, i. e. high levels of sucrose. The expression is restricted to both mesophyll and epidermal cells in contrast to vascular tissue or hair cells...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chloroxylon swietenia DC. {{belongs to}} the family Rutaceae / Meliaceae / Chloroxylaceae, is a {{medicinal}} and aromatic tree of dry deciduous forests. It is popularly known as Yellow wood, East Indian satin wood and Ceylon satin wood. The stem bark is credited for its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} common cough and cold, it is also used as an astringent. Its pharmacognostic data for authentication of the crude drug is not available, hence, in the present study, macroscopical, microscopical, and preliminary phytochemical investigations of stem bark is undertaken. Powder microscopy revealed that Cork cells, Calcium oxalate crystals, Phloem parenchyma, medullary rays and thick walled phloem fibers were abundant. Anatomical studies showed the presence of <b>phellem,</b> phellogen, and phelloderm with abundant secondary phloem. The qualitative chemical tests of petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and water extracts of stem bark revealed the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and tannins.

Important morphological and anatomical considerations were added for C. carthagenensis, such as: the occurrence of aerenchymatous <b>phellem</b> with suberized layers; the types of trichomes present in the vegetative organs, the characterization of secretory trichomes, as well as the secreted substances. The groups of secondary metabolites presents in the root, stem and leaf of C. carthagenensis with more intense histochemical reaction were: proanthocyanidins, phenolic compounds, acids polysaccharides (mucilage especially) and lipids...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{species of}} Canthium s. l. {{recorded}} in southern Africa were studied. In this paper {{the anatomy of}} the young stem is described and the taxonomic and diagnostic value of the characters discussed. Several anatomical features of the stem are useful in distinguishing between taxa. These include {{the structure of the}} hairs, the thickness of the cuticle, the shape of the epidermal cells, the initiation of the periderm and the structure of the <b>phellem,</b> the abundance and distribution pattern of a particular type of tanniniferous cell, the presence of subepidermal collenchyma, the relative abundance of two types of pericyclic fibres and the shape of the vascular cylinder and pith. On the basis of stem anatomy three distinct groups were recognized, corresponding with the recently proposed segregate genera, Canthium Lam. s. str. (in a southern African context), Psydrax Gaertn. and Keetia Phill. Anatomically all species show little infraspecific variation and most of the them could be distinguished from one another...|$|E

40|$|Plant growth {{regulators}} {{involved in}} cork formation In Europe, cork oak {{is the only}} tree species cultivated at large-scale and periodically harvested throughout the tree’s life for its bark (cork), suitable for industrial applications. The porosity and caliber {{are the two most}} important parameters to determine cork quality and, consequently, its economic value. In cork oak, the porosity and caliber of the cork vary along the trunk and branches of the tree. Plant growth regulators (hormones), such as auxin, are involved in the control of plant development, growth and response to stress conditions. The cork formation process involves cell division from the cork cambium (phellogen) and the differentiation of <b>phellem</b> (cork) cells which includes the deposition of suberin in the cell walls. Similarly to what has been documented for wood formation [1], it is expected that growth regulators have a crucial role in these tissues for regulation of cell division and differentiation, thus affecting the properties of cork. Project outline This work aims at the study of plant growth regulators and their signaling pathways involved in the cork formation process, focusing on auxin. The specific objectives are...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Lammas shoots are flushes {{formed by}} some woody species {{later in the}} growing season. Having less time to develop, tissue {{formation}} is suggested to be incomplete leading to a higher peridermal water loss during consecutive months. In this study, we analysed morpho-logical and anatomical parameters, peridermal conductance to water vapour {{and the level of}} native embolism in mid-winter and late-winter of lammas shoots and normal spring shoots of the apple varieties Malus domestica ‘Gala ’ and ‘Nicoter’. Lammas shoots showed a significantly higher shoot cross-sectional area due to larger pith and corticular parenchyma areas. In contrast, phloem was significantly thicker in spring shoots. No pronounced differences were observed in xylem and collenchyma thickness or mean hydraulic conduit diameter. The <b>phellem</b> of spring shoots was composed of more suberinised cells compared to lammas shoots, which led to a significantly higher peri-dermal conductance in the latter. The amount of native embolism in mid-winter did not differ between shoot types, but in late-winter lammas shoots were more embolised than spring shoots. Data show that the restricted vegetation period of lammas shoots affects their development and, in consequence, their transpiration shield. This may also pose a risk for winter desiccation...|$|E
