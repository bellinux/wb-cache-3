2500|$|The formal beatification of Faustina {{involved}} {{the case of}} Maureen Digan of Massachusetts. In March 1981 Digan reported a healing, while praying at the tomb of Faustina. Digan had suffered from Lymphedema (a disease which causes significant swelling due to fluid retention) for decades, and had undergone ten operations, including a leg amputation. Digan reported that while praying at Faustina's tomb, she heard a voice saying [...] "ask for my help and I will help you" [...] and her constant pain stopped. After two days, Digan reported that her foot - which had previously been too large for her shoe due to her body's liquid retention, was healed. Upon her return to the United States, five Boston area physicians stated that she was healed (with no medical explanation) and the case was declared miraculous by the Vatican in 1992 based on the additional testimony of over 20 witnesses about her <b>prior</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
6000|$|On October 5, 1918, the German Government {{addressed}} a brief Note to the President accepting the Fourteen Points {{and asking for}} Peace negotiations. The President's reply of October 8 {{asked if he was}} to understand definitely that the German Government accepted [...] "the terms laid down" [...] in Fourteen Points and in his subsequent Addresses and [...] "that its object in entering into discussion would be only to agree upon the practical details of their application." [...] He added that the evacuation of invaded territory must be a <b>prior</b> <b>condition</b> of an Armistice. On October 12 the German Government returned an unconditional affirmative to these questions;-"its object in entering into discussions would be only to agree upon practical details of the application of these terms." [...] On October 14, having received this affirmative answer, the President made a further communication to make clear the points: (1) that the details of the Armistice would have to be left to the military advisers of the United States and the Allies, and must provide absolutely against the possibility of Germany's resuming hostilities; (2) that submarine warfare must cease if these conversations were to continue; and (3) that he required further guarantees of the representative character of the Government with which he was dealing. On October 20 Germany accepted points (1) and (2), and pointed out, as regards (3), that she now had a Constitution and a Government dependent for its authority on the Reichstag. On October 23 the President announced that, [...] "having received the solemn and explicit assurance of the German Government that it unreservedly accepts the terms of peace laid down in his Address to the Congress of the United States on January 8, 1918 (the Fourteen Points), and the principles of settlement enunciated in his subsequent Addresses, particularly the Address of September 27, and that it is ready to discuss the details of their application," [...] he has communicated the above correspondence to the Governments of the Allied Powers [...] "with the suggestion that, if these Governments are disposed to effect peace upon the terms and principles indicated," [...] they will ask their military advisers to draw up Armistice Terms of such a character as to [...] "ensure to the Associated Governments the unrestricted power to safeguard and enforce the details of the peace to which the German Government has agreed." [...] At the end of this Note the President hinted more openly than in that of October 14 at the abdication of the Kaiser. This completes the preliminary negotiations to which the President alone was a party, adding without the Governments of the Allied Powers.|$|E

50|$|Damage from {{improperly}} fitted {{and applied}} horseshoes {{can be seen}} in a gradual distortion of hoof shape, along with other ailments. Hoof soles are often sensitive when going barefoot after a long period of having been shod (because they are not thick enough through callusing). It can take weeks, months, a year, or more, depending on the horse's <b>prior</b> <b>condition,</b> before a horse is sound and usable on bare feet. During this transition period, the horse can be fitted with hoof boots which protect the soles of the feet until the horse has time to heal and build up callouses, though these boots, especially when not properly fitted and used, can cause hoof damage as well.|$|E
