This paper delineates a 100 % atom economical process for the preparation of KDF from formic acid and potassium formate. Parametric optimization of the synthesis was conducted with respect to reaction time, reaction temperature, and molar ratio of the reactants by employing orthogonal design of experiment method. The results manifested a molar ratio of HCOOH to HCOOK of 1. 3, reaction temperature of 65 degrees C, and reaction time of 30 min as the optimal conditions with a KDF product yield of 94. 0 %. Efforts were also made to explore the antimold performance of KDF on animal feed using the plate count method. Compared with sodium diacetate (SDA), the widely used mold inhibitor, KDF exhibited even better antimold performance for animal feed. To our knowledge, this work first proved the applicability of KDF as a mold inhibitor for animal feed...|$|E
40|$|Performance of {{broilers}} fed diets containing <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> {{to replace}} flavomycin ABSTRACT. The {{aim of this}} research was to study the effect of potassium-diformate (PD) on broiler performance. One hundred and twenty old chicks of Cobb strain were divided into fifteen groups and feed one of five treatments, namely: P 1 (control diet), P 2 (P 1 + 0, 5 %PD), P 3 (P 1 + 1 %PD), P 4 (P 1 + 1, 5 %PD) and P 5 (P 1 + antibiotic). Data from Completely Randomized Design were analyzed by ANOVA and any significant among them were used contrast orthogonal test. Treatments did not impact on feed consumption, mortality and percentage of viscera, but the groups treated with 1 and 1. 5 % PD and flavomicyne antibiotic had significant improvement on body weight gain (P< 0. 169) and feed efficiency (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that addition of 1 - 1. 5 % potassium-diformate in the broiler’s diet could improve feed efficiency and replace flavomycine antibiotic as growth promotors without influencing the performance of viscera...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two organic acid salts on the {{production}} performance of juvenile male Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus were studied in two separate experiments. In the first trial the fish (initial size: 7. 84 kg) were fed commercial feed supplemented with 0, 3 % <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> (KDF) while in the second trial the fish (initial size: 16. 48 kg) were fed diets supplemented with 0, 3 % sodium diformate (NDF). The control group for both trials used the same commercial fish feed with no supplementation. The feeding trials lasted for 74 and 78 days, respectively. Results showed that the supplementation of either KDF or NDF significantly improved growth and feed conversion of male Nile tilapia compared to the control group. The fish in the KDF treatment had a mean final weight of 51. 4 g and FCR of 1. 81 compared to 45. 4 g and 1. 97, respectively, for the control. Mean final weight and FCR of fish in the NDF treatment were 66. 2 g and 0. 69, respectively, while those of the control were 58. 7 g and 0. 77. The condition factor of the fish in both trials was not affected by treatment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{connection}} with the global demand for safe human food {{and the production of}} environmentally friendly aquaculture products, acidifiers are natural organic acids and salts that have received considerable attention as animal-feed additives. The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> (KDF) on the growth performance and immunity of cultured Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus). Four iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric rations containing graded levels of KDF, including 0 % (control basal diet), 0. 1 %, 0. 2 % and 0. 3 %, were fed separately to four equal fish groups (30 fish/group with an initial body weight of 53. 49 ± 6. 15 g) for sixty days. At the end of the experimental period, the fish groups fed on 0. 2 % and 0. 3 % KDF exhibited significant improvements in their feed intake, live weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio, with concomitant improvement of their apparent protein digestibility (p< 0. 05). Dietary supplementation of 0. 3 % KDF appeared to stimulate the beneficial intestinal flora; a proliferation was observed of indigenous probionts (Eubiosis) associated with the relative activation of cellular and humeral innate immunity (phagocytic activity/index, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test and serum/gut mucous lysozyme activity). The cumulative mortality of the fish groups fed on KDF and challenged orally with Aeromonas hydrophila was lower than that of the control group. The resistance against diseases increased with dietary KDF in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, we conclude that the use of acidifiers can be an efficient tool to achieve sustainable, economical and safe fish production...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{and application of}} a wide range of dietary supplements, such as probiotics, prebiotic and other additives, are increasingly popular in aquaculture research and practice. To date few studies have attempted to quantify the value of commercially available additives in improving growth performance of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and in compensating potential growth reduction resulting from high levels of plant protein (PP) in carnivorous fish diets. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of different active ingredients in diet additives on turbot. I) Five diets supplemented with (1) yeast b-glucan and mannan oligosaccharides (GM), (2) alginic acid from brown algal extracts (AC), (3) yeast nucleotides and RNA (NR), (4) <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> (PDF) and (5) bacteria strains Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis (BS), containing fish meal (FM) as the only protein source, were fed to turbots (initial weight 48. 8 g ± 5. 2 g) over 112 days. II) Four diets supplemented with (1) GM, (2) AC, (3) NR and (4) BS, containing soy protein concentrate (SPC) and wheat gluten (WG) as a partial replacement of FM, were fed to turbots (initial weight 95. 8 g ± 17. 7 g) over 84 days. A non-supplemented FM diet (exp. I) and an FM- and PP-based diet (exp. II), respectively, were used as control diets. Diet additives did not promote additional weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in turbot fed FM- or PP-based diets (p > 0. 05) when compared to isocaloric control diets in both experiments. Growth of turbots fed the high FM content control diet (II) was significantly higher than all other treatments (p 0. 05). Results indicate that reported benefits for specific diet additives cannot be assumed to function or applied across species boundaries and age classes. In addition, dietary additive application may not be economically valid for larger animals and/or animals not exposed to specific culture-related stressors. The benefits of popular additives to high value species such as S. maximus remains to be tested under specific immune or physical stress situations and at crucial larval and early juvenile stages...|$|E
40|$|Two organic acids, {{polyhydroxybutyrate}} (PHB) and <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> (KDF) {{have been}} researched {{to only a}} limited extent with aquatic species but {{have been shown to}} have various positive effects on terrestrial animals. Two algae extracts, carrageenan and alginic acid, also have been shown to elicit immunostimulation in some fish. Therefore, the present study was conducted with red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) as a model marine species to study the effects of organic acids and algae extracts as feed supplements by evaluating several humoral immune responses. Two feeding trials, one of 7 -week duration and the other of 3 -week were conducted with disease-free juvenile red drum (average initial wt. 2. 6 ? 0. 2 g and 78. 2 ? 0. 2 g, respectively). Semipurified diets were formulated to be isocaloric and contain 40 % crude protein. Experimental diets were produced by supplementing the basal diet with KDF at 0. 6 %, PHB at 2 %, alginic acid at 1 % or carrageenan at 0. 5 % by weight in place of cellulose. Fish were stocked into 110 -L aquaria operated as a recirculating system with each diet assigned to three replicate aquaria containing either 15 fish (7 -week trial) or 9 fish per aquarium (3 -week trial). All fish were fed their respective diets at the same fixed percentage of body weight (initially 6 % and gradually reduced to 4 % as the fish grew). Body weight was monitored by collectively weighing fish from each aquarium every week. At the end of each feeding trial, weight gain and feed efficiency were significantly (P< 0. 0001) reduced in fish feed PHB compared to the basal diet and both algae extracts. There {{were no significant differences in}} condition indices such as hepatosomatic index (HSI) and intraperitoneal fat (IPF) ratio among fish fed the various diets. Lysozyme activity was significantly higher in fish fed alginic acid. The greatest phagocytic activity was found in fish fed the diet containing PHB. Total immunoglobulin level was higher in fish fed the diet supplemented with carrageenan. Goblet cell proliferation was greatest in the posterior end of the gastrointestinal tract but not different among dietary treatments. Organic acids and algae extracts evaluated in this study produced variable immunological responses in red drum with carrageenan showing the greatest potential as an immunostimulant...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion {{of plant}} {{ingredients}} in diets for salmonids is restricted due to low energy contents, unbalanced amino acid (AA) composition and presence of antinutritional factors (ANF). The {{objective of this}} thesis was to investigate methods for improving the nutritional and physical quality of plant ingredients in diets for salmonids by use of thermomechanical treatment and supplemental organic acid salts. Diets containing plant ingredients derived from soybeans or barley were exposed to thermo-mechanical treatment at different temperatures by (1) expander pretreatment, (2) extrusion and (3) autoclaving, {{with or without the}} supplementation of 12 g kg- 1 <b>potassium</b> <b>diformate</b> (KDF) or 10. 6 g kg- 1 sodium diformate (NaDF). Nutritional quality was evaluated by the content of dietary AA, available lysine and trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), as well as in vivo apparent digestibility in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and mink (Neovison vison). In addition, a two-step in vitro gastrointestinal model (GIM) was used to assess protein solubility and bioavailability of AA by use of digestive enzymes from Atlantic salmon. Physical quality of extruded diets was evaluated by measuring hardness, expansion ratio, durability and water stability index (WSI). Expander pretreatment of full-fat soybean meal (FFSBM) at 100 and 120 ºC improved (P 0. 1) affect nutrient digestibility in Atlantic salmon and mink, whereas supplementation of NaDF improved (P 0. 1) affect the digestibility of CP or individual AA in mink. Physical quality of the extruded diets was affected by both extrusion temperature and supplementation of organic acid salts. Increased pellet expansion was observed in diets with soybeans processed by expander pretreatment and increasing extrusion temperatures, while supplemental KDF reduced pellet expansion. In diets with BPC, increasing extrusion temperatures improved pellet durability. Addition of NaDF improved the expansion ratio, durability and WSI compared to diets without NaDF. The improved digestibility of plant proteins in salmonids by thermo-mechanical treatment at increasing temperatures is explained by a reduction in heat-labile ANF concurrent with higher availability of AA, as a result of denaturation and structural unfolding of protein molecules. The negative effects of increasing temperatures in combination with long treatment times in the autoclave on digestibility of CP and AA in mink was explained by a reduction in AA availability. Supplementation of acid salts did not consistently improve the digestibility of plant ingredients in salmonids and did not protect the protein from heat-induced damage during prolonged heat treatment. The lack of consistency remains unclear and requires further investigation. Both increasing temperatures during extrusion and supplementation of acid salts affected the physical quality of the feeds. The improved physical quality by supplemental acid salts indicates increased binding of feed particles...|$|E
