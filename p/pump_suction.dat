50|$|To have a {{well-developed}} flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) {{of straight}} pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel {{must contend with}} space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, {{it is common to}} use an elbow close-coupled to the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the <b>pump</b> <b>suction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Buffer tankA {{buffer tank}} is often {{installed}} upstream of the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> nozzle {{in case of}} a slug flow. The buffer tank breaks the energy of the liquid slug, smooths any fluctuations in the incoming flow and acts as a sand trap.|$|E
50|$|In normal conditions, common {{centrifugal}} pumps {{are unable to}} evacuate the air from an inlet line leading to a fluid level whose geodetic altitude is below that of the pump.

50|$|The {{depth of}} a spray pond {{has very little}} {{influence}} on its thermal performance. However, the pond should contain sufficient water to fill all flumes, seal wells and <b>pump</b> <b>suctions</b> during plant startup. Typically, spray pond depths of between 0.9 m and 1.5 m are recommended in the literature, with a depth of 0.9 m being most common. Additionally, sufficient additional volume above the normal operating level should be provided within the spray pond to accept all water drainage from these flumes, seal wells and <b>pump</b> <b>suctions</b> when the plant is stopped.|$|R

50|$|Pulp {{is pumped}} through a {{sequence}} of tanks that are commonly called chests, which may be either round or more commonly rectangular. Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used. Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> at the chest bottom.|$|E
50|$|To set {{the heat}} {{output of the}} burner, the rate of fuel {{delivery}} via the nozzle must be adjustable. This is often achieved by an adjustable pressure relief valve between the pump and the nozzle. When the set pressure is reached (usually 100psi), this valve opens and allows excess oil to flow through a bypass back to the fuel tank or the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> side.|$|E
50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must {{be filled with}} liquid before the pump is started, or the pump {{will not be able}} to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> under pressure supplied by another pump placed in the suction line.|$|E

50|$|The C.W. system {{comprises}} a twin culvert fed by four {{vertical spindle}} pumps feeding the condensers arranged in two parallel groups, and discharging to eight cooling towers. The cooled C.W. {{from the tower}} ponds is returned to the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> for re-circulation. A special feature of the C.W. plant at Cottam is the annular moat arrangement around the pump house. The moat is 45.72m (150 ft) external diameter, 5.486m (18 ft) deep and 3.048m (10 ft) wide. Suction for the four pumps is taken tangentially {{from the inside of}} the moat. This arrangement causes a continual circular, vortex free flow of water within the moat and allows any combination of the four pumps to be operated as the station demands.|$|E
50|$|The mud in the {{wellbore}} must exert enough {{hydrostatic pressure}} to equal the formation pore pressure. If the fluid’s hydrostatic pressure {{is less than}} formation pressure the well can flow.The most common reason for insufficient fluid density is drilling into unexpected abnormally pressured formations. This situation usually arises when unpredicted geological conditions are encountered. Such as drilling across a fault that abruptly changes the formation being drilled.Mishandling mud at the surface accounts for many instances of insufficient fluid weight. Such as opening wrong valve on the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> manifold and allowing a tank of light weight fluid to be pumped; bumping the water valve so more is added than intended; washing off shale shakers; or clean-up operations. All of these can affect mud weight.|$|E
50|$|Suction {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at {{the eye of the}} pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.|$|E
50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of the pump. Operation of the <b>pump</b> creates <b>suction</b> (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the <b>pump's</b> <b>suction</b> and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|R
50|$|Standard treadle <b>pumps</b> are <b>suction</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{and were}} first {{developed}} in the early 1980s in Bangladesh. Most treadle pumps manufactured in Africa are pressure treadle pumps; a modification to the original design that means water is {{forced out of the}} pump under pressure. Pressure treadle pumps are more versatile as they allow farmers to pump water uphill, or over long distances, or fill elevated tanks.|$|R
25|$|When an open {{collection}} system is used, the <b>pump’s</b> <b>suction</b> can cause milk to overflow {{it into the}} {{collection system}} tubing, which may lead to milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the pump's tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aperture}} {{visible from}} the pool side is typically 1' 0" [...] (300 mm) wide by 6" [...] (150 mm) high, which intersects the water midway though {{the center of the}} aperture. Skimmers with apertures wider than this are termed [...] "wide angle" [...] skimmers and may be as much as 2' 0" [...] wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E
50|$|Hot tubs and spa pools {{are common}} heated pools used for {{relaxation}} and sometimes for therapy. Commercial spas {{are common in}} the swimming pool area or sauna area of a health club or fitness centre, in men's clubs, women's clubs, motels and exclusive five-star hotel suites. Spa clubs may have very large pools, some segmented into increasing temperatures. In Japan, men's clubs with many spas of different size and temperature are common. Commercial spas are generally made of concrete, with a mosaic tiled interior. More recently with the innovation of the pre-form composite method where mosaic tiles are bonded to the shell this enables commercial spas to be completely factory manufactured to specification and delivered in one piece. Hot tubs are typically made somewhat like a wine barrel with straight sides, from wood such as Californian redwood {{held in place by}} metal hoops. Immersion of the head is not recommended in spas or hot tubs due to a potential risk of underwater entrapment from the <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> forces. However, commercial installations in many countries must comply with various safety standards which reduce this risk considerably.|$|E

5000|$|E. Suction Cleaner: In {{the opinion}} of the {{committee}} the only satisfactory method of removing the dirt, hair, etc., settling on the bottom of a pool is by means of a suction cleaner. As such cleaners are commonly operated by the circulation pumps; they may be classed as an adjunct to the recirculation system. When a suction cleaner is to be operated by the recirculation pump, a gate with graduated stem or other registering device should be provided for throttling the flow from the pool outlet to permit the pump to operate at maximum efficiency when the suction cleaner is in use. Fixed pipe connections for attachment of suction cleaner to <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> should be of ample size to reduce friction to a minimum and the cleaner and all removable connections should be designed to provide a maximum velocity at the suction nozzle.XXVI Cleaning PoolA.

50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed <b>pump</b> <b>suction</b> main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Awell-developed <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> in {{the head}} repre-sents an {{important}} adaptation for nectar-feeding insects, such as Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. This pumping organ creates a pressure gradient along the proboscis, {{which is responsible for}} nectar uptake. The extremely elongated proboscis of the genus Prosoeca (Nemestrinidae) evolved as an adaptation to feeding from long, tubular flowers. According to the functional constraint hypothesis, nectar up-take through a disproportionately elongated, straw-like pro-boscis increases flower handling time and consequently lowers the energy intake rate. Due to the conspicuous length variation of the proboscis of Prosoeca, individuals with lon-ger proboscides are hypothesised to have longer handling times. To test this hypothesis, we used field video analyses of flower-visiting behaviour, detailed examinations of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> morphology and correlations of proboscis length with body length and <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> dimensions. Using a biomechanical framework described for nectar-feeding Lepidoptera in relation to proboscis length and suc-tion pumpmusculature, we describe and contrast the system in long-proboscid flies. Flies with longer proboscides spent sig-nificantly more time drinking from flowers. In addition, pro-boscis length and body length showed a positive allometric relationship. Furthermore, adaptations of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> included an allometric relationship between proboscis length and <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> muscle volume and a combination of two pumping organs. Overall, the study gives detailed insight into the adaptations required for long-proboscid nectar feeding, and comparisons with other nectar-sucking insects allow fur-ther considerations of the evolution of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> in insects with sucking mouthparts...|$|R
