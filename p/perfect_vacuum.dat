5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum.</b> It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E

25|$|Michelson sought another measurement, {{but this}} time in an {{evacuated}} tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1930, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In multiple reflections the light path was increased to 10 miles. For {{the first time in}} history the speed of light was measured in an almost <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum</b> of 0.5mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "channel" [...] has two {{different}} meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the atmosphere for sound communications, glass optical fibers for {{some kinds of}} optical communications, coaxial cables for communications {{by way of the}} voltages and electric currents in them, and free space for communications using visible light, infrared waves, ultraviolet light, and radio waves. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or [...] "radio guide", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications. This last channel is called the [...] "free space channel". The sending of radio waves {{from one place to another}} has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum</b> just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.|$|E
2500|$|In nature, a {{light source}} emits {{a ray of}} light which travels, eventually, to a surface that {{interrupts}} its progress. [...] One can think of this [...] "ray" [...] as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. [...] In a <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum</b> this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [...] absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. [...] A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting {{in a loss of}} intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. [...] It might also reflect {{all or part of the}} light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. [...] A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of [...] the incoming rays. [...] Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.|$|E

6000|$|... 627. But the {{diminution}} {{of power to}} one-half {{on the side of}} the gaseous body towards the metal is only a slight result of what seems to me to flow as a necessary consequence of the known constitution of gases. An atmosphere of one gas or vapour, however dense or compressed, is in effect as a vacuum to another: thus, if a little water were put into a vessel containing a dry gas, as air, of the pressure of one hundred atmospheres, as much vapour of the water would rise as if it were in a <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Here the particles of watery vapour appear to have no difficulty in approaching within any distance of the particles of air, being influenced solely by relation to particles of their own kind; and if it be so with respect to a body having the same elastic powers as itself, how much more surely must it be so with particles, like those of the platina, or other limiting body, which at the same time that they have not these elastic powers, are also unlike it in nature! Hence it would seem to result that the particles of hydrogen or any other gas or vapour which are next to the platina, &c., must be in such contact with it as if they were in the liquid state, and therefore almost infinitely closer to it than they are to each other, even though the metal be supposed to exert no attractive influence over them.|$|E

But {{assuming}} that a <b>perfect</b> <b>vacuum</b> were {{to intervene in}} the course of the lines of inductive action (1304.), it does not follow from this theory, that the particles on opposite sides of such a vacuum could not act on each other. Suppose it possible for a positively electrified particle to be in the centre of a vacuum an inch in diameter, nothing in my present views forbids that the particle should act at the distance of half an inch on all the particles forming the inner superficies of the bounding sphere, and with a force consistent with the well-known law of the squares of the distance. But suppose the sphere of an inch were full of insulating matter, the electrified particle would not then, according to my notion, act directly on the distant particles, but on those in immediate association with it, employing all its power in polarizing them; producing in them negative force equal in amount to its own positive force and directed towards the latter, and positive force of equal amount directed outwards and acting in the same manner upon the layer of particles next in succession. So that ultimately, those particles in the surface of a sphere of half an inch radius, which were acted on directly when that sphere was a vacuum, will now be acted on indirectly as respects the central particle or source of action, i.e. they will be polarized in the same way, and with the same amount of force.|$|E

It {{would seem}} strange, if a theory which refers all the {{phenomena}} of insulation and conduction, i.e. all electrical phenomena, {{to the action}} of contiguous particles, were to omit to notice the assumed possible case of a vacuum. Admitting that a vacuum can be produced, {{it would be a}} very curious matter indeed to know what its relation to electrical phenomena would be; and as shell-lac and metal are directly opposed to each other, whether a vacuum would be opposed to them both, and allow neither of induction or conduction across it. Mr. Morgan[A] has said that a vacuum does not conduct. Sir H. Davy concluded from his investigations, that as <b>perfect</b> a <b>vacuum</b> as could be made[B] did conduct, but does not consider the prepared spaces which he used as absolute vacua. In such experiments I think I have observed the luminous discharge to be principally on the inner surface of the glass; and it does not appear at all unlikely, that, if the vacuum refused to conduct, still the surface of glass next it might carry on that action.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{stability of}} the Einstein static solution against homogeneous scalar, vector and tensor perturbations {{in the context of}} Rastall theory of gravity. We show that this solution in the presence of <b>perfect</b> fluid and <b>vacuum</b> energy originating from conformally-invariant fields is stable. Using the fix point method and taking linear homogeneous perturbations, we find that the scale factor of Einstein static universe for closed deformed isotropic and homogeneous FLRW universe depends on the coupling parameter λ between the energy-momentum tensor and the gradient of Ricci scalar. Thus, in the present model and in presence of vacuum energy, our universe can stay at the Einstein static state past-eternally, which means that the big bang singularity may be resolved successfully in the context of Einstein static universe in Rastall theory.

40|$|A {{mirror in}} the vacuum is {{submitted}} to a radiation pressure exerted by scattered fields. It is known that the resulting mean force is zero for a motionless mirror, but not for a mirror moving with a non-uniform acceleration. We show here that this force results from a motional modification of the field scattering while being associated with the fluctuations of the radiation pressure on a motionless mirror. We {{consider the case of}} a scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime and characterize the scattering upon the mirror by frequency dependent transmissivity and reflectivity functions obeying unitarity, causality and high frequency transparency conditions. We derive causal expressions for dissipation and fluctuations and exhibit their relation for any stationary input. We recover the known damping force at the limit of a <b>perfect</b> mirror in <b>vacuum.</b> Finally, we interpret the force as a mechanical signature of the squeezing effect associated with the mirror's motion.

40|$|Using the {{formalism}} developed earlier, {{we treat}} spontaneous emission from a three-level atom (ladder system) interacting with a broadband squeezed vacuum field. We obtain expressions for the transient and steady-state {{populations of the}} atomic levels with the conditions that the atom interacts with either a multimode <b>perfect</b> squeezed <b>vacuum</b> field, or a three-dimensional vacuum field in which the squeezed modes lie within a solid angle over which squeezing is propagated. The results are compared with those obtained for the atom interacting with a thermal field. We show that in the perfect case the first excited state is not populated when the squeezed vacuum field is in a minimum-uncertainty squeezed state. Moreover, the second excited state can have a steady-state population larger than 1 / 2. These features are completely absent when the atom interacts with the thermal field. In addition, for a low-intensity squeezed vacuum field {{the population in the}} second excited state exhibits a linear rather than quadratic dependence on the intensity of the squeezed vacuum field. In the three-dimensional case the presence of unsqueezed modes considerably reduces the effect of squeezing on spontaneous emission. However, a significant reduction in a population of the first excited state and a population larger than 1 / 2 in the second excited state can be achieved provided the squeezing is propagated over a large solid angle. We also discuss the effect of the two-photon detuning between the double carrier frequency of the squeezing and atomic transition frequency 3 on the steady-state atomic population...|$|R
40|$|Analytic {{solutions}} of the mean-field induction equation {{predict a}} nonoscillatory dynamo for homogeneous helical turbulence or constant alpha effect in unbounded or periodic domains. Oscillatory dynamos are generally thought impossible for constant alpha. We present an analytic solution for a one-dimensional bounded domain resulting in oscillatory solutions for constant alpha, but different (Dirichlet and von Neumann or <b>perfect</b> conductor and <b>vacuum)</b> boundary {{conditions on the}} two boundaries. We solve a second order complex equation and superimpose two independent solutions to obey both boundary conditions. The solution has time-independent energy density. On one end where the function value vanishes, the second derivative is finite, which would not be correctly reproduced with sine-like expansion functions where a node coincides with an inflection point. The field always migrates away from the perfect conductor boundary toward the vacuum boundary, independently of the sign of alpha. The obtained solution {{may serve as a}} benchmark for numerical dynamo experiments and as a pedagogical illustration that oscillatory migratory dynamos are possible with constant alpha.

40|$|The Strong Cosmic Censorship {{conjecture}} {{states that}} for generic initial data to Einstein's field equations, the maximal globally hyperbolic development is inextendible. We prove this conjecture {{in the class}} of orthogonal Bianchi class B <b>perfect</b> fluids and <b>vacuum</b> spacetimes, by showing that unboundedness of certain curvature invariants such as the Kretschmann scalar is a generic property. The only spacetimes where this scalar remains bounded exhibit local rotational symmetry or are of plane wave equilibrium type. We further investigate the qualitative behaviour of solutions towards the initial singularity. To this end, we work in the expansion-normalised variables introduced by Hewitt-Wainwright and show that a set of full measure, which is also a countable intersection of open and dense sets in the state space, yields convergence to a specific subarc of the Kasner parabola. We further give an explicit construction enabling the translation between these variables and geometric initial data to Einstein's equations.
