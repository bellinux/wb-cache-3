25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E

50|$|Triplex <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> use three <b>plungers,</b> {{which reduces}} the {{pulsation}} of single reciprocating <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps.</b> Adding a pulsation dampener on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic {{relationship of the}} high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality <b>plunger</b> seals. <b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> with {{a larger number of}} plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation dampener. The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.|$|R

50|$|<b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> {{component}} {{materials are}} chosen for wear and {{contact with the}} media type. Component materials include bronze, brass, steel, stainless steel, iron, nickel alloy, or other material. For example, <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> that function in general service or oil service applications often have an iron cylinder and plunger. The plunger, discharge valves, and suction valves {{come in contact with}} the media type transferred, and material choices are based on the fluid transferred. In power applications where continuous duty <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> are needed, solid ceramic plungers may be used when in contact with water and oil, but may not be compatible for use with highly acidic media types.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> - a {{reciprocating}} plunger {{pushes the}} fluid through {{one or two}} open valves, closed by suction on the way back.|$|R
5000|$|Rotary piston and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> use a crank {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump. The pressure in the chamber actuates the valves at both the suction and discharge points. <b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> are used in applications that could range from [...] Piston pumps are used in lower pressure applications. The volume of the fluid discharged {{is equal to the}} area of the plunger or piston, multiplied by its stroke length. The overall capacity of the piston <b>pumps</b> and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> can be calculated with the area of the piston or plunger, the stroke length, the number of pistons or plungers and the speed of the drive. The power needed from the drive is proportional to the pressure and capacity of the pump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{water from}} the mine was light, the largest pump being an [...]66 ft <b>plunger</b> <b>pump,</b> which sufficed to keep clear of water the {{workings}} below the tunnel level. Ventilation was afforded by a regular system of winzes from level to level.|$|E
50|$|Unit {{injector}} (UI) is {{an integrated}} {{direct fuel injection}} system for diesel engines, combining the injector nozzle and the injection pump in a single component.

50|$|A <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} of {{positive}} displacement pump where the high-pressure seal is stationary and a smooth cylindrical plunger slides through the seal. This makes them different from piston pumps and allows them to be used at higher pressures. This type of pump is often used to transfer municipal and industrial sewage.|$|E

50|$|Boulton and Watt {{used the}} simple {{tumbling}} box design of cataract {{for some years}} afterwards, to around 1779. After this other designs were used, including a water cataract where the same water was used and recycled continuously and also an air cataract using a circular bellows. An air cataract of this type was supplied for the Ale and Cakes Mine. The <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> design of cataract had appeared in Cornwall by 1785, but was not Watt's invention.|$|E
50|$|A {{reciprocating}} pump is {{a class of}} positive-displacement pumps which includes the piston pump, <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> and diaphragm pump. When well maintained, {{reciprocating pump}}s will last for years or even decades; however, left untouched, they can undergo rigorous wear and tear. It is often used where a relatively small quantity of liquid is to be handled and where delivery pressure is quite large. In reciprocating pumps, the chamber in which the liquid is trapped, is a stationary cylinder that contains the piston or plunger.|$|E
50|$|The Allis-Chalmers Company {{furnished}} the pumping equipment, {{which was}} a horizontal, cross-compound, flywheel engine fitted with Corliss valve gear, and operating two horizontal, outside packed, <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps.</b> The high and low pressure steam pistons were 14 inches and 28 inches in diameter, respectively, and the <b>pump</b> <b>plungers</b> 8% inches in diameter, all having a stroke of 18 inches. The capacity of the engine at 65 revolutions per minute was 1,500,000 gallons in twenty-four hours. The engine which was erected by the Blake & Knowles Steam Pump Works was of the horizontal, cross-compound, direct-acting type, operating two outside packed, <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps.</b> The steam cylinders were 11 inches and 22 inches in diameter, the <b>pump</b> <b>plungers</b> 12 inches in diameter, and both pistons and plungers have a stroke of 18 inches. When operated {{at the rate of}} 31 revolutions per minute the capacity was 1,500,000 gallons per day. There were two boilers of the horizontal, under-fired type, each 54 inches in diameter, containing 60 3-inch tubes 17 ft long. The furnaces were fitted with Foster shaking grates, 4 ft wide by 5 l/2 feet long.|$|R
50|$|Markfield Beam Engine is a {{free-standing}} {{steam engine}} with a 27 ft flywheel that moves a 21 ft beam.

When the machine was operational it had a working speed of 16 rpm and each pumps could move 2000000 imp gal a day.|$|R
50|$|Seals are an {{integral}} part of piston <b>pumps</b> and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> to separate the power fluid from the media that is being pumped. A stuffing box or packing is used to seal the joint between the vessel where the media is transferred and the plunger or piston. A stuffing box may be composed of bushings, packing or seal rings, and a gland.|$|R
50|$|The {{cataract}} itself {{resembled a}} small <b>plunger</b> <b>pump.</b> It was an iron box in a cistern filled with water, with a plunger or piston {{set in the}} top and pressed downwards by a weight. The water within the pump could only escape through a small tap or valve. As the plunger gradually fell, its motion was passed upwards by a rocking lever and a rod to the valvegear in the middle chamber. Once the rod had risen sufficiently, this opened the first valve to admit steam into {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, beginning a new stroke.|$|E
50|$|Central to the EUI is the {{built-in}} <b>plunger</b> <b>pump,</b> which, {{just as in}} a UI, allows for low-pressure fuel delivery and return to all injectors, yet provides exceptionally high pressure and concomitant injection and atomization of the fuel to a cylinder during the engine's power cycles. As in a UI, the injector is connected to common banks of fuel supply and fuel return. Fuel is always circulating within the EUI as two of its functions, other than injection for combustion, are injector lubrication and injector cooling. Connections on UIs are by formed steel tubes. Connections on EUIs are by stainless steel-reinforced hoses.|$|E
50|$|The city of Paterson at {{this time}} had no water service, and John Ryle after {{furnishing}} its citizens with a public park, conceived the idea of providing them with a good water service also, and to this end, after procuring the necessary legislative authority, through a charter granted to the Passaic Water Company, built the reservoir {{now known as the}} lower reservoir in the Falls Park grounds and proceeded to lay the necessary mains through the principal streets of the city. The water for the reservoir which supplied these mains was taken from the Passaic River, behind the Old Gun Mill, and pumped to the reservoir by the means of an old <b>plunger</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
50|$|Car washes {{often use}} these triplex-style <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> (perhaps without {{pulsation}} dampeners). In 1968, William Bruggeman significantly reduced {{the size of}} the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high pressure seals, low pressure seals and oil seals, hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps. Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world.|$|R

Maximum field-measured vibration levels were over 4 ips 0 -pk (200 mm/sec pk-pk). Most gear pumps are not equipped with the typical pulsation dampeners that are found on <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> because the relatively high frequency pulsations that gear pumps generate typically do not result in piping vibration problems. Modeling predictions indicated that the vibrations were primarily driven by pulsations. After implementation of a new gas-liquid dampener, the system vibrations were significantly reduced...|$|R

5000|$|Some 2-3 miles km {{upstream}} (north) from Renmark, Murtho {{was better}} financed than the others, demanding £60 from families and £40 from singles as start-up capital. Its chairman was Henry Cordeaux ( [...] -1902). Dubbed [...] "gentleman farmers", the Murthoites were Utopian idealists rather than impoverished workers. Among {{those who lost}} substantial sums were John Napier Birks (1845-1929) and Walter Richard Birks (1847-1900), of Adelaide's prominent Birks family. In 1897 some 60 or 70 acres were under irrigation, but the project was abandoned in 1899 after most settlers had left. A {{major factor in the}} failure of Murtho was the expense and problems involved in pumping the water: the land allocated was some 120 ft above the river level, necessitating an expensive and inefficient double-acting <b>plunger</b> <b>pump.</b> The settlers were incapable of the communistic spirit needed for the project to survive crop failures, and the Government-appointed manager (Samuel McIntosh) made only occasional contact with the settlers.

50|$|The M180's stroke was {{increased}} {{to produce the}} 2.5 L engine for the new Mercedes-Benz W108 250S and 250SE. A 6 mm increase resulted in an 82mm bore × 78.8mm stroke and displacement of 2,496 cc/152ci), carburetted on the 250S and fuel-injected on the 250SE, designated the M129. The M129 was fitted with a mechanically controlled six-piston fuel injection pump. A change from four to seven main bearings was necessary in order smoothly to handle the resulting increase in power. A larger capacity oil pump was also specified. Connecting rods were slightly shortened, reflecting the 6mm longer stroke in a block of unchanged overall height. The redesigned cylinder heads incorporated larger ports, and the valve diameters were increased by 2mm. On the fuel injected cars a six-plunger pump replaced the previous car's two <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> and the injectors were repositioned to give a more direct angle towards the inlet valve heads. The engine cooling fan now had six blades instead of four and incorporated a viscous coupling which activated the fan only when engine speed exceeded 3,000 rpm or the radiator water temperature reached a preset limit.I think engine of 250 S was called M108 (for W108 chassis) and only 250 SE engine was designated M129.|$|E

50|$|Most present-day {{diesel engines}} use a {{mechanical}} single <b>plunger</b> high-pressure fuel <b>pump</b> {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use injectors that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever. The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> are together in one unit. The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder {{in order to obtain}} the same pressure delay.|$|R
