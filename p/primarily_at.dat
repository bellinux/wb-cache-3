5|$|A {{large-scale}} uprising {{erupted in}} Serbia following the Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they took no part in the rebellion, Jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, {{and by the end}} of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish males were interned in concentration camps, <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> Topovske Šupe in Belgrade.|$|E

He won his first ITF Futures singles title in March 2009 in Montreal. He added three more singles titles and five doubles titles at the ITF Futures level in 2009 and 2010. He was less successful at the ATP Challenger level, tallying only one title. In his fourth tournament after turning professional, Raonic won the doubles title at the Men's Rimouski Challenger in November 2008, partnered with Pospisil.|$|E
5|$|Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films {{initially}} developed Saving Mr. Banks as {{an independent}} production until 2011, when producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney Pictures for permission to use copyrighted elements. The film's subject matter piqued Disney's interest, leading the studio to acquire the screenplay and produce the film. Principal photography commenced the following year in September before wrapping in November 2012; the film was shot almost entirely in the Southern California area, <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, where {{a majority of the}} film's narrative takes place.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their {{preliminary}} report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, {{to take into account}} the city's urban renewal era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in {{multistory}} apartment buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), toilets that were flushed with running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the common {{people who lived in}} the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E

5|$|Maxinquaye is the 1995 {{debut album}} by English rapper and {{producer}} Tricky. By {{the time he}} recorded the album, Tricky had grown frustrated with his limited role in the group Massive Attack and discovered vocalist Martina Topley-Bird, who he felt would offer another dimension to his lyrics. He signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way Records in 1993 and recorded Maxinquaye the following year <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> his home studio in London with Topley-Bird as the album's predominant vocalist. Additional contributing singers included Alison Goldfrapp, Ragga, and Mark Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Mulan (1998), {{the first}} film {{produced}} <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the Florida studio, earned $305 million in worldwide box office. The next summer's Tarzan, directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck, had a high production cost of $130 million, but earned $448 million at the box office. The Tarzan song score by pop star Phil Collins resulted in significant record sales and an Academy Award for Best Song.|$|E
5|$|The Voyagers found aurora-like {{ultraviolet}} {{emissions of}} hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity {{may lead to}} the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The Way I See It is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded The Way I See It <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E
5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> dusk or at dawn, and is {{associated}} with the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife is {{the second}} studio album by American post-hardcore band La Dispute, {{released}} October 4, 2011, on independent label No Sleep Records. Recording sessions for the album took place <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. The band members took control {{of all of the}} production duties alongside the album's recording engineers, Andrew Everding and Joseph Pedulla. Wildlife was their last release on No Sleep Records before forming their own record label, Better Living.|$|E
5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover {{in the water}} column with very little effort. Propulsive power is provided by the muscular tail, while the disc is held rigid. Telemetry studies have shown that this species swims <b>primarily</b> <b>at</b> night, when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief, and spends most of the day in nearby open areas buried in sediment. It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
