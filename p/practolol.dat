40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>practolol,</b> a new beta-adrenergic {{blocking}} agent, and propranolol were studied in volunteers. At rest, <b>practolol</b> caused {{a very small}} reduction in cardiac index (CI), 190 ml, P < 0. 25, and preejection period (PEP) lengthened 3 msec, P < 0. 025. In contrast, propranolol caused a reduction in CI of 770 ml, P < 0. 001. Heart rate (HR) slowed 10 beats/min, P < 0. 001, stroke volume index (SVI) fell 6 ml, P < 0. 005, PEP lengthened 16 msec, P < 0. 001, and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) increased 419 dynes-sec-cm- 5, P < 0. 001. <b>Practolol</b> reduced the increase in CI caused by an isoproterenol infusion by 65 %, P < 0. 005, by blocking the increase in HR by 73 %, P < 0. 05. <b>Practolol</b> also reduced the shortening of PEP and LVET caused by isopro-terenol. PVR decreases due to isoproterenol were not blocked by <b>practolol</b> although they were slightly attenuated, P < 0. 025. <b>Practolol</b> reduced the increase in CI caused by exercise by 22 %, P < 0. 05, by blocking the increase in HR by 29 %, P < 0. 01. <b>Practolol</b> also reduced the increase in tension-time index due to exercise by 25 %, P < 0. 025. <b>Practolol</b> has {{little effect on the}} performance of the normal heart at rest.

A range of metabolites and putative metabolites of procainamide and <b>practolol</b> were synthesized, and tested for their ability to inhibit the covalent binding reactions of C 3 and C 4. The highly nucleophilic hydroxylamine metabolite of procainamide was strongly inhibitory in both tests, as was a putative hydroxylamine metabolite of <b>practolol.</b> These studies indicate a potential role for the hydroxylamine metabolites in mediating the toxic side-effects of procainamide and <b>practolol,</b> and emphasize the need for adequate measurements of hydroxylamine metabolites in human tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that oral administration of a low dose of <b>practolol</b> in man produces selective beta- 1 receptor blockade, whereas oral administration of a high dose blocks both beta- 1 and beta- 2 receptors. Normal men were studied 2 - 4 h after a single oral dose of <b>practolol</b> (1. 5 or 12 mg/kg) and after placebo. Effects on beta- 1 receptors were studied by measuring heart rate responses to exercise. Effects on beta- 2 receptors were tested by measuring forearm vascular responses to brachial arterial infusions of isoproterenol. Neither dose of <b>practolol</b> altered base-line heart rate, forearm vascular resistance, and arterial pressure, Both low and high doses significantly attenuated heart rate responses to exercise. Forearm vasodilator responses to isoproterenol were attenuated by the high dose, but not the low dose, of <b>practolol.</b> Serum concentrations of <b>practolol</b> 2 h after administration of the drug and at the time of the studies of forearm vascular responses averaged 0. 5 +/- 0. 1 (SE) and 5. 9 +/- 1. 0 mug/ml for low and high doses of <b>practolol,</b> respectively.

40|$|In a {{controlled}} double-blind study <b>practolol,</b> a new cardioselective beta-blocking drug, {{was given to}} 15 patients with angina pectoris, and compared with propranolol 80 mg. q. d. s.

Propranolol reduced the incidence of angina and, in the exercise tests, increased the amount and duration of exercise but {{did not affect the}} degree of S—T depression. Unlike propranolol, <b>practolol</b> did not produce any adverse effects on bronchial smooth muscle.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} <b>practolol</b> 0. 4 mg/kg were studied in 12 hypertensive patients during halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. <b>Practolol</b> decreased heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (Q) from the elevated levels following atropine administration during anaesthesia, but values of arterial pressure (AP), HR and Q after {{the combination of}} atropine and <b>practolol</b> {{were not significantly different}} from those during anaesthesia prior to blockade. The effects of a similar anaesthetic sequence were studied in a further 11 treated hypertensive patients given <b>practolol</b> by mouth 1. 5 mg/kg/ 6 hours for at least 48 hours preoperatively in addition to current anti-hypertensive therapy. By comparison with treated hypertensive patients previously studied, those pretreated with <b>practolol</b> had similar AP awake, but higher AP throughout anaesthesia with either spontaneous or artificial ventilation.

40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{activities of}} two beta adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and <b>practolol,</b> were compared in eight hypertensive patients. The activity of each antagonist {{was established in}} relation to its blood concentration at maximal and submaximal adrenergic blockade defined by inhibition of exercise tachycardia. Maximal inhibition of exercise tachycardia was comparable with both drugs and averaged 74 ± 7 % of the control value during drug treatment. This inhibition was achieved with a blood concentration of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 μg/ml <b>practolol</b> and 0. 10 ± 0. 08 μg/ml propranolol. The antagonist activities of these drugs against adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol infusion indicated a much greater relative potency of propranolol against this stimulus, and in vivo estimates of PA 2 values differed by more than 600 -fold. Relative antagonist activity of <b>practolol</b> during isoproterenol stimulation was equivalent both at cardiac (inotropic and chronotropic) and at vascular adrenergic receptors, whereas greater antagonist activity of propranolol was observed at vascular receptors than at cardiac receptors. Thus, the activity of <b>practolol</b> {{was not limited to}} cardiac receptors as previously suggested. <b>Practolol</b> did not reduce cardiac output at any dose level and the effect on resting blood pressure was small.

40|$|Six healthy {{subjects}} were studied on two occasions. Graded bolus injections of isoprenaline sulphate were given intravenously and control dose-response curves were drawn for {{the changes in}} heart rate and blood pressure. In a random order each subject received an intravenous infusion of either propranolol or <b>practolol</b> and further dose-response curves were constructed PRE- and POST-atropine (0. 04 mg/kg). Exercise tachycardia was reduced 26. 1 +/- 2. 7 % by propranolol and this was {{not significantly different from}} the reduction by <b>practolol</b> (21. 2 +/- 1. 9 %). Propranolol attenuated the isoprenaline tachycardia (dose ratio 43. 7) and after atropinisation the dose ratio was not significantly altered (41. 1). <b>Practolol</b> also attenuated the isoprenaline tachycardia (dose ratio 4. 4) but after atropinisation the dose ratio was significantly increased to 8. 8, though this remained significantly less than the dose ratio for propranolol. At a heart rate increase of 25 beats/min, the isoprenaline-induced control fall in mean blood pressure was 9 - 11 mm Hg. After propranolol administration this fall was converted to a small increase of + 2. 3 +/- 1. 3 mm Hg. Following <b>practolol,</b> however, the mean blood pressure reduction was 19. 7 +/- 2. 9 mm Hg. <b>Practolol</b> did not significantly block the isoprenaline-induced fall in diastolic pressure. The difference in potency of propranolol and <b>practolol,</b> demonstrated by their effect on isoprenaline induced tachycardia at doses shown to have equal effects on exercise tachycardia, is contributed to but not fully explained by the reflex withdrawal of cardiac vagal tone which occurs with cardioselective but not non-selective antagonists...|$|E
