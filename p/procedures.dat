3000|$|The example {{presented}} above {{involved an}} easy choice because <b>Procedure</b> A yielded both a higher HR {{and a lower}} FAR than <b>Procedure</b> B. However, the issue becomes more complicated when the HR and FAR are both higher for one <b>procedure</b> than the other. For example, which <b>procedure</b> would be diagnostically superior if <b>Procedure</b> A yielded a HR of [...]. 80 and a FAR of [...]. 05, whereas <b>Procedure</b> B yielded a HR of [...]. 60 and a FAR of [...]. 02 ? The DR for <b>Procedure</b> B (. 60 /. 02 = 30) is higher than that for <b>Procedure</b> A (. 80 /. 05 = 16), so by that measure <b>Procedure</b> B would be preferred. However, this outcome would not actually identify <b>Procedure</b> B as being diagnostically superior. Why not? In brief, {{the reason is that}} {{it would be easy to}} selectively induce more conservative responding for <b>Procedure</b> A (e.g., using instructions that encourage a high degree of certainty before making an ID from the lineup), thereby lowering both the HR and the FAR for that <b>procedure.</b> Imagine that when conservative responding was encouraged for <b>Procedure</b> A, the HR dropped from [...]. 80 to [...]. 65 (still higher than <b>Procedure</b> B, with a HR of [...]. 60) and the FAR dropped from [...]. 05 to [...]. 02 (now equal to <b>Procedure</b> B). Under these conditions, <b>Procedure</b> A would clearly be the diagnostically superior <b>procedure.</b> Instead of switching from <b>Procedure</b> A to <b>Procedure</b> B to achieve a FAR as low as [...]. 02, it would make more sense to stick with <b>Procedure</b> A and to induce more conservative responding. In essence, that kind of comparison is what ROC analysis is all about, and it illustrates why ROC analysis is needed to unambiguously determine the diagnostically superior <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
