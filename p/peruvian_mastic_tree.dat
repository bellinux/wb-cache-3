40|$|WOS: 000392559300002 International audienceAmong the {{characteristic}} properties of timber from natural tree stands, {{particularly those in}} arid and semi-arid zones, variations in colour are decisive in the uses made of the wood as a high added-value visible material, in joinery and cabinet-making for example. This {{study was conducted to}} help promote the aesthetic value of a woody species which is common in Algeria but under-researched, the Mt. Atlas <b>mastic</b> <b>tree,</b> Pistacia atlantica Desf. Variations in wood colour were assessed from samples cut from the sapwood and heartwood of <b>mastic</b> <b>trees</b> from two different bioclimatic regions in north-western Algeria. The colour assessments were made at the Forest and Timber Resources Laboratory (LERFoB) in Nancy, France, using a spectrophotometer with measurement and display software. The results indicate variations between the two regions in the colour of Mt. Atlas <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> wood (for the three chromatic components L*, a* and b*) and among the different trees (component L*). The colorimetric components of the lighter-coloured sapwood, especially brightness (L*) and the red-green component (a*), are very different to those of the heartwood. From this we infer that environmental factors have an influence on the colorimetric characteristics of the wood in this species, as well as the intrinsic individual characteristics of each tree. Finally, brightness (L*) and the red-green (a*) and blue-yellow (b*) components vary between the different types of <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> wood...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Pistacia {{lentiscus}} L. (Anacardiaceae <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> or lentisk) is a bush {{playing an}} important role in the Mediterranean maquis ecosystem. For this purpose, a study on different accessions of <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> was carried out in Southern Italy to define the variability of characters related to morphology and survival under salt stress conditions. Methodology: This was study evaluated under nursery conditions the growing responses of 10 accessions of P. lentiscusto 6 different levels of salinization obtained by adding 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 g of salts 100 L- 1 of substrate, respectively. The following parameters were recorded; plant height, survival of plants and total root length, total biomass, number of leaves per plant and leaf area. Results: The results showed that P. lentiscuscan well tolerate salt at high concentrations when grown under nursery conditions. Furthermore, among the investigated germplasm, a different plant accessions response to salt stress was observed. Conclusion: Thus, by identifying of <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> accessions more tolerant to salty soil and the revegetation of degraded agricultural lands can be attained...|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally {{there has}} also been limited {{production}} of mastic on the Çeşme peninsula, on the Turkish coast only eight nautical miles from Chios, with similar ecological conditions suitable for mastic production. [...] The Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion, for Reforestation and the Protection of Natural Habitats TEMA has been leading a project to protect the native <b>mastic</b> <b>trees</b> and to plant new ones in Çeşme peninsula to revive viable commercial production. As part of this project, which is expected to last through 2016, over 3,000 <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> saplings were planted between 2008 and October 2011 to over 368 acres (149 hectares) of dedicated farm land provided by the Izmir Institute of Technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to provide a database through phytoclimatic-indicators such as wild olive and <b>mastic</b> <b>tree,</b> to define a tested starting condition, structured on the basis of ecological and geopedological parameters and climate. Climate change leads to an alteration in the balance of ecosystems resulting in increased vulnerability and a consequent loss of biodiversity (Bullock et al., 1996). The lack of data sometimes leads to use of theoretical models that are checked as to compliance with the actual field conditions and the resulting management actions. Because of this it is necessary to identify the species of reference. Wild olive and <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistacia lentiscus and Olea europaea var. sylvestris) are characteristic indicators of the thermophilic range of Mediterranean plants (Arrigoni, 1968) and are closely associated with each other; these species are representative in function of environmental parameters such as geological substrate and soil, climatic factors and human impact. Sample areas have been identified for research purposes, according to specific criteria selected to determine the altitudinal limits of both species and their distribution. The results provide indications on the distribution of <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> and wild olive and the relationship that exists with the geopedological, climatic and anthropogenic characteristics and ecology. Assuming an increase of 2 °C, the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> and the wild olive would expand to most of Sardinian territories up to 900 m in elevation, possibly 1100 m in the southern slopes of sandstone areas. Thus, the vegetation takes in general a thermoxerophilic characters, while the mesophilic vetetation that nowadays occupies the 600 - 900 altitude belt. Important consequences are also expected on human activities...|$|R

On the summit there is red lavender and Kermes oak. These take over from the communities of holm oak which dominate the more protected areas with deeper soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of mastika usually starts with an alcoholic base made from fermented fruit (usually grapes), which is double distilled and then {{filtered through the}} roots of the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree.</b> The alcohol can also be flavoured with the resin of the tree to give the alcoholic drink its distinctive pine-like taste.|$|R
50|$|This area is {{well known}} for the {{production}} of mastic, from which it derives its name.

5000|$|Chios Mastiha is {{a variant}} of mastic which has a {{protected}} designation of origin status in the European Union. [...] The main flavourings used in Chios Mastiha liqueur, mastic distillate and mastic oil, are wholly derived from PDO-certified Chios mastic.Mastic is harvested from the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistachia lentiscus var. chia), a small evergreen shrub that grows to about two to three meters on rocky terrain on {{the southern part of the}} island of Chios. This tree takes fifty years to reach maturity, and can be harvested for mastic from its fifth year onwards. Although the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> can be found around the Mediterranean Sea, the variety that produces the aromatic mastic sap only grows in the southern part of Chios. Chios mastic has also been certified by the Agricultural Products Certification and Supervision Organization as part of the Hellenic Ministry of Rural Development and Food.|$|R

40|$|Weed {{control is}} {{essential}} for a successful establishment and growth of tree seedlings in former agricultural land. Weed control methods are effective but can be costly in terms of time, damage to nontarget vegetation, or increased soil erosion. Alternatively, some living mulches can exclude undesirable vegetation, protect the soil, compete minimally with associated trees, and supplement soil nitrogen, {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge on living mulch systems in Mediterranean afforestation. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects on Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistacia lentiscus L.), wild olive (Olea europaea L. var. sylvestris Brot.) and terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus L.) seedlings of wrinkled medick (Medicago rugosa Desr.) mulch. Survival, growth, photosynthesis, foliar nutrient and soil parameters were measured during the first year. 36 months after planting, seedlings in the living mulch had survival rates of between 60 % for <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> and 8. 3 % for Holm oak, compared with survival rates of 70 % in the mechanical treatment for <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> and 2 % for Holm oak. Photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations were improved by the living mulch treatment. The soil under the living mulch had higher CEC, soil organic matter levels and nitrogen content in comparison to the cultivated soil. The response of living mulch differs between species and environmental conditions but our study suggests a positive effect due to soil protection. Living mulch may be a promise alternative for use in Mediterranean afforestation programs.

50|$|Mastic is {{a natural}} resin that runs down when a <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistacia lentiscus) is cut. Originally mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, {{resulting}} in producing translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright natural white and opaque gummy substance. The flavour is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing, Mediterranean-maple-syrup-like flavour, however it has a stickier texture than maple syrup.|$|R
25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is {{believed}} to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Aztec, as well as the ancient Maya before them, used chicle, a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>Mastic</b> gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and {{is believed to have been}} used to maintain oral health. Both chicle and <b>mastic</b> are <b>tree</b> resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.|$|R
5000|$|The aromatic, ivory-coloured resin, {{also known}} as mastic, is {{harvested}} as a spice from the cultivated <b>mastic</b> <b>trees</b> grown {{in the south of}} the Greek island of Chios in the Aegean Sea, where it is also known by the name [...] "Chios tears". Originally liquid, it is hardened, when the weather turns cold, into drops or patties of hard, brittle, translucent resin.

40|$|Pistacia {{lentiscus}} (Anacardiaceae; <b>mastic</b> <b>tree)</b> is an evergreen sclerophyll species, largely {{distributed in}} dry {{areas of the}} Mediterranean basin and well-adapted to severe conditions of drought in very unfertile soils. In the present study, we evaluated the growing responses of two accessions of P. lentiscus to three different levels of salinity under nursery conditions. The two <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> accessions (Manfredonia and Specchia) were collected from individual trees in two different sites in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) and subjected to three different levels of salinization by adding 0, 400, and 800 g of salts 100 L− 1 of substrate, respectively. The following parameters were recorded: plant height; survival of plants and total root length; total biomass; number of leaves per plant and leaf area; as well as various ecophysiological traits. Salinity reduced the values of all the examined parameters, both morphological and physiological. Results suggested that P. lentiscus can tolerate and accumulate salt at high concentrations in nursery conditions. As a result, {{it is important to}} identify germplasm that is highly tolerant to salinity for the production of nursery seedlings that will be planted in saline soils...|$|R

40|$|The {{retardation}} {{properties of}} diammonium phosphate (DAP), ammonium sulfate (AS) and {{a mixture of}} hun-tite/hydromagnesite minerals were studied on particle foliar combustion of Pistacia lentiscus L. (<b>Mastic</b> <b>tree)</b> collected from wildland/urban zones near Athens. Two methods were employed for this study. The first is thermal analysis (TG, DTG, SDTA), that uses samples of 15 - 17 mg under oxygen atmosphere conditions to favour complete combustion. The second is a laboratory-scale method (similar to the one described by the 79 / 831 European Commission Directive for testing relative self ignition properties of solid materials), that uses samples of 2. 5 g under static air conditions and low heating rate to ensure smoldering combustion. Both methods concluded that DAP and AS are the most effective retardants, with each presenting better performance at different properties, while the minerals are the least efficient ones. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
