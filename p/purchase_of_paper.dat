50|$|There {{are three}} general {{categories}} of casino games: table games, electronic gaming machines, and random number ticket games such as Keno and simulated racing. Gaming machines, such as slot machines and pachinko, are usually played by one player {{at a time}} and do not require the involvement of casino employees to play. Random number games are based upon the selection of random numbers, either from a computerized random number generator or from other gaming equipment. Random number games may be played at a table, such as roulette, or through the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> tickets or cards, such as keno or bingo.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this time}} Father Robert Persons, SJ and Edmund Campion were {{preparing}} for a vigorous propaganda through the press. With the assistance {{of several of the}} old Marian priests, Persons procured from the elder Brooks, owner of a large house called Greenstreet, at East Ham, Essex, then five miles from London, permission for certain gentleman to lodge there. To this house, chiefly with the assistance of Brinkley, Persons conveyed a printing press and materials. Brinkley's seven workman appeared in public with fine clothes and horses, to avert suspicion. The parson and churchwardens urged the newly arrived gentlemen to attend services; an incautious <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> almost gave a clue to the discovery of the press, and a servant of Brinkley's was caught and racked.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{additional}} paper size, 8 × 10+1/ 2 in, to which the name Government-Letter was given by the IEEE Printer Working Group (PWG). It was prescribed by Herbert Hoover when he was Secretary of Commerce {{to be used for}} US government forms, apparently to enable discounts from the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> for schools, but more likely due to the standard use of trimming books (after binding) and paper from the standard letter size paper to produce consistency and allow [...] "bleed" [...] printing. In later years, as photocopy machines proliferated, citizens wanted to make photocopies of the forms, but the machines did not generally have this size paper in their bins. Ronald Reagan therefore had the US government switch to regular Letter size, which is both half an inch longer and wider. The former government size is still commonly used in spiral-bound notebooks, for children's writing and the like, a result of trimming from the current Letter dimensions.|$|E

50|$|The {{monetary}} value of assets, goods, and services sold {{during the year}} could be grossly estimated using nominal GDP back in the 1960s.

Originally started as an oil production and refining {{firm in the}} first half of the twentieth century, Koch now has major operations in petroleum, chemicals, energy, fibers and polymers, minerals, fertilizers, chemical technology equipment, forest and consumer products, ranching, trading, and securities and finance. The company, based in Wichita, Kansas, employs 80, 000 people in sixty countries worldwide. Koch’s oil operations are run primarily through the Flint Hills Resources family of subsidiaries, which has a production capacity of about 800, 000 barrels of crude oil daily. Another one of Koch’s major ventures, synthetic textiles, operates through the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, INVISTA, which produces both consumer and commodity textiles. Koch’s newest project, forest and consumer products, operates through Georgia-Pacific, which remains an independent but wholly-owned subsidiary of Koch Industries...|$|E
40|$|Gone are {{the days}} of {{strictly}} paper reports. Increasingly we are being asked to render our tables and reports using a variety of electronic file types that can be browsed and read using our computers. Besides the cost savings associated with the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> paperless reports also minimize the costs associated with the printing and distribution of the reports. Another, often overlooked and potentially more important, side benefit of the paperless report is the increased availability of linked graphs, reports and tables. Navigation of the paper report is dependent on the table of contents, a strong index, and visual aids such as captions and footnotes; however in paperless reports we can easily jump from one table to its supporting and dependent tables with the click of a mouse. Easily, that is, if we have created the necessary links. Within PROC REPORT {{and with the help of}} the Output Delivery System, there are a number of techniques that we can use to build and maintain these links. Individually these techniques are not complicated, however we do need to be aware of the syntax, alternative approaches, and issues associated with the automation of the process that coordinates the links between tables...|$|E
