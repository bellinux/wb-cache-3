40|$|We present here petrological and geochemical data on volcanics {{cropping}} out {{in southern}} and northeastern {{walls of the}} Valle del Bove (Mt. Etna), belonging to the Rocche, Serra Giannicola Grande and Canalone della Montagnola Units. These units constitute the remnants of several volcanoes that were active in the time span 102 - 80 ka, i. e. before {{the growth of the}} Ellittico-Mongibello strato-volcano. Their <b>products,</b> <b>range</b> in <b>composition</b> from hawaiites to benmoreites. Amphibole (kaersutite) is present as phenocryst in all the studied rocks, and commonly shows breakdown coronas of rhönite ± clinopyroxene and plagioclase formed during magma ascent. Nevertheless, in mafic rocks, amphibole occurs as an early liquidus phase enclosed in a Ca-rich plagioclase (up to An 87). We propose that early cotectic crystallization of amphibole and Caplagioclase may reflect H 2 O-rich melts. Variations in major and trace elements among lavas erupted from coeval centres, suggest that fractional crystallization was the principal evolutionary process {{but at the same time}} magmas feeding the various volcanoes belonging to the Rocche Unit were more heterogeneous with respect to the younger Units studied here...|$|R
40|$|The late Hercynian dyke {{magmatic rocks}} of Sardinia {{develops}} in two main stages, with different compositional and tectono-magmatic features, one preceding {{and the other}} following Permian volcanism. The first stage which is present all throughout the island – is represented by orogenic type <b>products</b> <b>ranging</b> in <b>composition</b> from basaltic andesites to ryolites and peraluminous rhyolites. These were erupted during two phases one Carboniferous, and the other Permian in age. In the successive late Permian stage basaltic products are dominant. These are mostly transitional, from mildly sodic to mildly potassic, and are associated with subalkaline tholeitic rocks, {{in the vicinity of}} shear zones in the northen part of the island. Scarce peraluminous rhyolites are also found in the late Permian stage. Sach a varied geographycal distribution of basaltic types seems to be linked to the different crustal thinning of the northern and central southern parts of the island. The REE patterns and the values of the initial Sr isotopic ratio make it possible to differentiate the contamination phenomena present in the magma source zones from those accompanying the ascent, and hence the evolution of the melts. In the calcalkaline orogenic suite two groups of rocks with different values of REE and initial Sr isotopic ratio have been identified, these {{can be traced back to}} the difference in composition of the source zone...|$|R
40|$|The Averno 2 {{eruption}} (3, 700 ± 50 a B. P.) was {{an explosive}} low-magnitude event characterized by magmatic and phreatomagmatic explosions, generating mainly fall and surge beds, respectively. It {{occurred in the}} Western sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campanian Region, South Italy) {{at the intersection of}} two active fault systems, oriented NE and NW. The morphologically complex crater area, largely filled by the Averno lake, resulted from vent activation and migration along the NE-trending fault system. The eruption generated a complex sequence of pyroclastic deposits, including pumice fall deposits in the lower portion, and prevailing surge beds in the intermediate-upper portion. The pyroclastic sequence has been studied through stratigraphical, morphostructural and petrological investigations, and sub- divided into three members named A through C. Member A was emplaced during {{the first phase of the}} eruption mainly by magmatic explosions which generated columns reaching a maximum height of 10 km. During this phase the eruption reached its climax with a mass discharge rate of 3. 2 106 kg/s. Intense fracturing and fault activation favored entry of a significant amount of water into the system, which produced explosions driven by variably efficient water-magma inter- action. These explosions generated wet to dry surge deposits that emplaced Member B and C, respectively. Isopachs and isopleths maps, as well as areal distribution of ballistic fragments and facies variation of surge deposits allow definition of four vents that opened along a NE oriented, 2 km long fissure. The total volume of magma extruded during the eruption has been estimated at about 0. 07 km 3 (DRE). The erupted <b>products</b> <b>range</b> in <b>composition</b> from initial, weakly peralkaline alkali-trachyte, to last-emplaced alkali-trachyte. Isotopic data and modeling suggest that mixing occurred during the Averno 2 eruption between a more evolved, less radiogenic stored magma, and a les...|$|R
