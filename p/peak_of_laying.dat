40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on four groups of Hy-Line var. Brown hens (n = 350 each) monitored from 20 to 68 weeks of age. The hens were fed on diets which provided the following calcium intakes (%) : 2. 56 and 3. 12 in groups I and II, respectively, 3. 86 in control and 4. 22 in group III. The shell weight increased during the laying period proportionally to the ingested calcium. The thickness of the eggshell decreased: the decrease was higher in the groups which ingested less calcium. The eggshell strength increased from 20 to 36 weeks of age in all the hen groups. Further, the eggshell strength decreased from 36 to 68 weeks of age. These decreases were higher {{as the amount of}} calcium intake increased. In conclusion, calcium diet influences on eggshell properties are age-dependent and more pronounced at the <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> period. The increase in diet calcium content from 3. 86 to 4. 22 % has less and negative influences on the physical properties of the eggshell...|$|E

Data from this and other studies are used in consideration of certain aspects of the ecology of the species during the breeding season. There were two main areas of study, the mainland (Ross Back Sands, Old Law and Badle Bay) and the island (Lindisfarne). Territories were taken up earlier on the mainland. There was a fall in the. number of territories occupied in 1979, compared to previous years. There is good evidence for site tenacity, with many pairs occupying the same or an adjacent territory year after year. The minimum length of territory occupancy ranged from 15 to more than 94 days. The first egg of 1979 was laid on 2 May. The clutches were of 3 or 4 eggs. The <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> and the amount of laying per pair varies from year to-year. The final clutch of 1979 was recorded on 18 July. The interval between territory uptake and the laying of the first egg was longer, the earlier the territory was established. 85 % of eggs noted were predated in 1979. The major agent of egg predation was crows. The period of hatching lasts from May to August, The incubation period is usually from 22 to 26 days. The fledging success of 1979 was between 5. 8 and 12. 57 % of eggs laid. The birds {{spend most of their time}} feeding on the drier areas of the beach.

40|$|Alternative housing {{systems for}} hen eggs {{production}} represents {{clear evidence of}} the trend in animal housing and husbandry towards extensive rearing methods. Consumer demand is oriented towards healthy foods controlled not only under a safety point of view, but also under a welfare assessment of the animals’ living conditions. Among the different alternative systems deep litter and organic production {{in recent years have}} been improved in Italy. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different housing systems (barn B and organic O) for laying hens may influence productive performance, fear responses and egg quality characteristics. A total of 4, 745 birds were housed in the B system and 2, 016 in the O system, both of which were commercial facilities. In each system the same strain (Hy-Line Brown) was housed and layer performance, external and internal egg characteristics, mortality and feed consumption were recorded weekly. Animal reactivity was recorded monthly with the approaching test. Moreover, the Tonic Immobility test was conducted at 70 weeks of age; feather and foot pad conditions were also investigated at the same time. The <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> was reached in both housing systems at 25 weeks of age and was higher in organic hens (94. 5 %) than in barn hens (93. 0 %). Feed conversion rate during the overall laying period was 2. 36 vs 2. 20, respectively, in O and B housing systems. There was a significant difference concerning the eggs classified as very dirty, dirty and cracked between the two systems. The dirty eggs were higher in O system probably due to laying eggs in a free range area, while the higher number of cracked eggs in B system may be due to a significantly less shell thickness in this system. Egg weight increased with layer age in both housing systems. Animals reared in O system showed less fearfulness than in B emphasised by the approaching and Tonic Immobility test results. Feather scoring did not evidence any severe plumage damage; statistical analysis showed some significant differences in comb and back areas between O and B systems. The hens reared on litter showed more aggressive pecking than the organic hens probably due to difference both in light intensity and in density...|$|E

The aim of this PhD study was to investigate animal welfare in organic egg production in Denmark, with emphasis on mortality and helminth infections. The specific hypothesis in the PhD study were i) helminth infections (Ascaridia galli and Heterakis sp.) increase the mortality rate at <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> (observational event study, Paper I), ii) helminth infections (Ascaridia galli and Heterakis sp.) diagnosed at end <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> can be predicted by at least one clinical welfare indicator diagnosed at <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> and end <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> (longitudinal study, Paper II).

Average number of day-old chicks received at a broiler breeder farm was 19076. 29, out of which 16449. 08 birds attained sexual maturity and were housed in laying houses. Total hens housed represented 14037. 32 females and 1559. 70 males (a male to female ratio of 1 : 9). Reserved male stock (852. 06 birds) was 5. 18 % of the total population. Average mortality during 323. 46 days of growth and production period was 13. 77 %, representing 2. 97, 4. 99 and 5. 81 % mortality during brooding, growing and laying periods, respectively. Average age at point-of-lay, age at peak-of-lay and egg laying period were 164. 67, 232. 83 and 155. 46 days. Age at point-of-lay (r = 0. 227) and age at peak-of-lay (r = 0. 333) were found positively but non-significantly correlated with total mortality in a flock. On the other hand flock size was found negatively correlated with age at point (r = - 0. 052) and age at peak-of lay (r = - 0. 415; p< 0. 04). Egg laying period was found negatively but non-significantly correlated with flock size (r = - 0. 147) and positively correlated with total mortality in a flock (r = 0. 255). Egg laying period was found positively and significantly (P< 0. 027) associated with percent lay (b = 5. 770). Average peak percent lay and percent lay was 83. 09 and 59. 67 %, respectively. Percent lay was found non-significantly and positively correlated with flock size (r= 0. 184) and mortality (= 0. 085). Similar findings were observed for peak percent lay. Percent lay was found positively and significantly (P< 0. 033) associated with peak percent lay (b = 0. 625).

Two genotypes, a standard (S) and an experimental dwarf broiler breeder (E), were fed ad libitum (SA and EA, respectively), restricted at 55 % of ad libitum feed intake (intermediate restriction) from 6 to 15 wk of age (SI and El, respectively), or restricted (SR and ER, respectively) to match a standard growth curve with a diluted mash feed (2, 400 kcal/kg). The experiment was repeated at 2 locations (experiment I = 672 hens in pens from 0 to 40 wk; experiment 2 = 420 hens in pens and cages from 0 to 53 wk). Feed restriction reduced adult BW by 20 %, compared with ad libitum feeding, delayed sexual maturity by 2 to 4 wk, and improved livability. Hens fed the intermediate diet immediately compensated after 15 wk of age to reach BW, sexual maturity, and livability close {{to those of}} ad libitum-fed hens. The E genotype exhibited better tolerance to ad libitum feeding than the S genotype in all measured aspects.

40|$|The {{timing of}} {{breeding}} can strongly influence individual breeding performance and fitness. Seasonal declines in breeding parameters have been often documented in birds, {{particularly in the}} Northern Hemisphere. Fewer studies have investigated whether seasonal declines in productivity vary in space, which would have implications for a species' population dynamics across its distributional range. We report here on variation in the timing of breeding in the Black Harrier (Circus maurus), an endangered and endemic raptor to Southern Africa. We investigated how key breeding parameters (clutch size, nesting success and productivity) varied with the timing of breeding, weather conditions (rainfall and temperature) and between contrasted regions (coastal vs. interior-mountain). Black Harrier onset of breeding extended over an 8 -month period, with a <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> between mid-August and end of September. We show a marked seasonal decline in all breeding parameters. Importantly, for clutch size and productivity these seasonal declines differed regionally, being more pronounced in interior-mountain than in coastal regions, where the breeding season was overall shorter. Timing of breeding, clutch size and productivity were also partly explained by weather conditions. In coastal regions, where environmental conditions, in particular rainfall, appear to be less variable, the timing of breeding matters less for breeding output than in interior-mountain regions, and breeding attempts thus occurred over a longer period. The former areas may act as population sources and be key in protecting the long-Term population viability of this threatened endemic raptor. This study provides unique evidence for a regionally variable seasonal decline in breeding performance with implications for population biology and conservation.

To show how the different parameters of clutch formation affect the daily energy investment peak, we performed a simulation analysis in which the rapid yolk development (RYD) period, the follicle triggering interval (FTI), the laying interval (LI) and the albumen synthesis period (ASP) were allowed to vary simultaneously. In our sample, the mean RYD period was seven days with a range from six to eight days. There {{were no significant differences in}} yolk volume among eggs in a clutch, but albumen volume was significantly smaller in third eggs. According to our model the albumen synthesis of the a-egg coincides with the energy demand peak for clutch formation. This peak represents an increase by ca. 42 % in female energy requirements. Values obtained from the simulation analysis showed that only the ASP of the a-egg and the RYD durations of the second and third follicles produced noticeable reductions in peak energy investment. We predict that in gulls, whose laying intervals seem to be kept constant, significant increases of the durations of the RYD periods of second and third eggs, or even significant reductions of yolk size of these eggs, may operate simultaneously to match the energy demands during clutch formation to the prevailing food conditions.

This study aimed to: 1) determine factors that influence egg production, 2) knowing revenues laying hens, 3) knowing feasibility <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> hens. Subjects in this study were laying poultry Farm Harma at Banjarharjo, Sleman. Data in this research obtained through observation, interviews, and recording. Used analysis: 1) analysis of Factors Affecting Production <b>of</b> Livestock <b>Laying</b> Chickens used Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, 2) Analysis of revenues, and 3) analysis <b>of</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> hens used analysis of R/C. Results: 1) factors of production which includes amount of labor, housing, medicines, seeds, and feed together affect production <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> hens.

40|$|ABSTRACT Data from inbred lines, one (D) {{selected}} for part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> {{and the other}} (C) un{{selected for}} any trait, were analyzed. After 19 generations of continuous full sib matings, the C line showed significant decreases in part record egg number, 32 -week egg weight, shell thickness, full record egg number and part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> but nonsignificant decreases in hatchability, full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> and laying house mortality. Age at first egg, Haugh unit and mature body weight showed significant increases in this line. The D line {{was similar to the}} C line in its response to the same intensity of inbreeding for all traits except full record egg number, part record rate, and fertility, each of which showed a significant decrease, and Haugh unit and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> which showed nonsignificant increases. Results indicated that the small advantages selection conferred on the inbred line in part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> (the selection criterion), full record egg number, and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> were ac-companied by undesirable changes in other traits, resulting in later sexual maturity, larger body weight, lower Haugh unit, fertility, and hatchability compared with the unselected line...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the age of ostriches and month <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> on egg production and chick growth. On a small ostrich farm egg production, egg incubation and chick growth from hatching to 56 days of age were recorded from 2000, when the breeders were 5 years old, until 2002. Ostriches were kept in groups and fed commercial feed. In all, 568 eggs were laid and weighed at laying and during incubation (at 15 th and 30 th day of incubation), while 353 chicks were weighed at hatching, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days of age. The female’s productivity was calculated assuming a <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> 3. 5 eggs per week and ranged between 45 % and 48 %. The fertility was around 70 % with a <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> 74 % recorded in 2001. The hatchability of all eggs was higher than 62 % with a <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> 72 % in 2001, while the hatchability of fertile eggs was higher than 90 %. In each year the number of eggs laid increased from March to July, productivity showed a positive trend from May to June, while the fertility and hatchability of all eggs, as well as fertile eggs, was unaffected by year and month. As the hens aged, the egg mass grew constantly with an increase of about 8 %. During the first 30 days of incubation the egg weight decreased with the percentages of weight loss around 10. 0 %. At hatching, the weight of chick ranged between 765 g and 847 g, respectively, in 2000 and 2002. Egg weight influenced the hatching weight showing a linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 84). The effect of egg weight on the chick weight decreased as the chick grew. At 56 days of age, only the effect of year is significant. The month <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> did not demonstrate any effect on chicken weight...|$|R
