25|$|I {{know that}} some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about {{the legitimacy of the}} dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> killed, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|International {{music was}} chosen as the primary music style of Strange Days due to its variety of sounds and instruments. According to music {{supervisor}} Randy Gerston, who previously worked on True Lies, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that [...] "the world is shrinking and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular." [...] Musicians featured on the soundtrack also included French duo Deep Forest, British trip hop artist Tricky, and British alternative rock band Skunk Anansie. The latter was encouraged to jam between takes at the film's New Year event so that Bigelow could record them live and give the rave a greater authenticity. Although the band would have a live sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync. A soundtrack album was released shortly before the film's opening. In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, was made available only through the [...] "College Special" [...] issue of Rolling Stone magazine that was sold at record stores.|$|E
