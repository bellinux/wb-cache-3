40|$|AbstractComposites {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with another material to form a multi-material stack-up, which results in greater strength to weight ratios. In a wide range of aerospace applications dissimilar material stack-ups of composites and aluminium and/or titanium are used. Drilling is probably the most common machining operation applied to composites since components made out of composite materials are usually near net shaped and require only holes for assembly integration. In this investigation, experiments were conducted by varying the drilling parameters and determining the optimum cutting conditions for drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique. Tool wear study was performed by drilling 100 holes each with 118 ° and 130 ° point angle drills.

40|$|Citing the {{inability}} of conventional human rights thinking to address the ‘strong’ questions raised by our times, this article pursues a twofold objective: to identify the major challenges that the rise of political theologies {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth-first century posed to human rights; and second, to select within a broad landscape of theological analysis the types of reflections and practices that might contribute to expand and deepen the canon of human rights politics. In order to achieve this double goal the article uses complexity as its main analytical guideline making distinctions from which significant consequences were drawn: on one side, distinctions among different types of political theologies (pluralist versus revelationist, traditionalist versus progressive); and, on the other, between two contrasting discourses and practices of human rights politics (hegemonic versus counter-hegemonic). Depending on the circumstances, even conventional or hegemonic human rights struggles may be a <b>progressive</b> <b>tool</b> against social practices and norms derived from traditionalist and revelationist theologies.

40|$|Tool failure {{remains one}} of the most {{challenging}} phenomena in machining that affects the productivity and product quality, and hence the cost. In high feed rough milling operations of hard-to-cut materials, chipping and breakage have been observed as the dominant failure modes of the end mill cutters. Most of the work in the open literature is focusing on either detecting the complete tool breakage after it takes place or detecting the <b>progressive</b> <b>tool</b> wear. Detecting the abrupt/sudden tool failure due to tool chipping before it takes place, which is essential to avoid any damage to the machined part, has not been addressed. Therefore, the main objective of this research work is to investigate the ability of using the process monitoring signals in order to detect the tool pre-failure and failure by chipping/breakage in intermittent cutting operations. A method was devised to induce impact load on the cutting tool tip to study the features of signals collected by various sensors due to unstable crack propagation and chipping, while ensuring minimal tool wear effect. The acoustic emission (AE) signal features were able to successfully capture tool pre-failure, while other signals could detect the failure occurrence only.
