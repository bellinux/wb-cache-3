5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division {{to land on}} two beach sectors—Mike and Nan—focusing on Courseulles, Bernières and Saint-Aubin. It {{was hoped}} that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up the beach defences and destroy coastal strong points. Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Once the landing zones were secured, the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland, the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold. The 3rd Canadian Division's D-Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen–Bayeux railway line by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891.

In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

Other major parts of the spending <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the formation of two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form {{the core of a}} new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government.

It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E

5|$|Most {{notably the}} Saigon junta opposed US {{proposals}} to escalate {{the war with}} a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam, as advocated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. This <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the use of American resources badged as South Vietnamese. This was objected to {{on the grounds that}} it would lose moral capital for Saigon as they promoted their cause as just and compatible with the physical safety of fellow Vietnamese, as well as fears that it would provoke a communist land invasion from the north.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} <b>plan,</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{the capture}} of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the Soviet Air Force on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using blitzkrieg tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, Army Group South took control of Ukraine, and Army Group Center advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Center crossed the Dnieper River, {{on the path to}} Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The POSTERN <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the 7th Division {{to move in}} {{transports}} to Port Moresby and {{in coastal}} shipping {{to the mouth of}} the Lakekamu River. It would travel up the river in barges to Bulldog, and in trucks over the Bulldog Road to Wau and Bulolo. From there it would march overland via the Watut and Wampit Valleys to the Markham River, cross the Markham River with the aid of paratroops, and secure an airfield site. There were a number of suitable airfield sites in the Markham Valley; Blamey selected Nadzab as the most promising.|$|E

5|$|The {{month of}} August 1943 {{was used by}} the 45th Division for some rest and planning. Seven plans for the {{invasion}} of Italy were put on the table, and three of them were adopted, of which the British had two (Operation Baytown and Operation Slapstick) and the Americans had one, called Operation Avalanche. The 45th Division would be under Major General Ernest J. Dawley's U.S. VI Corps, within the U.S. Fifth Army commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the landing of the Allied forces in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy, about 200 miles north of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the majority of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|As little {{opposition}} was expected at Morotai, Allied planners decided {{to land the}} invasion force close to the airfield sites on the Doroeba Plain. Two beaches in the south-west coast of the island were selected as suitable landing sites, and were designated Red Beach and White Beach. The Allied <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> all three infantry regiments of the 31st Division to be landed across these beaches on 15 September and swiftly drive inland to secure the plain. As Morotai's interior had no military value, the Allies {{did not intend to}} advance beyond a perimeter needed to defend the airfields. Planning for the construction of airfields and other base installations was also conducted prior to the landing, and tentative locations for these facilities had been selected by 15 September.|$|E

5|$|By 1992, York Region {{was moving}} forward with plans to expand Green Lane into a four lane road, while the {{province}} was urged to consider extending Highway404 north to it, and eventually around {{the east side of}} Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an extension of Highway404 north to Green Lane, and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive outside town, to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{diplomatic}} {{pressure on}} 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, {{to allow the}} Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters to transit to the Aegean Sea. A complaint to the Turkish government emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E
