25|$|The state's {{high point}} is Eagle Mountain at 2,301feet (701m), {{which is only}} 13miles (20.9km) away from the low of 602feet (183m) at the shore of Lake Superior. Notwithstanding {{dramatic}} local differences in elevation, much {{of the state is}} a gently rolling <b>peneplain.</b>|$|E
25|$|The plateau is drained by the Godavari River {{taking a}} southeasterly course; by the Krishna River, which divides the <b>peneplain</b> into two regions; {{and by the}} Pennai Aaru River flowing in a northerly direction. The plateau's forests are moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and {{tropical}} thorn.|$|E
25|$|The {{bedrock of}} the park is of granite and {{granitic}} gneiss, and dates from {{the formation of the}} Svecofennids, a mountain chain formed between 1750 and 2500 million years ago. It underwent a long erosion, leading 600 million years ago to that which one calls the Precambrian <b>peneplain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} of some <b>peneplains,</b> and peneplanation as a geomorphological process, {{is not without}} controversy, {{due to a lack}} of contemporary examples and uncertainty in identifying relic examples By some definitions, <b>peneplains</b> grade down to a base level represented by sea level, yet in other definitions such a condition is ignored. A common misconception about <b>peneplains</b> is that they ought to be so plain they are featureless.|$|R
50|$|Isostatic {{movements}} {{during the}} Plio-Quaternary at the northeastern {{edge of the}} Aquitaine basin lead to an uplift and rejuvenation of the <b>peneplained</b> basement in the Massif Central. In the Aquitaine basin itself, these movements follow already existing basement structures and entrain the tilting {{of some of the}} pliocene <b>peneplains.</b> This in turn has a strong effect upon the hydrographic network, for example in the drainage basins of the Garonne and Adour, the rivers' courses were changed or entirely abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{adjacent}} physiographic provinces, {{a large part}} of the New England province was <b>peneplained</b> during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, then uplifted, extensively dissected, and finally glaciated.|$|R
25|$|Caille {{is built}} on a rocky outcrop in a glacial <b>peneplain.</b> Near to Bauroux, {{one of the major}} summits of the Alps, the village is {{surrounded}} by coniferous forests. Caille is constructed on an East-West axis along a single main street, which leads to the village of Andon, six kilometres away.|$|E
25|$|In the Paleogene period {{southern}} Sweden {{was at a}} {{lower position}} relative to sea level but was likely still above it as it was covered by sediments. Rivers flowing over the South Småland <b>peneplain</b> flowed also across Scania which {{was at the time}} covered by thick sediments. As the relative sea level sank and much of Scania lost its sedimentary cover antecedent rivers begun to incise the Söderåsen horst forming valleys. During deglaciation these valleys likely evacuated large amounts of melt-water. The relief of Scania's south-western landscape was formed by the accumulation of thick Quaternary sediments during the Quaternary glaciations.|$|E
25|$|The Malmesbury Group {{has been}} dated from between 830 and 980Mya, and was {{deformed}} during the Saldanian orogenic cycle, {{both before and}} during the granite intrusions of 630 to 500Mya, and there are minor intrusions which precede the granite. The base of this group has not been exposed. The basal rocks were eroded to a relatively featureless <b>peneplain</b> with exposed granites covering most of the peninsula south of Lion's Head and Devil's Peak. The Sea-Point contact zone, described by Charles Darwin is a well known region of metamorphic rocks formed by the (originally very hot) granite intrusion into the Malmesbury rocks.|$|E
50|$|The upland {{terraces}} {{and mountains}} consist mainly of quartzitic or sandstone rocks, with granitic rock in some areas.The lowland plains are recent, formerly flooded by lakes {{or by the}} sea.Most of the landscape is forest-covered rolling <b>peneplains</b> and floodplains.The undulating <b>peneplains</b> between the Caura and Paragua rivers hold low hills up to 500 m high.There are scattered upland areas of undulating plains, rounded hills, low mountains and Tepuis up to 1500 m high, and the lower slopes of the higher tepuis. Soils are mostly sandy and low in nutrients.|$|R

50|$|The {{notions of}} time, uplift, slope and {{drainage}} density {{evolution in the}} erosion cycle have been criticized. Further the validity of some whole concepts associated with the cycle of erosion have been questioned including stream grade, base level {{and most of all}} that of <b>peneplains.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Coast Mountains {{consist of}} a single uplifted mass. During the Pliocene period the Coast Mountains did not exist and a level <b>peneplain</b> {{extended}} to the sea. This mass was uplifted during the Miocene period. Rivers such as the Klinaklini River and Homathko River predate this uplift and due to erosion occurring faster than uplift, have continued to flow {{right up to the}} present day, directly across the axis of the range. The mountains flanking the Homathko River are the highest in the Coast Mountains, and include Mount Waddington west of the river in the Waddington Range and Mount Queen Bess east of the river, adjacent to the Homathko Icefield.|$|E
25|$|Topography {{is mostly}} gently {{rolling in the}} Springfield and Salem Plateaus, whereas the Saint Francois Mountains are more rugged. Although the Springfield formation's surface is {{primarily}} Mississippian limestone and chert, the Salem Plateau is older Ordovician dolostones, limestones, and sandstones. Both are rife with karst topography and form long, flat plains. The formations are separated by steep escarpments that dramatically interrupt the rolling hills. Although much of the Springfield Plateau has been denuded of the surface layers of the Boston Mountains, large remnants of these younger layers are present throughout {{the southern end of}} the formation, possibly suggesting a <b>peneplain</b> process. The Springfield Plateau drains through wide, mature streams ultimately feeding the White River.|$|E
25|$|The Wicklow Mountains are {{primarily}} composed of granite {{surrounded by an}} envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. The oldest rocks are the quartzites of the Bray Group that include Bray Head and the Little Sugar Loaf and Great Sugar Loaf mountains. These metamorphosed from sandstone deposited in the deep waters of the primeval Iapetus Ocean during the Cambrian period (542-488 million years ago). Layers of sediment continued to form slates and shales along the ocean floor mixed with volcanic rock pushed up as Iapetus began to shrink {{by the process of}} subduction during the Ordovician period (488-443 million years ago). These rocks now underlie the uplifted <b>peneplain</b> of the Vartry Plateau between the Bray Group and the main range.|$|E
50|$|Erosional plains {{have been}} leveled by various agents of {{denudation}} such as running water, rivers, wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them. Plain {{resulting from the}} action of these agents of denudation are called <b>peneplains</b> (almost plain) while plains formed from wind action are called pediplains.|$|R
50|$|Glaciation {{and other}} forces wore down {{the surface and}} created thick sandstone, conglomerate, and {{limestone}} deposits known as sparagmite. Numerous extensive areas called <b>peneplains,</b> whose relief has been largely eroded away, also were formed. Remains of these include the Hardanger Plateau—1,100 m above sea level—Europe's largest mountain plateau, covering about 6500 km2.|$|R
2500|$|A braided river, or braided channel, {{consists}} {{of a network of}} river channels separated by small and often temporary islands called braid bars or, in British usage, aits or eyots. Braided streams occur in rivers with high slope and/or large sediment load. Braided channels are also typical of environments that dramatically decrease channel depth, and consequently channel velocity, such as [...] river deltas, alluvial fans and <b>peneplains.</b>|$|R
25|$|The gross {{geography}} of Scania reflect more the preglacial development than the erosion and deposits {{caused by the}} Quaternary glaciers. In Swedish the word ås commonly refer to eskers but major landmarks in Scania like the Söderåsen are horsts formed by inversion tectonic activity along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone in the late Cretaceous. The Scanian horsts run in a north-west to south-east direction, marking the southwest border of Fennoscandia. Tectonic activity of the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone during the break-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs {{led to the formation}} of hundreds of small volcanoes in central Scania. Remnants of the volcanoes are still visible today. Paralell with volcanism a hilly <b>peneplain</b> formed in northeastern Scania due to weathering and erosion of the basement rocks. The kaolinite formed by this weathering can be observed at Ivö Klack. In the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous a sea level rise led to the complete drowning of Scania. Subsequently marine sediments burried old surfaces preserving the rocky shores and hilly terrain of the day.|$|E

50|$|Both {{types of}} {{mountains}} act as ”water towers”. Their high elevation brings about high precipitation and low evaporation, {{and the resulting}} surplus of water balance feeds large European rivers and other important water sources. Beside the mountains, large areas of Central Europe are occupied by highlands or <b>peneplains</b> of lower altitude (between 400 and 800 m) in which the surplus of annual water balance is less noticeable.|$|R

50|$|The Aquitaine Basin is, {{after the}} Paris Basin, {{the second largest}} Mesozoic and Cenozoic {{sedimentary}} basin in France, occupying {{a large part of}} the country's southwestern quadrant. Its surface area covers 66,000 km2 onshore. It formed on Variscan basement which was <b>peneplained</b> during the Permian and then started subsiding in the early Triassic. The basement is covered in the Parentis Basin and in the Subpyrenean Basin—both sub-basins of the main Aquitaine Basin—by 11,000 m of sediment.|$|R

2500|$|Twenty-seven {{hundred million}} years ago the Algoman orogeny formed {{mountains}}; these bare mountains eroded for several {{hundred million years}} to a broad level <b>peneplain.</b> A sea invaded central Minnesota and extended eastward through northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Sediments composed of quartz-rich sand were deposited along the shoreline of this sea; these were succeeded by thick iron-rich layers and eventually kilometers of mud and muddy sand.

50|$|The northwestern {{edge of the}} Massif Central near Rochechouart {{was struck}} during the latest Triassic Period (Rhaetian Stage) (about 202 million years ago) by a large meteorite, {{probably}} of the stony-iron type. The impact excavated a crater with a diameter of 20 kilometers in the <b>peneplained</b> basement rocks. Today the crater structure is almost completely eroded away, yet some suevites, several impact breccias, planar deformation features (PDFs), shatter cones and many local thrusts in the basement still document this event.|$|R

The site {{lies on the}} western ridge line of the Choconut Creek, part of the Susquehanna River Basin, {{a few hundred feet}} north of the New York - Pennsylvania border. The surrounding area is a product of significant glaciation that has removed any sharp relief of the hills seen in other unglaciated areas of the plateau. The tops of the hills in the area, including where the Observatory is located, approximate the level of a <b>peneplain</b> that was uplifted to form the plateau.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overlying}} Tonto Group {{is separated}} from the Dox Sandstone {{and the rest of}} folded and faulted Unkar Group by a prominent angular unconformity, {{which is part of the}} Great Unconformity. Typically, the surface of this unconformity is a remarkably flat, ancient erosional surface, often argued to be a <b>peneplain,</b> that cuts across units such as the Bass Formation, Hatakai Shale, and Dox Sandstone. Resistant beds within the Unkar Group, such as Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite, form ancient hills, called monadnocks, that rise as much as [...] high above this ancient plain. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group now cover most of these ancient monadnocks. However, a few of these monadnocks protrude up into the Bright Angel Shale. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments that accumulated during the marine transgression to form the Tonto Group.|$|E

40|$|During the Late Devonian, {{deposition}} in the Cantabrian Mountains was largely controlled by movements along faults. By way of intermitting subsidence {{of the area}} south of the Sabero-Gordón line and the connected progradation of the coast during the Frasnian and early Famennian, three regressive sequences were deposited. On account of these sequences the Nocedo Formation {{is divided into three}} units.
