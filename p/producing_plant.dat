5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. <b>Producing</b> <b>plant</b> ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} fossils of beetles known from this era, though the beetle fauna of the Paleocene is {{comparatively}} poorly investigated. In contrast, the knowledge on the Eocene beetle fauna is very good. The {{reason is the}} occurrence of fossil insects in amber and clay slate sediments. Amber is fossilized tree resin, that means it consists of fossilized organic compounds, not minerals. Different amber is distinguished by location, age and species of the resin <b>producing</b> <b>plant.</b> For the research on the Oligocene beetle fauna, Baltic and Dominican amber is most important. Even with the insect fossils record in general lacking, the most diverse deposit being from the Fur Formation, Denmark; including giant ants and primitive moths (Noctuidae).|$|E
25|$|Often in {{commercial}} farming, different breeds {{are used for}} rootstock, fruit bearing plants, and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, {{there is no guarantee}} that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time consuming. Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually. This is done by grafting the fruit <b>producing</b> <b>plant</b> onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.|$|E
