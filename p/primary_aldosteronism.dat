40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} fluorimetric method for the {{estimation}} of urinary aldosterone; to establish a normal range in 24 hour and overnight urine samples; and to investigate the use of overnight urines for detecting hyperaldosteronism. METHODS: Essential steps include hydrolysis of the 18 conjugate to release aldosterone and its oxidation with Benedict's solution, followed by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel and development of fluorescence on the plate with sulphuric acid. RESULTS: There was a linear correlation {{between the amount of}} aldosterone and the area under the peak on the chromatogram. The mean intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 4. 4 % and 6. 8 %, respectively. The mean aldosterone excretion in 67 adults was 15. 7 (SD 8. 1) nmol/ 24 hours. The mean overnight excretion in 65 adults was 2. 6 (1. 4) nmol/ 8 hours.

Results of diagnosis and treatment of 474 surgical and therapeutical patients were retrospectively studied. All patients were undergone screening of serum potassium, aldosteron-renin ratio, confirmation tests, multi-spiral computed tomography. Selective adrenal vein sampling was performed in 63 cases. Analysis of separate clinical and pathogenetic forms demonstrated the following sharing: idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia — 235 (49. 6 %), aldosteron-producing adenoma — 195 (41. 1 %), primary (unilateral) adrenal hyperplasia — 36 (7. 6 %), familial forms — 6 (1. 3 %) (including glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism — 4, FH II — 2), adrenocortical carcinoma — 2 (0. 4 %). 255 patients with primary hyperaldosteronism were operated by unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

40|$|Adrenal masses {{are more}} and more {{frequently}} detected by adrenal ultrasound, computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance carried out for a reason other than the suspicion of adrenal disease (incidentalomas). The findings of an incidentaloma still leaves many diagnostic and therapeutic questions open. We report the results of a multicentric retrospective evaluation of patients with adrenal incidentalomas, performed by a Study Group of the Italian Society of Endocrinology. According to the definition of incidentaloma, exclusion criteria a priori were: severe or paroxysmal hypertension, frank hypokalemia and clinical signs of hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism. 29 centers participated in the study and the data obtained by questionnaire were collected in 2 centers for final elaboration. Center 1 carried out the epidemiological and clinical evaluation. Basal and dynamic hormonal evaluation of 786 among the 1013 cases recruited were performed in our center (center 2). Functional studies included: diurnal rhythm of cortisol, urinary free cortisol (UFC), ACTH, DHEAS, 17 -OH progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, supine and upright plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone, urinary aldosterone, urinary catecholamines and VMA. The hormonal dynamic evaluation included the overnight dexamethasone suppression test (1 mg), CRH test and ACTH test. In our study, 89 % (702 patients) of adrenal incidentalomas were non-hypersecretory masses; 6. 2 % (49 patients) showed a preclinical Cushing's syndrome (PCS) (at least two altered parameters of pituitary-adrenal axis); 3. 4 % (27 patients) were pheochromocytomas; 0. 89 % (7 patients) were aldosteronomas. One tumor was a masculinizing adrenocortical carcinoma. Two hundred sixty patients underwent surgical exploration and the histological diagnosis showed: 138 adenomas (53 %), 32 carcinomas (12 %), 26 pheochromocytomas (10 %). 16 myelolipomas (8 %), 13 cystic lesions (5. 5 %), 7 tumors of neuronal lineage (3 %). 12 metastases (4 %), 13 others (5 %). The 138 patients with adenomas had the following hormonal diagnosis: 103 nonfunctional adenomas (74 %), 31 PCS (23 %) and 4 cases of hyperaldosteronism (3 %). In the patients with PCS an abnormal dexamethasone suppression test was found in 86 % of cases (37 / 41 patients). Values for ACTH were low in 78 % (32 / 41 patients). UFC was elevated in 64 % of patients, the diurnal rhythm of cortisol evaluated in 14 patients was absent in 7. Only in 50 % of cases DHEAS values (12 / 24 patients) were decreased, whereas they were normal in the other 50 %. Interestingly, 8 patients with normal DHEAS and normal UFC showed nonsuppressible cortisol by dexamethasone test (1 mg). Blunted ACTH response to CRH was detected in 9 of 14 patients (64 %). Thus our data suggest that the best parameter for evaluating subclinical hypercortisolism seems to be the overnight dexamethasone suppression test. In 27 patients with pheochromocytoma 24 -hour urinary catecholamine and VMA levels were elevated in 86 and 46 % of cases respectively. In 7 patients with hyperaldosteronism upright PRA was suppressed in 100 % of cases and aldosterone plasma levels were elevated in 6 patients (86 %); serum potassium level was slightly decreased in 60 % of cases. In 86 of 138 histologically proven adenomas, DHEAS levels were: normal in 59 % of patients, decreased in 36 % and elevated in 4. 6 %, whereas in 22 of 32 cortical carcinomas evaluated. DHEAS levels were normal in 63 % of cases, decreased in 18 % and elevated 18 %. Post-ACTH 17 -OH progesterone levels were elevated in 52 % (62 / 118 patients) of non-functioning adenomas and in 2 of 4 carcinomas. Not enough data are yet available postoperatively. In summary, endocrine evaluation can lead to the identification of a nonnegligible number of cases of clinically unsuspected pheochromocytomas and subtle hypercortisolism (about 3. 4 and 6. 2 %, respectively of all adrenal incidentalomas), while cases of <b>primary</b> subclinical <b>aldosteronism</b> are rarely found.

At baseline, renal cysts were evaluated by renal ultrasound and patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> were compared with 323 essential hypertension patients with the same severity and duration of disease, and 113 age- and sex-matched normotensive subjects. Results The adjusted prevalence and average number of renal cysts were significantly greater in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> than in patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects. Multivariate analysis revealed that age and plasma potassium levels were independently associated with the presence of renal cysts in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism.</b> Treatment of <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> decreased blood pressure (BP) and restored normal potassium concentrations.

Patients: Fifty-four patients with tumoral or idiopathic aldosteronism were followed after either surgical (n = 24) or medical (n = 30) treatment. Patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> were compared with 100 patients with primary hypertension and comparable severity and duration of disease. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in renal function and intrarenal echo-Doppler indices were measured. Results: Patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> had greater creatinine clearance and urinary albumin excretion than patients with primary hypertension. Patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> and creatinine clearance above the median (105 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2)) had significantly lower resistance and pulsatility index than patients with creatinine clearance below the median, independent of disease subtype.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A high {{prevalence}} of metabolic syndrome {{has been reported}} in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism.</b> Low levels of adiponectin, an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing properties, are considered a hallmark of the metabolic syndrome. We evaluated the relationship between adiponectin and insulin sensitivity in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism,</b> with and without metabolic syndrome, compared with essential hypertension. METHODS: Forty patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> and 40 matched patients with low-renin essential hypertension (LREH) were studied. Patients with type 2 diabetes were excluded. Each group was divided into two subsets: one including patients with metabolic syndrome and one including patients without metabolic syndrome (ie, hypertension alone or associated with another component of the syndrome). RESULTS: Insulin resistance, defined by increased homeostasis model assessment (HOMA index), was higher in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> than in those with LREH only in the absence of metabolic syndrome (P<. 01), whereas in the subsets bearing the syndrome it was similar. Adiponectin levels were lower in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> than in patients with LREH (P<. 01). Like HOMA index, the difference was maintained (P<. 01) only in the subsets without metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with HOMA index and positively correlated with potassium levels both in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> (P<. 001) or in LREH (P<. 05) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower adiponectin as well as lower insulin sensitivity in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> compared with LREH seem to result from both direct (aldosterone excess) and indirect (hypokalemia) mechanisms. Therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting both potassium and adiponectin levels by specific antihypertensive agents might improve insulin sensitivity, providing better cardiovascular protection in primary aldosteronis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Prorenin can be {{detected}} in plasma of hypertensive patients. If detected in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> could implicate prorenin {{in the development of}} <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism.</b> To address this issue, we measured the plasma prorenin levels in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> patients, the expression of the prorenin receptor (PRR) in the normal human adrenocortical zona glomerulosa and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), and we investigated the functional effects of PRR activation in human adrenocortical cells. METHOD: Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and active and total trypsin-activated renin were measured in <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> patients, essential hypertensive patients, and healthy individuals, and then prorenin levels were calculated. Localization and functional role of PRR were investigated in human and rat tissues, and aldosterone-producing cells. RESULTS: <b>Primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> patients had detectable plasma levels of prorenin. Using digital-droplet real-time PCR, we found a high PRR-to-porphobilinogen deaminase ratio in both the normal adrenal cortex and APAs. Marked expression of the PRR gene and protein was also found in HAC 15 cells. Immunoblotting, confocal, and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated PRR at the cell membrane and intracellularly. Renin and prorenin significantly triggered both CYP 11 B 2 expression (aldosterone synthase) and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, but only CYP 11 B 2 transcription was prevented by aliskiren.

RESULTS: Adjusted plasma Gal- 3 concentrations in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism,</b> patients after adrenalectomy and patients with EHT were 11. 39 +/- 0. 60, 11. 64 +/- 0. 81 and 11. 41 +/- 0. 73 ng/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD; P = 0. 95). In 11 patients of whom paired samples were available, mean Gal- 3 concentrations increased from 10. 03 +/- 1. 67 ng/ml preadrenalectomy to 14. 36 +/- 2. 07 ng/ml postadrenalectomy (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: In patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism,</b> plasma Gal- 3 concentrations are not elevated when compared with patients with EHT, and levels do not decrease after adrenalectomy. These results are in contrast to previous studies and do not support a pathophysiological role of plasma Gal- 3 in the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Primary,</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> {{is rare in}} children. We {{present a}} case report {{concerning}} an 11 -year-old girl. She was referred for dizziness, fatigue, muscular weakness, and headaches. The initial evaluation showed hypertension and hypokalemia. Further tests were performed and were compatible with <b>primary</b> <b>aldosteronism.</b> Abdominal CT scanning showed all enlargement of the right adrenal gland. Histology of the removed gland revealed nodular hyperplasia, compatible with unilateral adrenal hyperplasia. <b>Primary</b> <b>aldosteronism</b> is a rare but curable cause of hypertension in children.
