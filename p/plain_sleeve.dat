The album was packaged in a <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve</b> with no title or track listings, simply bearing a signature {{of one of the}} band members. The management thought that it should be perceived as a 'demo' album so no fancy sleeve was required, making it very cheap to produce. the first 1000 copies were pressed and made available at concerts or via mail-order for £3.50. The only mail-order advertisement appeared in Sounds and ran for six weeks. The bands management did not pay for the advertisement and ended up being sued. The idea for recording this album came from Fellows and Linda Harris as an attempt to record tracks to entice attention from a record company, which would take care of the recording costs.|$|E
500|$|... "This Guitar" [...] was {{the final}} release for the {{original}} Apple record label, which the Beatles had launched in 1968 as a business enterprise aligned with utopian ideology. The record's face labels reverted to the generic Apple design rather than use the customised design adopted for [...] "You" [...] and Extra Texture, which included a vivid orange and blue colour scheme and an eaten-away apple core {{in place of the}} standard Apple logo. In America and Britain, [...] "This Guitar" [...] was available only in a <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Among the alternative packaging available in other markets, the rare Japanese picture sleeve incorporated the colour scheme from the parent album, surrounding an image of Harrison on stage during the 1974 tour. The picture was taken by tour photographer Henry Grossman, who worked extensively with the Beatles in the 1960s. Harrison did no promotion for the single, but his guest appearance on comedian Eric Idle's Rutland Weekend Television 1975 Christmas special, singing the purpose-written [...] "The Pirate Song", heralded a return to form for him in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{recorded}} and released self-financed demo tapes in 1977 and 1979. Although only recorded within six {{hours on a}} four-track, they gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Although many record companies fought to sign the band, none were willing to commit fully. The band grew impatient and decided that they would release their material through their own label Happy Face Records. The band released their debut album on this label most commonly known as Lightning to the Nations, although it has never officially had a title. This album came in a <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve</b> with no title, having on it only a signature {{of one of the}} band members and no track listings. Amongst the stand out features of this album were the epic riffs created by Tatler, which prompted Sounds magazine to claim that [...] "one Diamond Head song contains more Chords than an entire Black Sabbath album".|$|E
50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} within seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in Worcester, which the band described as 'dead'. This album {{came in a}} <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve</b> with no title, having on it only a signature {{of one of the}} band members and no track listings. The reason for this was that the band's new manager, Reg Fellows, owned a cardboard factory and could produce blank sleeves at low cost. Also, the reason for recording this album was an attempt to lay down some tracks so they could send it to a record company who would be more willing to release it, as the recording costs had already been covered; this idea came from Fellows and Linda Harris (by then tour manager). There were originally only 1000 copies pressed of the album, which were only available at their concerts or through mail-order at a price of £3.50. In fact the only mail-order advertisement appeared in British music magazine 'Sounds' and ran for four weeks. However, the band did not pay for the ad and ended up being sued.|$|E
500|$|Although {{unofficial}} and unlicensed recordings {{had existed}} before the 1960s, {{the very first}} rock bootlegs came in <b>plain</b> <b>sleeves</b> with the title rubber stamped on it. However, they quickly developed into more sophisticated packaging, in order to distinguish the manufacturer from inferior competitors. With today's packaging and desktop publishing technology, even the layman can create [...] "official" [...] looking CDs. With {{the advent of the}} cassette and CD-R, however, some bootlegs are traded privately with no attempt to be manufactured professionally. This is even more evident with the ability to share bootlegs via the Internet.|$|R

30|$|Material and Methods: 43 {{patients}} received laparoscopic interventions {{longer than}} 10 minutes. We used 5 mm working trocars bearing a <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The fixator device {{was attached to}} one of the two side trocars prior to insertion. In 18 patients an unsutured fixator was used (FX-US-subgroup). In 25 patients the device was sutured to the skin through specially suturing ports (FX-S-subgroup). Position of both trocars was evaluated {{at the start of the}} procedure and eventually every 10 minutes intraoperatively.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Safe and {{reliable}} access systems are crucial in laparoscopy, and trocar dislodgement {{is still a}} common and frustrating problem. Wall emphysema can occur besides the risky prolongation of the surgical procedure. Wall-anchoring components provide a better hold of the device. This comparative analysis assesses the frequency of dislodgement and a time-sparing effect on the intervention of 3 different trocar systems, including an innovation {{in the field of}} access-providing systems. Methods: Patients who underwent laparoscopy for various gynecological indications were included and randomized consecutively into 3 groups according to the access system used in the intervention: (A) trocar fitted with a spiral thread on the sleeve, (B) trocar with <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve,</b> (C) trocar as in B together with a fixator. This novelty is installed on the trocar before insertion and then sutured to the abdominal wall. Intervention time, frequency of trocar corrections, and the time loss through correction were registered. Standard statistical analyses were performed. Results: The cohort comprised 131 patients; 51 patients were consecutively randomized into group A, 38 into group B, and 42 into group C. Mean intervention time was different, shortest in C and highest in B. Frequency of interruption of the intervention due to adjustment of the device and time loss through adjustment was lowest in group C (fixator � <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve)</b> and highest in group B (plain-sleeve) (0. 47 vs 0. 29, P� 0. 05 and 2. 13 minutes v...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical approach}} for modeling the synchronous instability {{phenomenon known as}} Morton effect is presented. The analysis is straight forward and easily applied to any rotor supported on fluid film bearings. The analysis clarifies the interaction of three distinct machine characteristics which combine to create a case of Morton effect. Some example calculations are shown illustrating the possible types of spiral vibration. In addition, an analytical approach is described for estimating {{the magnitude of the}} shaft temperature difference in a journal bearing as a direct function of the shaft orbit. It is significant that this method can readily be applied to any type of journal bearing, from <b>plain</b> <b>sleeve</b> bearings to tilting pad bearings. Example calculations using the method are shown...|$|E

50|$|A limited run of 5000 was made, {{meaning that}} the item is now very rare. A 12-inch release, housed in a <b>plain</b> black <b>sleeve,</b> is even harder to find, {{especially}} given that the band name is absent from the label.|$|R

50|$|The minimalist sleeve was {{in keeping}} with the American release of The Black Album, which unlike the UK release, {{featured}} a spoof of the Beatles' The Beatles - a <b>plain</b> black <b>sleeve</b> with the band's name in small white lettering in the bottom left corner.|$|R
5000|$|The sleeve to the [...] "Skin Trade" [...] single {{was banned}} in several countries, as it {{featured}} an airbrushed naked female buttock.

30|$|Discussion: The use of fixator {{significantly}} reduces <b>plain</b> (smooth) <b>sleeve</b> trocar movement, prohibits {{a complete}} dislocation or slippage of the port, while suturing {{the device to}} the skin further minimizes trocar movement. The fixation device {{may lead to a}} shorter operation time and reduce problems associated with trocar slippage or dislocation.|$|R

50|$|The Beatles had {{originally}} intended to use the title A Doll's House for the album they were recording during 1968. The release of Family's similarly titled debut then prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now more {{commonly referred to as}} The White Album due to its <b>plain</b> white <b>sleeve.</b>|$|R
