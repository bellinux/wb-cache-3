40|$|Health {{care policy}} is at a {{remarkable}} threshold. <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> drawn {{a line in}} the sand; he ran for election on a platform of health care reform and has introduced comprehensive health care reform legislation indicating that every-thing is negotiable {{with the exception of the}} goal of universal coverage. But-tressed by an electorate that appears to want health care reform without a clear preference for a particular structure, the President and the majority of Congress find themselves under pressure to reach a compromise on a proposal in which everyone can declare victory. As this paper is being written, key Congressional committees are trying to reach a compromise. Among the most contentious issues is whether health in-surance should be compulsory. An im-portant, but secondary, consideration is whether private insurance will have to be sold through an intermediary (such as an alliance) or whether it can be sold di-rectly.

40|$|Abstract: <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> {{proposed}} creating {{larger social}} security funds and investing a portion {{of them in the}} private sector. Others have suggested more radical reforms such as moving social security from a defined-benefit scheme to a definedcontribution plan based on the Chilean model. These proposals are based on the goal of creating higher investment returns, which would make social security benefits easier to finance in the long run. The important public policy issues inherent in such proposals are numerous: questions of whether pre-funded social security plans are demographically immune; whether pre-funding social security can increase gross national savings and worker productivity; whether there are better ways to create a healthy economy; whether social security is best offered as a defined-benefit plan or a defined-contribution plan. This paper reviews each of these important public policy issues in the context of recent social security policy initiatives in Canada and the United States. After an extensive review of the literature, the paper concludes that greater prefunding of social security will not, of and by itself, create a more secure system. ...|$|E

This material is part of the 226 metric tons of fissile material that <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> declared to be excess to US national-security needs and which will be permanently withdrawn from the US nuclear stockpile. In September 1997, the IAEA agreed to carry out this experiment, and during the first three weeks of December 1997, the IAEA verified the design information concerning the downblending process.

40|$|The current Social Security {{system is}} unsustainable. As <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> pointed out, the only {{alternative}} to tax increases or benefit cuts {{is to increase the}} rate of return to investment of Social Security funds. That means either allowing individuals to invest their own Social Security taxes or allowing the government to invest them. Supporters of government investing claim that it would allow the government to reap the benefits of the higher returns available in private capital markets, incur lower administrative costs than individual accounts, and allow the government to spread the risk of poor investment performance. On the surface, that approach may have some appeal; in reality it is fraught with peril. It could potentially make the federal government the largest shareholder in American corporations, raising the possibility of government control of American business. In addition, there are serious questions about what types of investment the government would make. Political considerations and "social investing" are likely to influence the government's investment decisions, allowing the government to manipulate economic markets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Comprehensive nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), {{which was}} re-cently {{adopted by the}} UN General Assembly and signed by <b>President</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>has</b> lowered the testing yield limit to zero and raised the profile of small {{earthquakes}} and mining blasts. Because relatively small events are very common, {{there is a strong}} need for automated algorithms {{that can be used to}} screen out the events that are obviously chemical or natural and identify those few curious enough to warrant closer scrutiny. The primary objective of this article is to assess the utility of high-frequency spectral modulations for the discrimination of mining blasts from earthquakes and single explosions at near-regional distances. Mining blasts commonly yield spectral modulations that are independent of time and the recording component. This article describes an automated discriminant that looks for these delay-fire diagnostics in data recorded on one or three components by single stations, arrays, or regional networks. Distinct deployments in central Asia, Europe, and North America are used to assess the transportability of the approach. The discriminant tests give misclassification probabilities, estimated with multivariate statistics, ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 5 %. Dis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} year, Congress has sealed {{the fate of}} the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Although <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> pledged to veto any action that abolishes the Commerce Department, in which the NTIA is located, Congress will {{ultimately}} dismantle the NTIA. Thus, the question becomes what entity will shoulder NTIA 2 ̆ 7 s workload, which includes among other responsibilities managing federal use of the radio frequency spectrum, developing executive branch telecommunications policy, and administering the Federal Grants Program. Although the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) appears to many a natural successor to the NTIA 2 ̆ 7 s varied responsibilities, the Authors suggest other agencies are more appropriate. For instance, relocation of NTIA 2 ̆ 7 s spectrum management functions are better suited to the General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), or the Treasury Department. The Authors indicate that these agencies are in a more neutral position than the FCC because {{they do not have a}} relationship with the private sector which makes balancing the needs of competing groups difficult. Moreover, the NTIA 2 ̆ 7 s policy-making functions should remain with an executive branch agency in order to provide the president the ability to take independent positions on telecommunications issues...|$|E
