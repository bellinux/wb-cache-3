25|$|Species of the clade Thecosomata {{produce a}} fragile {{external}} calcium carbonate shell, which {{could serve as}} a ballast enabling large vertical migrations and as a protection against predators. The aragonitic composition of the shell makes it very sensitive to dissolution. Aragonite is a metastable form of calcium carbonate and it is more soluble in seawater than calcite. Because of its highly soluble aragonite shell and polar distribution, Limacina helicina {{may be one of the}} first organisms affected by ocean acidification, and it is therefore a key indicator species of this process. As a key indicator of the acidification process, and a major component of <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> Limacina helicina has become a focus for acidification research. Based on labolatory experiments, they are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low aragonite saturation state. Limacina helicina seems to be relatively more resilient to elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) than other aragonitic organisms such as corals. Labolatory experiments results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH. A decline of pteropod populations would likely cause dramatic changes to various pelagic ecosystems. Shelled pteropods also play a geochemical role in carbon cycle in the oceans, as they contribute to the export of calcium carbonate and can represent a major component of the carbon transport to the deep ocean.|$|E

40|$|Long-range {{atmospheric}} transport of mercury, its transformation to more toxic methylmercury compounds, and their bioaccumulation in the aquatic food chain have motivated international research on mercury as a pollutant of global concern. The background concentration of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg" 0) {{in the lower}} troposphere of the northern hemisphere is generally around 1, 9 ng/m" 3 and 1, 3 ng/m" 3 in the southern hemisphere respectively. Highly time-resolved atmospheric mercury measurements in the Antarctic have shown that mercury depletion events do also occur in the Antarctic at Neumayer Station {{during the first three}} months after polar sunrise. This phenomenon leads to an increased input of atmospheric mercury into the <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> A possible explanation for mercury depletion events may involve chemical or photochemical oxidation of Hg" 0 to Hg" 2 "+ [resulting either in particle-associated mercury (Total Particulate-Phase Mercury: TPM) and/or reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) species] and significantly enhanced deposition fluxes of mercury leading to unequivocally increased input of atmospheric mercury into the <b>polar</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The Antarctic mercury depletion phenomenon is strongly correlated with ground-level ozone depletion episodes. These trophospheric ozone loss events in the Antarctic are associated with enhanced bromine monoxide concentrations in the free troposphere. It is hypothesized that Br atoms and/or BrO radicals are involved in a chemical reaction which destroys ozone. The following depletion of atmospheric boundary layer mercury (at times up to an altitude of #approx# 1 km) is due to a reaction between gaseous elemental mercury and BrO free radicals. In addition methods for the determination of GEM, TPM, and RGM were applied at Neumayer Station during antarctic summer and on board of the German research vessel ''Polarstern''.

40|$|Due to {{different}} oceanographic and geological characteristics, benthic algal communities of Antarctica and the Arctic differ strongly. Antarctica {{is characterized by}} high endemism, whereas in the Arctic only few endemic seaweeds occur. In contrast to the Antarctic region, where nutrient levels never limit algal growth, nutrient levels in the Arctic regions are depleted during the summer season. Both regions have a strong seasonally changing light regime, fortified by an ice covering throughout the winter months. After months of darkness algae are suddenly exposed to high light caused by the breaking up of sea ice. Simultaneously, harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) entersthe water column and can significantly affect algal growth and community structure. In the intertidal zone fluctuations of temperature and salinity can be very large. Ice scours can further influence growth and settlement of intertidal algae. The subtidal zone offers a more stable habitat than the intertidal,permitting the growth of larger perennial algae and microbial mats.

Intertidal communities were dominated by single cell diatoms and green algal propagules. Limpet grazing reduced the algal biomass and macroalgal recruit density and further introduced a shift in both macro- and microalgal species composition. There were no negative UVR effects on the diatom assemblage. In contrast, significant UVR effects on the macroalgal assemblage were detected.

Effects were species-specific and showed that particularly young propagules were sensitive to UVR. No interactive effects of UVR and grazing were found.
