50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{confirmed that}} ACE inhibitors are effective {{and certainly the}} first-line choice in hypertension treatment. This meta-analysis was based on 20 trials and a cohort of 158,998 patients, of whom 91% were hypertensive. ACE inhibitors were used as the active treatment in seven trials (n=76,615) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 13 trials (n=82,383).ACE inhibitors were associated with a statistically significant 10% mortality reduction: (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P=0.004). In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.04; P=0.683).

More recently, ACEI have been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk, where hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, or heart failure was not the primary indication for ACEI therapy. Objective: To review studies {{of the effects of the}} ACEI <b>perindopril</b> on cardiovascular events. Method: The EUROPA (European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with <b>Perindopril</b> in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease Study), PROGRESS (<b>Perindopril</b> Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study), and ASCOT-BPLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial – Blood Pressure Lowering Arm) trials are reviewed. Results: <b>Perindopril</b> alone reduced cardiovascular events in subjects with stable coronary heart disease. <b>Perindopril</b> in combination with indapamide reduced cardiovascular events in subjects with cerebrovascular disease. <b>Perindopril</b> in combination with amlodipine reduced cardiovascular events in subjects with hypertension.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Treatment of {{hypertension}} is fundamental {{for the prevention}} of cardiovascular events and mortality. This review focuses on the specific benefits of the ACE inhibitor <b>perindopril.</b> AREAS COVERED: A systematic literature search is undertaken for supporting the pharmacological proprieties and clinical efficacy of <b>perindopril</b> in the treatment {{of hypertension}}. Good tissue penetration, strong affinity for ACE and a long duration of action support the dose-dependent blood pressure lowering efficacy. <b>Perindopril</b> in combination with amlodipine significantly reduced total and cardiovascular mortality as compared to atenolol/diuretic in large-scale clinical trials of hypertensive patients. A greater reduction in blood pressure variability, central blood pressure and specific vascular protective proprieties of <b>perindopril</b> (improvement in arterial stiffness and endothelial function) might explain these results. Cardiovascular prevention with <b>perindopril,</b> in combination with indapamide, has been also shown in the elderly and patients with diabetes, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. EXPERT OPINION: <b>Perindopril</b> is effective and safe for blood pressure control with a dose-dependent effect. Combination therapy with indapamide or amlodipine reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in hypertensive patients. Pharmacological proprieties and results of clinical trials support the choice of <b>perindopril</b> as an appropriate treatment for hypertensive patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Perindopril</b> is a non-sulphydryl {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which requires hydrolysis to its active metabolite, perindoprilat, to produce its effects. Ten cirrhotic patients with mild to severe disease were studied after oral administration of a single 8 mg dose of <b>perindopril</b> as its tert-butylamine salt. Compared with a historical control group of young healthy volunteers receiving the same single oral dose of <b>perindopril,</b> mean AUC values of the prodrug <b>perindopril</b> were double in patients with liver cirrhosis (602 +/- 294 s. d. ng ml- 1 h vs 266 +/- 70 s. d. ng ml- 1 h) whereas the mean AUC of perindoprilat {{was found to be}} similar (134 +/- 139 ng ml- 1 h vs 120 +/- 29 ng ml- 1 h). The partial metabolic clearance of <b>perindopril</b> to perindoprilat was much lower in the cirrhotics (26 +/- 12 ml min- 1 vs 58 +/- 22 ml min- 1). The maximum inhibition of plasma ACE activity measured in the cirrhotic patients (87. 5 +/- 5. 1 %) was comparable with that previously reported with <b>perindopril</b> in patients with mild hepatic impairment as well as in patients with essential hypertension. We suggest that liver cirrhosis may be associated with imparied deesterification of <b>perindopril</b> to its active metabolite perindoprilat but that no dosage adjustment of <b>perindopril</b> is required in cirrhotic patients...|$|E
40|$|Short-term (one week) {{and chronic}} (six week) {{cardiovascular}} effects of orally administered <b>perindopril</b> {{were examined in}} the rabbit to demonstrate if short-term results can predict chronic outcomes. In short-term treatment, five doses of <b>perindopril</b> were examined in random order separated by a one week recovery period in each of six rabbits. Two doses of <b>perindopril</b> {{which resulted in a}} moderate hypotensive effect (- 14 mmHg) and no hypotensive effect, respectively, were then selected for long-term treatment. Each rabbit in the short-term study received <b>perindopril</b> in doses of 0. 01, 0. 06, 0. 32, 1. 8 and 10 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) for a week at a time. Rabbits on long-term treatment received either 0. 3 or 0. 01 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) <b>perindopril</b> for six weeks. All rabbits had their mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate recorded throughout treatment. Plasma angiotensin I (AngI), perindoprilat, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were also assayed. <b>Perindopril</b> treatment for one week produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect with the threshold dose, 0. 06 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1), producing a 6. 5 +/- 1. 8 mmHg fall in MAP. The highest dose (10. 0 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1)) produced a large fall in blood pressure of - 29. 6 +/- 4. 2 mmHg. The 0. 01 and 0. 06 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) doses of <b>perindopril</b> produced an average 2. 65 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial control. The three higher doses (0. 32 - 10. 0 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1)) of <b>perindopril</b> produced an equivalent 5. 7 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial controls. However, over six weeks 0. 01 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) <b>perindopril</b> induced a similar decrease in MAP as the 30 fold higher dose (- 9. 3 mmHg compared to - 11. 7 mmHg,). This was in spite of a 3 fold difference in plasma perindoprilat concentrations between the high and low dose <b>perindopril</b> groups. Plasma ACE inhibition was > 80 % with both doses of <b>perindopril.</b> The results indicate that while <b>perindopril</b> decreases MAP in a dose-dependent manner in short-term (one week) periods, over longer treatment times (six weeks) low concentrations of <b>perindopril,</b> non-hypotensive with shortterm treatment, may be as anti-hypertensive as considerably higher doses.

30|$|<b>Perindopril</b> {{erbumine}} {{belongs to}} the category of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. <b>Perindopril</b> erbumine is indicated {{for the treatment of}} hypertension; this effect appears to result primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity thereby reducing angiotensin II formation and decreasing vasoconstriction. <b>Perindopril</b> erbumine is also indicated for patients with congestive heart failure [British National Formulary BNF 2014].|$|E
40|$|<b>Perindopril</b> is a long-acting, once-daily {{lipophilic}} angiotensin-converting {{enzyme inhibitor}} with high tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme affinity, lowering angiotensin II and potentiating bradykinin.

Moreover, large morbidity-mortality trials, such as the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with <b>Perindopril</b> in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and <b>Perindopril</b> pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), have shown that antihypertensive treatment with <b>perindopril</b> reduces and prevents cardiovascular disease in a large range of patients with vascular diseases, {{whether or not they are}} hypertensive. Thus, the outcomes of these and other trials support the concept of cardiovascular protective properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with <b>perindopril</b> in addition to the obvious blood-pressure-lowering effect. Considering its properties and the clinical evidence on efficacy and tolerability that has been gathered, <b>perindopril</b> fulfils the criteria of the latest guidelines for hypertension and cardiovascular disease management and should therefore be considered as a first-line antihypertensive agent, forming a consistent part of the comprehensive strategy against hypertension and related cardiovascular complications...|$|E
