40|$|Extract] In the {{northern}} hemisphere's summer of 1978, Canine parvovirus (CPV), the causative agent of canine parvoviral enteritis, appeared and spread rapidly {{all over the}} world. Serological surveys subsequently showed that dogs had not encountered CPV before 1974 in Europe. It is thought that CPV arose by mutation of a precursor parvovirus, probably {{one that had been}} circulating in Europe for some time among one or more carnivore species. An alternative and enticing suggestion was that CPV had arisen from a modified live feline <b>panleucopenia</b> vaccine virus; however this has not been supported by subsequent study. All CPV isolates clearly formed a single tight group, and were considered most likely to have been derived from a single, common ancestral virus. CPV is extremely closely related to feline <b>panleucopenia</b> virus (FPV) and has recently been described as a "host range variant of a feline virus". Although remarkably similar to FPV, the 1978 strain of CPV specifically infected members of Canidae, whereas FPV was known to infect and cause disease in felids, procyonids (raccoons), mink (Mustela vison) and possibly foxes (Vulpes spp.), but not dogs. Feline <b>panleucopenia</b> (FP) is a viral disease characterised by fever, depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea. It has been recognised for about 100 years and is nowadays uncommonly diagnosed in pet cats in UK. In the past, FP was caused exclusively by FPV. However, a recent study showed that a disease identical to FP can be caused experimentally by CPV– 2 a and CPV– 2 b. CPV was isolated from a naturally infected 1. 5 year-old pet cat in Japan that died of a disease indistinguishable from FP and also from cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and a Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris Altaica) with diarrhoea. CPV, including a new variant referred to as CPV– 2 c by some researchers, has been found infecting Vietnamese and Taiwanese leopard cats (Felis bengalensis). This new variant virus caused disease when administered to experimental specific pathogen free (SPF) cats. Whether or not it is appropriate to refer to CPV-induced felid enteritis as FP is merely a semantic issue...|$|E
40|$|Viruses {{commonly}} cause gastrointestinal illnesses in {{dogs and}} cats that range in severity from mild diarrhoea to malignant neoplasia. Perpetual evolution of viruses is reflected in changing disease patterns, so that familiar viruses are sometimes discovered to cause new or unexpected diseases. For example, canine parvovirus (CPV) has regained the ability to infect felids and cause a panleucopenia-like illness. Feline <b>panleucopenia</b> virus (FPV) {{has been shown to}} cause “fading” in young kittens and has recently been implicated as a possible cause of feline idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Molecular scrutiny of viral diseases sometimes permits deeper understanding of pathogenesis and epizootiology. Feline gastrointestinal lymphomas have not, in the past, been strongly associated with retroviral infections, yet some of these tumours harbour retroviral proviruses. Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) {{may play a role in}} lymphomagenesis, even in cats diagnosed as uninfected using conventional criteria. There is strong evidence that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) can also be oncogenic. The variant feline coronaviruses that cause invariably-fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) arise by sporadic mutation of an ubiquitous and only mildly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV); a finding that has substantial management implications for cat breeders and veterinarians. Conversely, canine enteric coronavirus (CECV) shows considerable genetic and antigenic diversity but causes only mild, self-limiting diarrhoea in puppies. Routine vaccination against this virus is not recommended. Although parvoviruses, coronaviruses and retroviruses are the most important known viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease, other viruses play a role. Feline and canine rotaviruses have combined with human rotaviruses to produce new, reassortant, zoonotic viruses. Some companion animal rotaviruses can infect humans directly. Undoubtedly, further viral causes of canine and feline gastrointestinal disease await discovery.

40|$|A 10 -week-old Thoroughbred filly was {{referred}} for anaemia of 4 weeks' duration. Haematology revealed severe anaemia and <b>panleucopenia.</b> Cytological examination of bone marrow smears revealed a myeloid to erythroid ratio < 0. 02 : 1 (reference range 0. 5 – 2. 4 : 1. 0) and {{an abundance of}} erythroid precursor cells. The erythroid cell population included rubriblasts, prorubricytes and rubricytes, with only scant numbers of metarubricytes present. There were numerous mitotic erythroid cells, {{some of which were}} atypical and megaloblastic. These cytomorphological changes are consistent with pure acute erythroid leukaemia. No treatment was instituted and the filly died three days after presentation. This case illustrates the need to consider both haematology and bone marrow findings to establish a diagnosis of pure erythroid leukaemia. To our knowledge, there is no documented case of acute myeloproliferative disease in horses involving cells of erythroid lineage, but this condition should be considered a differential diagnosis for horses presenting with anaemia.

40|$|The most {{conspicuous}} clinical finding {{during the course}} of this virus disease is a fulminating <b>panleucopenia.</b> The earliest significant decrease noted is usually in the number of the lymphocytes. From the study of lymph nodes and bone marrow during the incubation period and throughout the illness, it appears that failure of leucopoiesis is the cause of leucopenia. Inclusion bodies in the primitive blood cells of the marrow suggest a direct action of the virus on these cells. When recovery occurs a marked myelogenous leucemoid response is noted. Available data indicate the presence of a mild anemia due to a failure in erythropoiesis, less marked than the leucopenia probably because of the longer life of the adult circulating erythrocytes. The erythrocytes appear to have an increased fragility and the serum has a slight increase in icterus, suggesting an increased mean erythrocyte age. During recovery erythropoiesis does not begin until after the myeloid marrow response has begun to subside, due possibly to previous mechanical crowding of the marrow by the more rapidly growing myeloblasts and myelocytes...|$|E
40|$|Feline <b>panleucopenia</b> virus (FPLV) was {{introduced}} in 1977 on Marion Island (in the southern Indian Ocean) {{with the aim of}} eradicating the cat population and provoked a huge decrease in the host population within six years. The virus can be transmitted either directly through contacts between infected and healthy cats or indirectly between a healthy cat and the contaminated environment: a specific feature of the virus is its high rate of survival outside the host. In this paper, a model was designed in order to take these two modes of transmission into account. The results showed that a mass-action incidence assumption was more appropriate than a proportionate mixing one in describing the dynamics of direct transmission. Under certain conditions the virus was able to control the host population at a low density. The indirect transmission acted as a reservoir supplying the host population with a low but sufficient density of infected individuals which allowed the virus to persist. The dynamics of the infection were more affected by the demographic parameters of the healthy hosts than by the epidemiological ones. Thus, demographic parameters should be precisely measured in field studies in order to obtain accurate predictions. The predicted results of our model were in good agreement with observations...|$|E
40|$|Feline <b>panleucopenia</b> virus (FPV) is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} pathogen that causes severe diseases in pets, economically important animals and wildlife in China. Although FPV was identified several years ago, {{little is known about}} how it overcomes the host innate immunity. In the present study, we demonstrated that infection with the FPV strain Philips-Roxane failed to activate the interferon β (IFN-β) pathway but could antagonize the induction of IFN stimulated by Sendai virus (SeV) in F 81 cells. Subsequently, by screening FPV nonstructural and structural proteins, we found that only nonstructural protein 2 (NS 2) significantly suppressed IFN expression. We demonstrated that the inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β production by FPV NS 2 depended on the obstruction of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3) signaling pathway. Further, we verified that NS 2 was able to target the serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK 1 and prevent it from being recruited by stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, which disrupted the phosphorylation of the downstream protein IRF 3. Finally, we identified that the C-terminus plus the coiled coil domain are the key domains of NS 2 that are required for inhibiting the IFN pathway. Our study has yielded strong evidence for the FPV mechanisms that counteract the host innate immunity...|$|E
40|$|Certain virus {{diseases}} are highly infectious and are trans-missible by contact. In some, the mere physical proximity of normal animals to infected animals {{is sufficient to}} cause infection in the former. This degree of infectiousness is common {{to a number of}} viruses which invade the cells of surface tissues, par-ticularly the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and the skin. Influenza (Smith, Andrewes, and Laidlaw, 1933), psittacosis (Lazarus and Meyer, 1939), distemper (Dunkin and Laidlaw, 1926), lymphocytic choriomeningitis (Traub, 1936 and Cogge-shall, 1939), infectious ectromelia (Marchal, 1930), malignant <b>panleucopenia</b> (Hammon and Enders, 1939), and vaccinia (Parker and Rivers, 1936) viruses, to mention but a few, are typical ex-amples. In the study of some {{virus diseases}} it is absolutely essential that the possibility of contact infections be eliminated. This is particularly true in the case of influenza since accidental in-fections, either apparent or inapparent but resulting in the devel-opment of specific antibodies, may vitiate the interpretation of results. Ferrets which are exposed, even at some distance and for relatively short periods, to other ferrets in the acute phase of influenza usually contract the disease (Smith, Andrewes, and Stuart-Harris, 1938). This fact complicates attempts to identify the virus in material obtained from human beings and makes it necessary that inoculated ferrets be strictly isolated. Further-more, ferrets often fail to show typical symptoms following the inoculation of human throat washings which contain the viru...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} report (1) we {{described}} a highly fatal epizootic disease of cats which, we demonstrated, {{is caused by a}} filterable agent. The usual clinical course is characterized by a fulminating leucopenia associated with 1 or 2 days of manifest illness during which vomiting, moderate elevation of temperature and progressive anorexia and weakness are almost constant features. A large series of autopsies with tissue sections showed the constant, outstanding pathological changes restricted to the bone marrow, lymphoid tissues and intestines. In these affected organs eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were found to be a characteristic feature. We have more recently, through the observation and autopsy of approximately 50 more kittens suffering from this infection, noted several pathological changes, not previously described, related to the blood and the hematopoietic tissues. The description of these which forms the matter of this report is of value, we believe, in the interpretation of the causes underlying the observed quantitative abnormalities of the cellular elements of the blood. Effects on the Leucocytes and Leucopoietic Tissues Prior to any manifest symptoms of illness and frequently before a rise in temperature, a fall in the leucocyte count occurs which, as previously described, may represent a decrease of the lymphocytes, the polymorphonuclear ceils or both. After studying this larger series of animals it has become more obvious that during the 2 nd to the 4 th day after inoculation there is in most cases a more conspicuous {{decrease in the number of}} lympho-* The material in this paper is derived in part from an unpublished thesis, "A recently defined virus disease; malignant <b>panleucopenia</b> of cats, " submitted as a requiremen...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina VeterináriaEm {{medicina}} veterinária, a morte súbita é uma síndrome que afecta animais que se apresentam aparentemente saudáveis, não só para os proprietários, mas também para os médicos veterinários assistentes. A sua definição reveste-se de características científicas precisas e tem implicações sociais próprias. Os objectivos deste estudo foram determinar as causas que levam à morte súbita de canídeos e felídeos, estabelecendo relações epidemiológicas. Foram analisadas as requisições de exame necrópsico e respectivos relatórios anatomo-patológicos referentes ao período entre Janeiro de 2000 e Dezembro de 2009, pertencentes à secção de Anatomia patológica da FMV-UTL. A morte súbita foi {{a causa de}} morte em 6, 2 % (n= 60) do número total de necrópsias realizadas em felídeos e 6, 3 % (n= 153) das realizadas em canídeos. Estes constituíram um grupo de animais aparentemente saudáveis que morreram repentinamente sem sintomatologia presenciada pelos proprietários. Foi considerado um período máximo de 10 horas entre a ocasião em que foram vistos pela última vez com vida e posteriormente encontrados mortos. Foram, também, incluídos os animais considerados saudáveis pelo proprietário e/ou médico veterinário que desenvolveram sintomas nas 6 horas antes da morte. Da análise da população total de felídeos presentes, observou-se que, a maior parte dos animais que morreram subitamente eram do sexo masculino, de raça Europeu Comum, com idades compreendidas entre 1 e 6 anos. A morte nestes 60 animais deveu-se sobretudo a pneumonia exsudativa, cardiomiopatia hipertrófica, edema agudo do pulmão, <b>panleucopénia</b> felina, lipomatose cardíaca, intoxicação por organofosforados e insuficiência renal aguda. Da análise da população total de canídeos, observou-se que a maior parte das mortes súbitas ocorreu em machos, de raça pura, sendo a mais representada a Pastor Alemão. A morte súbita foi mais comum na faixa etária entre 1 e 6 anos. A principal causa de morte súbita foi devido a síndrome de dilatação-torção de estômago, seguida por intoxicações por pesticidas, tromboembolismo pulmonar, estenose sub-áortica, cardiomiopatia dilatada, parvovirose, edema agudo do pulmão e lipomatose cardíaca. Tanto em gatos como em cães, na maioria das vezes não foi presenciada qualquer sintomatologia e em 13 % e em 7 %, respectivamente, a causa de morte foi inconclusiva. ABSTRACT - Sudden {{death in}} dogs and cats – Retrospective study of 213 cases (2000 - 2009) - In veterinary medicine, sudden death is a syndrome that affects animals which are apparently healthy, not only for their owners, but also for their veterinarians‟ practitioners. Its definition has precise scientific features and specific social issues. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the causes of sudden death of dogs and cats, establishing epidemiologic relations. Necropsy records of the department of pathological anatomy of the FMV-UTL, between January 2000 and December 2009, were analyzed. The data collected included clinical signs immediately before death, and post-mortem histopathological reports. Sudden death was the cause of death in 6, 2 % (n= 60) of necropsies performed in cats and 6, 3 % (n= 153) conducted in dogs. They constituted a group of apparently healthy animals that had died suddenly without symptoms attended by the owners, for a maximum of 10 hours between the time when they were last seen and the time that they were found dead, or when changes in their clinical status were witnessed by the owners in the last 6 hours before their death. Analysing the total population of these cats, it was observed that most animals that had died suddenly were males, of European shorthair breed, aged between 1 and 6 years. Death in these 64 animals was mainly due to exudative pneumonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute pulmonary edema, feline panleukopenia virus, cardiac lipomatosis, organophosphate poisoning and acute renal failure. Analysing the total population of dogs, it was observed that most sudden deaths occurred in males, purebred, being the most represented the German shepherd breed. Sudden death was more common between the ages of 1 and 6 years. The main cause of sudden death was due to gastric dilation-volvulus syndrome, followed by pesticide poisoning, pulmonary thromboembolism, sub-aortic stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, canine parvovirus infection, acute pulmonary edema and cardiac lipomatosis. In cats and dogs, most of the time no symptoms were witnessed and in 13 % and 7 %, respectively, the cause of death was inconclusive...|$|E
