Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I got to go be a kid for twelve hours a day".

500|$|Iftah Ya Simsim {{inspired}} [...] "a {{flood of}} studies", from scientific research to doctoral or masters theses submitted to Arab, European, and American universities.

In 1981, however, the JPPI invited children from Arab countries to Kuwait to access how they assimilated the program. Their attitudes about the show were assessed by education, social, and media specialists, who found that most viewers had benefited from watching it. Parents reported that their children's language use and ability improved, and the JPPI received many letters of appreciation and was commended for their efforts in producing the show. In 1984, in one of the first studies conducted researching the show's effects on its young viewers, Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi compared the relationship between the viewing behavior by the Kuwaiti <b>preschooler</b> of Iftah Ya Simsim and certain developmental and environmental variables. He found that variables such as socioeconomic status, parental education (especially that of the mother), sex, age, year in school, birth order, and family attitudes about the show influenced the frequency of viewing.|$|E
500|$|Twenty years {{worth of}} {{research}} had showed that television, a [...] "cultural artifact" [...] accessible to most American children, {{could be a}} [...] "powerful educational agent." [...] The show was designed and produced on the assumption that, since children are cognitively active when they watch television, a show could be an effective method of scientific education for young children by telling stories through pictures and by modeling behavior and learning. The creators and producers used film techniques to present information from multiple perspectives in many [...] "real world" [...] contexts, or situations within the daily experiences of young children. They wanted to provide their viewers with more [...] "authentic learning opportunities" [...] by placing problem-solving tasks within the stories they told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement. These learning opportunities included the use of mnemonics {{in the form of}} mantras and songs, and what Tracy called [...] "metacognitive wrap-up" [...] {{at the end of each}} episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed.

Accelerometers were initialized using 15 -second intervals and sedentary behavior was defined as Results Children attending Montessori <b>preschools</b> spent less time in sedentary behavior than those attending traditional <b>preschools</b> during the in-school (44. 4. min/hr vs. 47. 1 [*]min/hr, P = 0. 03), after-school (42. 8. min/hr vs. 44. 7 [*]min/hr, P = 0. 04), and total-day (43. 7 [*]min/hr vs. 45. 5 [*]min/hr, P = 0. 009) periods.
