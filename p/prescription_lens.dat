50|$|A sharp instrument, {{such as a}} thorn or needle, is used {{to pierce}} the eye either {{at the edge of}} the cornea or the sclera, near the limbus. The opaque lens is pushed downwards, {{allowing}} light to enter the eye. Once the patients sees shapes or movement, the procedure is stopped. The patient is left without a lens (aphakic), therefore requiring a powerful positive <b>prescription</b> <b>lens</b> to compensate.|$|E

50|$|The Peli Lens is a {{mobility}} aid {{for people}} with homonymous hemianopia. It {{is also known as}} “EP” or Expansion Prism concept and was developed by Dr. Eli Peli of Schepens Eye Research Institute in 1999. It expands the visual field by 20 degrees. He tested this concept on several patients in his private practice with great success using 40Δ Fresnel press-on prisms (Peli 2000). Development of the lens and clinical trials were funded by NEI-NIH Grant EY014723 awarded to Chadwick Optical. The results of the multi-center clinical trials were published in 2008 reporting a 74% patient acceptance rate. Under this grant Chadwick Optical also designed and produced a cosmetically acceptable permanent version of this concept in a <b>prescription</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E

50|$|Co-founders Dhavid Cooper, OD and Guy Hodgson, OD {{are both}} {{originally}} from South Africa where they moved from to the United States in the 1980s. The two business partners had several optometry practices in Houston, Texas operating from 1986 until 1994 {{when they had}} an opportunity to sell their offices. After taking a year off, the two co-founded FramesDirect in 1996 and launched FramesDirect.com later that year. The company was headquartered in Houston until Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike forced their customer service representatives to relocate to Austin, Texas, and eventually the rest of the office followed. In 2010, Essilor, a <b>prescription</b> <b>lens</b> manufacturing company, acquired the majority stake in FramesDirect.com. Shortly after, Essilor partnered with FramesDirect.com to create and launch MyOpticalOnline.com, an online service that allows independent eyewear practices to sell their products online.|$|E

40|$|Textured {{cosmetic}} lenses {{have long}} been known to present a problem for iris recognition. It was once believed that clear, soft contact lenses did not impact iris recognition accuracy. However, it has recently been shown that persons wearing clear, soft contact lenses experience an increased false non-match rate relative to persons not wearing contact lenses. Iris recognition systems need the ability to automatically determine {{if a person is}} (a) wearing no contact lens, (b) wearing a clear <b>prescription</b> <b>lens,</b> or (c), wearing a textured cosmetic lens. This work presents results of the first attempt that we are aware of to solve this three-class classification problem. Results show {{that it is possible to}} identify with high accuracy (96. 5 %) the images in which a textured cosmetic contact lens is present, but that correctly distinguishing between no lenses and soft lenses is a challenging problem. 1...|$|E

40|$|Progressive {{addition}} lenses (PALs) are {{an increasingly}} preferred mode for the correction of presbyopia, gaining an increased {{share of the}} <b>prescription</b> <b>lens</b> market. Sales volumes are likely to increase {{over the next few}} years, given the increasing cohort of presbyopic patients in the population. This research investigated adaptation to PAL wear, investigating head movement parameters with and without progressive lenses in everyday visual tasks, and examined symptoms of spatial distortions and illusory movement in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs. Minimum displacement thresholds in the presence and absence of head movement were also investigated across the lens designs. Experiment 1 investigated head movements in two common visual tasks, a wordprocessing copy task, and a visual search task designed to replicate a natural environment task such as looking for products on supermarket shelving. Head movement parameters derived from this experiment were used to set head movement amplitude and velocity in the third experiment investigating minimum displacement thresholds across three PAL designs. Head movements were recorded with a Polhemus Inside Track head movement monitoring system which allows real time six degrees of freedom measurement of head position. Head position in azimuth, elevation and roll was extracted from the head movement recorder output, and data for head movement angular extent, average velocity (amplitude/duration) and peak velocity were calculated for horizontal head movements Results of the first experiment indicate a task dependent effect on head movement peak and average velocity, with both median head movement average and peak velocity being faster in the copy task. Visual task and visual processing demands were also shown to affect the slope of the main sequence of head movement velocity on head movement amplitude, with steeper slope in the copy task. A steeper slope, indicating a faster head movement velocity for a given head movement amplitude, was found for head movements during the copy task than in the search task. Processing demands within the copy task were also shown to affect the main sequence slopes of velocity on amplitude, with flatter slopes associated with the need for head movement to bring gaze to a specific point. These findings indicate selective control over head movement velocity in response to differing visual processing demands. In Experiment 2, parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity were assessed in a group of first time PAL wearers. Head movement amplitude, average and peak velocity were calculated from head movement recordings using the search task, as in Experiment 1. Head movements were recorded without PALs, on first wearing a PAL, and after one month of PAL wear to assess adaptation effects. In contrast to existing literature, PAL wear did not alter parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity in a group of first time wearers either on first wearing the lenses or after one month of wear: this is due to task related effects in this experiment compared to previous work. Task demand in this experiment may not have required wearers to use the progressive power corridor to accomplish identification of visual search targets, in contrast to previous studies where experimental conditions were designed to force subjects to use the progressive corridor. In Experiment 3, minimum displacement thresholds for random dot stimuli were measured in a repeated measures experimental design for a single vision lens as control, and three PAL designs. Thresholds were measured in central vision, and for two locations in the temporal peripheral field, 30 ° temporal fixation and 10 ° above and below the horizontal midline. Thresholds were determined with and without the subjects' head moving horizontally in an approximate sinusoidal movement at a frequency of about 0. 7 Hz. Minimum displacement thresholds were not significantly affected by PAL design, although thresholds with PALs were higher than with a single vision lens control. Head movement significantly increased minimum displacement threshold across lens designs, by a factor of approximately 1. 5 times. Results indicate that the local measures of minimum displacement threshold determined in this experiment are not sensitive to lens design differences. Sensitivity to motion with PAL lenses may be more a global than a localized response. For Experiment 4, symptoms of spatial distortion and illusory movement were investigated in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs, and related to optical characteristics of the lenses. Peripheral back vertex powers of the PALs were measured at two locations in the right temporal zone of the lenses, 15. 6 mm temporal to the fitting cross, and 2. 7 m above and below the horizontal to the fitting cross. These locations corresponded to the zones of the lenses through which minimum displacement thresholds were measured in the previous experiment. The effect of subjects' self movement on symptoms is able to discriminate between PAL designs, although subjective symptoms alone were not related to the lens design parameters studied. Subjects' preference for one PAL design over the other designs studied in this experiment is inversely related to the effect on subject movement on their symptoms of distortion. An optical parameter, blur strength, derived from the power vector components of the peripheral powers, may indicate preference for particular PAL designs, as higher blur strength values are associated with lower lens preference scores. Head movement amplitude and velocity are task specific, and are also influenced by visual processing demands within tasks. PALs do not affect head movement amplitude and velocity unless tasks are made demanding or performed in less natural situations designed to influence head movement behaviour. Both head movement and PALs have large effects on minimum displacement thresholds; these effects may be due in part to complexity of the subjects' task within the experiment. Minimum displacement thresholds however were not influenced by PAL design. The most sensitive indicator for subject's preference of PALs was the effect of subjects' self movement on their perception of symptoms, rather than the presence of actual symptoms. Blur strength should be further investigated for its role in PAL acceptance...|$|E
