40|$|The Affymetrix U 95 and U 133 Latin Square spike-in {{datasets}} are reanalysed, {{together with}} a dataset from {{a version of the}} U 95 spike-in experiment without a complex non-specific background.

The model predicts a three parameter hyperbolic response function that fits well with fluorescence intensity data from all three datasets. The importance of the various <b>hybridisation</b> <b>and</b> washing effects in determining each of the three parameters is examined, and some guidance is given as to how a practical algorithm for determining specific target concentrations might be developed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the need to understand creativity both as a general feature of cultural change (associated with the processes of cultural promiscuity <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation),</b> <b>and</b> as a form of cultural capital used in strategies of scoail distinction.

40|$|Field-effect-based {{capacitive}} electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) sensors {{have been}} utilised for the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) immobilisation <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> detection {{as well as}} for monitoring the layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes (anionic poly(sodium 4 -styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)). The EIS sensors with charged macromolecules have been systematically characterised by capacitance-voltage, constant-capacitance, impedance spectroscopy and atomic-force microscopy methods. The effect of the number and polarity of the polyelectrolyte layers on the shift of the capacitance-voltage curves has been investigated. Alternating potential shifts of about 30 - 90 mV have been observed after the adsorption of each polyanion and polycation layer, respectively. The DNA immobilisation <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> signals were 35 - 55 and 24 - 33 mV, respectively. The possible mechanisms for the sensor responses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{fragmentation}} <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> {{of governance}} {{has been a}} preoccupation of public lawyers and others for some time. Commentators have focused variously on the internal and organisational fragmentation of the executive (the development of next step agencies, for example, {{and the growth of}} new control relationships {{as a consequence of the}} implementation of strategies of new public management), on the fragmentation <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> of service delivery (contracting-out, public-private partnerships, the private finance initiative), and on the fragmentation <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> of regulation. Concerns have been both to map and analyse the changing nature of the exercise of governance functions and to address the issues of accountability to which such changes have given rise. 5 This article focuses on regulation and suggests that we build on existing analyses of regulation as a decentred and fragmented activity by exploring the notions of regulatory capacity and regulatory enrolment, and provides illustrations using examples from the current system of UK financial services regulation. In focusing on regulatory capacity and regulatory enrolment, it is suggested, an analytical framework can be developed which has both prescriptive and descriptive dimensions, and which may facilitate thinking on how regulatory functions are and should be distributed between diverse actors in a regulatory system...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{dispersion}} {{processes are}} key mechanisms that shape the genetic structure {{and diversity of}} forest stands. Gene dispersal occurs by means of both natural migration of pollen and seed as well as via the artificial transfer of seeds and plants. These processes affect the genetic structure of forest stands and thereby influence their ability to adapt to future changes in the environment. Within the OAKFLOW project natural and artificial gene flow, including interspecific geneflow, was monitored in white oaks (mainly Q. petraea and Q. robur) in different purposely installed study plots across Europe. Three main objectives were set to the project: - To trace and quantify gene flow <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> in terms of distances and rates - To evaluate genetic and ecological consequences of gene flow <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> on the adaptation of oak stands - To evaluate impacts of gene flow on management rules and silvicultural regimes of oak stand...|$|R
40|$|After {{two decades}} of studies on the {{transformation}} of Central and East European regions and societies, most scientific communities seem to have normalised their theoretical concepts and empirical approaches. Leaving former exceptionalist views on systemic transition, convergence <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation,</b> <b>and</b> heading for “business as usual” as found in any society integrated into the world market or exposed to globalisation, they presently {{give the impression that}} transformation studies are coming to an end. This paper undertakes a review of the past phases of transformation studies in order to identify research gaps and necessities of further research on social and regional development as influenced by inherited or hybridised structural and cultural elements. It makes a point in favour of abandoning the convergence debate for more context-sensitive analyses of social change and societal restructuring, in particular with regard to structural fragmentation <b>and</b> cultural <b>hybridisation...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{observation}} that the differentiation of science and technology, representing and interventing is simultaneously blurred and re-drawn resonates with Latour’s (1987) depiction of an “a-modern” dialectic between purification <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> But while Latour suggests an a-modern de facto dialectic combined with a modern idea(l) that emphasises purification, others suggest a post-modern idea(l) that emphasises hybridisation (cp.

30|$|Conclusions The {{assessment}} of isolation distances around protection areas {{should be performed}} for each area individually concerning the GMP specific effects and dispersal properties {{as well as the}} protected organisms and the main protection targets. Especially HR-OSR is critical because of its volunteers <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> partners. Another main source of GMP dispersal into protection areas might be the contamination of conventional seeds with transgene OSR seeds.|$|R
30|$|Consequently, it is {{necessary}} to specify the genetic constitution of species and varieties which are able to cross-pollinate with GM oilseed rape to justify any decisions on the acceptance or non-acceptance of gene flow <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> between them.

40|$|Abstract. Leaf {{samples of}} {{endangered}} endemic orchid Calanthe izu-insularis Ohwi & Satomi {{collected at the}} time of full-bloom from two natural habitats on Mikurajima Island on (33 ◦ 50 ′N, 139 ◦ 37 ′E), ∼ 200 km south of Tokyo, Japan, were examined for nine species of virus. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) was detected by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> in 4 of the 104 leaf samples from different plants of C. izu-insularis. Five plants were removed from their natural habitat and cultivated in a greenhouse. Concentrations of detectable CMV in these plants increased and CMVwas detected in all five plants after 2 weeks of cultivation. However, after an additional 10 weeks of cultivation, CMV was not detected in any of the plants. Thus, it seems possible that almost all of the plants of this species in their natural habitat might harbour CMV at concentrations that are lower than the limit of detection by RT–PCR <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> The importance of these results for the conservation in situ is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of time, the pre-biological and the biological world have seen a steady increase in complexity of form and function based on a process of combination and re-combination. The current modern synthesis of evolution known as the neo-Darwinian theory emphasises population genetics and does not explain satisfactorily all other occurrences of evolutionary novelty. The authors suggest that symbiosis <b>and</b> <b>hybridisation</b> <b>and</b> the more obscure processes such as polyploidy, chimerism and lateral transfer are mostly overlooked and not featured sufficiently within evolutionary theory. They suggest, therefore, a revision of the existing theory including its language, to accommodate the scientific findings of recent decades...|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, {{hybridisation}} (or hybridization) is {{the concept}} of mixing atomic orbitals into new hybrid orbitals (with different energies, shapes, etc., than the component atomic orbitals) suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence bond theory.
