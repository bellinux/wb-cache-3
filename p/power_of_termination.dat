40|$|In [4, 14] we {{presented}} {{an approach to}} prove termination of non-recursive Java Bytecode (JBC) programs automatically. Here, JBC programs are first transformed to finite termination graphs which represent all possible runs of the program. Afterwards, the termination graphs are translated to term rewrite systems (TRSs) such that termination of the resulting TRSs implies termination of the original JBC programs. So in this way, existing techniques and tools from term rewriting {{can be used to}} prove termination of JBC automatically. In this paper, we improve this approach substantially in two ways: (1) We extend it in order to also analyze recursive JBC programs. To this end, one has to represent call stacks of arbitrary size. (2) To handle JBC programs with several methods, we modularize our approach in order to reuse termination graphs and TRSs for the separate methods and to prove termination of the resulting TRS in a modular way.

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} decision problem {{in computer science}} is the halting problem, i. e., given {{a description of a}} program and an input, decide whether the program terminates after finitely many steps or runs forever on that input. While Turing showed this problem to be undecidable in general, developing static analysis techniques that can automatically prove termination for many pairs of programs and inputs is of great practical interest. This is true in particular for logic programming, as the inherent lack of direction in the computation virtually guarantees that any non-trivial program terminates only for certain classes <b>of</b> inputs. Thus, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> logic programs is widely studied and significant advances have been made during the last decades. Nowadays, there are fully-automated tools that try to prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> a given logic program w. r. t. a given class of inputs. Nevertheless, there still remain many logic programs that cannot be handled by any current termination technique for logic programs that is amenable to automation. Another area where termination has been studied even more intensively is term rewriting. This basic computation principle underlies the evaluation mechanism of many programming languages. Significant advances towards powerful automatable termination techniques during the last decade have yielded a plethora of powerful tools for proving termination automatically. In this thesis, we show that techniques developed for proving <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> term rewriting can successfully be adapted and applied to analyze logic programs. The new techniques developed significantly extend the applicability and the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> automated <b>termination</b> analysis for logic programs. The work presented here ranges from adapting techniques to work directly on logic programs to transformations from logic programs to a specialized version of term rewriting. On the logic programming side we also present a new pre-processing approach to handle logic programs with cuts. On the term rewriting side we show how to search for certain popular classes of well-founded orders on terms more efficiently by encoding the search into satisfiability problems of propositional logic. The contributions developed in this thesis are implemented in tools for automated termination analysis – mostly in our fully automated termination prover AProVE. The significance of our results is demonstrated by the fact that AProVE has reached the highest score both for term rewriting and logic programming at the annual international Termination Competitions in all years since 2004, where the leading automated tools try to analyze <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> programs from different areas of computer science...|$|R
