5|$|Sir Francis Drake sailed from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, {{in command}} of a fleet of five ships under his {{flagship}} Pelican, later renamed the Golden Hinde. His <b>principal</b> <b>objective</b> was plunder, not exploration; his initial targets were the unfortified Spanish towns on the Pacific coasts of Chile and Peru. Following Magellan's route, Drake reached Puerto San Julian on 20 June. After nearly two months in harbour, Drake left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace. His ships entered the Magellan Strait on 23 August and emerged in the Pacific Ocean on 6 September.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} {{the presidency of}} the Oxford University Law Society, although his <b>principal</b> <b>objective</b> was {{the presidency of the}} Oxford Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E
5|$|Scott's plans {{gradually}} came to fruition– {{a large-scale}} scientific and geographical expedition with {{the conquest of}} the South Pole as its <b>principal</b> <b>objective.</b> Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had {{been associated with the}} Discovery Expedition's scientific work. He appointed Edward Wilson as his chief scientist, and Wilson selected an experienced team. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Amundsen's party reached the South Pole on 14 December 1911 and returned safely. Scott and four companions, including Wilson, arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912; all five perished on the return journey.|$|E

25|$|The Aztec of Central Mexico built a {{tributary}} empire covering most {{of central}} Mexico. The Aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice {{on a large}} scale.

Plan Dalet caused quite a controversy among historians. Some see it as a plan that was primarily defensive and military in nature and a preparation against invasion, whereas others think that the plan was offensive in nature and aimed at conquering as much of Palestine as possible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} incentive contracts in which the agent's payoff {{is not based on}} the <b>principal's</b> <b>objective.</b> The author shows that contracts based on such performance measures will not, in general, provide first-best incentives, even when the agent is risk neutral. The form of the optimal contract and the efficiency of this contract depend on the relationship between the performance measure used and the <b>principal's</b> <b>objective.</b> The model provides a simple and intuitive statistical measure. Applications to various incentive contracting situations, including the "gaming" of performance measures, the use of revenue-based sales commissions, and relative performance evaluation, are presented.
