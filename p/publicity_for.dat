5|$|In 1938 K. K. Madsen {{described}} an automated variation of SMAW, {{now known as}} gravity welding. It briefly gained popularity in the 1960s after receiving <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> its use in Japanese shipyards though today its applications are limited. Another little used variation of the process, known as firecracker welding, was developed {{around the same time}} by George Hafergut in Austria.|$|E

5|$|Rodman {{garnered}} as much <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> {{his public}} antics. He dated Madonna and claimed {{she tried to}} conceive a child with him.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} outside of Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator {{instead of the}} dainty-looking sorceress she originally was. Due {{to the lack of}} <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make a big impact on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.|$|E

5|$|To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a Watchman, {{an earlier}} draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015.

5|$|A {{statue of}} Mercury stood over the {{entrance}} to the Dominion Theatre in London's West End from May 2002 to May 2014 for Queen and Ben Elton's musical We Will Rock You. A tribute to Queen was on display at the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas throughout 2009 on its video canopy. In December 2009 a large model of Mercury wearing tartan was put on display in Edinburgh as <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the run of We Will Rock You at the Playhouse Theatre.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E

5|$|Feshbach is most {{well known}} for her stint as Tom Cruise's assistant, and for her {{friendship}} with Katie Holmes during the couple's engagement. In this role she traveled with Holmes during <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the actresses's film roles, sat in on interviews, and responded to questions about Holmes from journalists. Warner Bros. made special accommodations for Feshbach to accompany Holmes during promotion of Batman Begins, and she attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy in 2006. Feshbach was later a guest of honor at Scientology's Patron Ball, held at the organization's headquarters in Britain. By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard wrote all of {{the music}} for the album, with {{contributors}} utilizing instruments including synthesizers, bass, woodwinds, strings, and a bouzouki. She plays piano on the album. Most of the pieces on the album are of three to four minutes in duration. Wayne Isaak served as the Waterhouse Records publicist for the album. In <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the album, marketing compared Hubbard's musical writing style to that of Erik Satie. The album cover was marketed with a sticker on the outside wrapping advertising {{the fact that it}} was endorsed by Stanley Clarke.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, in the lead-up to {{the release}} of the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of Harry Potter fansites, {{demanding}} that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names. The action resulted in negative <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.|$|E

5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{associates}} of the Church include Mark Mothersbaugh, Mojo Nixon, Paul Mavrides, Paul Reubens, members of Negativland, David Byrne, and R.Crumb.

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with public {{relations}} man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Film is an {{initiative}} by the Netherlands Film Festival and the government-subsidized Netherlands Film Fund, {{with the support}} of Film Investors Netherlands, to increase the public's awareness of Dutch films in the Netherlands. The Golden Film recognises box office achievements to encourage positive <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> a film after the initial media attention surrounding its release has begun to wane. The award is similar to the Dutch music industry's Golden Record, that is awarded after selling 40,000singles, 35,000popular music albums, or 15,000classical music albums.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} {{with her}} agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb {{for much of the}} success of her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented that this could be in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin contracted with Viking, who offered larger advances and more <b>publicity</b> <b>for</b> her books.|$|E
