40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hydrogen-bridged cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> with a porosity. This kind of material is adopted to distinguish methanol from ethanol. Because {{of the diversity}} of molecular affinities in ethanol and methanol with the hydrogen-bridged cholesteric <b>polymer</b> <b>networks,</b> the reflected colors of the cholesteric <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> are obviously different upon the uptake of the alcohol solutions with different ratios of methanol/ethanol. Furthermore, the composition of the monomers was altered to obtain the different sensitivities of the different alcohol concentrations and ratios of methanol/ethanol. The reduction of cross-link density and increasing amount of alkyloxybenzoic acid in <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> can enhance the distinguishing ability between methanol and ethanol.

25|$|The rate of {{relaxation}} of density fluctuations will be rapid if the restoring force, which {{depends upon the}} network elasticity, is large—and if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small. The theory suggests that the rate is directly proportional to the elasticity and inversely proportional to the frictional force. The friction in turn depends upon both the viscosity of the fluid and the average size of the pores contained within the <b>polymer</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting <b>polymer</b> <b>network</b> is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-elastic light {{scattering}} offers direct experimental access to {{measurement of the}} wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the viscoelastic properties of the gel. It is reasonable to expect {{a relationship between the}} amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the <b>polymer</b> <b>network</b> offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{potential}} of photo-crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> for intraocular drug delivery is described. Patients with diseases {{of the back of}} the eye would benefit considerably from the development of drug delivery systems that can provide sustained intraocular delivery for months to years. Due to their versatility, photo-crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> are an interesting class of materials for application in drug delivery systems. Photo-crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> are often prepared from oligomers that are end-functionalized with double bond-containing groups. Many of the networks described in this thesis were prepared from oligomers functionalized with fumaric acid monoethyl ester (FAME). The possibilities of preparing photo-crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> using these end-groups were explored. The work described in this thesis demonstrates that photocrosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> with diverse properties can be prepared from FAMEfunctionalized oligomers. By varying factors such as the crosslink density and network hydrophilicity, release profiles could be tuned. Model proteins could be released in a controlled way over periods of a few months. Therefore the prepared networks hold promise for the intraocular delivery of protein drugs. Importantly, an initial in vivo study indicated that photo-crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> are well tolerated in the rabbit vitreous. However, there also remain challenges that need to be solved. Due to their large size and relative instability the controlled release of proteins remains challenging. Side reactions may occur during the network formation process and interactions of the protein with the polymer matrix may lead to incomplete protein release. It was shown that side reactions can be minimized if the network preparation process is optimized carefully, but these issues need further attention in the future. In vivo release studies with one of the networks that displayed attractive release profiles could be a next step towards an intraocular drug delivery system based on photocrosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Thus, if the {{elasticity}} is {{inferred from}} the {{measurements of the}} scattering intensity, and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the pore size distribution contained within the <b>polymer</b> <b>network,</b> e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity.

40|$|Several {{polyacrylamide}} hydrogels and semi-interpenetrated <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) included were synthesised and characterised {{by their}} swelling ratio. Their permeability to Orange II was studied {{as a function}} of temperature in the range 25 - 45 °C. In polyacrylamide hydrogels the permeability increases with temperature according to an Arrhenius relationship and the apparent activation energy for permeation decreases linearly as the swelling ratio of the hydrogel increases. In semi-interpenetrated <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> a more or less pronounced increase of the permeability to Orange II is observed above 32 °C, the lower critical solution temperature of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). Different values of the apparent activation energy for permeation were obtained below and above 32 °C, the last one being always lower than the former one. The permeability of semi-interpenetrated <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> increases above 32 °C though a slight shrinking of the gels is observed. This {{can be explained by the}} collapse of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains resulting in an increase of the pore volume that facilitates the diffusion of the dye but simultaneously water is expelled and the swelling ratio of semi-interpenetrated <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> decreases.

Such <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> are complex and heterogeneous hydrogel environments that regulate diffusive processes through finely tuned particle-network interactions.

We show that particle transport in the charged hydrogels is highly asymmetric, with diffusion slowed down much more by electrostatic attraction than by repulsion, and that the filtering capability of the gel is sensitive to the solution ionic strength. Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple model are used to examine key parameters, including interaction strength and interaction range within the model networks. Simulations, which are in quantitative agreement with our experiments, reveal the charge asymmetry to be due to the sticking of particles at the vertices of the oppositely charged <b>polymer</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
