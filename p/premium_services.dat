By adaptively adjusting the weights according to the dynamics of the average queue size of <b>premium</b> <b>service,</b> the proposed scheme can achieve low loss rate, low delay and delay jitter for the <b>premium</b> <b>service.</b> Moreover, it requires neither rigid admission control nor accurate traffic conditioning to support <b>premium</b> <b>service</b> in the DiffServ architecture. This adaptive packet scheduling is shown to absorb the transient burstiness of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) aggregate — which is caused by the traffic distortion inside the network — without incurring packet loss or increasing the queueing delay...|$|R

25|$|AOL's {{strategy}} was to make online services available and accessible to the mass market by making them affordable, easy to use, useful and fun. At a time when competing services like CompuServe were charging for each minute of access (which varied based on modem speeds and added extra charges for <b>premium</b> <b>services),</b> AOL priced its service at $19.95 per month for unlimited use of basic tier services beginning in 1996. Within three years, AOL's userbase grew to 10 million, ultimately reaching 26.7 million subscribers at its peak in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, HBO and Cinemax {{became the}} first <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> to offer {{multiplexed}} services to cable customers as companions to the main network, offering additional channels of the two services to three TeleCable-operated systems in Overland Park, Kansas, Racine, Wisconsin and the Dallas suburbs of Richardson and Plano, Texas. The first two multiplex channels – HBO2 and HBO3 – launched {{as part of this}} test by the TeleCable systems. The following year, research from ACNielsen revealed that multiplex delivery of HBO and Cinemax had a positive impact on subscriber usage and attitudes, including aiding in the retention of pay cable subscriptions by its subscribers.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of HBO's successes, Warner Communications (which ironically was part-owner {{of one of}} the network's pay-cable competitors, The Movie Channel, from its launch in 1973 until joint venture group Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment sold its stake in the channel to Viacom in 1986) merged with HBO parent Time Inc. in 1989 to create Time Warner, which , remains the parent company of the network. In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> to offer multiplexed channels to cable customers with the launches of HBO2, HBO3 and Cinemax 2 on three cable systems in Wisconsin, Kansas and Texas. In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service. The move proved successful, eventually resulting in HBO and Cinemax starting up additional multiplex channels of both services – starting with the December 1996 launch of HBO Family and concluding with the launch of four Cinemax channels in 2001: WMax (now MovieMax), @Max (now Cinemáx), OuterMax and 5StarMax.|$|E

25|$|HBO {{has long}} {{maintained}} a policy {{not to run}} R-rated films on its primary channel between 6:00a.m. and 8:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; this policy (which may have once stemmed from HBO's availability on analog cable tiers, while its multiplex channels generally required a digital cable subscription or at least scrambling) remains in place , despite {{the existence of the}} V-chip and other <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> having incorporated R-rated films onto their daytime schedules starting in the mid-1980s. The policy was also applied to all TV-MA rated programs after the TV Parental Guidelines were implemented on January 1, 1997; however the main HBO channel began airing a limited amount of TV-MA rated original series, movies and documentaries that contain some strong profanity and violence, but are largely devoid of nudity, and graphic violent or sexual content on weekends before 8:00p.m. Eastern in 2010. However, HBO does occasionally rebroadcast R-rated films as early as 6:00p.m. Eastern Time as part of its Sunday rebroadcast of the prior Saturday's movie premiere telecast, depending on the length of the film and the scheduling of any HBO original series that air after it.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the cost}} of HBO (which is the most {{expensive}} of the U.S. <b>premium</b> <b>services,</b> costing a monthly fee [...] between $15 and $20 depending on the provider), many Americans only view HBO programs through DVDs or in basic cable or broadcast syndication – months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network – and with editing for both content and to allow advertising, although several series have filmed alternate [...] "clean" [...] scenes intended for syndication runs.|$|E
2500|$|HBO {{subscribers}} generally pay for {{an extra}} tier of service that includes other cable- and satellite-exclusive channels even before paying for the channel itself (though HBO often prices all of its channels together in a single package). However, a law imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires that cable providers allow subscribers to get just [...] "limited" [...] basic cable (a base programming tier that includes local, and in some areas, out-of-market broadcast stations and public, educational, and government access channels) and <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> such as HBO, without subscribing to expanded service (Comcast is the only major provider to have purposefully offered the network {{in such a manner}} utilizing this law, as it offered a bundled cable/Internet package that included limited basic service and HBO from October 2013 to July 2014, or January of the latter year in some markets). Cable providers can require the use of a converter box – usually digital – in order to receive HBO.|$|E

2500|$|Showtime and Flix, {{which are}} also owned by CBS Corporation, operate as {{separate}} services. Although The Movie Channel is frequently sold together in a package with Showtime, TMC subscribers do not necessarily have {{to subscribe to the}} other two services. Prior to the advent of digital cable, many providers often sold The Movie Channel separately from Showtime, continuing for about two decades after Viacom acquired both Warner Communications and Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment's respective ownership interests of the two previously autonomous services in 1985. Showtime began offering all of its channels, including TMC, Flix and Sundance Channel (now [...] AMC Networks-owned SundanceTV), in a single package by the early 2000s; this resulted in most providers (with the exception of Comcast, DirecTV and Dish Network) ceasing to sell or promote The Movie Channel separately from Showtime (Dish Network and DirecTV offer both TMC and TMC Xtra optionally as either a package with the remainder of the Showtime multiplex, or as part of a separate movie tier to subscribers that do not already have Showtime; both The Movie Channel and Starz Encore are the only U.S. premium channels to be offered to subscribers that do not subscribe to their co-owned <b>premium</b> <b>services).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Movie Channel Challenge: Running each August from 1990 to 1997, [...] "The Movie Channel Challenge" [...] was a month-long summer {{programming}} stunt – {{inspired by}} the [...] "no-repeat weekends" [...] music playlist stunts used on many radio stations – that featured a lineup of approximately 420 movies, none of which were repeated {{during the course of}} that month. The festival was developed to address a consumer complaint common with <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> like The Movie Channel, in avoiding repeat showings of select films on multiple dates and time slots during the calendar month – effectively quadupling the number of movies that most pay services typically aired in a given month (TMC's film lineup normally averages around 100 movies per month) – and to attract potential subscribers to and increase consumer awareness of TMC (at the time the festival began, The Movie Channel had approximately 2.5 million subscribers, one-third that of sister network Showtime, which had 8.5 million). Individual marathon-style festivals consisting of a set of movies starring a particular actor or focusing on a certain film genre (similar to those later featured as part of the [...] "TMC Marathons/Double Vision Weekends" [...] blocks) would be aired at various points during the period.|$|E
2500|$|To this end, {{companies}} {{make use of}} platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram [...] to reach audiences much wider than {{through the use of}} traditional print/TV/radio advertisements alone {{at a fraction of the}} cost, as most social networking sites can be used at little or no cost (however, some websites charge companies for <b>premium</b> <b>services).</b> This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility. Customers can now post reviews of products and services, rate customer service, and ask questions or voice concerns directly to companies through social media platforms. Thus social media marketing is also used by businesses in order to build relationships of trust with consumers. To this aim, companies may also hire personnel to specifically handle these social media interactions, who usually report under the title of Online community managers. Handling these interactions in a satisfactory manner can result in an increase of consumer trust. To both this aim and to fix the public's perception of a company, 3 steps are taken in order to address consumer concerns, identifying the extent of the social chatter, engaging the influencers to help, and developing a proportional response.|$|E

The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would [...] "prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising" [...] following the merger, by allowing other <b>premium</b> <b>services</b> to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films – led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the Department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13. When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a new holding company, Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture's common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%) and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners (the operational arrangement between The Movie Channel and Showtime is of a similar relationship to that between rival pay service Starz and its progenitor Starz Encore; as with Starz Encore to Starz, TMC operates as a secondary service to Showtime even though its launch, under the Star Channel brand, predates that of its parent network – Showtime launched on July 1, 1976 – by three years).|$|E
