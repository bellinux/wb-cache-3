30|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the effect of some biocontrol agents against the powdery mildew of Thompson seedless grapevines. The study was carried out during the two successive seasons (2016 and 2017) at a private organic vineyard orchard located at El Beheira Governorate, Egypt. Uncinula necator (syn. Erysiphe necator) is a fungus that causes <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapevine.</b> It causes severe loss in yield quantity and quality. Application of different biocontrol agents, e.g., Trichoderma harzianum, T. hamatum, T. viride, and their combinations, {{as well as the}} Blight stop (Trichoderma spp.), a commercial biocide and micronic sulfur, was an attempt to control the disease. The mixture of the three Trichoderma spp. showed the highest efficacy (80.16 and 89.95 %) of controlling the disease incidence and severity in the two seasons 2016 and 2017, respectively, followed by the treatment of Blight stop + micronic sulfur (77.12 and 84.02 %), while micronic sulfur showed the lowest effect (57.02 and 41.32 %). At all treatments, the yield was increased and the chemical characteristics, e.g., “total sugars, total soluble solids (TSS), total anthocyanin (% in mg/ 100  g[*]F.W.), and total phenols (mg/g betties as gallic acid equivalent)” of berries were improved. On the contrary, the percentage of total acidity was decreased at all treatments than in the control.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} an {{overview}} {{of what we know}} at present about the patogen Uncinula necator and the disease <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapevine,</b> i. e. its economic status, inoculum source, microclimate conditions, vine susceptibility and principles of its protection. Powdery mildew is a major grapevine disease in terms of losses. It infects the plant’s green parts, reducing its fertility, spoiling the quality of grapes and wine and ruining plant vitality. The process additionally affects subsequent vegetation seasons. The disease occursevery year and its intensity depends on a number of factors. It had long been assumed that overwintering mycelium was the primary source of inoculum. More recent research, however, has revealed a crucial role of cleistothecia in many vineyards. They were found in our vine-growing regions long ago but their true role in the epidemiology of disease has been explained only recently. Microclimate conditions considerably affect the abundance and vitality of cleistothecia and the pathogen’s infection potential. Outbreaks and intensity of disease both depend on them, while vine susceptibility plays another important role, depending on cultivarand plant ontogenesis. Grapevine is most sensitive during flowering and bunch formation when conditions are generally good for the disease to appear and spread. Temperature, precipitation and relative air humidity may limit the occurrence of powdery mildew, but extreme values in that respect are a rarity. Their normal scope is more or less favourable for the disease, especially in Podgorica vineyards. Knowing the pathogen, especially its infection potential, environmental conditions, dynamics of host development and timely and good quality protection of vines, both preventive and chemical, is crucial for grapevine protection. Prevention is important but treatments with fungicides are crucial for U. necator control, and they can either focus on destroying the inoculum and delaying mildew outbreaks or on preventing primary and secondary infection and spreading of disease. Fungicides that arenormally used include some old compounds (sulphur, dinocap) as well as new ones (strobilurins and hinolines), while inhibitors of ergoserol biosynthesis have an increasing role...|$|E
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapevine,</b> {{caused by}} the ascomycete Erysiphe necator (Schw.) Burr., is a {{polycyclic}} disease with primary infections caused by ascospores produced in the overwintered fruiting bodies (called chasmothecia), and secondary infections caused by asexual conidia produced in powdery mildew colonies during the grapevine growing season. Despite an initial controversy {{about the importance of}} the ascospores as a relevant source of inoculum for the disease, ascospores are now considered an important form of primary inoculum in many grape-growing areas. Sanitation, i. e. the interventions aimed at reducing the overwintering inoculum that triggers the disease epidemic in the following year, has been already tested in vineyards and is now considered a key part of the disease control strategy in the vineyards with severe attach of powdery mildew after harvest. Sanitation can be performed using different kinds of fungicides, natural compounds or the biocontrol agent Ampelomyces spp., which are all more effective when applied against developing chasmothecia, than on mature or dispersed ones. A model was therefore developed, based on the principles of the systems analysis, to predict the development and maturation of the E. necator chasmothecia in the vineyard. The model considers four state variables, which represent the four developmental stages of the chasmothecia: from the white ascocarp primordia to the yellow, brown and at the end black mature chasmothecia. Chasmothecia advance from one stage of development to the next at specific rates that depend on air temperature and are calculated based on the equations developed by Legler et al. (2012). Mature black chasmothecia are finally dispersed by rain splashes whenever there is a measurable rainfall. To validate the model, a total of 38 commercial vineyards were considered Northern Italy, Baden-Württemberg (Germany), and Riverland region (South Australia). In each vineyard, a plot was maintained untreated with fungicides against powdery mildew and disease severity was periodically assessed until leaf fall was complete. In 31 vineyards, the number of chasmothecia dispersed from the powdery mildew colonies were periodically trapped by using plastic trap funnels. The numbers of chasmothecia trapped per cm 2 of trap surface was enumerated and expressed as a cumulative proportion of the total chasmothecia trapped in each vineyard; these data formed the first dataset used for model validation. In 8 vineyards, the number of yellow, brown and black chasmothecia produced by powdery mildew colonies on vine leaves was enumerated as numbers/cm 2 leaf, and expressed as a proportion of the total number of mature chasmothecia; these data were used as the second dataset for model validation. Model predictions provided a good fit of the actual data collected in different vineyards and years: i) for the first dataset, the R 2 for the aggregate data of all the vineyard was 0. 95, the s. e. of estimate, which measures the accuracy of predictions, was 0. 097, the indexes of goodness-of-fit were close to 1 (NS= 0. 94,W= 0. 98,EF= 0. 94) and MAE was 0. 12; ii) for the second dataset, the R 2 for the aggregate data was 0. 91, the s. e. of estimate was 0. 091, the indexes of goodness-of-fit were all close to 1 (NS= 0. 90,W= 0. 98,EF= 0. 90) and MAE was 0. 18...|$|E

40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapevines</b> is {{difficult}} to assess visually at the weighbridge, particularly in large consignments of machine-harvested fruit. To facilitate accurate methods for the detection and quantification of the disease in grape samples obtained from both the vineyard and winery, we developed a DNA probe for the pathogen Erysiphe necator. The E. necator-specific 450 bp DNA fragment pEnA 1, targets highly repetitive sequences and was isolated from a partial genomic library. In screening for species specificity, clone pEnA 1 was used in slot-blot hybridization and detected E. necator DNA from grapes and resultant must and juice, but not from clarified juice and wine. The detection threshold was approximately 50 pg ofE. necator DNA per 100 ng total DNA of grape sample and was equivalent to 1 – 5 % of a grape bunch visually affected by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Disease severity, expressed {{as the percentage of}} surface area of a bunch with <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> and E. necator DNA content were highly correlated, r² = 0. 955, P < 0. 001. The DNA-based hybridization assay has the potential to predict the severity <b>of</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> in grape samples from the vineyard and in must and juice samples at the winery. The DNA sequence of clone pEnA 1 was used to design species-specific primers, the results maintaining the same specificity patterns observed in the initial hybridization assays. The PCR-based assay was sensitive enough to detect approximately 1 pg DNA, being equivalent to 1 conidium per sample. This is the first report to date of the detection of all known phenetic groups of E. necator DNA and of the quantification of DNA from grape samples at the winery. Accurate information on the extent <b>of</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> contamination <b>of</b> grape lots would enable wineries to make more informed decisions about the use of fruit and must.

40|$|International audienceWorks {{initiated}} in 2001 by our partners phytopathologists at INRA Bordeaux {{led to the}} design of a decision system against both <b>powdery</b> and downy <b>mildews</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapevine,</b> which has been named “GrapeMilDeWS”, in French “POD Mildium”. GrapeMilDeWS is decomposed in 7 stages distributed all along the vegetative season. Each leads basically to two decisions made at the plot scale: whether or not to spray against each of the two diseases. Our contribution to system design has been on knowledge elicitation and formal modelling, with Statecharts. Statecharts describe processes with states and events, and are a formal construct built upon finite state automata. Details and complex time behaviour can be described thanks to hierarchy and concurrency mechanisms. The modelling was undertaken in order to produce a fully explicit and logically consistent decision protocol, so that many users would test it on many different plots, in different regions. The protocol now exists in a written form and has been tested on a network that has grown up to 35 plots in 2009. Experimenting on a such a large scale, and getting back data and knowledge from this, causes numerous new challenges: (i) the decision system has to be robust to various conditions, while avoiding two loopholes: too much flexibility in the specification with risk of inappropriate implementation, or too many details (ii) the data to collect are numerous and include weather forecasts that are evolving by nature and need to collected in a timely manner; (iii) people involved are numerous: regional disease risk analysts, decision-makers for each plot, advisers who provide assistance to decision-makers and check conformance of decision to the original protocol. We have thus undertaken to develop an experimentation support system that is based on workflow nets by van Der Aalst (YAWL framework). Workflow nets are derived from Petri nets, which like Statecharts are based on processes with events and states. The emphasis of Petri nets is on management of resources, represented by tokens, and control of concurrent process. With workflow nets, tokens represent cases to handle. The workflow system allows to manage processes and associated data in a consistent manner. The paper is about how GrapeMilDeWS, which we call a Decision Worklow, is being implemented in YAWL. The advantages of workflows nets for this application are discussed in regards to alternatives like Statecharts and Colour Petri Nets...|$|R

This disease, caused by the plant pathogenic fungus Sphaerotheca fuliginea, is favored by moderate temperature and relative humidity, succulent plant growth and reduced light intensity. Potential new fungicides were evaluated for disease management in a field trial conducted {{in the spring of}} 1996. All tested products significantly reduced the level of disease compared to nontreated melon plants. In addition to compounds already registered for use on cantaloupe, such as Microthiol Special, Reach, Benlate, Bayleton and Bravo, the list of efficacious nonregistered agrochemicals included Quadris, Procure, BAS- 490, and Rally. The possible availability of new disease management tools in the future for <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> <b>of</b> cantaloupe and other melons could enhance our efforts to reduce the development of resistance to these fungicides by the pathogen...|$|R
