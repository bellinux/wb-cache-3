40|$|The {{convoluted}} (CPT) {{and straight}} (SPT) {{portions of the}} renal proximal tubule are susceptible to injury by {{a wide variety of}} chemical agents. These agents often affect the CPT or SPT selectively by proposed mechanisms usually attributed to tubular concentration, blood flow delivery patterns and tubuloglomerular feedback responses within the intact kidney. The innate cellular responses to chemical exposures remain virtually unexplored. Hence, the basic goal of this research was to develop an in vitro system that was conducive to examining the innate cellular differences in susceptibility between the CPT and SPT following in vitro exposure to mercuric chloride (HgCl₂), <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> (<b>K₂Cr₂O₇)</b> $ or hypoxic conditions. A renal cortical slicing technique was developed for these studies to position the CPT and SPT within discrete regions of slices made perpendicular to the cortical-papillary axis. An incubation vessel that could maintain the morophological and biochemical viability of slices for at least 12 hr was also developed. The selective necrosis of CPT induced by K₂Cr₂O₇ or hypoxic exposure, and SPT induced by HgCl₂, observed in vivo was reproduced in renal cortical slices exposed in vitro. Innate cellular uptake mechanisms were then investigated since the tissue distribution of each metal was found to be most concentrated within their respective injured cell type. The transport of PAH, TEA, phosphate, sulfate, glutathione and cysteine were examined as potential mechanisms for selective accumulation of these metals. K₂Cr₂O₇ caused a dose-dependent reduction in the uptake rate of sulfate by cortical slices, while phosphate, PAH, and TEA uptake were unaffected. Although HgCl₂ has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups its uptake as a complex to glutathione or cysteine was not enhanced. HgCl₂ also had no affect on the uptake rate of PAH or TEA even though both HgCl₂ and K₂Cr₂O₇ were able to reduce the steady state accumulation of these organic substrates...|$|E

Twenty fish in each group were exposed to tap water alone (Gr I) or containing Trifla in it at 100 ppm (Gr II) or <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> in it at 10 ppm (Gr III) or containing both i. e. Trifla plus <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> at 100 ppm and 10 ppm respectively Gr IV. Fish of group V were initially exposed to Trifla for fifteen days at 100 ppm and then exposed to <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> for next 15 days. Fish of group V were sacrificed on thirty first day while fish of remaining groups were sacrificed on sixteenth day. Behavior of fish was recorded and gill blood smear were made for micronuclei test. Fish remained unaffected in tap water alone and with trifla but <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> altered their behavior and induced micronuclei formation in their red blood cells. Fish exposed to both trifla & <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromates</b> are found protected but fish pretreated with trifla are not protected. This observation suggested that toxicity of <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> is declined in the presence of trifla means some interaction might have taken place between in them.

In contrast, hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene and only the highest dose (40 mg/kg b. w.) of <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate,</b> caused a significant dose-dependent decrease of glutamine synthetase activity in the kidney beginning 24 h after treatment. Finally, <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> and the highest dose (200 mg/kg b. w.) of hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene (48 h after the treatment) caused a significant dose-dependent loss of kidney protein content. The results suggest that p-aminohippuric acid accumulation is localized in the pars convoluta and confirm that glutamine synthetase is in the pars recta of the rat proximal tubule. p-Aminohippuric acid uptake impairment and glutamine synthetase activity loss caused by the highest doses of hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene and <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate,</b> respectively, suggests that high doses of segment-specific chemicals may involve other portions of the proximal tubule; in addition, the decrease of glutamine synthetase activity caused by <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> {{may be related to}} the protein content loss...|$|R

50|$|For all {{organic matter}} to be {{completely}} oxidized, an excess amount of <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> (or any oxidizing agent) must be present. Once oxidation is complete, the amount of excess <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> must be measured {{to ensure that the}} amount of Cr3+ can be determined with accuracy. To do so, the excess <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> is titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) until all of the excess oxidizing agent has been reduced to Cr3+. Typically, the oxidation-reduction indicator ferroin is added during this titration step as well. Once all the excess dichromate has been reduced, the ferroin indicator changes from blue-green to a reddish brown. The amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate added is equivalent to the amount of excess <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> added to the original sample. Note: Ferroin indicator is bright red from commercially prepared sources, but when added to a digested sample containing <b>potassium</b> <b>dichromate</b> it exhibits a green hue. During the titration the color of the indicator changes from a green hue to a bright blue hue to a reddish brown upon reaching the endpoint. Ferroin indicator changes from red to pale blue when oxidized.|$|R
