40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 18 genera of the swallowtail subfamily Papilioninae, four genera of Parnassiinae, and the monobasic Baroniinae are inferred based on 94 morphological characters and 5616 bp DNA from seven genes (16 S, COI, COII, ND 1, ND 5, EF- 1 alpha and wingless). Bayesian likelihood analyses show that Baroniinae are {{the sister of}} a clade comprising Parnassiinae and Papilioninae. Four Papilioninae tribes are recognized, Leptocircini, Teinopalpini, Papilionini and Troidini, with Leptocircini being the sister of the remaining tribes. Meandrusa and Teinopalpus are sister taxa and comprise the tribe Teinopalpini, which is the sister of a clade comprising Papilionini and Troidini. The tribe Troidini (<b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtails)</b> comprises two subtribes: Battina (including only Battus) and Troidina. The endemic Madagascan genus Pharmacophagus is consistently placed as the sister to the remaining Troidina. The non-Pharmacophagus Troidina are tentatively divided into a Neotropical lineage and an Australasian lineage. Dispersal–vicariance analyses indicate that past dispersal events are most important for explaining current distribution patterns of Papilionidae. However, {{the division of the}} non-Pharmacophagus Troidina into a Neotropical lineage and an Australasian lineage is possibly due to the final break-up of southern Gondwana. A fossil-calibrated relaxed Bayesian molecular clock analysis confirms that the ages of the lineages fit this scenario.

40|$|Species {{interact}} with each other both directly and indirectly, and indirect effects have similar or even stronger impacts on population dynamics and community structure than direct effect. Indirect effects were divided into two main processes based on the mode of transmitter response; density-mediated indirect effects (DMIEs) and trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs). To predict the indirect interactions caused by multiple processes, researchers need to detect the factor affecting the relative strength of these processes. Because there are differences in response speeds between trait changes via phenotypic plasticity at the individual level and demographic changes at the population level, the relative importance of these effects is expected to show time-scale dependency. However, no empirical study provided evidence supporting time-scale dependency of relative strength of DMIEs and TMIEs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate the time-scale dependency in density- and trait-mediated indirect effects in "large herbivore-plant-phytophagous insects" systems, in which plant quantity- and quality-mediated interactions were widely known. First, I explore general patterns in the direction of indirect effects of large herbivores on insect densities. Second, I examined indirect interactions between sika deer (Cervus nippon) -woody pipevine (Aristolochia kaempferi) -swallowtail butterfly (Byasa alcinous) in the Boso Peninsula, and estimated the time-scale dependency of plant quantity- and quality-mediated effects. Chapter 2 explores general patterns in the directions of indirect effects of large herbivores on insect densities. Large herbivores affect insect abundance both positively and negatively, or did not show significant impacts. The directions of total effects are determined by the relative strength of the positive and negative effects, which is assumed to associate with plant qualitative and quantitative changes induced by browsing. I focused on three factors associated with the appearance of density-mediated indirect effects, i. e., plant life-form, measures of insect density, and time-scale of study. As a result, differences in these factors affected the direction of indirect effects. Studies mediated by forb or grass exhibited negative effects on insect abundance in long-term studies, whereas studies mediated by trees tended to show positive effects on attack rates by insects in short-term studies. Consideration of the above three factors may help predict the occurrence of negative effects in nature. Chapter 3 investigated the processes of trait-mediated indirect effects in the "sika deer [...] woody <b>pipevine</b> [...] <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly" system. First, to assess how A. kaempferi responds to deer browsing, I conducted field experiments using deer exclosures. Outside the exclosures, deer browsing stimulated the regrowth of A. kaempferi. Simulated browsing also induced compensatory growth of A. kaempferi and improved leaf nutritional and physical qualities for insects. Second, to examine the young leaf utilization by B. alcinous in response to increasing deer densities, I conducted field survey on the availability and utilization patterns of young leaves across deer-density gradient. Young leaf availability increased with deer density, and young leaf utilization by butterflies also increased. Third, to examine the effects of plant trait-change on larval and pupal performance of B. alcinous, I conducted laboratory experiments raring larvae at different food-quality treatments. Byasa alcinous larvae fed by good quality leaves increased their survival rate, growth rate, and decreased the incidence of pupal diapause. Consequently, the combination between plastic response of A. kaempferi to deer browsing and plastic response of B. alcinous to food quality may lead to positive trait-mediated effects. Chapter 4 evaluated the effect of deer on the density of B. alcinous mediated by the changes in quantity and quality of A. kaempferi. The density of sika deer population in the Boso Peninsula was estimated for 15 years, and areas with different browsing histories are available. I conducted the field survey for A. kaempferi, and estimated the carry-over rate of responses of plant quantity and quality by the relationship between plant response and temporal trends in deer density. Leaf density of A. kaempferi exhibited high carry-over rate of the effect of deer browsing and cumulatively decreased in response to successive deer herbivory, while percentage of young leaves increased with current deer density. The high density of B. alcinous were observed in areas with high leaf density and high percentage of young leaves. Total estimated indirect effects showed a positive trend in short-term due to relatively strong quality-mediated effect, but they showed no specific trends in long-term because quality- and quantity- mediated effects canceled each other. According to these results, I found that the indirect effects of large herbivores on insects mediated by host plants exhibit a time-scale dependency. This study provides the first empirical evidence supporting the time-scale dependency of the relative importance of density- and trait-mediated effects. In large herbivore-plant insects system, the transmitter plants show slow and cumulative responses, which may cause time-scale dependency. In trophic cascade studies, transmitter species often have a short generational time and sometimes the recruitment to the local population in the following year is limited by large spatial-scale processes. In such cases, cumulative responses over years are unlikely to appear in small spatial scale experiments. In nature, inducer populations can show both fast- and slow-time scale dynamics, which may cause the rapid trait changes and the cumulative density changes in transmitter. To understand indirect interactions under the transient conditions, researchers should be in mind the existence of time-scale dependency. 報告番号: 甲 28109; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3825 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科生圏システム学専...|$|R

50|$|Battus philenor hirsuta, the California <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> or hairy <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> that is {{endemic to}} Northern California in the United States. Populations are {{found throughout the}} Sacramento Valley {{and outside of the}} valley in Contra Costa and Alameda counties. The butterfly is black with hindwings that have iridescent green-blue coloring above and a row of red spots below; the caterpillars are black with fleshy protrusions and red spots. The subspecies' butterflies are smaller in size and hairier than the species, and they lay eggs in larger clutch sizes than the species. The egg clutches are deposited on the shoot tips of the California pipevine, a perennial vine native to riparian, chaparral, and woodland ecosystems of the California Coast Ranges, Sacramento Valley, and Sierra Nevada foothills. The larvae feed exclusively on the foliage and shoot tips of the pipevine, although adults eat floral nectar from a variety of plants. The plant contains a toxic substance, aristolochic acid. The larvae sequester the toxin, and both the juvenile and adult butterflies have high and toxic concentrations of the aristolochic acid in their tissues. Throughout the range of the species, Battus philenor, other butterflies and moths mimic the distinctive coloration of the swallowtail to avoid predators. However, there are no known mimics of the Californian subspecies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Larvae of the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> Battus philenor, feed {{on plants}} in the genus Aristolochia, which {{contains}} aristolochic acids, toxic alkaloids unique to the Aristolochiaceae. Pipevine swallowtails sequester these compounds and, as a consequence, are chemically defended against many natural enemies. In California, the primary aristolochic acid present in the butterfly is aristolochic acid I. Newly eclosed adult females possess greater amounts of these sequestered toxins compared to males. However, {{over the course of}} the flight season, the aristolochic acid content of females in the population declines, whereas male aristolochic acid content remains relatively constant. Transference of sequestered aristolochic acids to eggs by females might explain the decline of these sequestered chemical defenses observed over time. We found no evidence that males transfer aristolochic acids to females via the spermatophore. The possibility that females at the end of the flight season may be automimics of males is discussed.

Pipevine swallowtails sequester these compounds and use them for their own defense against predators. Numerous palatable butterflies are involved in Batesian mimicry complexes with B. philenor over its range. The California subspecies of the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> B. philenor hirsuta, has no mimics. Analysis of the butterfly and its only host plant, Aristolochia californica, indicate that both contain aristolochic acid. Aristolochic acid (I) and (II) are the primary aristolochic acids found in A. californica. The highest concentration of aristolochic acids was found in the flowers, which bloom before B. philenor emerges. Concentrations of aristolochic acids decreased in the leaves but not in stem tissue {{over the course of the}} season. Butterflies contained primarily aristolochic acid (I). Aristolochic acid content of individuals from Arizona, which are involved in mimicry complexes, did not differ from California populations.

40|$|Abstract We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that larvae of the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly, Battus philenor, employ behavioral and phenotypic plasticity as thermoregula-tory strategies. These larvae are phenotypically varied across their range with predominantly black larvae (southeastern USA and California) and red larvae (western Texas, Arizona) occurring in different regions. Two years of field observations in south Texas indicate {{that the proportion of}} red larvae increases with increasing daily temperatures as the growing season progresses. Larvae were also observed to shift their mi-crohabitats by climbing on non-host vegetation and avoided excessive heat in their feeding microhabitat. Larvae of ten half-sib families from populations in south Texas and California, reared under different tempera-ture regimes in common garden experiments, exhibited plasticity in larval phenotype, with larvae from both populations producing the red phenotype at tempera-tures greater than 30 C and maintaining the black phenotype at cooler temperatures. However, larvae from Texas were more tolerant of higher temperatures, showing no decrease in growth rate in the highest tem-perature (maximum seasonal temperature) treatment, compared to the California population. In a field experiment, black larvae were found to have higher body temperatures when exposed to sunlight compared to red larvae. These results suggest that microhabitat shifts and the color polyphenism observed in <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> larvae may be the adaptive strategies that enable larvae to avoid critical thermal maximum temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{plants with}} {{sequestering}} specialists {{are presented with}} a problem because plant derived toxins protect herbivores against natural enemies. It {{has been suggested that}} early induction of toxins and later relaxation of these defenses may help the plant resolve this problem because neonate caterpillars incur the physiological cost of dealing with toxins in early life, but are denied toxins when they are able to sequester them efficiently. In California, the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail,</b> Battus philenor L. (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), feed exclusively on Aristolochia californica Torrey (Aristolochiaceae), an endemic vine that contains toxic alkaloids called aristolochic acids that caterpillars sequester to provide chemical defense in immature and adult stages. In a field experiment, the concentration of aristolochic acids doubled in the plant following leaf damage and returned to constitutive levels after six days. Neonate <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> caterpillars showed no aversion to high levels of aristolochic acid in a preference test. Caterpillars reared on leaves with supplemented aristolochic acid showed no physiological cost or increased mortality compared to caterpillars reared on un-supplemented leaves.

Females avoided oviposition on plants bearing artificially constructed models identical to larvae in shape, size and colour pattern.

40|$|Abstract. Ovipositing {{females of}} the <b>pipevine</b> <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly, Battus philenor, detect the {{presence}} of eggs laid by other females on their host plants. The presence of eggs on a plant inhibits oviposition by a female that discovers it. The selection pressure responsible for the evolution and maintenance of discrimination against plants with eggs appears to be lower survival from egg to adult of eggs laid on plants already containing eggs than on plants without eggs. Several authors have proposed that a preference in an ovipositing insect for a particular host plant or group of host plants {{is the result of}} natural selection for behaviour that discriminates against plants on which egg and larval survival is poor (Wiklund 1975; Chew 1977; Rausher 1978 a, b; Smiley 1978).

40|$|Animals {{sometimes}} develop conspicuous projections on or {{near their}} heads as, e. g., weap-onry, burrowing or digging tools, and probes to search for resources.

40|$|AbstractMelanism in Lepidoptera, either {{industrial}} or in mimicry, {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly cited examples of natural selection [1, 2]. Despite extensive studies of the frequency and maintenance of melanic genes in insect populations [1, 2], there has been little work on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Nowhere is butterfly melanism more striking than in the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) of North America [3 – 5]. In this species, females can be either yellow (wild type) or black (melanic). The melanic form is a Batesian mimic of the distasteful <b>Pipevine</b> <b>Swallowtail</b> (Battus philenor), which is also black in overall color. Melanism in P. glaucus is controlled by a single Y-linked (female) black gene [6]. Melanic females, therefore, always have melanic daughters. Black melanin replaces the background yellow in melanic females. Here, we show that the key enzyme involved is N-β-alanyl-dopamine-synthase (BAS), which shunts dopamine from the melanin pathway into the production of the yellow color pigment papiliochrome and also provides products for cuticle sclerotization. In melanic females, this enzyme is suppressed, leading to abnormal melanization of a formerly yellow area, and wing scale maturation is also delayed in the same area. This raises the possibility that either reduced BAS activity itself is preventing scale sclerotization (maturation) or, in contrast, that the delay in scale maturation precludes expression of BAS at the correct stage. Together, these data show how changes in expression of a single gene product could result in multiple wing color phenotypes. The implications for the genetic control of mimicry in other Lepidoptera are discussed...|$|E
