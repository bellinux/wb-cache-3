40|$|Individual {{particles}} {{that on a}} mass basis consist dominantly of the components ammonium sulfate, organic material, and water are a common class of submicron particles found in today's atmosphere. Here we use (1) the organic-to-sulfate (org:sulf) mass ratio of the overall particle and (2) the oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) elemental ratio of the organic component as input variables in <b>parameterisations</b> that predict the critical relative humidity of several different types of particle phase transitions. These transitions include liquid-liquid phase separation (SRH), efflorescence (ERH), and deliquescence (DRH). Experiments were conducted by optical microscopy for 11 different oxygenated organic-ammonium sulfate systems covering the range 0. 1 &lt; org:sulf &lt; 12. 8 and 0. 29 &lt; O:C &lt; 1. 33. These new data, {{in conjunction with other}} data already available in the literature, were used to develop the <b>parameterisations</b> SRH(org:sulf, O:C), ERH(org:sulf, O:C), and DRH(org:sulf, O:C). The <b>parameterisations</b> correctly predicted SRH within 15 % RH for 86 % of the measurements, ERH within 5 % for 86 % of the measurements, and DRH within 5 % for 95 % of the measurements. The applicability of the derived <b>parameterisations</b> beyond the training data set was tested against observations for organic-sulfate particles produced in an environmental chamber. The organic component consisted of secondary organic material produced by the oxidation of isoprene, α-pinene, and β-caryophyllene. The predictions of the <b>parameterisations</b> were also tested against data from the Southern Great Plains, Oklahoma, USA. The observed ERH and DRH values for both the chamber and field data agreed within 5 % RH with the value predicted by the <b>parameterisations</b> using the measured org:sulf and O:C ratios as the input variables...|$|R

40|$|Cloud droplet number {{concentration}} prediction {{is central to}} large-scale weather and climate modelling. The benchmark cloud parcel model calculation of aerosol particle growth and activation, by diffusion of vapour to aerosol particles in a rising parcel of air experiencing adiabatic expansion, is too computationally expensive for use in large-scale global models. Therefore the process of activation of aerosol particles into cloud droplets is parameterised with an aim to strike the optimum balance between numerical expense and accuracy. We present a detailed systematic evaluation of three cloud droplet activation <b>parameterisations</b> that are widely used in large-scale models and one recent update. In all cases, {{it is found that}} {{there is a tendency to}} overestimate the fraction of activated aerosol particles when the aerosol particle "median diameter" is large (between 250 and 2000 nm) in a single lognormal mode simulation. This is due to an infinite "effective simulation time" of the <b>parameterisations</b> compared to a prescribed simulation time in the parcel model. This problem arises in the <b>parameterisations</b> because it is assumed that a parcel of air rises to the altitude where maximum supersaturation occurs, regardless of whether this altitude is above the cloud top. Such behaviour is problematic because, in some cases, large aerosol can completely suppress the activation of drops. In some cases when the "median diameter" is small (between 5 and 250 nm) in a single lognormal mode the fraction of activated drops is underestimated by the <b>parameterisations.</b> Secondly, it is found that in dual-mode cases there is a systematic tendency towards underestimation of the fraction of activated drops, which is due to the methods used by the <b>parameterisations</b> to approximate the sink of water vapour...|$|R

40|$|In {{numerical}} {{weather prediction}} models, <b>parameterisations</b> are used {{as an alternative to}} spectral modelling. One type of <b>parameterisations</b> are the so-called methods of moments. In the present study, two different methods of moments, a presumed-number-density-function method with finite upper integration limit and a quadrature method, are applied to a one-dimensional test case (‘rainshaft’) for drop sedimentation. The results are compared with those of a reference spectral model. An error norm is introduced, which is based on several characteristic properties of the drop ensemble relevant to the cloud microphysics context. This error norm makes it possible to carry out a quantitative comparison between the two methods. It turns out that the two moment methods presented constitute an improvement regarding two-moment presumed-number-density-function methods from literature for a variety of initial conditions. However, they are excelled by a traditional three-moment presumed-number-density-function method which requires less computational effort. Comparisons of error scores and moment profiles reveal that error scores alone should not be taken for a comparison of <b>parameterisations,</b> since moment profile characteristics can be lost in the integral value of the error norm...|$|R
