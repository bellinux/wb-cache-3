5|$|After {{receiving}} the Wake Forest kickoff, however, Georgia Tech's hopes were quickly deflated by three <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> resulted in negative yardage or no gain. Georgia Tech {{was forced into}} its final punt of the game, and Wake Forest received the ball and ran out the remaining time on the clock.

5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Florida State {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 32-yard line with a 2017 lead and 12:08 remaining in the game. On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E

5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy Feint Astrologue.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars also note {{that it is impossible}} to determine if the play was written before, after, or at the same time as The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> Blount registered on that date.|$|E

5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling on the ball after taking the field on offense.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E

None of the Orioles' first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. One pick, Gregg Olson (1988), has won the MLB Rookie of the Year Award; he won the award in 1989. The Orioles had the first overall selection once in the draft, which they used on Ben McDonald (1989).

5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at times in the past for making risk/reward <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more responsible in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame {{opened the}} third quarter on offense, but Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Golson pass that gave Alabama {{possession}} at the Irish three-yard line. The Crimson Tide then drove 97 yards in ten <b>plays</b> <b>that</b> ended with a 34-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Amari Cooper that extended their lead to 35–0. Notre Dame then responded with their first points of the game on the drive that ensued with a two-yard Golson touchdown run that made the score 35–7. Alabama then began their final scoring drive of the night. The final Crimson Tide touchdown came {{early in the fourth}} quarter on a 19-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Cooper that capped a 14-play, 86-yard drive that took 7:41 off the clock and made the score 42–7. The Irish then made the final score 42–14 when Golson threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Theo Riddick. The teams then traded punts with the final play of the game being a short Notre Dame run as time expired.|$|E
