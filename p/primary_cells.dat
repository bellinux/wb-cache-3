These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

In 1828, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a small model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track.

25|$|Electrochemistry is {{the direct}} {{transformation}} of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. Electrochemical electricity generation {{is important in}} portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells,</b> such as the common zinc-carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but many types of cells are used as storage systems rather than primary generation systems.

25|$|In the mid-2000s, Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} a novel inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, known as ABT-737.

ABT-737 is superior to previous BCL-2 inhibitors given its higher affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. In vitro studies showed that <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with B-cell malignancies are sensitive to ABT-737. ABT-737 does not directly induce apoptosis; it enhances the effects of apoptotic signals and causes single-agent-mechanism-based killing of cells in small-cell lung carcinoma and lymphoma lines.|$|E
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the isolation and characterization of rhamnogalacturonan II, a hitherto unobserved {{component of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls of dicotyledonous plants. Rhamnogalacturonan II constitutes 3 to 4 % of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls of suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. Rhamnogalacturonan II {{is a very complex}} polysaccharide yielding, upon hydrolysis, 10 different monosaccharides including the rarely observed sugars apiose, 2 -O-methylxylose, and 2 -O-methylfucose. In addition, rhamnogalacturonan II is characterized by the rarely observed glycosyl interconnections of 2 -linked glucuronosyl, 3, 4 -linked fucosyl, and 3 -linked rhamnosyl residues. These glycosyl linkages have never previously been detected in <b>primary</b> sycamore <b>cell</b> walls. Evidence is presented which suggests that polysaccharides similar to rhamnogalacturonan II are present in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls of the three other dicotyledonous plants examined...|$|R

2500|$|Vaccine {{production}} has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). [...] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein {{derived from the}} viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus {{may need to be}} inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.|$|E

40|$|Xylan is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of many plant <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>cell</b> walls. However, the structure and function of xylan in the dicotyledon <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall is not well understood. Here, we characterized a xylan that is specific to tissues enriched in Arabidopsis <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Unlike previously described xylans, this xylan carries a pentose linked 1 – 2 to the a- 1, 2 -D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) side chains on the b- 1, 4 -Xyl back-bone. The frequent and precisely regular spacing of GlcA substitutions every six xylosyl residues along the backbone is also unlike that previously observed in secondary cell wall xylan. Molecular genetics, in vitro assays, and expression data suggest that IRX 9 L, IRX 10 L and IRX 14 are required for xylan backbone synthe-sis in <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesising tissues. IRX 9 and IRX 10 {{are not involved in}} the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall xylan synthesis but are functionally exchangeable with IRX 9 L and IRX 10 L.

40|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall is {{a complex}} multipolymer system whose {{composite}} structure has been mostly determined from chemical and biochemical studies. Although the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall serves a central role, {{with regard to the}} connective properties of fibres, knowledge about the interactions among the polymers, {{when it comes to the}} mechanical properties, is very limited. The physical properties of the polymers, i. e. their elastic and viscous deformations, as well as the ultrastructure of the polymers, i. e. the interactions among the polymers in the outer fibre wall layers that lead to this behaviour, are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine how the different wood polymers, viz. lignin, protein, pectin, xyloglucan and cellulose, interact in the outer fibre wall layers of the spruce wood tracheid. The initial objective was to separate an enriched <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall material from a first stage TMP, by means of screening and centri-cleaning. From this material, consisting of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall (P) and outer secondary cell wall (S 1) materials, thin sheets were prepared and analysed using a number of different analytical methods. The major measuring technique used was dynamic Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy in combination with dynamic 2 D FT-IR spectroscopy. This technique is based on the detection of small changes in molecular absorption that occur when a sinusoidally stretched sample undergoes low strain. The molecular groups affected by the stretching respond in a specific way, depending on their environment, while the unaffected molecular groups provide no response to the dynamic spectra, by producing no elastic or viscous signals. Moreover, the dynamic 2 D FT-IR spectroscopy provides useful information about various intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, which influence the reorientability of functional groups in a polymer material. Measurements of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall material, using dynamic FT-IR spectroscopy, indicated that strong interactions exist among lignin, protein and pectin, as well as among cellulose, xyloglucan and pectin in this particular layer. This was in contrast to the secondary cell wall, where interactions of cellulose with glucomannan and of xylan with lignin were dominant. It was also indicated that the most abundant crystalline cellulose in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall of spruce wood fibres is the cellulose Iβ allomorph, which was also in contrast to the secondary cell wall, where the cellulose Iα allomorph is more dominant. The presence of strong interactions among the polymers in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall and, especially, the relatively high content of pectin and protein, showed that there is a very good possibility of selectively attacking these polymers in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall. The first selective reaction chosen was a low degree of sulphonation, applied by an impregnation pretreatment of chips with a very low charge of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3). This selective reaction caused some structural modification of the lignin, a weakening of the interactions between lignin;pectin, lignin;protein and pectin;protein, as well as an increased softening of the sulphonated <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall material, when compared to the unsulphonated <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall material. All this resulted in an increased swelling ability of the material. QC 2010112...|$|R
