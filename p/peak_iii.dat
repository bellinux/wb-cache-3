In contrast to the catalytic subunit, <b>Peak</b> <b>III</b> protein kinase phosphorylated casein more rapidly than histone. <b>Peak</b> <b>III</b> was insensitive to the heat-stable protein inhibitor of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinases and appeared to have a higher requirement for ATP than did the catalytic subunit. <b>Peak</b> <b>III</b> catalyzed the conversion of glycogen synthase (UDPglucose:glycogen alpha- 4 -glucosyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 11) from the I (glucose- 6 -phosphate-independent) to the D (glucose- 6 -phosphate-dependent) form. This conversion was dependent on Mg- 2 + and ATP and was unaffected by cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or the protein inhibitor. Glycogen synthase I in the soluble fraction of kidney medulla could be converted to the D form by endogenous glycogen synthase I kinase if Mg- 2 + and ATP were added.

We now report that MSA is exclusively associated wth an albumin-size binding protein in fetal rat serum; the growth hormone-dependent, gamma globulin-size binding protein, which predominates in the older animal, is absent from fetal rat serum. When 125 I-MSA was incubated with fetal rat serum and then gel filtered on Sephadex G- 200, specific radioactivity eluted in the void volume (peak I) and the albumin region (peak III); by contrast, specific radioactivity eluted mainly in the gamma globulin region (peak II) in adult rat serum. Pools of the Sephadex G- 200 fractions were chromatographed on Sephadex G- 50, in 1 M acetic acid, to separate the binding protein from IGF activity. Analysis of IGF activity by chick embryo fibroblast bioassay, competitive protein binding assay, and MSA by radioimmunoassay revealed that all the IGF activity and MSA in fetal rat serum resided in <b>peak</b> <b>III.</b> Measurement of MSA binding capacity of the stripped binding protein by Scatchard analysis demonstrated {{that the majority of}} binding capacity also was found in <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> in fetal rat serum; most of MSA binding capacity was in peak II in adult rat serum.

In an attempt to examine the possible central effects of MPB, notably on cyclic nucleotides and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE; EC 3. 1. 4. 17), rats were orally treated with the drug (0. 4 % in rat food) for 3 weeks with cortex extracts being used for the various determinations. Three isozymes were identified by DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography, namely the calmodulin/calcium-stimulated form or PDE I (peak I), the cGMP-stimulated form or PDE II (peak II), and an independent form not affected by either calmodulin or cGMP also known as PDE IV (<b>peak</b> <b>III).</b> The presence of MPB induced a significant decrease in cortical cAMP, as well as strongly stimulating the activity of PDE IV (<b>peak</b> <b>III).</b> In addition, a small, yet significant, increase in cGMP levels was observed. Since no increase in cGMP hydrolysis was observed, we conclude that chronic ingestion of MPB induces a preference for cAMP hydrolysis, which was confirmed by the increase in PDE IV (<b>peak</b> <b>III)</b> activity. PDE IV is a membrane-bound, low K(m) PDE exhibiting high selectivity for cAMP hydrolysis. While there was an increase in cGMP, we failed to observe an increase in the activity of the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE II).

Three NAD(P) H dehydrogenases are released from these mitochondria by sonication, and these enzymes were partially purified using fast protein liquid chromatography. One of the enzymes, designated peak I, is capable of oxidizing NADPH and the β form of NADH. The other two activities, peaks II and III, oxidize only β-NADH. All three peaks are insensitive to divalent cation chelators and a complex I inhibitor, rotenone. The major component to peak I is a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 42 kilodaltons. Peak I activity was insensitive to platanetin, a specific inhibitor of the exogenous dehydrogenase, and insensitive to added Ca 2 + or Mg 2 +. Peak I displayed a broad pH activity profile with an optimum between 7. 5 and 8. 0 for both NADPH and NADH.

Here, we report the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) of strained and unstrained GaSe flakes.

40|$|Carbon-doped {{aluminium}} oxide, α-Al₂O₃ : C, is {{a highly}} sensitive luminescence dosimeter. The high sensitivity of α-Al₂O₃ : C {{has been attributed to}} large concentrations of oxygen vacancies, F and F⁺ centres, induced in the material during its preparation. The material is prepared in a highly reducing atmosphere in the presence of carbon. In the luminescence process, electrons are trapped in F-centre defects as a result of irradiation of the material. Thermal or optical release of trapped electrons leads to emission of light, thermoluminescence (TL) or optically stimulated light (OSL) respectively. The thermoluminescence technique is used to study point defects involved in luminescence of α-Al₂O₃ : C. A glow curve of α-Al₂O₃ : C, generally, shows three peaks; the main dosimetric peak of high intensity (peak II) and two other peaks of lower intensity called secondary glow peaks (peaks I and III). The overall aim of our work was to study the TL mechanisms responsible for secondary glow peaks in α-Al₂O₃ : C. The dynamics of charge movement between centres during the TL process was studied. The phototransferred thermoluminescence (PTTL) from secondary glow peaks was also studied. The kinetic analysis of TL from secondary peaks has shown that the activation energy of peak I is 0. 7 eV and that of <b>peak</b> <b>III,</b> 1. 2 eV. The frequency factor, the frequency at which an electron attempts to escape a trap, was found near the range of the Debye vibration frequency. Values of the activation energy are consistent within a variety of methods used. The two peaks follow first order kinetics as confirmed by the TM-Tstop method. A linear dependence of TL from peak I on dose is observed at various doses from 0. 5 to 2. 5 Gy. The peak position for peak I was also independent on dose, further confirmation that peak I is of first order kinetics. Peak I suffers from thermal fading with storage with a half-life of about 120 s. The dependence of TL intensity for peak I increased as a function of heating rate from 0. 2 to 6 ºCs⁻¹. In contrast to the TL intensity for peak I, the intensity of TL for <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> decreases with an increase of heating rate from 0. 2 to 6 ºCs⁻¹. This is evidence of thermal quenching for <b>peak</b> <b>III.</b> Parameters W = 1. 48 ± 0 : 10 eV and C = 4 x 10 ¹³ of thermal quenching were calculated from <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> intensities at different heating rates. Thermal cleaning of <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> and the glow curve deconvolution methods confirmed that the main peak is actually overlapped by a small peak (labeled peak IIA). The kinetic analysis of peak IIA showed that it is of first order kinetics and that its activation energy is 1 : 0 eV. In addition, the peak IIA is affected by thermal quenching. Another secondary peak appears at 422 ºC (peak IV). However, the kinetic analysis of TL from peak IV was not studied because its intensity is not well defined. A heating rate of 0. 4 ºCs⁻¹ was used after a dose of 3 Gy in kinetic analysis of peaks IIA and III. The study of the PTTL showed that peaks I and II were regenerated under PTTL but <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> was not. Various effects of the PTTL for peaks I and II for different preheating temperatures in different samples were observed. The effect of annealing at 900 ºC for 15 minutes between measurements following each illumination time was studied. The effect of dose on secondary peaks was also studied in this work. The kinetic analysis of the PTTL intensity for peak I showed that its activation energy is 0. 7 eV, consistent with the activation energy of the normal TL for peak I. The PTTL intensity from peak I fades rapidly with storage compared with the thermal fading from peak I of the normal TL. The PTTL intensity for peak I decreases as a function of heating rate. This decrease was attributed to thermal quenching. Thermal quenching was not observed {{in the case of the}} normal TL intensity. The cause of this contrast requires further study...|$|E
40|$|From the {{membrane}} fraction of Escherichia coli K- 12 strain, four protein fractions (peaks I, IIa, IIb, and III) which have affinity for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) have been isolated. The molecular weights of these proteins are between 12, 000 and 8, 000. Only the <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> fraction contains a protein that binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA, whereas the others contain proteins that bind also to double-stranded DNA. The binding {{activity of the}} peak IIb protein is inhibited {{in the presence of}} polyuridylic acid. Peak I and peak IIa protein fractions behave like hydrophobic proteins...|$|E
40|$|Several {{forms of}} {{phosphodiesterase}} {{are present in}} the male gonad, and their relative concentrations vary during testicular development. On the basis of kinetic analysis and chromatography on DEAE cellulose, 3 forms were separated: (a) a high-affinity cGMP phosphodiesterase, regulated by Ca 2 + and calmodulin, similar to a form described in different tissues (peak I); (b) a high-affinity cAMP form insensitive to Ca 2 +, which cannot be readily compared with forms described elsewhere (peak II); and (c) a high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase, Ca 2 +- and calmodulin-insensitive, corresponding to the "hormone-regulated" form described in several systems (<b>peak</b> <b>III).</b> The elution pattern of peak I and calmodulin stimulation were dependent on free calcium concentration during cytosol preparation and chromatography. This datum and rechromatography in {{the presence or absence of}} excess calmodulin suggested that the enzyme complexes calmodulin in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner and is therefore activated. Moreover, whereas peak I was observed in all cell compartments of the testis, peak II was present in germ cells and <b>peak</b> <b>III</b> was found mainly in somatic cells. During development of the testis, a relevant enhancement in the ratio between cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity was observed together with an overall increase of phosphodiesterase activity, thus suggesting that the previously described increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity during testis maturation should be ascribed to forms present in both germ cells and somatic cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{characteristics of}} demyelinated axons {{are sensitive to}} changes in plasma calcium concentration. This study investigated the effect of verapamil, a calcium antagonist drug, on brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials in multiple sclerosis patients. Eight clinically stable patients with abnormal visual and/or brainstem auditory evoked potentials and four normal volunteers were studied. During intravenous infusions of verapamil (mean plasma concentration = 130. 0 +/- 56. 4 ng/ml), the latencies of <b>peaks</b> <b>III</b> and V were shortened (p less than 0. 05) in multiple sclerosis patients with abnormally prolonged BAEPs. The I-III (delta = 0. 08 ms), III-V (delta = 0. 46 ms), and I-V (delta = 0. 53 ms) interpeak intervals, and the P 100 latency (delta = 10. 15 ms) of the visual evoked potential were similarly affected in these patients. In contrast, normal evoked potentials of both multiple sclerosis patients and control subjects were not altered compared to baseline recordings obtained 24 hours earlier. Intravenous verapamil, therefore, alters the BAEPs and VEPs of some multiple sclerosis patients with demyelinated auditory and visual pathways by shortening pathologically prolonged latencies toward normal. The present study suggests pharmacological manipulation of calcium-dependent processes, possibly {{at the level of}} the demyelinated axon, can acutely facilitate central conduction of electrical impulses in some patients with clinically stable multiple sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} penicillin binding {{capacity of}} a postexponential culture of Staphylococcus aureus remains constant, but that of a sporulating Bacillus subtilis culture fluctuates dramatically. An initial decrease in binding capacity during presporulation events is followed by two distinct intervals of enhanced specific binding capacity during the postlogarithmic growth of a sporulating B. subtilis culture. The first peak of enhanced binding occurs during septation, when enzymes for germ cell wall formation are present; and the second peak coincides with cortical biosynthesis. The specific postlogarithmic binding capacities {{of a number of}} Spo− mutants of B. subtilis were examined to ascertain if specific asporogenous mutations altered the binding pattern observed with the wild-type organism. Four distinct postexponential binding patterns were recognized: (i) a low, constant binding capacity resembling the binding pattern of S. aureus, (ii) a decrease in binding capacity with no subsequent significant <b>peaks,</b> (<b>iii)</b> a decrease in binding capacity followed by a single peak corresponding to the first peak seen with the wild type, (iv) a pattern similar to the wild type. The fourth pattern was observed in a mutant blocked during stage III of sporogenesis which produced forespores that never became refractile. Mutations blocking either one or both periods of enhanced postlogarithmic binding were interspersed throughout a linkage group of spore genes next to lys- 2 on the B. subtilis chomosome...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with internal friction due to crystal lattice defects. Particular attention is given to losses involving dislocation motion which are observed in metals. Five characteristic types of loss are distinguished experimentally. These are i) the Bordoni Peaks, ii) the Hasiguti <b>Peaks</b> <b>iii)</b> a damping observed at high temperatures which increases exponentially with temperature, iv) a damping which is independent of the stress amplitude at which it is measured, providing this is small, end which is also dependent on {{the frequency of the}} stress wave, and v) a damping which is dependent on the measuring stress amplitude but independent of the measuring frequency. An attempt is made to relate each of these five losses to a specific dislocation damping mechanism. The individual damping mechanisms ere based on one or other of three general processes by which energy may be lost from an oscillating length of dislocation. These were firstly a relaxation process, secondly a damped resonance process end thirdly a static hysteresis process. Internal friction measurements are found to give information on, for example, the nature and distribution of point defects and dislocations, the interaction between point defects and dislocations, the magnitude of the Peierls stress and the dynamics of dislocation motion. In connection with the latter the string model of dislocation motion is compared with the kink model. <p...|$|R
