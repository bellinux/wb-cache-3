Using an inductive approach, coding and analysis was carried out independently by three of the researchers to increase inter-coder reliability and research rigour (Boyatzis, 1998; Fereday & Muir-Cochrane, 2006; Guest, 2012). The analysis extended beyond identifying semantic phrases or words in the data by further identifying, interrogating and explicating underlying latent ideas and meanings related specifically to the research question (Boyatzis, 1998; Guest, 2012).

The paper problematizes {{diagnostic}} {{work as a}} solely {{technical and}} rational activity by presenting an analysis focused on the social and organizational practices in which diagnosis is embedded. The analysis of a troubleshooting episode in an Italian internet company shows how diagnostic work is realized: 1) through collaboration sustained by specific knowledge distribution among designers (different but overlapping competences); 2) intersubjectively and discursively as an activity characterized by specific and diverse forms of participation and interwined with material intervention in the system; 3) following a situated rationality which proceeds by gradual approximations to achieve partial or provisional solutions while also taking account of organizational goals and needs. In particular the paper discusses how diagnosis is shaped by time pressure, flexible roles and distributed responsibilities, absent <b>participants,</b> <b>narratives</b> as specialized discourses...|$|E

Readers used a coding rubric to assess the motivations for and the obstacles to seeking forgiveness as written in the narratives. These motivations and obstacles were explored in the context of a three-stage forgiveness model. The main research question of the study was to explore common reasons that people did or did not seek forgiveness and the methods that they used to do so.

A significant number also sought forgiveness for the benefit of the victim. Narratives about obstacles to seeking forgiveness indicated that the majority of people did not seek forgiveness because they felt that the victim deserved it. A smaller percentage did not seek forgiveness because they did not acknowledge their error or responsibility for any harm that was caused. Correlational analysis showed that individuals who sought forgiveness for the benefit of the victim were more likely to experience a positive effect on the relationship.

As clinicians we are engaged in an inter-subjective experience to acquire knowledge and understanding of the person before us. Our person-in-context lens and how we apply it is only as expansive and/or limited as our professional knowledge base allows. Although researchers in the psychological and behavioral sciences have briefly explored the impact of gender socialization within the Latino communities, known as machismo and marianismo, as it relates to clinical practice implications, empirical inquiry remains limited. Furthermore, the breadth of inquiry on machismo has focused primarily on how it relates to Latino men. Machismo, as an intricate part of the home and the culture, directly affects Latina women and their development. This qualitative study aimed to acquire an in-depth understanding of the lived experience of Latina women with machismo, and its impact on identity development.

Individuals are progressively moving from meeting romantic partners face to face to meeting and engaging with individuals online. There is ample {{evidence to support the}} view that individuals do initiate romantic relationships online and often these relationships progress offline. The primary focus of online research had been conducted by communication and linguistic scholars while very little research has been conducted into the psychological conceptualisation of online relationships. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} available research pertaining to the development of romantic relationships online and more so in South Africa. The current study utilised Sternberg’s Triangular model of love and the Johari window as a framework for understanding the concepts involved in online romantic relationships. The study specifically aimed to explore and describe the lived experiences of individuals who engage in online dating. The parameters of the study included the elements that comprise the online relationship, the subjective meaning attached to the relationships, and the processes these relationships encompass. The study moreover aimed to explore the progression of the online relationship. The study used a qualitative, phenomenological approach using snowball sampling and semi structured interviews to collect data.

With {{the growth in the}} school-age population, the need to attract and retain quality teachers will become even greater. The purpose of this narrative inquiry was to explore factors that influenced teachers?? decisions to remain in an urban school. A qualitative research design was used by conducting one interview with 13 teachers in an intermediate school (5 th & 6 th grades) in an urban school district near Houston, Texas. The participants?? years of experience in this study ranged from 5 - 33 years. They presented a diverse range of age, career experiences, and cultural/ethnic backgrounds. Data were collected through audio-taped interviews that lasted 45 - 90 minutes conducted in their classrooms before or after school. Additional follow-up questions and clarification statements were obtained from the participants where it was warranted. The transcribed interviews and the follow-up questions were analyzed using the Labov method of structuring narratives into stories. This method was used in order to compare <b>participants??</b> <b>narratives</b> to identify emergentthemes among the rich stories that the participants shared with me. The findings are presented as three emerging themes on why teachers choose to remain in an urban school. These themes were recurrent and dominant throughout the narratives. Participants generally felt that there were three main reasons why they remained to teach in this urban school. Those three reasons manifested themselves in the form of themes. Those three dominant themes were: (a) making a {{difference in the lives of}} young people, (b) having no reason to leave, and (c) having administrative support, which was the leading factor that influenced teachers to remain in an urban school.

40|$|Background and Aims Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) {{remains a}} poorly {{understood}} condition, shrouded by debate, stigma, and uncertainty. Unsurprisingly, the little available {{research suggests that}} caring for a Child or Young Person (CYP) affected by the condition can be extremely challenging. While the majority of available literature is quantitative in nature, there is some qualitative research examining the impact of having a CYP with CFS/ME on parents. However, there currently appear to be no studies examining the narratives of parents living with a CYP with CFS/ME. Therefore, this research aimed to hear how parents narrate their experiences of living with a CYP affected by CFS/ME, paying attention to how they construct their identity, and the contested condition. Methodology This research drew on a qualitative approach that explored the narratives of the participants. A purposive sample of five parents of CYP affected by CFS/ME (5 mothers) was recruited for a single semi-structured interview. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using a narrative approach to explore what participants said and how they narrated their accounts. This was then situated within {{the social and cultural}} contexts that shaped them. Analysis and Findings Multiple readings of the narratives allowed me to develop a summary of each individual???s narrative account. These were presented, after which similarities and differences across narratives were considered.

40|$|Social care is {{currently}} undergoing a transformation, driven by Government policy, and {{key to this}} transformation is giving greater choice to service users. This vision of choice {{is based on a}} market model of competing service providers; such a model can be difficult to implement in rural areas where problems of space, time and access hamper service delivery. This {{raises the question of whether}} policy is biased towards urban areas and highlights the important role that geographical gerontology can play in developing more person-centred social care policy and practice. This consumerist vision of social care has also fuelled a theoretical debate which underpins this research. The market model of choice has been located within a wider discourse which regards the self as a rational, self-sufficient individual. An alternative discourse has been posited from a feminist ontology in which interdependence and co-responsibility come to the fore; such a discourse emphasises the personal dimension to social care practice. This project forms the research component of a professional doctorate in occupational therapy and is concerned with the self-expressed views of rural older people in relation to the above social care theory and policy. Taking a phenomenological approach, a narrative methodology was used to interview 11 older people who live in rural West Northumberland. <b>Participants?</b> <b>narratives</b> concerning social care re-affirm findings from previous gerontological research which assert low expectations, self-sufficiency and the crucial role of human relationships. Although at a superficial level, „choice? is not a term participants relate to social care, it is revealed that they do make choices on a daily basis both in relation to social care and their home situation, but choice is a complex and ongoing process rather than a one off event. It is suggested that the way participants situate themselves within their network of care and their geographic location helps them to maintain coherence in their personal identity. The concepts identified above are used to develop theory from a postmodern and feminist perspective in the areas of social care and geographical gerontology, forming an original contribution at the interface of these two domains...|$|E
40|$|Black {{gay male}} identities and their {{place within the}} social {{hierarchy}} are organized by interlocking systems of race, sexuality, gender and class. This produces the social marginality of black gay men in seemingly neutral ways. Prominent features of this systemic oppression are stock stories of black gay life that construct black gay men as pathological, dangerous, conflicted, inauthentically black, emasculated, and heretical within public and academic discourses. In order to better understand these dynamics {{and add to the}} empirical literature on race/sexuality intersections, fifty-two men identifying themselves as black/African American and as having relationships with other men, participated in semi-structured one-on-one interviews which explored their accounts of the structural arrangements, social interactions, and cultural meaning systems that defined the experience of being both black and gay in America. These interviews revealed that black gay men construct rich and complex counter narratives which not only expose the complex structural arrangements, cultural practices and racial ideologies that produce their marginality, but also remediate black gay manhood as part of the black diaspora. These narrative challenges illuminated discursive, performative and cultural practices, as well as social interactions occurring in three areas of the men?s lives. First, were strategic uses of a hegemonic masculine form I call the "Super Black Man" (SBM) by which the men counteract the heteronormative, and hypermasculine prerequisites of respectable black masculinity, and represent themselves as racially-conscious and respectable black men. Participants also constructed narrative challenges to those cultural repertoires produced by the black church which organize the dominant scripts of black, Christian identity. These accounts were distinguished by the academic resources they utilized to re-theorize the relationship between Christian faith and the black body, confront the white racial framing and heteronormative assumptions embedded in church doctrine, and transform their outsider status within these communities. Finally <b>participants?</b> <b>narratives</b> also illustrate multiple dimensions by which a black racial framing organizes their experiences as black gay men, and their connection to black communities.

40|$|Educational {{practices}} are ideologically informed, socially framed, and culturally contested. Historically, these forces have impacted upon how far and how swiftly education {{can respond to}} national and global challenges. In the 21 st century the tension between Platonic and Aristotlean philosophies of education, and how those dissonant epistemologies are embodied in curriculum and pedagogy continues to inform contemporary debate about the purposes and practices of formal education. Platonic beliefs in education {{as a means of}} strengthening the state are consistent with Firstspace ideologies of testing and reporting, benchmarking and competitive practice. This is in contrast with Secondspace ideologies that emphasise education for the individual, and for cooperative communities. This study is situated in the troubling and troubled borderland or Thirdspace between two ideologies. They are Firstspace ideologies and practices of education that seek to create a skilled but malleable workforce for a competitive economy, and Secondspace ideologies that promote individual learner autonomy for lifelong and life-wide learning and global citizenship. Transformative or critical pedagogies are described by both ideologies as pivotal: for governments they are presented as strategic to the achievement of a competitive edge in a global economy, and for postcolonial theorists they are the means for subverting epistemologies of difference and inequities of power. The organising argument of this study, that critical pedagogy has the capacity to democratise and subvert dominant and colonising ideas and practices of education, is balanced by two supporting arguments. They are, first, that reflective, critical and transformative pedagogy belongs to a Thirdspace epistemology, whose purpose is to trouble, rather than to serve beliefs and practices of education that re-inscribe the dominant culture. Second, that the dominant culture employs bureaucratic and hegemonic force to subvert the potential for change that results from critical and transformative praxis. Hence, the transformative educator seeks to effect change in fields that are inherently resistant to change. A bricolage of narratives gathered over a three-year period informs this study of transformative praxis in the context of education. The data are constituted from notes, diaries, children‘s and pre-service teachers‘ writings and feedback, and films and interviews gathered by the researcher and <b>participants.</b> <b>Narratives</b> from an alternative play-based community primary school, undergraduate pre-service primary educators and self-as-teacher-educator constitute ‗tales from the field‘, locating participants in the study as post-colonial voices. The process of writing upon writing reveals and re-presents the views of participants as subtexts from the field. The findings of the study are presented as neonarratives, indicating shared perceptions between the school community, pre-service teachers and the researcher of dissonances between contemporary theories of education and constraints impacting upon transformative pedagogy in practice. These findings have implications for the researcher‘s personal and professional practices of pedagogy as an educator of pre-service teachers as well as more broadly for government policy, the implementation of change within established systems; and for parents seeking a transformative education for their children. ...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo é uma pesquisa-formação, realizada por duas professoras de inglês negras em formação universitária, com o apoio de uma pesquisadora. Com este estudo, buscou-se {{investigar}} a concepção de raça e racismo das professoras e como esses dois temas são abordados em suas aulas. Além disso, buscou-se investigar as consequências da pesquisa para a vida pessoal e profissional das professoras. Para a sua realização, foram utilizados como referenciais teóricos estudos sobre: raça e racismo (CARNEIRO, 2002; FOUCAULT, 1999; GUIMARÃES, 1999; hooks, 1992; MOORE, 2007; MUNANGA, 2004; STEPAN, 2005; SALES JR., 2006); língua e linguagem (AUSTIN, 1975; WEEDWOOD, 2002; RAJAGOPALAN, 2003; BAKHTIN, 1888); ensino crítico e formação docente (GOMES, 1995; GONÇALVES E SILVA, 2006; FREIRE, 1993; MOITA LOPES, 2002); e pesquisa-formação (JOSSO, 1999; 2000; 2004). Os resultados indicam que, ao participar dos encontros promovidos pela pesquisa, que tinham como foco os relatos de vida compartilhados e reflexões sobre as aulas, as professoras refletiram mais profundamente sobre raça e racismo no Brasil, evidenciando, assim, que a pesquisa-formação com base em histórias de vida ajudou a proporcionar maior entendimento sobre como as relações pessoais e profissionais estão interligadas pela raça e pelo racismo. Com base em suas reflexões, as professoras elaboraram atividades sobre os dois temas para suas aulas de inglês de forma que a reflexão com estudantes também fosse empreendida. A análise dos dados evidencia que as professoras se tornaram pesquisadoras do assunto, adotaram a abordagem dos temas como agenda permanente em suas aulas e mudaram suas percepções como mulheres negras. The {{present study}} is a recherche-formation accomplished by two graduating black female English teachers and supported by a researcher. This study attempted to investigate the meaning of race and racism for these teachers and how these two themes were approached in their lessons. Furthermore, it attempts to investigate {{the consequences of the}} research for the life of these teachers. In order to carry out this work studies about four themes were used as theoretical background: race and racism (CARNEIRO, 2002; FOUCAULT, 1999; GUIMARÃES, 1999; Hooks, 1992; MOORE, 2007; MUNANGA, 2004; STEPAN, 2005; SALES JR., 2006); language (AUSTIN, 1975; WEEDWOOD, 2002; RAJAGOPALAN, 2003; BAKHTIN, 1888); critical teaching and teaching education (GOMES, 1995; GONÇALVES E SILVA, 2006; FREIRE, 1993; MOITA LOPES, 2002); and recherche-formation (JOSSO, 1999; 2000; 2004). The results show that, by participating in the meetings promoted by the research, which focused on their life s history and their classes, the teachers reflected more profoundly about race and racism in Brazil, showing that recherche-formation, based on the <b>participants</b> <b>narratives,</b> helped to better understand how personal and professional relations are intertwined by race and racism. Based on their own reflections, the teachers developed activities addressing the two themes in a way that reflecting with students was also undertaken. The data analysis portrays that the teachers have also become researchers and have adopted the approach of these themes in their classrooms as a permanent agenda, and changed their perceptions as black women...|$|E

Este estudo teve por Objetivo Geral analisar o impacto da AIDS na sa?de mental e Qualidade de Vida de pessoas com idade igual ou superior a 50 anos soropositivas para o HIV (HIV+). M?todo: Participaram 86 pessoas HIV+ com idade igual ou superior a 50 anos. Foram constitu?dos, ainda, dois grupos comparativos: a) Grupo formado por 86 pessoas HIV+ com idade abaixo de 50 anos, na faixa-et?ria de 40 a 49 anos e b) Grupo formado por 86 pessoas com idade igual ou superior a 50 anos da popula??o em geral, sem o diagn?stico de soropositividade ao HIV. Foram utilizados os seguintes instrumentos: 1) Question?rio sociodemogr?fico e cl?nico; 2) Escala Whoqol-HIV Bref; 3) Escala Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ- 20); 4) Escala de Ansiedade e Depress?o (HAD); e 5) Entrevista. Para a an?lise dos dados do question?rio sociodemogr?fico e das escalas foram realizadas an?lises de estat?stica descritiva e multivariada. J? para os dados das entrevistas, utilizou-se a An?lise Categorial Tem?tica. Resultados: Quando comparado com pessoas de mesma faixa et?ria da popula??o geral, as pessoas na maturidade e velhice com HIV/AIDS t?m maiores preju?zos na sa?de mental e na qualidade de vida, mas n?o mais que as pessoas abaixo de 50 anos HIV+. Na verifica??o das vari?veis preditivas, O fator Independ?ncia (b= 0, 414) foi o principal respons?vel pela explica??o da vari?ncia, seguido do fator Psicol?gico (?= 0, 29), e, de forma negativa, os Transtornos Mentais Comuns (?= - 0, 20). A partir da an?lise dos relatos dos participantes, emergiram nove categorias: Cont?gio, Diagn?stico, Percep??o da AIDS, AIDS na velhice, Enfrentamento, Suporte, Preconceito, Trabalho e Perspectivas. Conclus?o: A conviv?ncia com o HIV/AIDS tem impacto em v?rias dimens?es da vida de um indiv?duo, contribuindo para a presen?a de Transtornos Mentais Comuns. O impacto da doen?a para a avalia??o de Qualidade de Vida foi verificado, principalmente, quando comparado com as pessoas sem o diagn?stico da doen?a, corroborando a hip?tese inicial do estudo. Al?m disso, h? varia??es interindividual significativa em termos do impacto da doen?a para as pessoas, ainda que com o mesmo diagn?stico. Esta varia??o do impacto sugere considerar n?o s? vari?veis ??mensur?veis, tais como a idade, n?veis de CD 4 ou est?gio da doen?a (sintom?tico ou assintom?tico), uma vez que tal varia??o pode estar relacionada ? natureza subjetiva da resposta do indiv?duo a uma complexa intera??o de fatores inerentes ? conviv?ncia com a doen?a, conforme verificado nos relatos dos participantes. Introduction and Objectives: What is {{the impact}} of the AIDS on the mental health and Quality of Life in people who are equal or superior the age of 50 years? This study had as General Objective to analyze the impact of AIDS on the mental health and Quality of Life on people who are equal or superior the age of 50 years for HIV (HIV+) seropositiv. Method: A number of 86 people who are equal or superior age of 50 years, HIV+ seropositiv were the participants of this study. It was composed two comparative groups: a) Group formed by 86 people HIV+ who are age below of the 50 years, in the age band of 40 49 years and b) Group formed by 86 people who are equal or superior age of the 50 years of the population in general, without the diagnosis of the HIV seropositiv. This study counted on the following instruments: 1) Socio-demographic and clinical questionnaire; 2) Whoqol-HIV Brief scales; 3) Self-Reporting Questionnaire scales (SRQ- 20); 4) Scale of Anxiety and Depression (HAD); and 5) Interview. For the analysis of the data originated by the socio-demographic questionnaire and the scales it was applied the descriptive and multivariate statistics analysis. The data of the interviews, the Thematic Categorical Analysis was carried out. Results: When compared with people of same age bands of the general population, the people in the maturity and in the old age with HIV/AIDS have greater damages in their mental health and in their quality of life, but they have not more damages than the people below of the 50 years HIV+. In the verification of the predictive variables, the factor Independence (? = 0, 414) was main the responsible for the explanation of the variance, followed by the Psychological factor (?= 0, 29), and, of negative form, the Common Mental Disorders (?= - 0, 20). The analysis of the participants stories counted with nine emerged categories: Infect, Diagnosis, Perception of the AIDS, AIDS in the old age, Confrontation, Support, Prejudice, Work and Perspectives. Conclusions: Living with the HIV/AIDS has its impact in some dimensions of the individual s life, contributing for the presence of Common Mental Disorders. The impact of the illness for the evaluation of the Quality of Life was verified, mainly, when compared with the people without the diagnosis of the illness, corroborating for the initial hypothesis of the study. Moreover, it has inter individual variations significant in terms {{of the impact of the}} illness for the people, despite with the same diagnostic. This variation of the impact suggests not only considering the changeable variables, such as the age, levels of CD 4 or period of the disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic), a time that such variation might be related to the subjective nature of the individual s reply to a intricate interaction of inherent factors of living with the illness, as verified in the <b>participants</b> <b>narratives...</b>|$|E
