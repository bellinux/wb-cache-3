5|$|The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are {{versatile}} catalysts in {{the chemical}} industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the selective oxidation of <b>propylene</b> to acrolein and acrylic acid, the ammoxidation of <b>propylene</b> to acrylonitrile. Suitable catalysts and {{process for the}} direct selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid are being researched.|$|E
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a <b>propylene</b> glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using <b>propylene</b> glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or <b>propylene</b> oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and <b>propylene</b> glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often <b>propylene</b> glycol or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces such as {{the bodies}} of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of <b>propylene</b> glycol (p.I-3).|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene,</b> mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the <b>propylene</b> glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propylene</b> glycol oxidizes {{when exposed}} to air and heat, forming lactic acid. If not {{properly}} inhibited, this fluid can be very corrosive, so pH buffering agents such as dipotassium phosphate and potassium bicarbonate are often added to <b>propylene</b> glycol, to prevent acidic corrosion of metal components. Pre-inhibited <b>propylene</b> glycol solutions {{can also be used}} instead of pure <b>propylene</b> glycol to prevent corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{solubility}} in <b>propylene</b> glycol it {{is unlikely}} to replace water in saponificaction due to <b>propylene</b> glycol primary reaction with fat before reaction between sodium hydroxide and fat.|$|E
25|$|Bulk slurry (or bulk): Uses liquid <b>propylene</b> {{instead of}} liquid inert {{hydrocarbon}} diluent. The polymer does not dissolve into a diluent, but rather rides on the liquid <b>propylene.</b> The formed polymer is withdrawn and any unreacted monomer is flashed off.|$|E
25|$|Antifreeze {{products}} for automotive use containing <b>propylene</b> glycol {{in place of}} ethylene glycol are available. They are generally considered safer to use, as <b>propylene</b> glycol does not taste as good and is converted in the body to lactic acid, a normal product of metabolism and exercise.|$|E
25|$|Phillips Petroleum chemists J. Paul Hogan and Robert Banks first {{polymerized}} <b>propylene</b> in 1951. <b>Propylene</b> {{was first}} polymerized to a crystalline isotactic polymer by Giulio Natta {{as well as}} by the German chemist Karl Rehn in March 1954. This pioneering discovery led to large-scale commercial production of isotactic polypropylene by the Italian firm Montecatini from 1957 onwards.|$|E
25|$|In a {{standard}} oil refinery {{process known as}} alkylation, isobutane is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of <b>propylene</b> and butylene) {{in the presence of}} the strong acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (<b>propylene,</b> butylene) to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30°C) in a two-phase reaction.|$|E
25|$|Gas phase: Uses gaseous <b>propylene</b> {{in contact}} with the solid catalyst, {{resulting}} in a fluidized-bed medium.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{chemicals}} (12 {{percent of}} sales) are used internally by Dow {{as raw materials}} and are also sold worldwide. Markets include dry cleaning, paints and coatings, snow and ice control and the food industry. Major products include ethylene glycol, caustic soda, chlorine, and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM, for making PVC). Ethylene oxide and <b>propylene</b> oxide and the derived alcohols ethylene glycol and <b>propylene</b> glycol are major feedstocks for the manufacture of plastics such as polyurethane and PET.|$|E
25|$|On September 30, 2013, <b>propylene</b> was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS).|$|E
25|$|The roof is {{made from}} cedar shake. A new {{ethylene}} <b>propylene</b> diene monomer rubber seal was installed on the building’s tower in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Hafnium {{tetrachloride}} is {{the precursor}} to highly active catalysts for the Ziegler-Natta polymerization of alkenes, especially <b>propylene.</b> Typical catalysts {{are derived from}} tetrabenzylhafnium.|$|E
25|$|Most {{antifreeze}} is made {{by mixing}} distilled water with additives and a base product - MEG (Mono ethylene glycol) or MPG (Mono <b>propylene</b> glycol).|$|E
25|$|Direct {{hydration}} reacts propene and water, {{either in}} gas phase or in liquid phase, at high pressures {{in the presence}} of solid or supported acidic catalysts. Higher-purity <b>propylene</b> (> 90%) tends to be required for this type of process.|$|E
25|$|The Hydrocarbons and Energy {{operating}} segment (13 percent of sales) oversees energy management at Dow. Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured. Major feedstocks for Dow {{are provided by}} this group, including ethylene, <b>propylene,</b> 1,3-butadiene, benzene and styrene.|$|E
25|$|As the {{concentration}} of the acid catalyst is reduced, the rate of production of acid soluble polymers increases. Feeds that contain high amounts of <b>propylene</b> have a much higher rate of increase in acid consumption over the normal spending range.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter of 2014, Dow {{announced}} new operating segments in response to its previously announced leadership changes. The company stated it would give further support to its end-market orientation and increase its alignment to Dow’s key value chains – ethylene and <b>propylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Halcon {{partnered with}} Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco) to form Oxirane, to produce <b>propylene</b> oxide, styrene, and tert-Butyl alcohol. Both {{companies}} {{were interested in}} expanding, both companies were researching oxidation, and Arco was aware that Halcon held critical patents in the area.|$|E
25|$|Oxy-fuel {{processes}} may use {{a variety}} of fuel gases, the most common being acetylene. Other gases that may be used are <b>propylene,</b> liquified petroleum gas (LPG), propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and MAPP gas. Many brands use different kinds of gases in their mixes.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011, Manali Petrochemicals Ltd {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to set up storage and handling facility at the port for bulk import of <b>propylene</b> oxide, a major input for the derivative plants of the company. The facility {{is expected to be}} ready in about a year.|$|E
25|$|Although {{ethylene}} glycol hydrometers {{are widely available}} and mass-marketed for antifreeze testing, they give false readings at high temperatures because specific gravity changes with temperature. <b>Propylene</b> glycol solutions cannot be tested using specific gravity because of ambiguous results (40% and 100% solutions have the same specific gravity).|$|E
25|$|On 31 April 2008 the Petromont Varennes plant {{closed its}} methylacetylene/propadiene crackers. As {{they were the}} only North American plant making MAPP gas, many {{substitutes}} were introduced by the companies who had repackaged the Dow and Varennes product(s) - most of these substitutes are <b>propylene,</b> see below.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{zaleplon}} in its {{solid state}} is a white to off-white powder with very low solubility in water, as well as low solubility in ethanol and <b>propylene</b> glycol. It has a partition coefficient in octanol/water that is constant (logP = 1.23) when the pH range is between 1 and 7.|$|E
25|$|The largest use of {{n-butanol}} is as {{an industrial}} intermediate, {{particularly for the}} manufacture of butyl acetate (itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent). It is a petrochemical, manufactured from <b>propylene</b> and usually used close {{to the point of}} manufacture. Estimated production figures for 1997 are: United States 784,000tonnes; Western Europe 575,000tonnes; Japan 225,000tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Hydrocarbon slurry or suspension: Uses {{a liquid}} inert {{hydrocarbon}} diluent in the reactor to facilitate transfer of <b>propylene</b> to the catalyst, {{the removal of}} heat from the system, the deactivation/removal of the catalyst as well as dissolving the atactic polymer. The range of grades that could be produced was very limited. (The technology has fallen into disuse).|$|E
25|$|Like {{ethylene}} glycol and <b>propylene</b> glycol, glycerol is a non-ionic kosmotrope that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonds. This disrupts the crystal lattice formation of ice unless {{the temperature is}} significantly lowered. The minimum freezing point temperature is at about 36°F / 37.8°C corresponding to 60–70% glycerol in water.|$|E
25|$|As {{predicted}} by the VSEPR model of electron pair repulsion, the molecular geometry of alkenes includes bond angles about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of steric strain introduced by nonbonded interactions between functional groups attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C–C–C bond angle in <b>propylene</b> is 123.9°.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene (PP), {{also known}} as polypropene, is a {{thermoplastic}} polymer used {{in a wide variety}} of applications including packaging and labeling, textiles (e.g., ropes, thermal underwear and carpets), stationery, plastic parts and reusable containers of various types, laboratory equipment, loudspeakers, automotive components, transvaginal mesh and polymer banknotes. An addition polymer made from the monomer <b>propylene,</b> it is rugged and unusually resistant to many chemical solvents, bases and acids.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{water-based}} antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures {{of water and}} either ethylene glycol (EGW) or <b>propylene</b> glycol (PGW). The use of ethylene glycol has a longer history, especially in the automotive industry. However, EGW solutions formulated for the automotive industry often have silicate based rust inhibitors that can coat and/or clog heat exchanger surfaces. Ethylene glycol is listed as a toxic chemical requiring care in handling and disposal.|$|E
