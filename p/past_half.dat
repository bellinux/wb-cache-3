5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was <b>past</b> <b>half</b> past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E
5|$|Tegström {{became an}} instant success at Sandefjord and contributed {{greatly to the}} club's first-ever {{promotion}} to the Tippeligaen, {{with a total of}} 14 goals when the club finished second in the 2005 Norwegian First Division. Tegström scored a hat-trick in the decisive match, beating promotion-challengers Moss 4–2; Tegström's teammate Andreas Augustsson scored one goal. Tegström also impressed at the top-flight in Norway, and after scoring five goals in the five first matches of the season he was the leading goalscorer in Tippeligaen, while his team was in fourth place despite being predicted to be in last place by every media outlet in Norway. When Sandefjord played Viking on 24 September 2006, both teams were fighting against relegation and Tegström scored the match-winning goal on a counter-attack after dribbling <b>past</b> <b>half</b> the Viking defencecomparable to Diego Maradona's goal in the 1986 World Cup. Tegström scored ten goals and made five assists in the Tippeligaen, helping Sandefjord avoid relegation in their first year in the top-flight. He also scored the first goal in the semi-final of the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup, which Sandefjord won 5–2 against Rosenborg at Lerkendal Stadion and played in the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup Final, in which the team lost 3–0 to Fredrikstad.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in New Spain and Central America, in South America {{independence}} was {{spurred by the}} pro-independence fighters who had held out for the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> decade. José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar inadvertently led a continent-wide pincer movement from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent. After securing the independence of Chile in 1818, San Martín concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter Spanish control of those waters and reach the royalist stronghold of Lima. By mid-1820 San Martín had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships {{under the command of}} Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from Valparaíso to Paracas in southern Peru. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took Pisco. After this, San Martín, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Martín hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic Peruvian revolt against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Martín engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela, who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate {{on the basis of the}} 1812 Constitution and to maintain the unity of the Spanish Monarchy. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in Huacho, in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Martín learned that Guayaquil (in Ecuador) had declared independence on October 9.|$|E

Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including protectionism) that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care.|$|E

25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial.

Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many {{school districts in the}} United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E
25|$|With {{the series}} tied at 1–1 with two matches to go, New Zealand had a shout at gaining their first series win. That was quickly {{quenched}} – Cameron bowled 30 wicketless overs {{in the fourth}} Test at the Wanderers, and New Zealand's batting yielded twice as South Africa registered a win by an innings and 51 runs. Still, New Zealand drew the series, after Cameron took the final wicket. His match bowling figures then read 28.5–7–94–2, but with the final ball of the over he had South Africa's number 11 Harry Bromfield caught. Bromfield had been batting for the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> hour without scoring a run, {{though he had been}} in a partnership of 14 with 55 runs required for the win or 21 minutes required for the draw. Thus, Cameron finished his maiden Test series with 20 wickets at a bowling average of 24.65.|$|E
25|$|In this model, {{the factor}} driving female {{strategies}} {{is the high}} cost to females of increasingly large-brained offspring, requiring increased investment from males. As females of Homo heidelbergensis, the ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans, came under increasing selection pressure for larger brain size within the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> million years, they needed more energy in support. This meant greater productivity by males as hunters. However, in the Darwinian world of primate sexual competition, males may {{be more interested in}} finding new fertile females than in supplying the needs of breast-feeding mothers and their infants. Women, unlike chimpanzees, do not show their fertile time. But females cannot easily disguise menstruation. Menstrual periods mark out very clearly which females are coming close to fertility among other females who are pregnant and lactating. Dominant males could therefore target the cycling females and neglect those most in need of support.|$|E

25|$|Numerous recent {{publications}} {{have provided}} {{evidence suggesting that}} increased aerobic exercise for children suffering with ataxic cerebral palsy can improve physiological outcomes. More research is being conducted {{to better understand the}} specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this observation. Over the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century, a significant amount of research has been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson’s disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes.|$|E
25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century) is part of their legacy.|$|E

Lecamus' brigade (under Colonel Cambriel) defended the Hog's Back and the Vera Pass on the left flank. Allied forces led by James Kempt drove back Cambriel's brigade rather easily and seized the crest while sustaining only 78 casualties. John Colborne's brigade had more difficult time and its first attack on the Saint Benôit fort was repulsed. The French chased their enemies downhill and were out of order when the British supporting battalion appeared. The Allies returned to the attack and ousted the French from the fort. Then they fought {{their way to the}} top of the spur where they overran the redoubt also. Colborne's brigade lost 302 men killed or wounded. British officers remarked that the French soldiers fought less stubbornly than in the <b>past.</b> <b>Half</b> of the total French casualties of 1,673 men were in Taupin's division.|$|E
