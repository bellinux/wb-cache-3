The specific supports intended for use are commercial units designated ''Seismic Stops'' manufactured by Robert L. Cloud Associates, Inc. (RLCA). These devices have the physical appearance of snubbers and are essentially spring supports incorporating clearance gaps sized for the Byron Station application.

These specimens were subjected to alternating hot and cold forced flow, low oxygenated water every three minutes so that rapid changes in water temperature impart a thermal shock event to the inner wall of the girth butt welds. Thermal and structural piping analyses were conducted using the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III NB- 3600 <b>piping</b> <b>analysis</b> methods and a series of current and proposed design fatigue curves for 304 stainless steel that include water environment effects. These analyses were also used to assess the conservatism in the ASME Code Section III NB K 3 thermal stress index for girth butt welds.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of elevated dynamic loads, affecting {{the elements of}} the hydraulic drive, is an important task in production equipment maintenance. In case of the hydraulic drive with actuators, remotely located from the power source, the piping defines the working capacity of the whole system. Hence the development of <b>piping</b> vibroacoustic <b>analysis</b> methods appears to be the vital task. The said methods would not only help to define the cause of increased loads, but also permit to develop an adequate design solution without prolonged experimental checks. The article proposes the method of pipeline system vibroacoustics analysis through the example of press-forge unit drain piping. The novelty of this method consists {{in the use of the}} fluid pulsation and <b>piping</b> vibration spectra <b>analysis</b> in their correlative comparison with account to the calculated modal parameters of a pipeline. The measurements of working fluid pressure pulsation and pipeline vibration in the vicinity of the breakage locations were carried out. The experimental data spectrum analysis indicated an apparition of intense water-hammer process along with the frequency coalescence of fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration. The resonant vibration amplification, caused by the water-hammer effect, was suggested. The pipeline system mathematical model, allowing to calculate its modal parameters, was derived. The comparison of the modal analysis with the vibroacoustic response confirmed the hypothesis of the pipeline resonant breakdown. The article depicts, that the study of the pipeline system vibroacoustic response, based only on Fourier analysis of the working fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration, is prone to fail the reliable causation of elevated dynamic loads. It is suggested to complement the vibroacoustic response analysis with the modal parameters calculation. The mathematical computation of the modal frequencies and shapes was implemented instead of their experimental observation in order to exclude the undesired signal, introduced with attached mechanical equipment. On top of that, the mathematical computation of the pipeline modal parameters allowed to perform the pipeline modal frequency shift from the water-hammer effect frequency range through cautious relocation of additional supports...|$|R

The {{purposes}} of this paper are to perform <b>piping</b> failure <b>analysis</b> for the failed safety class piping in Korean nuclear power plants(NPPs) and evaluate the effect of an in-service inspection(ISI) on the piping failure probability. For data collection, a database for piping failure events was constructed with 135 data fields including population data, event data, and service history data. A total of 6 kinds of events with 25 failure cases up to June 30, 2003 were identified from Korean NPPs. The failed systems were main feedwater system, CVCS, primary sampling system, essential service water system, and CANDU purification system. Piping failure analyses such as evaluation of the impact on nuclear safety and piping integrity and the root cause analysis were performed and the piping failure frequencies for the failed piping were calculated by using population data. The result showed that although the integrity was not maintained in the failed piping, {{the safety of the}} plants was maintained for all the events. And the root causes of the events were analyzed as FAC, vibration, thermal fatigue, corrosion, and/or an improper weld joint. The piping failure frequencies ranged from 6. 08 E- 5 /Cr-Yr to 1. 15 E- 3 /Cr-Yr for the events. According to the ASME Code Sec.

Based upon {{the results of a}} metallurgical investigation, which included a creep testing program and a detailed finite element stress analysis, the cause of the failure has been attrib-uted to creep damage at the weld seam. The metallurgical investigation and creep testing program indicated that the 1 - ^ O- j Mo pipe material was normalized and exhibited greater than average creep strength and creep ductility. The results of a <b>piping</b> stress <b>analysis</b> indicated that all pressure, weight, and thermal stresses were in compliance with the ASME B 31. 3 Piping Code (ASME, 1993 a). Nonetheless, the pipe failed after only 100, 000 h at a nominal hoop stress of 6 ksi (41. 4 MPa) with an operating temperature range of 970 °F (521 °C) to 1000 °F (538 °C). Results from subsequent detailed finite element stress analyses of the failed pipe indicated that very high localized bending stresses were present in the pipe due to peaking at the long-seam weld. These stresses partially relax by creep, but after 100, 000 h they were still approximately 38 percent higher than the nominal hoop stress. The creep strains resulting from stress relaxation and those associated with the long-term value of the sustained stresses cause severe creep damage at the weld seam. As a result of this damage, cracks initiated at the inside of the pipe and primarily grew through the HAZ/fusion line until an 18 -in. through-wall crack developed. The pipe was produced to ASTM A 691, Grade l-l 4 Cr, Class 41 (ASTM, 1989), and the peaked geometry was found to satisfy the fabrication tolerances of this standard.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the study of}} ground water availability at Karamba in Kalpitiya peninsula and hence supply of potable water requirement to the Employer's Housing Compound (EHC) rather than implementing Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The specific objectives are, 1. To find out the reliable water source. 2. To supply sufficient and quality water {{in accordance with the}} Sri Lankan regulations. 3. How to use earth resistivity theory to predict the availability of ground water. 4. To analysis cost effectiveness ground water usage compared to RO modules. 5. To establish the reliable water supply net work to fulfill demand. The content in Chapter 2 provides the reader with the ground water aquifers in Sri Lanka and geomorphological and hydrogeological distribution patterns mapped for different types of aquifers. The information presented in Chapter 3, describes the fundamentals of the image survey to measure the earth resistivity and made various decisions on geological parameters such as the mineral and fluid content, porosity and degree of water saturation in the rock. Actually, Electrical resistivity surveys have been used for many decades in hydrogeological, mining and geotechnical investigations. As human increases, fresh water demand tended to increase too. The world's water consumption rate is doubling every 20 years. Then, RO process, water is made to pass from the more concentrated one, which is the reverse of the principle of osmosis, is used as new technology in the world but more energy consumed with more capital cost. Chapter 4, 5, 6 & 7 will discuss in more details about RO pants, pump selection, <b>piping</b> and costs <b>analysis.</b> Chapter 8 will explain the conclusion and future needs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{stringent}} safety criteria evolved {{after the}} Fukushima accident, {{it is necessary}} to ensure the availability of the Safety Graded Decay Heat Removal (SGDHR) system even under Beyond Design Basis Event (BDBE). Towards ensuring the availability of the SGDHR system for the decay heat removal, the structural integrity of the SGDHR piping system has been demonstrated under BDBE by testing. Accordingly one of the typical full scale SGDHR pipe bend have been tested towards the assessment of the seismic margin available in the design of PFBR SGDHR piping system. Maximum load carrying capacity of this pipe bend was demonstrated as 2. 9 times of the maximum potential EQ possible at the PFBR site with a return period of once in 106 years without any loss of structural integrity. This test results ensures the availability of the SGDHR piping system even under BDBE for the decay heat removal without getting any compromise on the loss of structural integrity of the <b>piping</b> system. Numerical <b>analysis</b> also carried out to understand the overall stress distribution and also to compare the experimental results. It indicated that, the crown experiences highest tensile stress and intrados portion under compressive stress upon typical in-plane bending moment. The comparison of the numerical analysis and the experimental result for the collapse behaviour matches perfectly within the elastic portion. Slight deviation observed in the plastic region may be due to ther eason that, the material property taken for the numerical analysis was based on the uni-axial data. But the experimental results are multi axial in nature. The small difference could have been improved by applying the multi axial material property data for the numerical prediction. In the present analysis numerical results over predicts the plastic deformation...|$|R
