50|$|The Q-machine plasma {{is created}} at a plate {{that has been}} heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the hot plate. Electrons are emitted by the hot plate through {{thermionic}} emission, and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the hot plate. A high value of the hot <b>plate</b> <b>work</b> function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation. The Q-machine's nonequilibrium plasmais a primary example of epicatalysis.|$|E

His most successful works are of his male subjects. However his images {{of women and children}} were collected in albums, as the small delicately coloured prints are considered the best of that period and time of portrait photography. The highly persevered state of his prints suggest that people of the time went to Boake for charming miniatues.He volunteered as a captain in the 7th Battery of New South Wales Voluntary Artillery. Here Boake made his most famous work, the mosaic of the returning New South Wales contingent that fought in the Sudan campaign of 1890.Capel practiced in many different photographic printing and developing techniques. The heliograph and the instantaneous process were ways Boake was able to maintain the fine art quality of his execution. The competitors from other local studios moved to larger prints, while Boake maintained his artistic reputation, working on finer photographs.Barcroft was also often seen using, a carte de visite, which is 10 x 6.4 cm stiff card, with a paper photograph attached, invented in 1854 by André-Adolphe-Eugène Disderi.|$|E
5000|$|Oeder {{was the son}} of a Bavarian parish {{minister}} and theologian, Georg Ludwig Oeder (1694-1760). He studied medicine at the University of Göttingen under Albrecht von Haller. He then settled as a doctor of medicine in the city of Schleswig. The king called him to Copenhagen in 1751, on von Haller's recommendation. The autonomous - and conservative - University of Copenhagen, reluctant as it was to employ foreign experts, resisted Oeder's appointment in an ordinary chair. Thus, he was appointed Professor botanices regius (Royal Professor) and soon led the installation of a new botanic garden. From 1753 he led the publication of a monumental botanical <b>plate</b> <b>work,</b> Flora Danica, which at first was planned to cover all plants, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi native to crown lands of the Danish king [...] - [...] Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg-Delmenhorst and Norway [...] - [...] with its North Atlantic dependencies Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Oeder visited the mountain regions of Norway up to Trondheim during the years 1758-1760. Consequently, the first fascicles of Flora Danica contain many alpine plant species. Oeder also corresponded with the Norwegian bishop and botanist Johan Ernst Gunnerus during the time.Oeder also built up a considerable botanical library, mainly through purchase from colleagues abroad. English and American literature was obtained from Philip Miller of Chelsea Physic Garden and as many as 1327 volumes were bought from the estate of Richard Mead in 1754.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} dynamic {{responses of}} annular plate composed of three layers. The middle {{layer of the}} plate has electrorheological properties expressed by the Bingham body model. The plate is loaded in the plane of facings with time-dependent forces. The electrorheological effect is observed {{in the area of}} supercritical plate behaviour. The influence of both material properties and geometrical dimensions of the core on plate behaviour is examined. The problem is solved analytically and numerically using the orthogonalization method and the finite difference method. Comparison of the results obtained using the finite difference and the finite element methods for a plate in critical state is shown. The numerical calculations are carried out for axisymmetric and asymmetric plate modes. The presented diagrams show the plate reaction to the changes in values of plate parameters and indicate that the supercritical control of <b>plate</b> <b>work</b> is possible...|$|E
