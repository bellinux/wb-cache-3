40|$|Recently, polling {{has been}} {{included}} as a resource sharing mechanism in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol of several communication systems, such as the IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area network, primarily to support realtime traffic. Furthermore, to allow these communication systems to support multimedia traffic, the polling scheme often coexists with other MAC schemes such as random access. Motivated by these systems, we develop {{a model for a}} polling system with vacations, where the vacations represent the time periods in which the resource sharing mechanism used is a non-polling mode. The real-time traffic served by the <b>polling</b> <b>mode</b> in our study is telephony. We use an ON-OFF Markov Modulated Fluid (MMF) model to characterize telephony sources. Our analytical study and a counterpart validating simulation study show the following. Since voice codec rates are much smaller than link transmission rates, the queueing delay that arises from waiting for a poll dominates the total delay experienced by a voice packet. To keep delays low, the number of telephone calls that can be admitted must be chosen carefully according to delay tolerance, loss tolerance, codec rates, protocol overheads and the amount of bandwidth allocated to the <b>polling</b> <b>mode.</b> The effect of statistical multiplexing gain obtained by exploiting the ON-OFF characteristics of telephony traffic is more noticeable when the impact of polling overhead is small...|$|E

50|$|If {{there is}} an unused slot, the port {{addresses}} of the others are moved up. (For example, if a port at 0x3BC does not exist, the port at 0x378 will then become the first logical parallel port.) The base address 0x3BC is typically supported by printer ports on MDA and Hercules display adapters, whereas printer ports provided by the mainboard chipset or add-on cards rarely allow to be configured to this base address. Therefore, in absence of a monochrome display adapter, a common assignment for the first logical parallel port (and therefore also for the corresponding LPT1 DOS device driver) today is 0x378, even though the default is still 0x3BC (and would be selected by the BIOS if it detects a printer port at this address). The IRQ lines are typically configurable in the hardware as well. Assigning the same interrupt {{to more than one}} printer port should be avoided and will typically cause one of the corresponding ports to work in <b>polled</b> <b>mode</b> only. The port addresses assigned to slot can be determined by reading the BIOS Data Area (BDA) at 0000h:0408h.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The IEEE 802. 11 e {{standard}} {{defines the}} enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF) {{to improve the}} quality of service (QoS) in a wireless local area network (WLAN). The EDCF is a CSMA/CA based protocol, where stations compete for the medium with prioritized contention parameters.

The primary purpose of the 802. 11 e HCF is to decrease the average queuing delay. The EDCF fails to scale well at high loads due to increase in collisions, while the HCF Polling compromises on throughput to achieve lower delay and has the disadvantage of being centrally controlled.

In unicast polling, the BS polls each individual MS to allow to transmit a bandwidth request packet. This paper presents an analytical model for the unicast polling of bandwidth request in IEEE 802. 16 e networks over Gilbert-Elliot error channel. We derive the probability distribution for the delay of bandwidth requests due to wireless transmission errors and find the loss probability of request packets due to finite retransmission attempts. By using the delay distribution and the loss probability, we optimize the number of polling slots within a frame and the maximum retransmission number while satisfying QoS on the total loss probability which combines two losses: packet loss due to the excess of maximum retransmission and delay outage loss due to the maximum tolerable delay bound. In addition, we obtain the utilization of polling slots, which is defined as the ratio of the number of polling slots used for the MS's successful transmission to the total number of polling slots used by the MS over a long run time. Analysis results are shown to well match with simulation results. Numerical results give examples of the optimal number of polling slots within a frame and the optimal maximum retransmission number depending on delay bounds, the number of MSs and the channel conditions.

The resolution of problems arising from the mis-matches between the requirements of the MPI standard and the features of LAPI is discussed. As a result of this exercise, cer-tain enhancements to LAPI are identified to enable an efficient implementation of MPI on LAPI.
