5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. These <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> help define the new university.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, the National Council {{announced}} that, as {{a result}} of the findings and recommendations of a select committee made up of volunteer Scouters, the Cub Scout and Venturing <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> transition to use of the Boy Scout Oath and Promise, and in the case of the Venturers, the Boy Scout three-finger salute and sign as well. The Venturing change will occur in late 2013 or early 2014; the Cub Scout change will take effect in mid-2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II baby boom, the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and/or correspondence courses. The university rejected the idea, stating that external degree or certification <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be significantly inferior to residence education. Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct external studies. Madgwick enthusiastically supported the idea and instructed his college's staff to begin preparing an external studies program. Heffron asked the University of Sydney if it had any objection to New England being granted independence to operate the state's external education program. The university replied {{that it had no}} objection.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Radio-Québec and TVOntario {{signed an}} {{exchange}} arrangement, in which English-language TVO <b>programming</b> <b>would</b> {{be seen on}} Radio-Québec, and Radio-Québec's French-language <b>programming</b> <b>would</b> be seen on TVO.|$|R
50|$|For {{some time}} {{it seemed like}} the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> still return after the summer of 2008, but unfortunately, on June 26, 2008, RTL told in public that the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> not return.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the type}} {{declaration}} {{on the first}} line were omitted, the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> trigger an error on compilation, as the variable [...] "p" [...] would not be defined. But the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.|$|R
5|$|The United States Air Force, focused toward {{nuclear weapons}} and {{delivery}} of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities {{since the end of}} the World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E
5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general <b>programs,</b> <b>would</b> be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E
25|$|The Basic Disk Operating System, or BDOS, {{provided}} {{access to}} such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address was the same independent {{of the amount of}} memory in the system, application <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.|$|E
50|$|On October 8, 2007, it was {{announced}} http://www.theindychannel.com/news/14291931/detail.html that effective December 26, the WIBC call letters and news/talk <b>programming</b> <b>would</b> move to 93.1 FM, and that WIBC's sports <b>programming</b> <b>would</b> remain on 1070 AM, joined by programming from ESPN Radio, effective January 7, 2008. The new call letters WFNI were announced in December.|$|R
50|$|Finch {{joined with}} the mayors of Hartford, New Haven and New London in 2008 to urge the state to fund its Payment-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILOT) <b>program,</b> which <b>would</b> offset the revenue burden on {{municipalities}} that are home to tax-exempt institutions like colleges and hospitals. Finch argues that a full reimbursement under the PILOT <b>program</b> <b>would</b> provide relief to cities and towns across the state, and with full funding, the PILOT <b>program</b> <b>would</b> add $5 million to the Bridgeport city budget.|$|R

25|$|On September 21, 1959, P.L. 86-341 {{authorized}} the Secretary of Agriculture {{to operate a}} food-stamp system through January 31, 1962. The Eisenhower Administration never used the authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in West Virginia, President John F. Kennedy's first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, on February 2, 1961, he announced that food stamp pilot <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be initiated. The pilot <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> retain the requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of perishables.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 {{the federal}} {{government}} announced that all of Canada's social <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be reviewed with sweeping and significant changes likely to come which prompted several student unions not affiliated with the CFS to try to organize efforts to lobby {{the federal government}} on education issues.|$|E
25|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney {{had said}} he backed age-appropriate, {{comprehensive}} sex education in public schools. In 2005, against {{the will of the}} state legislature, he introduced federally funded abstinence-only education programs developed by a subsidiary of a Christian anti-abortion organization into some public schools. Romney said that adoption of the <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be voluntary for individual school districts and that the <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> supplement rather than replace existing comprehensive sex education curricula. Opponents argued that funding pressure would lead to schools dropping comprehensive sex education programs for the freely available abstinence-only ones, which under federal law were required to teach that any sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, and which were prohibited from discussing the potential benefits of contraception.|$|E

25|$|Paul's “Restore America” budget plan, {{which he}} laid out in October 2011, calls for the {{immediate}} elimination of the Department of Education. College Pell grants and other federal financial aid <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be transferred to another branch of government during a transition period, following which all federal financial aid for education would be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, Duncan Smith {{announced}} that earlier welfare-to-work <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> {{be replaced with}} a single Work Programme, which included incentives for private sector service providers to help the unemployed find long term employment. Further developments included the requirement for some long term recipients of Job Seekers Allowance to undertake unpaid full-time work placements with private companies.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus {{observed}} that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be unconnected, placed in “silos,” a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.|$|E

50|$|Currently, VMFA-112 {{has been}} working closely with sister {{squadron}} VMGR-234 onwhat {{has been called the}} “Herc/Hornet Expeditionary Package.” The conceptual <b>program</b> <b>would</b> allow an F/A-18A+ to land on a hastily constructed runway and refuel and rearm quickly without having to return to base, as is the current operating procedure. The <b>program</b> <b>would</b> be in keeping with the Marine Corps nature of self-sufficiency.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak {{testified before}} the Pennsylvania House Education Committee {{regarding}} full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered these <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> see {{a significant decrease in}} special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Bermudian Springs School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposal}} for a new downtown arts campus got a funding boost on June 26, 2013, with a $20 million challenge grant from the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation, but an additional $70 mil. needs to be raised. The backers say a new campus will increase {{the profile of the}} university's arts programs and the new performing arts facility. The first phase involves moving the university's Conservatory of Music and Dance to a location in the Crossroads District. Other <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> be moved in subsequent phases.|$|E
25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in the Medicare program, mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> connect patients with primary care, create an individualized health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health. The general ethos of these proposals is to “treat the patient, not the condition,” and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Diamond {{announced}} {{the launch of}} its light jet program, known as the Diamond D-Jet. This five-seat single engine jet aircraft was marketed towards the emergent very light jet market, and {{was considered to be}} a major diversification for the company. Nonetheless, Feinig was confident on the prospective demand for the type, forecasting that around 15 per cent of demand for the D-Jet would come from existing Diamond customers. Development of the D-Jet, unlike the majority of the company's <b>programs,</b> <b>would</b> be protracted as a result of numerous factors, of both a technical and fiscal nature.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} when moving APL {{programs}} from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content. Depending on the compiler, variable declarations might be needed, certain language features {{would need to be}} removed or avoided, or the APL <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> need to be cleaned up in some way. Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various reflection and introspection functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.|$|E
25|$|The {{average annual}} cost of ART per patient in 1997 was $4,469—compared to over $10,000 {{in most of the}} {{developed}} world—totaling only $242 million per annum. However, in 2001, Brazil manufactured locally 8 of the 12 drugs in the national ARV cocktail; in 2003 and 2005, 8 of the 15. If all of the drugs were patented imports, the cost of these ARV <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> increase by 32%. In the period between 1996 and 2000, Brazil reduced treatment costs by 72.5% through import substitution; by contrast, the price of imports dropped by only 9.6%. Brazil has saved over US $1.1 billion in the cost of providing universal access to ART by producing anti-retroviral medications generically.|$|E
