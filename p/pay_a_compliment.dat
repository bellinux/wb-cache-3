2500|$|In {{the early}} years of Queen Victoria's reign, the {{population}} of Prestwich was growing at an unprecedented rate, having risen from 470 in 1714 to 5,152 by 1849. [...] The site of St Margaret's was given by the 2nd Earl of Wilton, the first of many gifts the Earl was to make to the young church over {{the latter half of the}} century. [...] In 1884 the great west window, depicting the Parable of the Good Samaritan was erected by the parishioners to his memory. [...] The name of the new church was chosen after the rejection of the original suggestion of St Thomas (arising from a desire to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Thomas, Earl of Wilton). [...] Eventually the dedication of St Margaret of Antioch, Virgin Martyr was selected. [...] At one time, there had been a chantry in Prestwich Parish Church dedicated to St Margaret the Virgin.|$|E
60|$|The Irishman was now beaming. He had {{endeavored}} to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> with a lie, and the prompt {{repudiation of the}} lie served only to increase his hero-worship.|$|E
60|$|Soames was alarmed. He {{had really}} been struck by the plans, and the {{concealment}} of his satisfaction had been merely instinctive. It was {{difficult for him to}} <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b> He despised people who were lavish with their praises.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{where the}} masters don't have such {{beautiful}} long hair to be dishevelled," [...] said Mr. Slope, {{taking up the}} joke and <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> at the same time.|$|R
60|$|Mildred {{thought to}} herself {{that this was an}} odd way of <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> if it was meant for one; but then, old gentlemen with crushed fingers are not given to {{weighing}} their words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Th' innicent's fond on you," [...] {{observed}} the carrier, thinking that David was probably an amiable brother, and wishing to <b>pay</b> him <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{found himself}} {{now in the}} {{embarrassing}} position of one who must <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> or {{run the risk of}} losing a good thing. Bosinney was just the fellow who might tear up the plans and refuse to act for him; a kind of grown-up child! ...|$|E
60|$|Mary {{thought this}} a {{magnificent}} compliment, even considering {{that no one}} but her mamma had succeeded in teaching Louis to read when a little boy, or in making him persevere in anything now: but then, when Lord Ormersfield did <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> it {{was always in the}} style of Louis XIV.|$|E
6000|$|... "I WISHED to tell you, my good kinsman," [...] {{said the}} Marquis, [...] "now {{that we are}} quit of that impertinent fiddler, that I had tried to discuss this love affair of yours with Sir William Ashton's daughter. I never saw the young lady but {{for a few minutes}} to-day; so, being a {{stranger}} to her personal merits, I <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to you, and offer her no offence, in saying you might do better." ...|$|E
6000|$|A sneer flickered {{over the}} younger man's white face. [...] "You <b>pay</b> me <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> sir, which I fear me 'tis not mine {{to return to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Mr. Coleridge here notes: [...] "I will, if I can, here make an {{historical}} movement, and <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> proper <b>compliment</b> to Mr. Hallam." [...] Ed.] ...|$|R
60|$|Jessie {{looked up}} at him languidly. He had spoken as he felt, on impulse, which was more gratifying than an obvious desire to <b>pay</b> her <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> would have been.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to be friends, Mr. Wrayson," [...] she declared. [...] "You are sitting there in fear and trembling, and yet you have dared to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> the first I have heard for, oh! so many months. Do not be afraid. Louise is not so terrible as she seems. I will not let her send you away. Now you must answer my question. May we do this terrible thing, Louise and I?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{it was the}} lawyer’s turn to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b> ‘I do {{not know}} what Providence may hold in store,’ he said, ‘but this day should be a bright one in the annals of your reign. The shouts of armies could not be more eloquent than the emotion on these honest faces.’ And the Brandenau lawyer bowed, skipped, stepped back, and took snuff, with the air {{of a man who has}} found and seized an opportunity.|$|E
60|$|She ventured a second, appraising glance. His head, {{which he}} carried a little flung back, his voice, his easy and {{confident}} bearing--all these contradicted the saw and the hammer, the flannel shirt, open at the neck, the khaki trousers still bearing the price tag. And curiosity beginning to {{get the better of}} her, she was emboldened to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the fence. If one had to work, it must be a pleasure to work on things pleasing to the eye--such was her inference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Foster, [...] "I'll <b>pay</b> you <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> {{by stating}} that I wouldn't have {{imagined}} it; but I don't understand what the police {{have to do with}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Jessy {{looked up}} at him. He had, as she recognized, spoken as he felt, on impulse, and this was more gratifying than an obvious desire to <b>pay</b> her <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> would have been.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my Lord; I {{told you}} what sort of a man you'd have to do with; one that does his work thoroughly, and, I think, <b>pays</b> you <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> by {{thinking}} that you want it done thoroughly." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{excitement}} {{of the past few}} days must have had a stimulating effect on Mike's mind--shaken it up, as it were, for now, {{for the second time in}} two days, he displayed quite a creditable amount of intuition. He might have been misled by Adair's apparently deprecatory attitude toward Sedleigh, and blundered into a denunciation of the place. Adair had said, [...] "a small school like this" [...] in the sort of voice which might have led his hearer to think that he was expected to say, [...] "Yes, rotten little hole, isn't it?" [...] or words to that effect. Mike, fortunately, perceived that the words were used purely from politeness, on the Chinese principle. When a Chinese man wishes to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> he does so by belittling himself and his belongings.|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't {{much time}} if you are to see {{everything}} in a day. We shall be off in a moment. We'll have lunch at the Amarilla Club--though I belong also to the Anglo-American--mining engineers and business men, don't you know--and to the Mirliflores as well, a new club--English, French, Italians, all sorts--lively young fellows mostly, who wanted to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to an old resident, sir. But we'll lunch at the Amarilla. Interest you, I fancy. Real thing of the country. Men of the first families. The President of the Occidental Republic himself belongs to it, sir. Fine old bishop with a broken nose in the patio. Remarkable piece of statuary, I believe. Cavaliere Parrochetti--you know Parrochetti, the famous Italian sculptor--was working here for two years--thought very highly of our old bishop. [...] . There! I am very much at your service now." ...|$|E
60|$|HUSSEIN PACHA, 'the favourite,' {{not only}} of the Marquess of Mash, but of Tattersall's, unaccountably sickened and died. His noble master, full of chagrin took to his bed, and {{followed}} his steed's example. The death of the Marquess caused a vacancy in the stewardship of the approaching Doncaster. Sir Lucius Grafton was the other steward, and he proposed to the Duke of St. James, as he was a Yorkshireman, to become his colleague. His Grace, who wished to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to his county, closed with the proposition. Sir Lucius was a first-rate jockey; his colleague was quite ignorant of the noble science in all its details; but that was of slight importance. The Baronet was to be the working partner, and do the business; the Duke the show member of the concern, and do the magnificence; as one banker, you may observe, lives always in Portland Place, reads the Court Journal all the morning, and has an opera-box, while his partner lodges in Lombard Street, thumbs a price-current, and only has a box at Clapham.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{discovered}} {{an excellent way}} of punishing me," [...] he said manfully, [...] "and I submit. Indeed, I admire you the more. So I am <b>paying</b> you <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> when I whisper that I know you knew." ...|$|R
60|$|Here was <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} of <b>paying</b> her <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> if I {{had been a}} younger man, or if she had produced a favorable impression on me. As it was, I hit--if I may praise myself--on an ingenious compromise.|$|R
5000|$|The {{critics say}} that her work {{is as good as}} a man's, which is a way critics have when they wish to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> {{greatest}} <b>compliment</b> that <b>a</b> critic's phrasing can devise. Laura R. Prieto ...|$|R
60|$|Had Grace Chatterton been a {{particle}} less delicate--less retiring--blessed with a managing mother, as she was, John Moseley {{would not have}} thought another moment about her. But, on every occasion when the dowager made any of her open attacks, Grace discovered so much distress, so much unwillingness to second them, that a suspicion of a confederacy never entered his brain. It {{is not to be}} supposed that Lady Chattelton's manoeuvres were limited to the direct and palpable schemes we have mentioned; no--these were the effervescence, the exuberance of her zeal; but as is generally the case, they sufficiently proved the ground-work of all her other machinations; none of the little artifices of such as placing--of leaving alone--of showing similarity of tastes:--of compliments to the gentlemen, were neglected.--This latter business she had contrived to get Catherine to take off her hands; but Grace could never <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> in her life, unless changing of color, trembling, undulations of the bosom, and such natural movements can be so called; but she loved dearly to receive them from John Moseley.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{answer to}} your letter, I {{can assure you that}} you must not {{conceive}} me to be wanting in those finer feelings which are the chief adornment of humanity. It is true that for some years, absorbed as I have been in affairs of the highest importance, I have seldom taken a pen in hand, for which I can assure you that I have been reproached by many des plus charmantes of your charming sex. At the present moment I lie abed (having stayed late in order to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the Marchioness of Dover at her ball last night), and this is writ to my dictation by Ambrose, my clever rascal of a valet. I am interested to hear of my nephew Rodney (Mon dieu, quel nom!), and as I shall be on my way to visit the Prince at Brighton next week, I shall break my journey at Friar's Oak for the sake of seeing both you and him. Make my compliments to your husband.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the eighteenth}} of January the House of Lords sent down {{a bill to}} the Commons, for fixing the {{precedence}} of the Hanover family, which probably had been forgot in the Acts for settling the succession of the crown. That of Henry VIII. which gives the rank to princes of the blood, carries it no farther than to nephews, nieces, and grandchildren of the crown, by virtue of which the Princess Sophia is a princess of the blood, as niece to King Charles I of England, and precedes accordingly, but this privilege doth not descend to her son the Elector, or the electoral prince. To supply which defect, and <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the presumptive heirs of the crown, this bill, as appeareth by the preamble, was recommended by Her Majesty to the House of Lords, which the Commons, to shew their zeal for every thing that might be thought to concern the interest or honour of that illustrious family, ordered to be read thrice, passed nemine contradicente {{and returned to the}} Lords, without any amendment, on the very day it was sent down.|$|E
6000|$|... "The wise," [...] said Hartley, declining the present, and at {{the same}} time <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> {{suitable}} <b>compliment</b> to the Fakir's cap and robe,--"the wise of every country are brethren. My left hand takes no guerdon of my right." ...|$|R
6000|$|Which {{toast of}} course {{involved}} the drinking the healths {{of the three}} representatives of those families, and their returning thanks, and <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> each to the other's house: and so the ice cracked a little further; and young Fortescue proposed the health of [...] "Amyas Leigh and all bold mariners;" [...] to which Amyas replied by a few blunt kindly words, [...] "that he wished to know no better fortune than to sail round the world again with the present company as fellow-adventurers, and so give the Spaniards another taste of the men of Devon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; not Mephistopheles, but Wagner--with a difference. Wagner taking Mephistopheles {{instead of}} Faust for his model." [...] Seeing by {{his face that}} he did not relish the comparison, she added, [...] "I am <b>paying</b> you <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b> Wagner {{represents}} <b>a</b> very clever man." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{customary}} {{to condemn}} the American as a materialist because of his worship of success. But indeed this very worship, like any worship, even devil-worship, proves him rather a mystic than a materialist. The Frenchman who retires from business when he has money enough to drink his wine and eat his omelette in peace might much more plausibly be called a materialist by {{those who do not}} prefer to call him a man of sense. But Americans do worship success in the abstract, as a sort of ideal vision. They follow success rather than money; they follow money rather than meat and drink. If their national life in one sense is a perpetual game of poker, they are playing excitedly for chips or counters as well as for coins. And by the ultimate test of material enjoyment, like the enjoyment of an omelette, even a coin is itself a counter. The Yankee cannot eat chips as the Frenchman can eat chipped potatoes; but neither can he swallow red cents as the Frenchman swallows red wine. Thus when people say of a Yankee that he worships the dollar, they <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to his fine spirituality more true and delicate than they imagine. The dollar is an idol because it is an image; but it is an image of success and not of enjoyment.|$|E
60|$|You cannot {{open your}} statute book without seeing {{positive}} provisions relative to every {{right of the}} subject. This business of juries {{is the subject of}} not fewer than a dozen. To suppose that juries are something innate in the Constitution of Great Britain, that they have jumped, like Minerva, out of the head of Jove in complete armour, is a weak fancy, supported neither by precedent nor by reason. Whatever is most ancient and venerable in our Constitution, royal prerogative, privileges of parliament, rights of elections, authority of courts, juries, must have been modelled according to the occasion. I spare your patience, and I <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to your understanding, in not attempting to prove that anything so elaborate and artificial as a jury was not the work of chance, but a matter of institution, brought to its present state by the joint efforts of legislative authority and juridical prudence. It need not be ashamed of being (what in many parts of it at least it is) the offspring of an Act of Parliament, unless it is a shame for our laws to be the results of our legislature. Juries, which sensitively shrank from the rude touch of parliamentary remedy, {{have been the subject of}} not fewer than, I think, forty-three Acts of Parliament, in which they have been changed with all the authority of a creator over its creature, from Magna Charta to the great alterations which were made in the 29th of George II.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{the people}} of the Generality of Limoges {{represented}} the most unattractive type of peasantry. They were deeply superstitious, violent in their prejudices, obstinate withstanders of all novelty, rude, dull, stupid, perverse, and hardly redeeming a narrow and blinding covetousness by a stubborn and mechanical industry. Their country has been fixed upon as the cradle of Celtic nationality in France, and there are some who believe that here the old Gaulish blood kept itself purer from external admixture than was the case anywhere else in the land. In our own day, when an orator has occasion to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the townsmen of Limoges, he says that the genius of {{the people of}} the district has ever been faithful to its source; it has ever held the balance true between the Frank tradition of the north, and the Roman tradition of the south. This makes an excellent period for a rhetorician, but the fact which it conveys made Limousin all the severer a task for an administrator. Almost immediately after his appointment, Turgot had the chance of being removed to Rouen, and after that to Lyons. Either of these promotions would have had the advantages of a considerable increase of income, less laborious duties, and a much more agreeable residence. Turgot, with a high sense of duty that probably seemed quixotic enough to the Controller-General, declined the preferment, on the very ground of the difficulty and importance of the task that he had already undertaken. 'Poor peasants, poor kingdom!' had been Quesnay's constant exclamation, and it had sunk deep into the spirit of his disciple. He could have little thought of high salary or personal ease, when he discerned an opportunity of improving the hard lot of the peasant, and softening the misfortunes of the realm.|$|E
60|$|You <b>pay</b> me <b>a</b> great <b>compliment,</b> Alec. You repeat to my very face {{one of my}} {{favourite}} observations.|$|R
60|$|My colleague, {{the first}} secretary, {{was a far}} more {{interesting}} person. Bright, unaffected, and agreeable, he at once interested me when we were introduced to each other. I <b>pay</b> myself <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> as I consider, when I add that he became my firm and true friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{business}} is it of yours who the visitor is?" [...] her master asked sharply. Always easy and good-humoured with his inferiors in general, Lord Harry {{had taken a}} dislike to his wife's maid, from {{the moment when he}} had first seen her. His Irish feeling for beauty and brightness was especially offended by the unhealthy pallor of the woman's complexion, and the sullen self-suppression of her manner. All that his native ingenuity had been able to do was to make her <b>a</b> means of <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to his wife. [...] "Your maid has one merit in my eyes," [...] he said; [...] "she is a living proof of the sweetness of your temper." ...|$|R
