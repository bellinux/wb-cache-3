Fossil fuel generators can provide dispatchable low carbon electricity by leveraging post-combustion carbon capture technologies assuming <b>post-combustion</b> capture (PCC) <b>plants</b> can operate in a flexible and efficient manner. This thesis explores the connection between solvent analysis techniques and the optimal operation of PCC plants with a particular focus on process optimisation and control under flexible and transient conditions. The connection between solvent analysis measurements and PCC plant process control and optimisation strategies is established. An ideal set of analysis technique criteria is established for flexible <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plants.</b> Currently available solvent analysis techniques are surveyed and evaluated against the ideal set of criteria. Specific weaknesses of current techniques are highlighted and two novel solvent analysis techniques are introduced to address these weaknesses. The first provides continuous amine concentration and CO 2 loading measurements at process flow conditions by inferring solvent chemical composition from physical properties. This method was evaluated by deploying an instrument prototype to a <b>post-combustion</b> pilot <b>plant</b> to continuously analyse solvent during a test campaign which simulated flexible plant operation. The measurement results were compared against industry standard solvent analysis techniques and the inferential technique was found to produce sufficient measurement accuracy and sensitivity while providing a faster, lower cost and more robust measurement technique. The second technique combines the strengths of several currently available CO 2 loading techniques to measure CO 2 gas evolved from an acidified solvent under vacuum conditions. The technique was found to provide superior measurement accuracy and sensitivity compared to currently available methods when measuring lab standard solutions.

40|$|A techno-economic {{assessment}} of power plants with CO 2 capture technologies {{with a focus}} on process scenarios that deliver different grades of CO 2 product purity is presented. The three leading CO 2 capture technologies are considered, namely; oxyfuel combustion, pre-combustion and post-combustion capture. The study uses a combination of process simulation of flue gas cleaning processes, modelling with a power plant cost and performance calculator and literature values of key performance criteria in order to evaluate the performance, cost and CO 2 product purity of the considered CO 2 capture options. For oxyfuel combustion capture plants, three raw CO 2 flue gas processing strategies of compression and dehydration only, double flash system purification and distillation purification are considered. Analysis of pre-combustion capture options is based on integrated gasification combined cycle plants using physical solvent systems for capturing CO 2 and sulfur species via three routes; co-capture of sulfur impurities with the CO 2 stream using Selexol™ solvent, separate capture of CO 2 and sulfur impurities using Selexol™, and Rectisol® solvent systems for separate capture of sulfur impurities and CO 2. Analysis of <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plants</b> was made with and without some conventional pollution control devices.

30|$|Extreme {{learning}} machine (ELM) was proposed into {{address the issue}} of slow training in conventional feedforward neural networks (Huang et al. 2006). ELM is basically a single hidden layer feedforward neural network with randomly assigned weights between the input and hidden layers. The weights between the hidden and output layers are determined in a one-step regression type approach using generalised inverse. Thus, an ELM can be built very quickly. As the weights between the input and hidden layers are randomly assigned, correlations can exist among the hidden neuron outputs and variations in model performance can exist. This paper proposes using principal component regression (PCR) to obtain the weights between the hidden and output layers in order to overcome the correlation issue among hidden neuron outputs. This paper also proposes building multiple ELMs on bootstrap re-sampling replications of the original training data and then combining these ELMs in order to enhance model accuracy and reliability.

40|$|A {{simple method}} based on {{hydrophilic}} liquid chromatography (HILIC) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) {{for the detection}} of monoethanolamine (MEA) degradation products in CO 2 <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plants</b> has been developed. MEA by-products determination has traditionally been difficult due to analytical separation problems. Even in recent sophisticated methods, this difficulty remains as the major issue often resulting in time-consuming sample preparations. In this work, we have collected samples directly from a real pilot plant and analyzed them, for the first time, by using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) -MS or ESIMS without any separation, both in positive and negative ionization modes. Alternatively, a previous liquid chromatography (LC) run was performed before ESI-MS; traditional reverse phase separation and HILIC were compared. Our results indicated that HILIC separation using an amino modified column, coupled to ESI-MS or ESI-MS/MS measurements, is the suitable method for identifying as many degradation products. Moreover, some plausible degradation mechanisms are proposed to explain some peaks in the spectra. The present work is intended as a preliminary study aiming to show the usefulness of these alternative techniques for this kind of investigations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The poor {{performance}} of internal combustion (IC) engines {{can be attributed}} to the departure from equilibrium in the combustion process. This departure is expressed numerically, as the difference between the working fluid’s temperature and an ideal ‘combustion tempera-ture’, calculated using a simple expression. It is shown that for combustion of hydrocarbons to be performed reversibly in a single reaction, impractically high working fluid temperatures are required – typically at least 3500 K. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is an alternative to traditional, single-stage combustion that performs the oxidation of fuels using two reactions, in separate vessels: the oxidizer and reducer. An additional species circulates between the oxidizer and reducer carrying oxygen atoms. Careful selection of this oxygen carrier can reduce the equilibrium temperature of the two redox reactions to below current metallurgical limits. Consequently, using CLC it is theoretically pos-sible to approach a reversible IC engine without resorting to impractical temperatures. CLC also lends itself to carbon capture, as at no point is N 2 from the air allowed to mix with the CO 2 pro-duced in the reduction process and therefore a <b>post-combustion</b> scrubbing <b>plant</b> is not required. Two thermodynamic criteria for selecting the oxygen carrier are established: the equilibriu...|$|R

To make the integration of carbon capture to power plants economically and technically feasible, the carbon capture process {{has to be able}} to follow these fast and large load changes without decreasing the overall performance of the carbon capture plant. Therefore, dynamic models for simulation, optimization and control system design are essential. In this work, we compare the transient behavior of the model against dynamic pilot data for CO 2 absorption and desorption for step-changes in the flue gas flow rate. In addition we investigate the dynamic behavior of a full-scale <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plant</b> using monoethanolamine (MEA) and piperazine (PZ). This analysis demonstrates the good agreement between the developed model (dCAPCO 2) and the pilot measurements at both, transient and steady-state conditions.

The simulation study reveals that it is essential to control the lean solvent flow to avoid sudden changes in the CO 2 removal rate and to avoid increased heat demand of solvent regeneration.

40|$|AbstractPiperazine is a {{promising}} solvent for reducing CO 2 emissions. It {{can be applied}} for the post-combustion capture process and it has limited degradation and fast kinetics. However, precipitation and slurry formation still represent a challenge for the PZ-CO 2 -H 2 O system from an operational point of view but also from a modeling perspective. The present work develops a rate-based model for CO 2 absorption and desorption modeling for gas-liquid-solid systems and it is demonstrated for the piperazine CO 2 capture process. This model {{is an extension of}} the DTU CAPCO 2 model to precipitating systems. It uses the extended UNIQUAC thermodynamic model for phase equilibria and thermal properties estimation. The mass and heat transfer phenomena is implemented in a film model approach, based on second order reactions kinetics. The transfer fluxes are calculated using the concentration of the dissolved species since the piperazine is deactivated when present as solid. It is assumed that solid-gas reactions are slow compared to normal liquid side reactions. In the current work, the formation of solids is described in an equilibrium approach, assuming instantaneous formation of hydrates such as PZ• 6 H 2 O, PZ•½H 2 O, and anhydrous PZ. The simulation of a 100 t/hr <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plant</b> outlines that 5 % solid reduces the CO 2 capture rate with 13 %.

40|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs), a {{new class}} of porous solids comprised of metal-containing nodes linked by organic ligands, have become promising materials for gas separations. In particular, their flexible chemistry makes them attractive for CO 2 capture from flue gas streams in <b>post-combustion</b> <b>plants.</b> Although numerous efforts have been exerted on the investigation of MOFs for CO 2 capture, the exploration of the effects from coexisting components present in very dilute proportions in flue gases is limited because of the experimental difficulty to determine the coadsorption of CO 2 with trace components. In this regard, molecular simulations show superiority. In this study, molecular simulations are used to estimate the in?uence of impurities: water, O 2, and SO 2 on post-combustion CO 2 capture in MOFs. Firstly, two MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUMs), HKUST- 1 and Mg-MOF- 74 are explored. Increase of CO 2 adsorption is observed for hydrated HKUST- 1; on the contrary, the opposite water adsorption behavior is observed in hydrated Mg-MOF- 74, leading to decrease of CO 2 adsorption. Further, water effects on CO 2 capture in M-HKUST 1 (M = Mg, Zn, Co, Ni) are evaluated to test whether comparing the binding energy could be a general method to evaluate water effects in MOFs with CUMs. It is found that the method works well for Zn-, Co-, and Ni-HKUST 1 but partially for Mg-HKUST 1. In addition, the effects of O 2 and SO 2 on CO 2 capture in MOFs are also investigated for the first time, showing that the effects of O 2 may be negligible but SO 2 has negative effects in the CO 2 capture process in HKUST- 1 systems. Secondly, the influences of water on CO 2 capture in three UiO- 66 MOFs with functional groups, ?NH 2, ?OH and ?Br are explored, respectively. For UiO- 66 -NH 2 and -OH, the presence of water lowers CO 2 adsorption significantly; in contrast, water shows much smaller effects in UiO- 66 -Br. Moreover, the presence of SO 2 decreases water adsorption but enhances CO 2 uptakes slightly in both UiO- 66 -NH 2 and -Br. Finally, the effects of impurities on CO 2 capture in a MOF with suitable pore size (PCN- 200) are analyzed. The adsorption of both CO 2 and N 2 decrease substantially even with 1 % water present in the mixture. In addition, the presence of low SO 2 does not show obvious effect in PCN- 200. However, a lower CO 2 adsorption is observed for a mixture with a high SO 2 content. In collaboration with experimental groups, the performances of three new MOFs in CO 2 capture are evaluated using molecular simulations. The computational results demonstrate the feasibility of precisely designing single-molecule traps (SMT) for CO 2 capture. Also, a multi-functional MOF with micro-porosity, open Cu 2 + sites and amine groups has also proved computationally the selective adsorption of CO 2 over CH 4 and N 2.

Today, CO 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CO 2 gas separation with membranes has been demonstrated mainly on a laboratory scale, while less is known about membrane performance and stability under real conditions. To extend the state of knowledge, a test bed was put into operation in the flue gas stream of a hard-coal-fired power plant (EnBW Rheinhafendampfkraftwerk, Karlsruhe), which enabled the long-term functional test of ceramic as well as polymer gas separation membranes for up to 1100 h.

Due to operating this membrane in direct contact with flue gas, the flow rate was reduced from 0. 86 to 0. 07 m 3 /m 2 h bar within the first 400 h.

Solvent samples were analysed by titration and CO 2 solvent loadings well above 0. 5 mol CO 2 /mol MEA were determined. This high CO 2 loading is possibly due to good absorptions properties, such as the absorption height of 23. 9 m, a low gas velocity of approx. 1 m/s in the absorber and low lean solvent and flue gas temperatures of 32 and 35 °C. Solvent degradation in the pilot plant is clearly dominated by oxidative degradation forming formate and oxalate as major degradation products. Due to the application of the pre-scrubber the increase of inorganic salts is more or less continuous at a moderate level. Finally, a system for managing and maintaining solvent properties over long operational periods is developed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne {{major part}} of the {{cooperation}} of RWE Power, BASF and Linde, which is aiming at an advanced optimised CO 2 -scrubbing technology for power plant applications, was the construction and commissioning of the first <b>post-combustion</b> capture pilot <b>plant</b> in Germany at the lignite-fired 1, 000  MWel power station Niederaussem. The testing programme executed in the pilot plant is not only focusing on the energy demand for CO 2 capture, solvent stability and emissions but also comprises an extensive material testing programme. Steel and plastic samples, tubes and flanges are located in different positions in the plant (pre-scrubber unit, absorber, desorber) to investigate material resistance at a wide range of specific process conditions (temperature, pressure, solvent loading, gas/solvent stream). Coupons made of different grades of stainless steel and plastic were placed in eight different positions. Tubes and flanges made of stainless steel and glass fibre-reinforced plastic were located in five different positions. In addition, a temperature-controlled concrete module equipped with a plastic in-liner was incorporated into the pilot plant. And, finally, different types of gaskets were tested. The testing programme started in mid- 2009 with a six-month campaign using 30 %-weight MEA as a benchmark solvent. At the beginning of 2010, the testing campaign with the new optimised solvent from BASF was started. This paper summarises the examination methodology based on non-destructive and destructive measurements and discusses some of the results obtained for both testing phases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a one-dimensional, semi-empirical dynamic {{model for the}} simulation and analysis of a calcium looping process for post-combustion CO 2 capture. Reduction of greenhouse emissions from fossil fuel power production requires rapid actions including the development of efficient carbon capture and sequestration technologies. The development of new carbon capture technologies can be expedited by using modelling tools. Techno-economical evaluation of new capture processes can be done quickly and cost-effectively with computational models before building expensive pilot <b>plants.</b> <b>Post-combustion</b> calcium looping is a developing carbon capture process which utilizes fluidized bed technology with lime as a sorbent. The main objective of this work was to analyse the technological feasibility of the calcium looping process at different scales with a computational model. A one-dimensional dynamic model {{was applied to the}} calcium looping process, simulating the behaviour of the interconnected circulating fluidized bed reactors. The model incorporates fundamental mass and energy balance solvers to semi-empirical models describing solid behaviour in a circulating fluidized bed and chemical reactions occurring in the calcium loop. In addition, fluidized bed combustion, heat transfer and core-wall layer effects were modelled. The calcium looping model framework was successfully applied to a 30 kWth laboratory scale and a pilot scale unit 1. 7 MWth and used to design a conceptual 250 MWth industrial scale unit. Valuable information was gathered from the behaviour of a small scale laboratory device. In addition, the interconnected behaviour of pilot plant reactors and the effect of solid fluidization on the thermal and carbon dioxide balances of the system were analysed. The scale-up study provided practical information on the thermal design of an industrial sized unit, selection of particle size and operability in different load scenarios...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe US Department of Energy (DOE) {{established}} the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) {{as part of}} its strategy to address the need for cost-effective CO 2 capture technologies. The focus of the NCCC is to conduct research and development to advance emerging CO 2 control technologies to commercial scale for effective integration into coal- based Integraged Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and combustion processes. To achieve this goal, the NCCC provides a test-bed for government, industrial, and university projects to conduct meaningful tests in an industrial setting. The NCCC test plan includes both post-combustion and pre-combustion CO 2 capture development. A flexible post- combustion test facility, <b>Post-combustion</b> Carbo <b>Plant</b> E. C. Gaston, in Wilsonville, Alabama. The facility, which is managed by Southern Company Services, provides a platform for testing technologies at a wide-range of sizes and process conditions on coal-derived flue gas. Since completing commissioning and baseline testing in early 2011, several technologies have been tested. The PC 4 facility includes multiple slipstreams with a range of flue gas throughputs to allow the evaluation of post- combustion CO 2 capture technologies. It provides the capability to test modules from technology developers and to test solvents in an absorber/regenerator unit, the pilot solvent test unit (PSTU). In 2011, PSTU baseline tests were completed, using a reference solvent, monoethanol amine (MEA) to characterize its performance and verify the reliability of the data generated. The PSTU was later operated to test a potential commercial solvent developed by Babcock & Wilcox. Aker Carbon Solutions installed a mobile test unit at the site to test its commercial solvent, and Membrane Technology & Research installed and commissioned its 0. 05 -MW polymeric CO 2 -separation membrane, which will continue to be tested throughout 2012. Also in 2012, several other developers will test solvents in the PSTU and enzyme-based solvent systems in the bench scale area on coal-derived flue gas. Collaboration with additional developers for future test plans is on-going. The NCCC also generates coal derived syngas which is available for testing technologies related to pre-combustion CO 2 capture. Several slipstreams are in place with a range of syngas throughputs. Technologies tested in 2011 include water gas shift catalysts, high-temperature mercury and CO 2 sorbents, a hydrocarbon removal system, physical and chemical solvents for CO 2 absorption, a polymeric CO 2 -separation membrane, and three hydrogen- separation membranes (carbon molecular sieve, polymeric, and palladium based). Several of these technologies will be tested further in 2012, and membranes and solvents from other developers will also be tested. Result from NCCC's testing have indicated the facility's usefulness in accelerating the commercialization of advanced CO 2 capture technologies. This paper will detail the NCCC's capabilities, test results, and future plans...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} from power plants utilizing fossil fuels {{is expected to}} become substantially {{more important in the}} near- to medium-term due to increasing costs associated to national and international greenhouse gas regulations, such as the Kyoto protocol and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. However, since net efficiency penalties caused by capturing CO 2 emissions from power plants are significant, measures to reduce or recover efficiency losses are of substantial interest. For a state-of-the-art 400 MW natural gas-fueled combined cycle (NGCC) power <b>plant,</b> <b>post-combustion</b> CO 2 removal based on chemical solvents like amines is expected to reduce the net plant efficiency in the order of 9 - 12 percentage points at 90 % overall CO 2 capture. A first step that has been proposed earlier to improve the capture efficiency and reduce capture equipment costs for NGCC is exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). An alternative or complementary approach to increase the overall plant efficiency could be the recovery of available low temperature heat from the solvent-based CO 2 removal systems and related process equipment. Low temperature heat is available in substantial quantities in flue gas coolers that are required upstream of the CO 2 capture unit, and that are used for exhaust gas recirculation, if applied. Typical temperature levels are in the order of 80 °C or up to 100 °C on the hot end. Additional low-grade heat sources are the amine condenser which operates at around 100 - 130 °C and the amine reboiler water cooling that could reach temperatures of up to 130 - 140 °C. The thermal energy of these various sources could be utilized in a variety of low-temperature heat recovery systems. This paper evaluates heat recovery by means of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) that - in contrast to traditional steam Rankine cycles- is able to convert heat into electricity efficiently even at comparably low temperatures. By producing additional electrical power in the heat recovery system, the global performance of the power plant can be further improved. This study indicates a theoretical entitlement of up to additional 1 - 1. 5 percentage points in efficiency that could be gained by integrating ORC technology with a post-combustion capture system for natural gas combined cycles. The analysis is based on fundamental thermodynamic analyses and does not include an engineering- or componentlevel design and feasibility analysis. Different ORC configurations have been considered for thermal energy recovery at varying temperature levels from the abovementioned sources. The study focuses on simultaneous lowgrade heat recovery in a single ORC loop. Heat recovery options that are discussed include in series, in parallel or cascaded arrangements of heat exchangers. Different organic operating fluids, including carbon dioxide, R 245 fa, and Nbutane were considered for the analysis. The ORC performance was evaluated for the most promising organic working fluid by a parametric study. Optimum cycle operating temperatures and pressures were identified in order to evaluate the most efficient approach for low temperature heat recovery...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} various processes for reducing CO 2 emissions from natural-gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. The scope of the thesis is to focus mainly on post-combustion chemical absorption for NGCC. For the <b>post-combustion</b> capture <b>plant,</b> an important interface is the steam extraction from the steam turbine in order to supply the heat for solvent regeneration. The steam extraction imposes a power production penalty. The thesis includes analysis and comparison between several chemical absorption processes configurations integrated with NGCC. The objectives of the present work were to use thermodynamic analysis on various chemical absorption process configurations to evaluate, quantify and justify improved design of NGCC with post-combustion CO 2 capture. The thermodynamic evaluation of the processes gave insight to the detailed distribution of process irreversibilities and supports the state-of-the-art process configuration with the lowest energy penalty due to addition of CO 2 capture to the power plant. The reference power plant without CO 2 capture has a power production of 384 MW and a net electric efficiency of 56. 4 % (LHV) with CO 2 emissions of ≈ 362 g CO 2 / net kWh electricity. The power plant design was carried out using the computational tool GTPRO. The aim of the CO 2 capture plant was to remove 90 % of the CO 2 emissions present in the flue gas. To assess and analyse the various chemical absorption process configurations, the UniSim Design software was used, which contains the Amines Property Package. This special property package {{has been designed to}} aid the modelling of alkanolamine treating units in which CO 2 is removed from gaseous streams. The downstream compression of the captured CO 2 was also simulated using UniSim Design. The investigated process configurations were comprised of chemical absorption process with absorber inter-cooling, split-flow process and lean vapour recompression (LVR) process. Several design parameters were modified for each of the process configurations to achieve low energy consumption and consequently low work demand. The inter-cooling of the absorber column led to increased solvent rich loading. Consequently, the solvent circulation rate and reboiler energy requirement was decreased. In the split-flow configuration, due to splitting of the rich solvent into two streams, the amount of rich solvent entering the bottom section of the stripper was reduced. Therefore, less reboiler energy was required to remove CO 2 from the solvent to reach the same solvent lean loading as of the reference chemical absorption process. In the configuration with lean vapour recompression (LVR), the lean solvent stream was utilised as a low temperature heat source in order to add exergy input in the form of steam to the stripper column and thus reduce the reboiler duty. The reboiler duty for the CO 2 capture was decreased from 3. 74 MJ/kgCO 2 in the reference chemical absorption process to 2. 71 MJ/kgCO 2 for the case of LVR with absorber inter-cooling. The net electric efficiency of the reference process with CO 2 capture was calculated to 49. 5 % (LHV). With the improved process design, the highest net power plant efficiency was calculated to 50. 2 % (LHV) for the case of LVR with absorber inter-cooling. Moreover, exergy analysis was performed to identify the irreversibilities associated with the integration of power plant with various CO 2 capture and compression processes. Particularly, the second law of thermodynamics was used as a tool to evaluate and quantify the reduction of energy penalty associated with CO 2 capture for each process modification. Defining the work input for a theoretical reversible CO 2 capture process as the minimum required work was functional step in characterising the difference of the work input of theoretical reversible processes and the real irreversible processes. Exergy efficiency of the reference chemical absorption process was calculated to 21. 3 % versus 25 % for the case of LVR with absorber inter-cooling. Through exergy balance for every CO 2 capture process configuration, the exchange of exergy content of material and energy streams was assessed. Using the combination of power plant efficiency and exergy analysis as tools, a pre-combustion reforming combined cycle (IRCC) process with chemical absorption CO 2 capture process was investigated. A rational efficiency of 43. 8 % was achieved, which indicates the share of input exergy utilised for work production by the power cycle in addition to the exergy of the pure compressed CO 2 stream. The highest amount of irreversibility was contributed by the gas turbine and mainly by the combustor. The irreversibility which is inherent in the combustion process corresponded to a large fraction of original exergy of the fuel. This could be partially compensated by increase the preheating of the fuel supplied to the combustor. Also preheating the inlet streams to auto-thermal reactor (ATR) was found advantageous in decreasing the ATR irreversibilities.
