40|$|Fowler's {{theory of}} {{photoelectric}} emission is discussed {{from the viewpoint}} of the experimental physicist and several significant consequences of the theory in analyzing experimental data pointed out. A new graphical method of testing the theory is suggested. This method makes it possible to determine the "true" <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> of a surface from photocurrent-temperature curves taken at a single incident frequency, eliminating the necessity of measuring relative intensities of spectral lines. The method is applied to new experimental data on palladium and to Morris' data on gold and found to be completely successful, thus furnishing additional verification of Fowler's theory...|$|E
40|$|In {{extending}} results {{previously reported}} the photoelectric and thermionic work functions for platinum were studied while the specimen was put through an extended outgassing process. With monochromatic light the final {{value of the}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> {{was found to be}} 1962 A (6. 30 v.) The thermionic work function increases during outgassing, reaching a final value of 6. 35 volts, within 1 percent. The two work functions are thus in agreement within the limits of error. The thermionic constant A of the Richardson T^ 2 law also increases as the work function increases, reaching a final value which is 200 times or more greater than Dushman's theoretical value of 60. 2 amp/cm^ 2 deg^ 2...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between the influence of domain dependent photochemical and photoelectric cation reduction {{on the surface of}} LiNbO 3 is presented. The reduction of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> for LiNbO 3 due to the polar nature of the crystal allows high energy UV irradiation to produce free electrons that can participate in photochemical reduction of silver nitrate on the surface. This is in addition to the previously understood phenomenon of domain directed photophysics, where influences on space charge layer due to the internal dipole of a ferroelectric determine the carrier at the surface. We show that the interaction of photoelectric and domain dependent influences can be observed in LiNbO 3 due to the low electron affinity (ca 2 eV) and large band bending (0. 8 eV) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} {{electron affinity}} photocathodes, in particular GaAs, have been extensively studied {{in recent years}} [1]. Negative electron affinity occurs when a low work function coating, for example caesium plus oxygen, reduces the vacuum level below {{the bottom of the}} conduction band. Electrons are excited in the bulk of the crystal, and, having rapidly thermalised diffuse to the vacuum interface where a certain fraction are emitted. The efficiency of this final process depends on various parameters such as the nature of the surface, the (Cs-O) activation procedure used, and the electronic properties of the surface, for example the degree of bandbending. An equally important parameter which is particularly evident in the case of photoemission from ternaries is the heterojunction barrier [2] between the semiconductor and the Cs-O coating. Experiments have been conducted to measure this parameter on n and p type GaAs. Using heat cleaned (100) Si doped GaAs, the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>thresholds</b> were determined as the thickness of the (Cs-O) coating increased. Values for the heterojunction barrier in the range 1. 26 - 1. 32 eV were measured. In the case of p type GaAs, {{because of the nature of}} the band bending at the surface, it is not possible to measure the thresholds directly. However some work has been carried out on heat cleaned (100) Zn doped p type GaAs and, taking energy distribution measurements as the thickness of the Cs-O coating is increased, the heterojunction barrier has been found to be ~ 1. 3 eV. There is thus some evidence from these measurements, that the barrier height is the same for both n and p type GaAs. It is difficult to assess the importance of the barrier, but in the case of p type material it appears that the maximum sensitivity occurs when the work function is equal to the barrier height...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{response}} of anth"y-caesium photocathodes Measurements {{have been made}} of the relative photoileclric quantum eficiency?(A) of SbCs 3 cathodes of M ith Pyrex and quartz windows, from ~= 200 - 650 mp. ?(A) depends on the window transinittame W(h), the cathode absorbance A(h, d), the absolute photoelectric quantum efiiciency Qo(h) and the p/ 1 otoelectron escape probability f (A, d). Comparison Irith other data has allowed the separation of these factors, yielding inter alia the absorption spectrum of SbCs 3 down to h = 220 mp, and the absolute <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> curre Qo(h) plotted against h. The optimum thickness for a thin cathode is d = 200 A. Errors in other published data are noted, and methods of increasing?(A) and of improving scintillation detectors are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel dual-mode Kelvin probe featuring ambient pressure Photoemission Spectroscopy (PES), which yields {{information on the}} absolute work function (Φ) of a metal and the Ionisation Potential (IP) of a semiconductor, coupled with a high resolution Contact Potential Difference capability which can be extended to Surface Photovoltage measurements. The relative energy resolution are 50 meV for PES and 1 - 3 meV for CPD. To surmount the limitation of electron scattering in air the incident photon energy is rastered rather than applying a variable retarding electric field as is used UPS. We propose a mechanism of atmospheric ion generation and show that for the metal photoresponse obeys Fowler Theory. The relationship between CPD and <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> is a useful tool in characterizing the electrical behavior of materials. We illustrate this with native oxide covered Cu and n-type Si. Further we show that the photoresponse {{can be used to}} generate the near Fermi-level Density of States (DOS) in Iron and Nickel-Phthalocyanine...|$|E
40|$|The quantum {{detection}} efficiency (QDE) of potassium bromide as a photocathode applied {{directly to the}} surface of a microchannel plate over the 250 - 1600 A wavelength range has been measured. The contributions of the photocathode material in the channels and on the interchannel web to the QDE have been determined. Two broad peaks in the QDE centered at about 450 and about 1050 A are apparent, the former with about 50 percent peak QDE and the latter with about 40 percent peak QDE. The <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> is observed at about 1600 A, and there is a narrow QDE minimum at about 750 A which correlates with 2 X the band gap energy for KBr. The angular variation of the QDE from 0 to 40 deg to the channnel axis has also been examined. The stability of Kbr with time is shown to be good with no significant degradation of QDE at wavelengths below 1216 A over a 15 -day period in air...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel photoemission technique utilizing a traditional Kelvin probe as a detector of electrons/atmospheric ions ejected from metallic surfaces (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ti, Zn, Al) illuminated by a deep ultra-violet (DUV) source under ambient pressure. To surmount {{the limitation of}} electron scattering in air the incident photon energy is rastered rather than applying a variable retarding electric field as is used with UPS. This arrangement can be applied in several operational modes: using the DUV source to determine the photoemission threshold (Φ) with 30 – 50 meV resolution and also the Kelvin probe, under dark conditions, to measure contact potential difference (CPD) between the Kelvin probe tip and the metallic sample with an accuracy of 1 – 3 meV. We have studied {{the relationship between the}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> and CPD of metal surfaces cleaned in ambient conditions. Inclusion of a second spectroscopic visible source was used to confirm a semiconducting oxide, possibly Cu 2 O, via surface photovoltage measurements with the KP. This dual detection system can be easily extended to controlled gas conditions, relative humidity control and sample heating/cooling...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 118 - 122) Microfiche. xv, 122 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis PhD dissertation {{is concerned}} with an experimental study of solid surfaces and interfaces. The electronic structure of magnesium hydride, chemisorption of oxygen or hydrogen on the Kg surface, and photoeffect of the Pd/SiOx/Si interface were investigated using the techniques of ultraviolet photoemission (UPS), x-ray photoemission (XPS), and interfacial photoemission (photoemission into solution). The core level binding energies, the valence bandwidth and the volume plasmon energy of KgH 2 were determined from the x-ray photoelectron spectra. The observed plasmon energy {{was found to be}} useful in calculating the average energy gap and the static dielectric constant of MgH 2, which is new information on MgH 2. Measurements of uv photoemission from the Mg surface were made at photon energies a few eV above the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>threshold</b> before and after exposure to oxygen or hydrogen. The oxygen induced vacant-state features in the photoelectron spectra appear to be in good agreement with the calculated resonant state energy levels, suggesting that both singly anionic Oˉ complex and doubly charged O^ 2 - complex exist at the initial stage of oxidation of the Kg surface. This is a new technique for observing the initial stage of chemisorption on Mg. The uv photoelectron spectra and spectral photoelectric yield also provided evidence of coadsorption of hydrogen and oxygen as magnesium hydride-hydroxide. From the XPS study of the Pd/SiOx/Si interface under the visible light bias, we developed a novel method of making non-destructive testing of the open-circuit photovoltage at the interface. The core level spectra of Pd 3 d 5 / 2 was observed to shift to higher (lower) binding energy for the n-type (p-type) Si substrate under illumination, in agreement with the Schottky photovoltaic theory. This shift was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of oxygen or hydrogen which can change the Schottky barrier height. This technique appears to be a promising method of investigating the effect of metal microclusters on the semiconductor surface electronic properties. The effect of hydrogen on the photoresponse of the Pd/SiOx/Si photoelectrode was also investigated using the solid/electrolyte interfacial photoemission technique. Hydrogen was used to exploit the fact that exposure to hydrogen can lower the work function of Pd. The results obtained at low light intensity (6. 4 microwatts/cm 2) agree with the metal/semiconductor interface model. However, at high light intensity (34 milliwatts/cm^ 2), our results of p-type Si/SiOx/Pd support the metal/solution interface model. The dependence of the photocurrent change on light intensity suggests that the magnitude of the surface recombination rate constant is important in locating the rate-determining step in the photoelectrochemical system. The results help resolve the controversy over the proposed models...|$|E
