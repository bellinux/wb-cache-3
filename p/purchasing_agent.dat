5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the Republican {{majority}} on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent</b> and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirements}} of each concern govern {{the number of}} copies of the chart of accounts to be prepared {{and the members of}} the staff to whom they are to be given. Ordinarily it is necessary for each clerk in the accounting and cost departments to have his own copy, while an additional copy should be given to the <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent</b> and treasurer or the officer who is in charge of the accounting records. Portions of the chart of accounts may be given to the plant superintendent, production manager, factory foreman, stock clerks, and factory clerks.|$|E
5000|$|Negotiating {{is a key}} skillset in the Purchasing field. One of {{the goals}} of <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Agents</b> is to acquire goods per the most {{advantageous}} terms of the buying entity (or simply, the [...] "Buyer"). <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Agents</b> typically attempt to decrease costs while meeting the Buyer's other requirements such as an on-time delivery, compliance to the commercial terms and conditions (including the warranty, the transfer of risk, assignment, auditing rights, confidentiality, remedies, etc.).|$|R

25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent,</b> the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746 (1993), that the mere fact that the United States reimburses a contractor for payment of state taxes does not violate the legal incidence test.|$|E
500|$|Furcolo was a {{vigorous}} and active chief executive, working {{long hours in}} the office. He came to the office with large-scale visions and worked hard, sometimes stubbornly and against other party interests, to realize some of them. [...] He was not always seen as a [...] "team player" [...] by {{members of his own}} party in the legislature whose backgrounds he did not generally share. [...] This was particularly manifested in his push for a broad-based sales tax, opposition to which had been enshrined in the Democratic Party platform; the proposal went down to bipartisan defeat in the legislature. [...] During his administration, Furcolo established a network of regional community colleges throughout the Commonwealth, and fought for increases in state worker salaries, as well as improvements in workmen's compensation and unemployment benefits. He introduced income-tax withholding from payroll checks, leading to a significant increase in state revenue. [...] According to the state's 1960 report, it ranked first in the nation in education and at or near the top in other social programs. [...] He also appointed the state's youngest state <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent,</b> Bernard [...] "Bunny" [...] Solomon, who saved taxpayers hundreds of thousands annually.|$|E
500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent</b> for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so when she needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs. She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E

2500|$|In United States v.

Noting that prior statements of a witness that [...] "relate generally to the events and activities testified to" [...] by him must be produced in the Jencks Act, the court said that since the statement in question related to the subject matter as to which the witness had testified, the statute left no room for the trial court, nor for the present court, to speculate as to how useful this statement would be for purposes of cross-examination or how important such cross-examination would be to the defendant's case.|$|E

The board oversaw {{operations at}} Territorial insane asylum, reform school, and prison while McCord served as both citizen {{board member and}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>agent.</b> During his time on the board, several questionable decisions were made. The most significant was the board's approval of a contract with Eugene S. Ives' State of Arizona Improvement Company for construction of a [...] irrigation canal near Yuma. Terms of the contract called for convict labor to be provided from Yuma Territorial Prison {{at the rate of}} US$0.70/man/day, with the territory covering all transportation, guard, and maintenance costs. Payment in turn was {{to be made in the}} form of water from the canal. Many in the territory were angered by the terms of the contract, and Governor Benjamin Joseph Franklin refused to honor it when he came into office. Another action was McCord's approval of $630 to purchase a [...] tract of land for the insane asylum despite the land only being worth $380 at the time.
