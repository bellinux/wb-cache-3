The gameplay is shown on the bottom screen, where the player controls Hammy; the top screen has a map which shows the entire level from a top-down view, and shows a picture of a human from the level who is asleep and counting sheep. The human serves as a timer, as once they wake up, the player loses. The game is controlled using exclusively the touch screen.|$|E

I have been told by experts that right now the vertebrate <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> <b>man</b> is woefully underequipped for the job we have created for him. For insect and fungus control, the pest control operator is a generation ahead. He has dozens of dusts and sprays on his shelves, specific ones for specific crops and pests, and new materials developed each year and tested by chemical companies and land-grant university researchers in the 50 states. When it comes to vertebrate pests, he reaches up on the shelf and finds just about the same equipment that was there 75 years ago. Strychnine was being used in the l 8802 ̆ 7 s to kill wolves on the western plains. How we have the anticoagulants for rat control. And there 2 ̆ 7 s compound 1080, though the restrictions almost make it unusable. There 2 ̆ 7 s not much else that 2 ̆ 7 s new.

40|$|Aphids are a {{major concern}} in {{agricultural}} crops worldwide, and control by natural enemies is {{an essential component of}} the ecological intensification of agriculture. Although the complexity of agricultural landscapes is known to influence natural enemies of pests, few studies have measured the degree of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> by different enemy guilds across gradients in landscape complexity. Here, we use multiple natural-enemy exclosures replicated in 18 fields across a gradient in landscape complexity to investigate (1) the strength of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> across landscapes, measured as the difference between pest pressure in the presence {{and in the absence of}} natural enemies; (2) the differential contributions of natural enemy guilds to <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> and the nature of their interactions across landscapes. We show that natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> of aphids increased up to six-fold from simple to complex landscapes. In the absence of <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> aphid population growth was higher in complex than simple landscapes, but was reduced by natural enemies to similar growth rates across all landscapes. The effects of enemy guilds were landscape-dependent. Particularly in complex landscapes, total <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was supplied by the combined contribution of flying insects and ground-dwellers. Birds had little overall impact on aphid control. Despite evidence for intraguild predation of flying insects by ground-dwellers and birds, the overall effect of enemy guilds on aphid control was complementary. Understanding <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services at large spatial scales is critical to increase the success of ecological intensification schemes. Our results suggest that, where aphids are the main pest of concern, interactions between natural enemies are largely complementary and lead to a strongly positive effect of landscape complexity on <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Increasing the availability of seminatural habitats in agricultural landscapes may thus benefit not only natural enemies, but also the effectiveness of aphid natural <b>pest</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{landscape}} simplification reduces abundance and diversity of natural enemies in agroecosystems, but its effect on natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> remains poorly quantified. Further, natural enemy impacts on pest populations have usually been estimated for {{a limited number of}} taxa and have not considered interactions among predator species. In a quantitative synthesis with data collected from several cropping systems in Europe and North America, we analyzed how the level and within-field spatial stability of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services was related to the simplification of the surrounding landscape. All studies used aphids as a model species and exclusion cages to measure aphid <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Landscape simplification was quantified by the proportion of cultivated land within a 1 km radius around each plot. We found a consistent negative effect of landscape simplification on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> despite interactions among enemies. Average level of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was 46 % lower in homogeneous landscapes dominated by cultivated land, as compared with more complex landscapes. Landscape simplification did not affect the amount of positive or negative interactions among ground dwelling and vegetation-dwelling predators, or the within-field stability of <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Our synthesis demonstrates that agricultural intensification through landscape simplification has negative effects on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> with important implications for management to maintain and enhance ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Specifically, preserving and restoring semi-natural habitats emerges as a fundamental first step to maintain and enhance <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services provided by predatory arthropods to agriculture.
