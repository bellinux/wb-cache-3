40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the role of the insurance company as a financial intermediary which offers securities to uninformed retail investors. The search costs of retail investors cause the demand for the securities offered by intermediaries to be inelastic, making possible an intermediary spread, the difference between the returns on primary securities and the rates offered on the secondary securities sold by intermediaries. It is argued that the intermediary spread is economically significant, and a simple model of its determination is offered: the spread is shown to be an increasing function of interest rates. The bonus <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies is analyzed and is shown to be inefficient under simple assumptions about asset returns.

40|$|The cadaver organ {{shortage}} {{has pushed}} the transplant community {{to extend the}} boundaries beyond the traditional criteria used for living donor transplantation. This new liberal policy involves: (1) the type of donor, such as emotionally related individuals, the direct or indirect interchange of donors, anonymous as well as rewarded donation; (2) challenging immunological criteria, using incompatible ABO blood types and or transplantation across a positive cross-match; (3) relaxing clinical criteria related to elderly, hypertensive, or obese donors, or patients with nephrolithiasis, fibromuscular renal artery disease, hematuria, or renal cell carcinomas. However, these practices may be dangerous. They must be clearly validated to promote a liberal policy of donor acceptance since it may carry a risk for both the donor and the recipient {{as well as for}} society. It is crucial to ensure the physical integrity of the donor as well as to provide guarantees, for instance a 1 -year <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance,</b> an indefinite long-term medical follow-up and the assurance of going {{to the top of the}} waiting list if the donor becomes uremic in the future.

40|$|The {{history of}} the {{technical}} warranty in insurance law is instructive in showing how a rule, never very good or necessary, may, like more human creatures, so degenerate through later associations and changed conditions as to become positively bad, and so injurious to society that it must needs be brought to an end by legal process. In the United States, {{the reign of the}} technical warranty is almost over. For over a century it has been condemned by courts and text writers as an instrument of oppression and unfair dealing, and this sentence of condemnation is now being rapidly executed in the several states by the enactment of statutes wholly abolishing it as a rule of law. Even in those states, now relatively few, in which it has not been specifically abolished by statute, the warranty has been deserted even by its only friends, the underwriters. It is seldom that one now finds a trace of the warranty in the <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> reputable <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies; and in the standard fire policy, now almost universally in use, warranties have been confined to a small and relatively un-objectionable field...|$|R

2500|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{construction}} includes the courts and statute implying terms into agreements. Courts imply terms, as a general rule, when the express terms of a contract leave a gap to be filled. Given their basic attachment to contractual freedom, the courts are reluctant to override express terms for contracting parties. Legislation can also be a source of implied terms, and may be overridden by agreement of the parties, or have a compulsory character. For contracts in general, individualised terms are implied (terms [...] "implied in fact") to reflect the [...] "reasonable expectations of the parties", and like the process of interpretation, implication of a term of a commercial contract must follow from its commercial setting.

In AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, Lord Hoffmann in the Privy Council added that the process of implication is to be seen as part of the overall process of interpretation: designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in their context.
