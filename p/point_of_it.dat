These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape (1975). The significance of a future [...] "galactic alignment" [...] was noted in 1991 by astrologer Raymond Mardyks, who asserted that the winter solstice would align with the galactic plane in 1998/1999. He wrote that this event [...] "only occurs once each 26,000-year cycle and would be most definitely of utmost significance to the top flight ancient astrologers." [...] Astrologer Bruce Scofield noted, [...] "The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is something that has been neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions.

Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start."

Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success.

In July 1626, Henrietta Maria stopped to pray for Catholics who had died at the Tyburn tree, causing huge controversy– Catholics were still being executed in England during the 1620s, and Henrietta Maria felt passionately about her faith. In due course, Henrietta Maria would unsuccessfully try to convert her Calvinist nephew Prince Rupert during his stay in England.|$|E
