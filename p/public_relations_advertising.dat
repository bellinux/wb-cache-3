This study involves three main groups, namely prominent practitioners in <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and <b>advertising</b> as well as independent party who does not belong to either of these categories of practitioners. Guided by the Source Credibility Theory, this exploratory study emphasises on key measure of credibility in finding the overall effectiveness of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> over <b>advertising.</b> Findings of this study provide ground for constructive argument on the co-relations, effectiveness, estrangement and togetherness of the much debated topic of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> versus <b>advertising.</b> The main basis of the comparison is based on credibility, and the data focused on three central themes: contribution to brand knowledge and brand image, adequacy of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and <b>advertising,</b> and concerns of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and <b>advertising</b> practitioners. In short, both <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and <b>advertising</b> can employ contextual strategy by working together to reach consumers in the most creative and tactical manner...|$|R
