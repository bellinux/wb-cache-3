40|$|ABSTRACT: With its nearly 40 {{years of}} existence, speckle {{interferometry}} (SI) {{has become a}} complete technique, widely used in many branches of experimental mechanics. It is thus a challenging task to try to summarise {{in a couple of}} pages its principal characteristics from both theoretical and practical points of view. Admittedly, even though this goal is not met here, it appeared worth attempting to provide the <b>photomechanics</b> community with a discussion of {{the ins and outs of}} the technique. The necessity of a vocabulary free of ambiguity was a prerequisite, and hence the first section is a plea for a clearer definition of the discipline. Moreover, this section offers the oppor-tunity to re-examine the basic aspects of SI. Then, the main features of the method are briefly considered following a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis. Endowed with a lot of specific advantages, compared with other whole-field methods, SI can play an increasing role in <b>photomechanics...</b>|$|E

40|$|Beetles of {{the genus}} Melanophila and certain flat bugs {{of the genus}} Aradus {{approach}} forest fires. For the detection of fires and of hot surfaces, the pyrophilous species of both genera have developed infrared (IR) receptors, which have developed from common hair mechanoreceptors. Thus, this type of insect IR receptor has been termed <b>photomechanic.</b> Compared to a hair mechanoreceptor, a <b>photomechanic</b> IR sensillum shows the following special features. (i) The formation of a complex cuticular sphere instead of the bristle; the sphere consists of an outer exo-cuticular shell {{as well as of}} a cavernous microfluidic core. (ii) The enclosure of the dendritic tip of the mechanosensitive neuron inside the core in a liquid-filled chamber. Hence, we propose that a <b>photomechanic</b> IR sensillum most probably acts as a microfluidic converter of IR radiation into an increase in internal pressure inside the sphere, which is measured by a mechanosensitive neuron. A simple model for this biological IR sensor is the Golay sensor, which is filled with a liquid instead of gas. Here, the absorbed IR radiation results in a pressure increase of the liquid and the deflection of a thin membrane. For the evaluation of this model, analytical formulas are presented, which permit the calculation of the pressure increase in the cavity, the deformation of the membrane and the time constant of an artificial leak to compensate ambient temperature changes. Some organic liquids with high thermal expansion coefficients may improve the deflection of the membrane compared to water...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{components}} in flight vehicles is often inherited flaws, such as microcracks, voids, holes, and delamination. These defects will degrade structures {{the same as}} that due to damages in service, such as impact, corrosion, and erosion. It is very important to know how a structural component can be useful and survive after these flaws and damages. To understand the behavior and limitation of these structural components researchers usually do experimental tests or theoretical analyses on structures with simulated flaws. However, neither approach has been completely successful. As Durelli states that 'Seldom does one method give a complete solution, with the most efficiency'. Examples of this principle is seen in <b>photomechanics</b> which additional strain-gage testing can only average stresses at locations of high concentration. On the other hand, theoretical analyses including numerical analyses are implemented with simplified assumptions which may not reflect actual boundary conditions. Hybrid-Numerical methods which combine <b>photomechanics</b> and numerical analysis have been used to correct this inefficiency since 1950 's. But its application is limited until 1970 's when modern computer codes became available. In recent years, researchers have enhanced the data obtained from photoelasticity, laser speckle, holography and moire' interferometry for input of finite element analysis on metals. Nevertheless, there is only few of literature being done on composite laminates. Therefore, this research is dedicated to this highly anisotropic material...|$|E

Mechanical relaxation processes have generally been incorporated in dynamic analysis, but there has been no widespread application of optical relaxation or creep functions over the complete time spectrum in <b>photomechanics</b> of birefringent polymers. Using material characterizations previously developed, this study compares a theoretical viscoelastic solution and its predicted fringe pattern for stresswave propagation in a thin rod of polyurethan material (Solithane 113) with the photoviscoelastic data from a similar experimental arrangement. The agreement demonstrates both the validity and general necessity of such an approach for the time-domain characteristic of wave-propagation phenomena in low-modulus polymers...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} behavior of jointed-rock masses is {{of critical importance}} to designing and predicting {{the performance of a}} potential nuclear waste repositiry. To this end we have studied the frictional sliding between simulated rock joints using phase shifting moire interferometry. Preliminary calibration models were made from stacks of Lexan plates that were sand-blasted to provide a uniform frictional interface. Load was applied monotonically and phase shifted moire fringe patterns were recorded at three different load states. Plots of slip along the interfaces for the model are presented to demonstrate the ability of the <b>photomechanics</b> technique to provide precise measurements of in-plane displacement, and ultimately the slip between the plates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLiquid Crystal Elastomers {{constitute}} {{a class of}} intelligent materials and actuators. External stimulation induces an internal phase-change that results in a mechanical motion of the Liquid Crystal Elastomer. External stimuli can be humidity, thermal energy but also radiation with an appropriate wavelength. In this paper we use the <b>photomechanic</b> response of Liquid Crystal Elastomers as a driving force for a controlled actuator, operating in feedback constellation with a tuned cascade-compensator. To accomplish this, we go the methodical route of dynamic system investigation consisting of {{an analysis of the}} phenomenological system-properties, the identification of the dynamic behaviour and the overall synthesis of the feedback-control loop. Since we also take practical considerations into account, we present a coordinated hard- and software concept to realize the application of the Liquid Crystal Elastomer as a controlled actuator. An application guide complements the paper and discusses the limits of this class of actuators...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{manifold}} {{experiments were}} conducted to investigate the thermomechanical behavior of short E-glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 6. 6 composites subjected to low cycle fatigue loadings. Different hygrometric states, fiber configurations and loading rates were considered. Mechanical, thermal and energy responses of composite specimens were recorded using <b>photomechanic</b> techniques. The influence of water content, fiber orientation and loading rate on these thermomechanical responses was systematically analysed. The mechanical findings indicated that the ratcheting phenomenon was more pronounced for humid composites reinforced with fibers oriented transversely and subjected to a low loading rate. Moreover, the order of magnitude in self-heating was greater for transversal fiber composites conditioned at high relative humidity and subjected to a 10 Hz loading rate. From a thermodynamic standpoint, we also noticed that high proportions of the mean stored energy rate were obtained at a high loading rate, with values exceeded 64 %. These values were noticeably altered by the water content and fiber angles, i. e. lower as the relative humidity increased and higher as the fiber angles increased...|$|R
40|$|Jewel beetles of {{the genus}} Melanophila possess a pair of metathoracic {{infrared}} (IR) organs. These organs are used for forest fire detection because Melanophila larvae can only develop in fire killed trees. Several reports in the literature and a modeling of a historic oil tank fire suggest that beetles {{may be able to}} detect large fires by means of their IR organs from distances of more than 100 km. In contrast, the highest sensitivity of the IR organs, so far determined by behavioral and physiological experiments, allows a detection of large fires from distances up to 12 km only. Sensitivity thresholds, however, have always been determined in non-flying beetles. Therefore, the complete micromechanical environment of the IR organs in flying beetles has not been taken into consideration. Because the so-called <b>photomechanic</b> sensilla housed in the IR organs respond bimodally to mechanical as well as to IR stimuli, it is proposed that flying beetles make use of muscular energy coupled out of the flight motor to considerably increase the sensitivity of their IR sensilla during intermittent search flight sequences. In a search flight the beetle performs signal scanning with wing beat frequency while the inputs of the IR organs on both body sides are compared. By this procedure the detection of weak IR signals could be possible even if the signals are hidden in the thermal noise. If this proposed mechanism really exists in Melanophila beetles, their IR organs could even compete with cooled IR quantum detectors. The theoretical concept of an active amplification mechanism in a photon receptor innervated by highly sensitive mechanoreceptors is presented in this article...|$|R
40|$|The digital speckle {{correlation}} method (DSCM) is {{a rapidly}} developing new <b>photomechanics</b> technique {{used to measure}} the surface deformation. With its advantages of non-contact, real time, whole field and direct measurement, it can be used from macro-scale area to nano-scale area. This paper describes the use of this method in the experiment of the fracture of copper thin film. The displacement field and strain field in a crack tip region of a thin film are measured. Based on the displacement field and strain field of the crack tip region, the figure of plastic zone is determined. The experimental results indicate that DSCM is a useful method for studying the fracture behavior of thin film...|$|E
40|$|Light-induced shape transformations {{represent}} a fundamental step towards {{the emergence of}} adaptive materials exhibiting photomechanical behaviours. Although a range of covalent azobenzene-based photoactive materials has been demonstrated, the use of dynamic photoisomerization in mesostructured soft solids involving non-covalent co-assembly has received little attention. Here we prepare discrete micrometre-sized hydrated particles of a hexagonally ordered polyelectrolyte-surfactant mesophase based on the electrostatically induced co-assembly of poly(sodium acrylate) (PAA) and trans-azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide (trans-azoTAB), and demonstrate unusual non-equilibrium substrate-mediated shape transformations to complex multipodal microarchitectures under continuous blue light. The microparticles spontaneously sequester molecular dyes, functional enzymes and oligonucleotides, and undergo self-division when transformed to the cis state under UV irradiation. Our results illustrate that weak bonding interactions in polyelectrolyte-azobenzene surfactant mesophases can be exploited for photo-induced long-range molecular motion, and highlight how dynamic shape transformations and autonomous division can be activated by spatially confining azobenzene <b>photomechanics</b> in condensed microparticulate materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLight-activated {{polymers}} can undergo complex deformation {{in response}} to the combination of mechanical and optical stimuli. These materials are attractive for remote actuation and sensing applications. However, the behavior of such materials subjected to photomechanical patterning is not well understood. In this paper we consider a polymer that operates by photoactivated stress relaxation; at the molecular level, photoinitiation of residual initiator molecules generate free radicals that break and then reform in-chain functionalities of stretched chains in an elastomeric network, which results in macroscopic stress relaxation. We carry out experiments and finite element calculations that demonstrate the sequence of deformation events culminating in the formation of a buckled spot as a result of biaxially stretching the elastomeric film then irradiating a circular region followed by releasing the mechanical constraint. In order to better understand the <b>photomechanics,</b> we analyze a simpler model problem wherein a linear elastic, stress relaxing disk is subjected to (i) radial extension, (ii) irradiation of a concentric circular region, and (iii) release of the applied displacements in (i), which results in deformation and stress redistribution. In the final step, the deformation may transition from planar to buckling out of the plane depending on system parameters. Companion finite element calculations are performed against which our analytical results are in good agreement. Although not directly comparable, the analytic model qualitatively agrees with the experiments. The results of this work provide a useful foundation from which to explore more interesting behavior of periodically photo-mechanically patterned films and other more challenging actuation problems...|$|E
