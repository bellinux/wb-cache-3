50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>bending</b> {{begins when}} an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a {{cross-section}} {{to exceed the}} material's yield strength. Loaded only by a moment, the peak bending stresses occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section. The cross-section will not yield linearly through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the neutral axis {{is the same as}} the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section). After a cross-section reaches a sufficiently high condition of <b>plastic</b> <b>bending,</b> it acts as a Plastic hinge.|$|E

Kinematic and isotropic hardening rule was employed for the plastic constitutive equations. The kinematic hardening rule was more suitable {{for the expression of}} the stress reversal in uniaxial stress- strain relation than the isotropic hardening. For the result of the finite element {{analysis of}} V-bending, the kinematic hardening rule was able to predict the experimental behavior of springback more properly than the isotropic hardening. Moreover, the effects of hydrostatic pressure-dependence were revealed by examining the calculated distribution of <b>bending</b> <b>plastic</b> strain, <b>bending</b> stress and the width of the bent specimen...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of internal misfit stresses between matrix and reinforcement {{has been studied}} in an Al/SiC particulate-reinforced metal-matrix composite. Bars of the composite were deformed in bending to introduce a varying residual stress field, and subsequently heat treated at different temperatures and for different times to study {{the evolution of the}} macroscopic stress field and the interphase stresses. The results show that the shape misfit stresses between the matrix and reinforcement, which arise from the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the two phases, are reduced by the plastic deformation, but is re-generated by heat treatment. Higher temperatures and longer times increase {{the degree to which the}} shape misfit stresses return to their initial values.

5000|$|The {{limiting}} <b>plastic</b> <b>bending</b> strength [...] (see Plastic moment) can {{generally be}} thought of as an upper limit to a beam’s load-carrying capability as it only represents the strength at a particular cross-section and not the load-carrying capability of the overall beam. A beam may fail due to global or local instability before [...] is reached at any point on its length. Therefore, beams should also be checked for local buckling, local crippling, and global lateral-torsional buckling modes of failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>bending</b> is a {{nonlinear}} behaviour {{particular to}} members made of ductile materials that frequently achievemuch greater ultimate bending strength than indicated by a linear elastic bending analysis. In both the plastic andelastic bending analyses of a straight beam, {{it is assumed}} that the strain distribution is linear about the neutralaxis (plane sections remain plane). In an elastic analysis this assumption leads to a linear stress distribution butin a plastic analysis the resulting stress distribution is nonlinear and is dependent on the beam’s material.|$|E
50|$|In the Euler-Bernoulli {{theory of}} slender beams, a major {{assumption}} is that 'plane sections remain plane'. In other words, any deformation due to shear across the section is not accounted for (no shear deformation). Also, this linear distribution is only applicable if the maximum stress {{is less than the}} yield stress of the material. For stresses that exceed yield, refer to article <b>plastic</b> <b>bending.</b> At yield, the maximum stress experienced in the section (at the furthest points from the neutral axis of the beam) is defined as the flexural strength.|$|E

5000|$|Elementary Elastic Bending theory {{requires}} that the bending stress varies linearly with distance from the neutral axis, but <b>plastic</b> <b>bending</b> shows a more accurate and complex stress distribution. The yielded areas of the cross-section will vary somewhere between the yield and ultimate strength of the material. In the elastic region of the cross-section, the stress distribution varies linearly from the neutral axis {{to the beginning of}} the yielded area. Predicted failure occurs when the stress distribution approximates the material's stress-strain curve. The largest value being that of the ultimate strength. Not every area of the cross-section will have exceeded the yield strength.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{deflections}} necessary {{to develop the}} stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently {{to the point of}} incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with <b>plastic</b> <b>bending</b> can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations.|$|E

The evaluation of integrals at nodal points using curvature smoothing stabilization both keeps the size of the optimization problem small and also results in stable and accurate solutions. Difficulties imposing essential boundary conditions are overcome by enforcing displacements at the nodes directly. The formulation can be expressed as the problem of minimizing a sum of Euclidean norms subject to a set of equality constraints. This non-smooth minimization problem can be transformed into a form suitable for solution using second-order cone programming.
