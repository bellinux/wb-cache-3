In phase one, the majority of <b>professional</b> secondary <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> had a mixed or positive reaction to the standards.

School counselors have been professionals in schools for over one hundred years. During the past century, as the nation has grown and changed, the roles and responsibilities of school counselors have as well. As the initial roles of school counselors have progressed to include more than vocational counseling, their roles and responsibilities have transformed as well {{to meet the needs of}} students. Changes, combined with several other factors, caused most states to alter the traditional certification requirement for <b>professional</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors.</b> Illinois was the 42 nd state to do so in July 2004. Today, three different educational backgrounds are acceptable for certification upon completion of an approved master's degree: teacher-trained, non-teacher trained with no experience, and non-teacher trained with a clinical master's degree in a related field with experience. The changes in certification are relatively new; therefore teacher versus non-teacher-trained has a small literature base. This inquiry explored similarities and differences of three educational backgrounds. A multiple-case study approach was utilized with a modified 360 -degree feedback process and a modified Consensual Qualitative Research method that explored word family patterns in the cross-case analysis.
