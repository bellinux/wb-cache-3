5|$|In April 2010, {{after months}} of <b>political</b> <b>pressure,</b> the {{government}} passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping {{the office of the}} power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of <b>political</b> <b>pressure.</b> After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The only {{memorial}} {{created by}} the Commission that {{was not in the}} form of a monument or cemetery was the Opththalmic Institute at Giza, Egypt—complete with library, and bacteriology and pathology departments—as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps. Its erection was agreed with local <b>political</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Even as Metro officially {{designated}} Rosecroft Raceway as the Green Line's southern terminus, {{more than}} half of Prince George's County's representatives in the Maryland state legislature asked Governor Harry Hughes to review the proposed route after allegations of improper <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> regarding the 1978 route decision surfaced.

5|$|Faced with {{decreasing}} passenger {{numbers and}} intense <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> to consolidate, the railroads operating into Grand Central Station re-routed their trains into other Chicago terminals, {{beginning with the}} Soo Line into Central Station in 1963. The remaining six Baltimore and Ohio and ex-Pere Marquette trains last used Grand Central Station on November 8, 1969 and were routed into their new terminus at the Chicago and North Western Terminal the following day.|$|E

The original Metrorail line was initially planned to be built to the airport, but due to <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> and lobbying was instead directed to its current alignment around the airport and to Hialeah.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{external}} <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> for faster renminbi (RMB) appreciation {{have any}} statistically {{significant effect on}} both the daily returns and the conditional volatility of the RMB central parity rate. We construct external pressure indicators pertaining to the RMB exchange rate, with a special emphasis on US pressures, to test the hypothesis. After controlling for domestic macroeconomic news, we find that external <b>political</b> <b>pressures,</b> including US-specific ones {{do not have a}} significant influence on RMB’s daily returns. However, evidence suggests that external pressures, and especially those from the US, have statistically significant impacts on the conditional volatility of the RMB. Furthermore, we conduct the same exercise on the RMB non-deliverable forward rate (NDF). We find that the NDF market is highly responsive to macroeconomic news and <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> and there is some weak evidence that non-US <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> affect the daily returns of the NDF...|$|R

50|$|In past times, Dari {{speakers}} {{have experienced}} <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> to yield up their language as well. The period since the seventh-century Muslim conquest of Persia {{has been a}} time of great persecution for the Zoroastrians of Iran. <b>Political</b> <b>pressures</b> have directly resulted in language loss when Zoroastrians have deliberately abandoned their language as a means of hiding their identity so as to escape persecution. <b>Political</b> <b>pressures</b> have also led to language loss indirectly; the oppression the Zoroastrians have been experienced under Iran’s various rulers over the past thousand or so years has driven a steady stream of Zoroastrians to more tolerant areas, mostly the capital, Tehran, or abroad. Again, a complete language environment does not exist in these places, inhibiting the transmission of Dari to new generations.|$|R

5|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, and were organized into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter; the Department of Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck; and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. By January 1862, the disunity was apparent because they could not agree on a strategy for operations in the Western Theater. Buell, under <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> to invade and hold pro-Union eastern Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville. In Halleck's department, Grant moved up the Tennessee River to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. Halleck and the other generals in the West were coming under <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from President Abraham Lincoln to participate in a general offensive by Washington's birthday (February 22). Despite his tradition of caution, Halleck eventually reacted positively to Grant's proposal to move against Fort Henry. Halleck hoped that this would improve his standing in relation to his rival, Buell. Halleck and Grant were also concerned about rumors that Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard would soon arrive with 15 Confederate regiments. On January 30, 1862, Halleck authorized Grant to take Fort Henry.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a political economy model of exchange rate policy. The theory {{is based on}} a common agency approach with rational expectations. Financial and exporter lobbies exert <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> to influence the government’s choice of exchange rate policy, before shocks to the economy are realized. The model shows that <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> affect exchange rate policy and create an over-commitment to exchange rate stability. This helps to rationalize the empirical evidence on fear of large currency swings that characterizes exchange rate policy of many emerging market economies. Moreover, the model suggests that the effects of <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> on the exchange rate are lower if the quality of institutions is higher. Empirical evidence for a large sample of emerging market economies is consistent with these findings. exporters and financial lobbies, exchange rate stability...|$|R

5|$|After unrelenting <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia {{signed the}} Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, a {{military}} coup d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1954, Australia {{recognised}} that the English Electric Canberra was becoming outdated and evaluated aircraft {{such as the}} Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. <b>Political</b> <b>pressure</b> for a Canberra replacement only rose to a head in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the RAAF if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for a promise to liquidate his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result of economic and <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as the legitimate ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and his young son, Abu Bakar.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol and the {{effectiveness}} of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> through the United Nations Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the second main party to the civil war after the government—and on Sierra Leone's neighbour Liberia, which had provided support to the RUF. The new approach, combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, bogies and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it.

The American Federation of Labor responded to <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions.
