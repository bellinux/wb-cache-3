However for these alternative fuels to be accepted they must show they do not affect materials, particularly elastomers, in aircraft significantly different than standard 100 low lead (100 LL). This research is focused on comparing {{the effects of a}} proprietary bio-derived alternative fuel on elastomers against 100 LL. Materials to be tested are Buna-N vinyl, neoprene, nitrile, plain cork, neoprene and cork (backed cork), Viton, high-purity silicone, polyester, <b>polysulfide</b> and <b>rubber</b> hose. The testing to be performed includes volume swell, tensile strength, elongation, durometer hardness and density. The samples were soaked in fuel for a period of 28 days at room temperature, 71 °C and 93 °C. All testing will be done in accordance with respective ASTM standards. Due to proprietary concerns, actual measurement cannot be reported, but differences between the two fuels can, i. e. the percentage difference between materials soaked in 100 LL and the bio-derived alternative. Statistical methods were applied to the volume change, tensile strength and elongation tests to determine significant differences. The largest difference in volume swell was for backed cork, the largest difference in tensile and elongation was in neoprene, the largest difference in density was in nitrile, and plain cork exhibited the largest difference in durometer hardness. Viton and polyester exhibited no significant differences.

40|$|Following {{in vitro}} {{inoculation}} with C albicans or P aeruginosa, three impression materials [...] <b>polysulfide</b> <b>rubber,</b> irreversible hydrocolloid, and poly(vinyl siloxane) [...] were disinfected with either 0. 1 % or 0. 02 % chlorhexidine gluconate and a {{quantitative assessment of}} the microorganisms was made. Very few microorganisms were retained on the poly(vinyl siloxane) material immediately after microbial inoculation. The numbers of microorganisms on polysulfide impression materials diminished rapidly with time even without disinfection, and a 30 -minute disinfection procedure resulted in total microbe elimination. With irreversible hydrocolloid, microorganisms persisted and disinfection procedures were considerably less effective. When the disinfection efficacy of three commercially available agents was compared using irreversible hydrocolloid impression material, chlorhexidine gluconate (0. 2 %) {{was found to be}} less effective than either glutaraldehyde (2 %) or sodium hypochlorite (0. 0125 %); the latter two agents were comparable in their antimicrobial effect. Thus, a simple disinfection regime of 30 minutes with commonly available disinfectants may be effective in eliminating cross-contamination from impression materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the current concepts, techniques and materials used in making the final impression for the edentulous patients among dentists in Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was designed to involve information pertaining to final impression. The questionnaire was distributed to 205 dentists working in governmental or private clinics in the Riyadh region. Results: The response rate was % 51. The results showed that the most prevalent type of tray used for making final impressions was custom trays (% 92), the most frequently used impression material was <b>polysulfide</b> (<b>rubber</b> base) % 47. 9, and the most frequently used material for custom tray was auto polymerizing resin (% 57. 8).

5000|$|The sulfur {{percentage}} and {{the applied}} temperatures and duration during vulcanizing {{are the main}} variables that determine the technical properties of the hard <b>rubber</b> <b>polysulfide</b> elastomer. The occurring reaction is basically addition of sulfur at the double bonds, forming intramolecular ring structures, so {{a large portion of}} the sulfur is highly cross-linked in the form of intramolecular addition. As a result of having a maximum sulfur content up to 40%, it may be used to resist swelling and minimize dielectric loss. The strongest mechanical properties and greatest heat resistance is obtained with sulfur contents around 35% while the highest impact strength can be obtained with a lower sulfur content of 30%. The rigidity of hard rubber at room temperature is attributed to the van der Waals forces between the intramolecular sulfur atoms. Raising the temperature gradually increases the molecular vibrations that overcome the van der Waals forces making it elastic. Hard rubber has a content mixture dependent density around 1.1 to 1.2. When reheated hard rubber exhibits shape-memory effect and can be fairly easy reshaped within certain limits. Depending on the sulfur percentage hard rubber has a thermoplastic transition or softening temperature of [...]|$|R

These {{mechanical systems}} include penetrators that must survive soil and rock penetration, nuclear transportation casks that must survive transportation environments, and laydown weapons that must survive delivery impact. These mechanical systems contain electronics that may operate {{during and after}} the high shock environment and that must be protected from the high shock environments. A study has been started to improve the packaging techniques for the advanced electronics utilized in these mechanical systems because current packaging techniques are inadequate for these sensitive electronics. In many cases, it has been found that the packaging techniques currently used not only do not mitigate the shock environment but actually amplify the shock environment. An ambitious goal for this packaging study is to avoid amplification and possibly attenuate the shock environment before it reached the electronics contained in the various mechanical systems.

Three reference points A, B, and C were placed on the master cast and reproduced on all experimental casts. Ten combined variables of tray space (2), impression material (3), and method of tray attachment (2) were used. Eight casts were made utilizing each of the combined variables resulting in 80 experimental casts. The dimensions AB, AC and BC were accurately measured (+ 10 /jm) on the master model and all experimental casts. Each measurement was repeated twice and averaged resulting in 480 experimental measurements (80 casts x 3 dimensions x 2 readings). One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to discern differences between the dimensions of the master model and those of casts produced by each of the combined variables including the effect of the impression material. Tukey's standardized range test was used to discern accuracy differences among the combined variables. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences for the dimensions A-B, A-C, or B-C between the master model and those produced by the ten combined variables. Nonetheless, the mean B-C dimensions on casts produced by the ten combined variables tended to be smaller (though not significantly) than for the master model. Further, while {{there were no significant differences}} for the dimensions A-B and A-C among casts produced by the ten combined variables, significant differences were detected for the B-C dimension. Casts poured in regular set alginate impressions in single spaced perforated trays showed significantly larger B-C dimension than those derived from fast-set alginate impressions in double spaced perforated trays (P< 0. 05). Provided that impressions are well attached to their trays and poured immediately (within 5 minutes), tray conditions tested in this study had no effect on accuracy of casts poured from either polysulfide or either of the irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials.

40|$|Introduction. Ectodermal Dysplasias are a {{heterogeneous}} group of inherited disorders characterized by dysplasia of tissues of ectodermal origin (hair, nails, teeth, skins and glands). Clinically, {{it may be}} divided into two broad categories: the X-linked hypoidrotic form and the hidrotic form. Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (H. E. D) is characterized by the triad oligo-anodontia, hypotricosis, hypo-anhydrosis (Christ-Siemens-Tourane syndrome). The incidence of HED is about 1 / 100, 000. Mutation in the actodysplasin-A (EDA) and ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) genes are responsible for X-linked and autosomal HED. The clinical features include sparse, fine hair, missing or conical-shaped teeth, decreased sweat and mucous glands, hypoplastic skin, and heat intolerance with exercise or increased ambient temperature. Complete or partial anodontia and malformation of teeth are the most frequent dental findings. Incisors and canines are often conical-shaped while primarily second molars, if present, are mostly affected by taurodontism. Treatment is supportive and includes protection from heat exposure, early prosthetic rehabilitation, skin, hair ear, nose and nail care, and genetic counseling for family planning. The diagnosis of HED in the neonatal and early infancy period may be difficult since sparse hair and absent teeth are normal finding at this age. In childhood the diagnosis is more easily {{made on the basis of}} history and clinical examination. Dental abnormalities are the most common complaint. Prosthetic rehabilitation has been recommended as an essential part of the management of HED because is important from functional, esthetic, and psychological standpoint. A team approach that includes input from a pediatric dentist, an orthodontist, a prosthodontist, and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome. Conventional prosthodontic rehabilitation in young patient is often difficult because of the anatomical abnormalities of existing teeth and alveolar ridges. The conical shaped teeth and “knife-edge” alveolar ridges result in poor retention and instability of dentures. Moreover, denture must permit jaws expansion and a correct pattern of growth. Materials and Methods. Complete removable dentures were provided to allow for normal physiological development and a corrected masticatory function. Initial maxillary and mandibular impressions were made with smallest stock trays and irreversible hydrocolloid and then final impressions ware made with light-bodied <b>polysulfide</b> <b>rubber</b> base impression material. A base of autopolymerizing resin was constructed and a wax rim was added to the base. The patient’s vertical dimension of occlusion was established by assessing phonetic and esthetic criteria. Preliminary occlusal relations were recorded, and the mandibular cast was mounted on the articulator. Acrylic resin teeth specific for children dentures were selected and mounted. The dentures were tried in and, after proper adjustments, were inserted. The patients were monitored clinically every month to fit prostheses. Cephalometric radiographs were taken every 6 month with the prostheses in place in order to evaluate correct pattern of growth. Cephalometric measurements were realized and used to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on craniofacial growth. Cephalometric measurements of sound patients were compared with ED patients. After two month expander screws (three-way screw in the upper denture and two-way the lower one) were inserted in each denture in order to permit the expansion of the denture and the jaws growth. Where conical teeth were present, composite crown were realized and luted to improve the esthetic and phonesis. In order to improve retention the placement of endosseous implants was carried out. TC 3 D Accuitomo was performed and a resin model of mandibular bone of the patient was realized. At the age of 11 years two implants were inserted into anterior mandible in a child with anodontia. Despite a remarkable multi-dimensional atrophy of the mandibular alveolar process, the insertion of two tapered screw implants (SAMO Smiler, diameter 3. 8, length 10 mm). After a submerged healing period of two-three month, the implants were exposed. Implants were connected with an expansion guide that permits mandibular growth and prosthetic retention. The amount of mandibular growth was also evaluate dusing the expansion guide. Results. Early oral rehabilitation improve oral function, phonesis and esthetic, reducing social impairment. Treated patients showed normal cephalometric measurement. Early rehabilitation is able to prevent the prognatissm of the mandibula. The number of teeth was significantly related to several changes in craniofacial morphology. Discussion. In the present study the 5, 3...|$|E
