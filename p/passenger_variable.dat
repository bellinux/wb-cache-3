40|$|A <b>passenger</b> car <b>variable</b> mass {{crankshaft}} is here reported. This particular device {{consists of}} an auxiliary flywheel with a high moment of inertia. It spins freely at above 1500 rpm, thanks to centrifugal masses which disengaged it from the crankshaft. The flywheel is connected once again to the crankshaft, when the engine speed reduces to under 1400 rpm. In this way, {{the mass of the}} crankshaft is increase at low engine speed (e. g. idle condition) and the magnitude of rotational fluctuations are consequently lowered. On the contrary, the extra mass is unnecessary and undesirable above certain engine speed and is therefore reduced, so improving both the vehicle acceleration, engine braking performance and fuel economy. He variable mass crankshaft device has been mounted onto a passenger car, in order to determine fuel consumption and acceleration performance, both though theoretical investigations and by means of experimental tests on roller-type benc...|$|R
40|$|Cruise tourism generates {{different}} types of cruise consumption and related indirect, direct and induced expenditure effects, in homeports {{as well as in}} ports of call. Cruise passengers’ expenditures produce positive economic effects for destinations, from increasing the incomes and employment, to tax incomes, duties, etc. Therefore, it is no doubt that cruise stakeholders and local economies can benefit from increased cruise passenger consumption. To stimulate higher consumption and passengers’ satisfaction, it is necessary to design the supportive policy framework and build appropriate quality of products and services. Identifying influential variables of cruise passengers’ expenditures in this sense enables the design of appropriate policies and measures. In the current research, based on a survey of 357 cruise <b>passengers,</b> several <b>variables</b> included in a new theoretical model of the expenditures determinants, such as gender, nationality, frequency of cruising and frequency of visits, were found to be statistically significantly associated with cruise passengers’ expenditures.

Here, we add the flexibility of providing the option for passengers to transfer from one vehicle to another at specific locations. As part of the mathematical formulation, we include transfer nodes where vehicles may interact interchanging <b>passengers.</b> Additional <b>variables</b> {{to keep track of}} customers along their route are considered. The formulation has been proven to work correctly, and by means of a simple example instance, we conclude that there exist some configurations in which a scheme allowing transfers results in better quality optimal solutions. Finally, a solution method based on Benders decomposition is addressed. We compare the computational effort of this application with a straight branch and bound strategy; we also provide insights to develop more efficient set partitioning formulations and associated algorithms for solving real-size problems.

40|$|A {{framework}} is developed to calculate reliability from the passengers perspective in a multilevel public transit network. The major variables that impact reliability for transfers passengers are identified as: scheduled transfer time, headways of connecting lines, variation of vehicle operations, transfer walking time and proportion of transferring <b>passengers.</b> These <b>variables</b> are {{examined in the}} context of changing the scheduled transfer time in a hypothetical network and in the case that a holding strategy is added at the transfer point. It is shown that a trade-off exists between scheduled transfer time and reliability. Holding at a transfer point can be beneficial to passengers transferring to the held line, depending on the scheduled transfer time. The calculation method is applied to a cost-benefit analysis to a small example using data from the tram network in The Hague, Netherlands. Benefits to passengers are quantified from changes to the magnitude of a passenger’s travel time, including scheduled travel time and additional travel time, as well as the width of the travel time distribution using the reliability ratio as a value for reliability. Although it is difficult to set a schedule that benefits different groups of transferring passengers, it is possible to realize travel time and reliability benefits through scheduling.

40|$|We analyze {{whether it}} is better to {{forecast}} air travel demand using aggregate data at (say) a national level, or to aggregate the forecasts derived for individual airports using airport-specific data. We compare the US Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) practice of predicting the total number of <b>passengers</b> using macroeconomic <b>variables</b> with an equivalently specified AIM (aggregating individual markets) approach. The AIM approach outperforms the aggregate forecasting approach in terms of its out-of-sample air travel demand predictions for different forecast horizons. Variants of AIM, where we restrict the coefficient estimates of some explanatory variables to be the same across individual airports, generally dominate both the aggregate and AIM approaches. The superior out-of-sample performances of these so-called quasi-AIM approaches depend on the trade-off between heterogeneity and estimation uncertainty. We argue that the quasi-AIM approaches exploit the heterogeneity across individual airports efficiently, without suffering from as much estimation uncertainty as the AIM approach...|$|R
40|$|The Urban Rail Transit (URT) {{has been}} one of the major trip modes in cities worldwide. As the <b>passengers</b> arrive at <b>variable</b> rates in {{different}} time slots, e. g., rush and non-rush hours, the departure frequency at a site directly relates to perceived service quality of passengers; the high departure frequency, however, incurs more operation cost to URT. Therefore, a tradeoff between the interest of railway operator and the service quality of passengers needs to be addressed. In this paper, we develop a model on the operation method of train operation scheduling using a Stackelberg game model. The railway operator is modeled as the game leader and the passengers as the game follower, and an optimal departure frequency can be determine the tradeoff between passengers' service quality and operation cost. We present several numerical examples based on the operation data from Nanjing transit subway at China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly improve the traffic efficiency. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, conferenc...|$|R

30|$|At present, {{the urban}} rail transit (URT) system has {{achieved}} network operation in many major cities of China. But, {{little attention has}} been given to the vulnerability of the URT system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assign the passenger flow under the condition of section interruption in URT system. Two surveys (a passenger behavior survey and a stated preference survey) were conducted and a multinomial logit model was developed. The results show that although the first choice of passengers in emergency situation is to stay in URT system by a circuitous way, more than half of the respondents express interest in the temporary shuttle bus. For the temporary shuttle bus, the sensitivity analysis show that the relative speed is more important than crowding degree for <b>passengers.</b> The significant <b>variables</b> mostly fall in the personal attributes such as income, gender, age, etc. The impacts of trip feature factors are similar to the previous research in normal situations. These results provide basic support for passenger flow assignment at the shuttle bus level and reducing the risk of crowding at some special stations. Moreover, it is also good for reducing passenger delay and recovering the trip.|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the trend of the share of clean vehicles into the Swedish market from January 2009 to February 2015. This work will also assess whether there is any economic variable that affects the purchase of clean vehicles as well as regular <b>passenger</b> cars. The <b>variables</b> tested are as follows; price on car, petrol price, micro index of the CCI, unemployment, disposable income and interest rate. The result of a segmented regression analysis showed an increased trend {{in the proportion of}} clean vehicles where time explaining growth. The study cannot explain the underlying factors, because none of the surveyed financial variables could explain the increase in sales of clean vehicles. Therefore the consumer preferences are assumed to be the strongest explanatory variable in the choice of driving a green car. The study could not identify any specific variable that have had a greater impact on the clean vehicles sales due to total sales of passenger cars. For the government to realize the {{vision of a}} fossil-free vehicle fleet more studies about consumer preferences related to the choice of clean vehicles is required.

40|$|Customer {{loyalty is}} a source of {{competitive}} advantage and an important intangible asset to any organisations, but empirical evidence from China&# 039;s airline market regarding the determinants of passenger satisfaction and loyalty is lacking. This paper investigates the service quality of four major airlines in China&# 039;s domestic market and explores the links between their service quality and customer satisfaction, as well as the conditions under which airlines can retain existing passengers. In line with previous studies, service quality variables are significant factors influencing customer satisfaction levels. However, satisfactory service was not found to result in higher customer loyalty among business travellers. In comparison to Hainan Airlines, passengers who travelled with Air China, China Southern and China Eastern were more likely to switch to an alternate carrier, indicating lower levels of brand loyalty. In addition, the frequent flyer programs (FFPs) have been largely a failure for the four major airlines in terms of increasing customer loyalty, as revealed in this study. It is necessary to draw distinctions between business and leisure travellers when studying the determinants of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Ticket pricing had a positive and significant effect on passengers&# 039; overall satisfaction and in turn strengthened customer loyalty among leisure travellers, but achieved no impact on the satisfaction and loyalty of business <b>passengers.</b> Some demographic <b>variables</b> such as gender, income and education are statistically significant for one group of passengers but not for another in the probit models estimated.

40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} short-range transit planning {{technique was}} developed to help local planners evaluate the impacts of transit routing and scheduling options. A transit route evaluation procedure established route potential {{on the basis of}} demographic and transit service factors. The procedure was to provide a framework for selecting the best service policies to undertake when a reallocation of system resources was considered. The Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) fixed-route system, a radial transit system, was selected for evaluating the transit use potential at the route level;A stiffness concept applied in structural analysis was used to estimate route ridership under varying supply conditions. The stiffness is more than trip generation from an area. Its function is to simultaneously measure a trip generation and distribution effect by incorporating both production and attraction capabilities along a route. Multiple regression techniques were valuable for sorting through the many eligible explanatory variables regarding transit ridership. The observation unit in regression analysis was a route-segment. Passenger density, the stiffness for each route-segment, was used as a dependent <b>variable.</b> <b>Passenger</b> density was represented by on-off-passengers per unit length of route-segment. The number of on-off-passengers is the sum of the number of on-passengers and the number of off-passengers. Frequency of service was always found to be the most significant independent variable. Other independent variables that are significant in explaining variations included population density, employment density, and travel time factor;A linear programming model was used to optimize the transit route {{on the basis of the}} demand and system constraints. The objective was to maximize the ridership in the system. The constraints included budget restriction, fuel supply, minimum and maximum service levels, and performance standards.

30|$|This study {{employed}} weekday, weekend, road type, type of {{car that}} is taxi or private car variables to explain their effect on peak hour travels. In this section, we explain the similarities of variable choice with others studies and state how our study is different from other studies. Van Wee et al. [35] stated in their study the importance of temporal factors on travel behavior, emphasizing that there are opportunities available depending {{on the time of}} day chosen. This goes to explain the relevance of weekday, weekend and time of day factors in analyzing travel patterns. Yu et al. [36] used weekday peak hour, weekday non-peak hour and weekend non-peak hour to investigate different crash rate circumstances. Even though this was used to investigate crash rates, whereas our study uses it for vehicular movement, it still serves as valuable variables for peak hour traffic studies. Loudon et al. [37] argued in their research the need to specifically model peak hour travels instead of the traditional way of making assumptions with percentages based on twenty-four-hour estimates. They used 6  am to 9  am peak period and 3  pm to 6  pm off-peak period travel for their research. Our research descriptive statistics, however, confirmed the 6  am to 9  am morning peak period but had a 4  pm to 7  pm evening peak period instead. Chen et al. [38] also employed peak and off-peak hour variables to investigate the influence of congestion and passenger load on bus emissions compared with passenger cars but they only collected data for weekdays. Chiou, Fu [39],Seedam et al. [6] only used 7  am to 9  am morning peak period variable in their study but the former used it to study behaviors of drivers with respect to congestion charges while the latter used it to investigate motorcycles impact on fuel consumption and emissions. Holguin-Veras et al. [40] in their study to report the results of a project that evaluated the effects of a pricing initiative on the behavior of <b>passengers,</b> used <b>variables</b> of weekday and weekend peak and off-peak period travels, and also employed a morning peak period of 6  am to 9  am and evening peak period of 4  pm to 7  pm. Their study was however focused on passenger behavioral changes. Ben-Elia, Ettema [41], also used peak periods in their research but used it to investigate a reward system for not commuting during peak hours of 6.30  am to 9.30  am. Yazici et al. [42] analyzed temporal travel variances between urban roads and highways and concluded that there is a variability of travel time patterns between urban roads and highways. They also used different vehicles for their analysis but did not specifically conclude on the relationship between these vehicle types and peak or off-peak hour travels. These previous studies have used only one or two road types in their investigations whereas our paper employs the choice of four (4) road types (secondary, primary, tertiary and motorway). Tarko, Perez-Cartagena [43] utilized temporal and spatial variables for their investigation on peak hour factor but used site to site analysis instead of the type of road we are using for the analysis. They concluded on the significance of spatial factor on peak hour factor variability, thus further endorsing the importance of our choice for road type as a variable for peak hour investigations.|$|R
