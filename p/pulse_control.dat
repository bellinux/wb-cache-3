50|$|The {{original}} {{manual for}} the SID mentions that if several waveforms are enabled {{at the same}} time, {{the result will be}} a binary AND between them. What happens in reality is that the input to the waveform DAC pins receive several waveforms at once. For instance, the Triangle waveform is made with a separate XOR circuit and a shift-to-left circuit. The top bit drives whether the XOR circuit inverts the accumulator value seen by the DAC. Thus, enabling triangle and sawtooth simultaneously causes adjacent accumulator bits in the DAC input to mix. (The XOR circuit does not come to play because it is always disabled whenever the sawtooth waveform is selected.) The pulse waveform is built by joining all the DAC bits together via a long strip of polysilicon, connected to the <b>pulse</b> <b>control</b> logic that digitally compares current accumulator value to the pulse width value. Thus, selecting the pulse waveform together with any other waveform causes every bit on the DAC to partially mix, and the loudness of the waveform is affected by the state of the pulse.|$|E

40|$|Using three {{precisely}} timed laser pulses, we show experimentally that subvibrational period, nonresonant {{laser radiation}} can control a vibrational wave packet.

The aim is to estimate the derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM with the modified system in conditions of frequent starts, depending on the intensity of its speed up. To estimate the derivation of the stator temperature, the temperature of AM with the modified system, depending intensity of its speed up the complex simulation model of electromagnetic and thermal process are designed. This model describes the thermal transient process in structural elements of AM and allows considering peculiarities of electromagnetic energy transformation in thermal energy, heat transferring and heat interchanging processes.

40|$|Skilled pilots {{often use}} <b>pulse</b> <b>control</b> when {{controlling}} higher order (i. e. acceleration-command) vehicle dynamics. Pulsing {{does not produce}} a stick response that resembles what the human Crossover Model predicts. The Crossover Model (CM) assumes the pilot provides compensation necessary (lead or lag) such that the suite of display-human-vehicle approximates an integrator {{in the region of}} crossover frequency. However, it is shown that the CM does appear to drive the pilots pulsing behavior in a very predictable manner. Roughly speaking, the pilot generates pulses such that the area under the pulse (pulse amplitude multiplied by pulse width) is approximately equal to area under the hypothetical CM output. This can allow a pilot to employ constant amplitude pulsing so that only the pulse duration (width) is modulated a drastic simplification over the demands of continuous tracking. A pilot pulse model is developed, with which the parameters of the pilots internally-generated CM can be computed in real time for pilot monitoring and display compensation. It is also demonstrated that pursuit tracking may be activated when <b>pulse</b> <b>control</b> is employed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the control of}} electronic energy transfer in molecular dimers through the preparation of specific vibrational coherences prior to electronic excitation, and its observation by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry. Laser-driven coherent nuclear motion can affect the instantaneous resonance between site-excited electronic states and thereby influence short-time electronic excitation transfer (EET). We first illustrate this control mechanism with calculations on a dimer whose constituent monomers undergo harmonic vibrations. We then consider the use of nonlinear wave-packet interferometry (nl-WPI) experiments to monitor the nuclear dynamics accompanying EET in general dimer complexes following impulsive vibrational excitation by a sub-resonant <b>control</b> <b>pulse</b> (or <b>control</b> <b>pulse</b> sequence). In measurements of this kind, two pairs of polarized phase-related femtosecond <b>pulses</b> following the <b>control</b> <b>pulse</b> generate superpositions of coherent nuclear wave packets in optically accessible electronic states.

It is also shown that, due to the Raman effect, more than 100 % of maximum switching efficiency of a NOLM can be achieved. Furthermore, when the <b>control</b> <b>pulse</b> width is equal to three times the signal pulse width, a switching efficiency of more than 90 % could still be obtained even when the central wavelength of the <b>control</b> <b>pulse</b> is detuned by about 4 nm or when timing jitter is more than 1. 5 times the signal pulse width.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the quantum {{control of a}} two-level system (TLS) coupled to photons can modify and tune the TLS's photon absorption spectrum. Tuning and controlling the emission and the absorption are of great interest, e. g., {{for the development of}} efficient interfaces between stationary and flying qubits in modern architectures for quantum computation and quantum communication. We consider periodic <b>pulse</b> <b>control,</b> where the TLS is subjected to a periodic sequence of the near-resonant Rabi driving pulses, each pulse implementing a 180 rotation. For small interpulse delays, the absorption spectrum features a pronounced peak of stimulated emission at the pulse frequency, similar satellite peaks with smaller spectral weights, and the net absorption peaks on the sides. As long as the detuning between the carrier frequency of the driving and the TLS transition frequency remains moderate, this spectral shape shows little change. Therefore, the <b>pulse</b> <b>control</b> allows shifting the absorption peak to a desired position and locks the overall absorption spectrum to the carrier frequency of the driving pulses.
