40|$|Auctions {{have been}} used in several formats in the {{electric}} energy industry. In general, regulators may be uncomfortable initiating a reverse auction at a higher-than-expected final price, fearing that participants may sell their energy at an excess profitability. Nevertheless, evidence from electricity <b>procurement</b> auctions <b>conducted</b> in Brazil supports the findings that these types of auctions have the opposite effect. By attracting a larger number of agents, these auctions can trigger stronger competition and lead to lower settlement pricing. Accordingly, the Brazilian cases examined in this article present significant evidence to support this directional theory. In fact, there are some cases of electricity procurement auctions that show that inadequate auction reserve pricing leads to inefficient outcomes and may also cause the auction to fail. On the other hand, auctions with adequate price caps have led to lower final clearing prices, thus contributing to reasonable final energy pricin...|$|R

Our research quantifies both the operational and strategic impacts of electronic integration in a B 2 B procurement environment for a supplier. Additionally, we show that the customer also obtains substantial benefits from efficient procurement transaction processing. We isolate the performance impact of technology choice and ordering processes on both the trading partners. A significant finding is that the supplier derives large strategic benefits when the customer initiates the system and the supplier enhances the system's capabilities. With respect to operational benefits, we find that when suppliers have advanced electronic linkages, the order-processing system significantly increases benefits to both parties. business value of IT, empirical assessment, electronic integration, electronic procurement, B 2 B, strategic IT impact, operational IT impact...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{procurement}} in supplier relationships (SRs). Driven by the importance of outsourcing, {{there is a widespread}} awareness that procurement {{plays an important role in}} their management, yet there is still an incoherent view of what this role entails. The role of procurement is identified in this study by exploring how <b>procurement</b> managers <b>conduct</b> certain activities for the management of SRs that involve the exchange of products/services with different levels of asset specificity. The role is analysed and assessed in terms of four fundamental dimensions of SRs (trust, power, commitment and involvement). The findings reveal a far more limited role for procurement managers than what is advocated in the literature, especially for SRs that involve the exchange of products/services with high level of asset specificity and criticality. In light of the findings, certain profiles that can be adopted by procurement managers in specific contextual situations are identified and a guide to how procurement departments may be involved in an effective way in the management of SRs is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the initial}} {{euphoria}} about Internet-enabled reverse auctions {{has given way}} to a cautious but widespread use of reverse auctions in business-to-business (B 2 B) procurement, there is a limited understanding of the effect of auction design parameters on buyer surplus. In this paper, we study the effect of bidding competition, information asymmetry, reserve price, bid decrement, auction duration, and bidder type on buyer surplus. We collected field data on more than 700 online <b>procurement</b> auctions <b>conducted</b> by a leading auctioneer and involving procurement items worth millions of dollars. Consistent with the predictions of auction theory, the results indicate that bidding competition, reserve price, and information sharing affect buyer surplus. Unlike previous findings in the consumerto-consumer context, we find that bid decrement and auction duration have no effect in B 2 B procurement auctions. Our results suggest that use of the rank-bidding format increases buyer surplus when incumbent suppliers participate in the auction. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for future research and for optimal design of online procurement auctions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a case study, the Construction Case, which examines procurement practices within the UK construction supply chain and compares these with a more general UK sample taken from non-construction sectors. Using a qualitative methodology, the approaches to relationship management and buyer value perception are graphically mapped, using an innovative â€˜transaction X-rayâ€™ technique. The Construction Case considers <b>procurement</b> transactions <b>conducted</b> at various points along the construction value chain: the client, the construction firm and the specialist contractor. Recognising that the research design favours a small sample size, and thus limits generalisability beyond the boundaries of the case, the paper finds that construction industry procurement operates in an adversarial and largely armâ€™s-length manner. While procurement practice is found to share common aspects with other industrial sectors, the case demonstrates that the construction industry is more adversarial and less collaborative than is the average found across the other sectors examined. The paper outlines a useful framework whereby construction practitioners can evaluate elements of procurement practice within their own organisations, and also signposts the required direction for future research in order to reflect the gap, suggested by the case, between current normative theory and construction procurement practice...|$|R

The award of public sector contracts (ie both â€˜pureâ€™ public contracts and private contracts awarded by contracting authorities and entities, CAE) in Spain is regulated by the Spanish Law on Public Sector Contracts (LPSC) and its implementing regulations.

40|$|Hospitals {{have always}} faced {{fundamental}} questions of patient safety, care, and budgetary concerns. There {{has been increasing}} recognition recently of the serious issue of medical devices management, covering the areas of procurement, training, maintenance, and governance. This issue, documented by the National Audit Office, National Patient Safety Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, National Health Service Litigation Authority, and World Health Organisation, impacts on healthcare costs and patient safety. It has led to new Health and Social Care Act Regulations, enforced by the Care Quality Commission. As a result of my work as a consultant {{in the field of}} medical devices management, I constructed a policy model based on my own specialist experience and knowledge. This research sought to improve that model through participatory research conducted at an NHS Hospital in London. It took the form of a case study that specifically explored the core policy areas, but this time in collaboration with participants with expertise in {{one or more of the}} four interrelated policy areas of procurement, training, maintenance, and governance. This collaboration involved researching and analysing the external demands from regulatory agencies and internal demands from the organisation, centred on procurement, budgetary, and policy issues. The action research informed changes in policy, especially around procurement, leading to improvements in practice. The challenge of keeping policy up to date, and consistent with the external regulations and internal operational demands, is discussed in the case study. The Hospitalâ€™s internal politics and culture were found to be a help when starting up the case study, but a hindrance when it came to getting agreement and approvals to change the policy content, because of multiple committees and competing interests. The overall outcome of the project was an organisationally approved best practice policy model for medical devices management within a governance framework that meets the needs of the external regulators, and the management of the organisation. More specifically it was discovered that the use, maintenance, and governance of medical equipment were all reliant on a central issue, namely <b>procurement</b> practice. <b>Procurement</b> <b>conduct</b> for the organisation was redefined within the Hospital policy, and is making training, maintenance, and governance easier to achieve, thereby reducing risk and cost. A major consequence is that all budget holders need to be trained in procurement itself. Moreover, it is anticipated that the model could be used at similar healthcare organisations, ultimately leading to a contribution to knowledge and practice which assists in patient safety and meeting budgets...|$|R
