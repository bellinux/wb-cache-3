When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two-way data, the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5-wire version.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to analyze whether a regulation of the postal sector as a monopoly is actually efficient by examining its cost structure. The authors detected significant scale economies only in the delivery function and hence demonstrated a necessity for competition in the upstream operations. The primary {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize the basic conditions of natural monopoly theory and to review the approaches and results of the studies dealing with this topic. Despite the importance of contestability in this context, previous literature concentrates only on the subadditivity aspect. The existence of economies of scale does not inevitably justify a governmental maintenance of the monopoly if the market is contestable. In this respect, further research is needed in order to account for contestability. <b>Postal</b> Sector, <b>Scale</b> Economies, Subadditivity, Contestability...|$|R

He eventually specialized in two areas: early Americana and the works of Charles Dickens.He collected not only rare editions of Dickens's books, many in their original publications as periodical series, but also various ephemera such as speeches, addresses, original illustrations, mementos, and letters. Elkins also owned a desk that Dickens used, along with his <b>postal</b> <b>scale</b> and pen tray, his pocket compass, travelling lantern, and a bedside candlestick.

50|$|The Galaxy is the world's largest {{polished}} opal, {{certified by}} the Guinness Book of World Records in 1992. It was found at the Boi Morto Mine in north eastern Brazil in 1976. It is today part of a private collection. The finished opal weighs approximately 3,749 carats, or 0.75 kg. It was carved from a grapefruit-sized piece of rough stone weighing 5,205 carats by Scott Cooley into a shape resembling a child's head. The weight of the finished stone was beyond the capacity of any gem measuring scale at the Gemological Institute of America and an approximation of its weight in carats had to be determined using a <b>postal</b> <b>scale.</b> The stone measures 14.0 x 10.2 x 4.1 cm (5-1/2 x 4 x 1-5/8 in).|$|E

40|$|Aims:To objectively {{assess the}} quality of life after femorodistal bypass and compare this to quality of life {{achieved}} following primary limb amputation. Design:Retrospective review. Setting:Leicester Royal Infirmary, U. K., 1988 – 1993. Methods:A self-assessment <b>postal</b> questionnaire containing <b>scales</b> measuring emotional disorder, social functioning and mobility was sent to 112 patients who had previously undergone femorodistal bypass (n = 86) or primary limb amputation (n = 26). Results:Further analysis demonstrated that a secondary procedure (PTA or graft revision) to maintain graft patency did not adversely affect quality of life. Additionally, patients undergoing secondary amputation after graft failure had an identical quality of life to those undergoing primary amputation. Conclusions:These data illustrate that {{the quality of}} life after successful femorodistal bypass is higher than after primary or secondary amputation. To attain the maximum quality of life in patients with critical ischaemia, femorodistal bypass should be performed wherever feasible...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A double-blind, {{randomized}} controlled {{trial of a}} novel educational booklet compared with a traditional booklet for patients seeking treatment in primary care for acute or recurrent low back pain. Objective. To test {{the impact of a}} novel educational booklet on patients' beliefs about back pain and functional outcome. Summary of Background Data. The information and advice that health professionals give to patients may be important in health care intervention, but there is little scientific evidence of their effectiveness. A novel patient educational booklet, The Back Book, has been developed to provide evidence-based information and advice consistent with current clinical guidelines. Methods. One hundred sixty-two patients were given either the experimental booklet or a traditional booklet. The main outcomes studied were fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity, beliefs about the inevitable consequences of back trouble, the Roland Disability Questionnaire, and visual analogue pain <b>scales.</b> <b>Postal</b> follow-up response at 1 year after initial treatment was 78...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{on recent}} studies of the {{importance}} of social networks and embeddedness in affecting the operation of businesses, this paper reports the results of an empirical study of the social networks maintained by business owners located in three small towns in the highly peripheral Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Through a combination of a large <b>scale</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire and qualitative semi-structured interviews, the study found that, although business owners in all three towns place importance on maintaining embedded ties, there are differences between the towns in terms of the characteristics of the social networks maintained by owners. Respondents suggest several explanations for these differing patterns, including the number of in-migrants in the local area and the cultural characteristics of local people. The paper discusses the implications of these patterns for the future development of the businesses and the towns in which they are located. In particular, it is argued that the strength of local social networks maintained by owners in very remote Wick may serve to hamper both their future business development and that of the wider local economy...|$|R

40|$|From January to March 1980, a {{consecutive}} {{sample of}} 50 children admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain provisionally diagnosed as appendicitis but who recovered spontaneously without a specific physical diagnosis was studied. The instruments used were a standardized parental interview and Rutter A(2) and B(2) questionnaires which are designed as screening devices to explore levels of emotional adjustment in children. A comparison {{was made with}} 43 children (controls) matched for sex and age from the same schools. Forty children suffering from acute appendicitis were studied in the same way. A significantly increased {{number of children in}} the nonspecific group obtained abnormal scores on the Rutter Scales compared with the control group (P less than 0. 025).

40|$|AbstractForty eight {{potential}} outliers in {{air pollution}} measurements taken simultaneously in Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada in 2008 and 2009 were identified using four independent methods: box plots, variogram clouds, difference maps, and the Local Moran's I statistic. These methods were subsequently used in combination to reduce and select a final set of 13 outliers for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), total benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX), and particulate matter in two size fractions (PM 2. 5 and PM 10). The selected outliers {{were excluded from the}} measurement datasets and used to revise air pollution models. In addition, a set of temporally-scaled air pollution models was generated using time series measurements from community air quality monitors, with and without the selected outliers. The influence of outlier exclusion on associations with asthma exacerbation rates aggregated at a <b>postal</b> zone <b>scale</b> in both cities was evaluated. Results demonstrate that the inclusion or exclusion of outliers influences the strength of observed associations between intraurban air quality and asthma exacerbation in both cities. The box plot, variogram cloud, and difference map methods largely determined the final list of outliers, due to the high degree of conformity among their results. The Moran's I approach was not useful for outlier identification in the datasets studied. Removing outliers changed the spatial distribution of modeled concentration values and derivative exposure estimates averaged over postal zones. Overall, associations between air pollution and acute asthma exacerbation rates were weaker with outliers removed, but improved with the addition of temporal information. Decreases in statistically significant associations between air pollution and asthma resulted, in part, from smaller pollutant concentration ranges used for linear regression. Nevertheless, the practice of identifying outliers through congruence among multiple methods strengthens confidence in the analysis of outlier presence and influence in environmental datasets...|$|R
40|$|While {{agricultural}} {{risk and}} risk perception has received significant {{attention in the}} literature, few studies have explored {{the factors that influence}} the way farmers respond to particular risks. This paper uses the case of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), {{one of the most significant}} risks currently facing the English cattle farming industry, to explore these factors, with a particular focus on the role of social networks. A large <b>scale</b> <b>postal</b> survey distributed to beef and dairy farmers in the south west of England provides representative data which are subjected to factor and cluster analysis in order explore farmer views towards and responses to disease risk. Two groups of farmers are identified which can be distinguished from each other based on their attitudes towards bTB and the nature of their social networks. Farmers with wider, more externally focussed social networks are found to be more resilient than those whose social networks are restricted to family members and other farmers. However, while differences between the two groups are found in terms of their attitudes towards bTB, no differences are found in relation to their risk management behaviour, with few farmers taking clear action to reduce the risk of their herds contracting the disease. In order to address the identified disconnection between attitudes and behaviour, a number of potential interventions are put forward and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) is {{established}} {{and is used}} by physicians to identify patients at risk of job loss for rapid intervention. The study objective was to explore the concept of Work Instability (a mismatch between an individual's abilities and job demands) in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and develop a Work Instability Scale specific to this population. Methods New items generated from qualitative interviews were combined with items from the RA-WIS to form a draft AS-WIS. Rasch {{analysis was used to}} examine the scaling properties of the AS-WIS using data generated through a <b>postal</b> survey. The <b>scale</b> was validated against a gold standard of expert assessment, a test-retest survey examined reliability. Results Fifty-seven participants who were in work returned the postal survey. Of the original 55 items 38 were shown to fit the Rasch model (χ 2 37. 5; df 38; p 0. 494) and free of bias for gender and disease duration. Following analysis for discrimination against the gold standard assessments 20 items remained with good fit to the model (χ 2 24. 8; df 20; p 0. 21). Test-retest reliability was 0. 94. Conclusion The AS-WIS is a self-administered scale which meets the stringent requirements of modern measurement. Used as a screening tool it can identify those experiencing a mismatch at work who are at risk of job retention problems and work disability. Work instability is emerging as an important indication for the use of biologics, thus the AS-WIS has the potential to become an important outcome measure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Policing {{is often}} characterised by highly {{stressful}} {{situations that are}} outside {{the experience of the}} general public (Violanti, 1999). In spite of this only a few studies have gone beyond identifying and categorising likely stressors as well asking police officers themselves how they view and experience stress. The present research set out to explore the subjective experiences of and preferred modes of managing stress as reported by police officers and some of their spouses. Adopting a mixed methodological approach, three empirical investigations were conducted. The first study reported findings emerging from a survey questionnaire, while the second and third studies entailed Interpretative Phenomenological Analyses of narrative, interview based data. The quantitative study comprised two distinct phases: a pilot followed by a large <b>scale</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire, both surveying psychological outcomes of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and coping behaviours of 45 and 168 police officers respectively. Analysis of variance for differences on anxiety and depression as a function of rank and gender produced non-significant results across two the phases. Hierarchical log linear however showed different patterns of morbidity for gender in the prevalence of PTSD. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of the interview transcripts with six police officers revealed themes relating to "stress in an experience to be denied; the emotional rules of display how stress is managed; and managing the professional self" as important dimensions of stress and managing stress experiences. The analysis of six officer spouses' accounts about their own stress experiences identified three prevalent themes; namely, "living with an intransient organisation; feelings of exclusion; and living with a non-communicative partner". Collectively these two sets of themes showed the experience of stress for these police officers was multi-dimensional in that two conversational voices (that of a professional police officer, and as a private individual) emerged. Influenced by the role of the officer in both worlds, organisational norms in their professional world and quality of relationships in their private world, the findings of this thesis are discussed in terms of the interconnectedness between the public and private worlds of the officer and how this shapes their contextualisation, experience and management of stress...|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{emergence}} {{more than}} a decade ago, information architecture remains a problematic concept. A study of relevant literature suggests significant advocacy with inadequate supporting evidence on its existence, application or value. The available limited research evidence generally presents unsatisfactory information architecture experience. Notwithstanding the unresolved issues and reported unsatisfactory experience, information architecture continues to be referenced as an important information management issue. Hence this doctoral study sought to investigate it. In the first stage, the study set out to clarify the position of information architecture via a large <b>scale</b> <b>postal</b> survey of 294 organisations. The survey found that information architecture is being used in association with IS planning, particularly in organisations which position IT as a strategic resource, but perceptions on its two conventional key components vary. While application architecture is viewed as being useful for IS planning, corporate data model is seen as being more relevant to data management and project implementation. Both models are regarded as tools facilitating integrated information systems development. In the second stage of research, case studies on 6 large organisations were conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of successful information architecture practice. The investigation reaffirmed application architecture's position as an IS planning tool and cast further doubt on corporate data model's role not only in IS planning but also in IS practice as a whole. Business area/project data model was identified as the pragmatic high-level data model for both application/database development and data management. A major finding of the case studies was on business system architecture, a pictorial model depicting IT in its business setting. It is seen as being of value for integrating IS planning with strategy development and business planning - a tool for fusing IT with the business. The case studies concluded that the value and effectiveness of information architecture is dependent on the targeting of its components - business system architecture, application architecture and business area/project data model - in terms of tasks and recipients. The case for a holistic approach to business/IS planning and implementation is currently being argued by a number of leading management and IS scholars. This thesis embraces the holistic approach and positions the (redefined) information architecture as a valuable tool in its implementation. </p...|$|R
