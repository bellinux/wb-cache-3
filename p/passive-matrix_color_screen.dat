40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} Charmonium energy spectrum {{determined by the}} Bethe-Salpeter equation are investigated. It is found that the regular motion of the cc̅ system can be expected at a small value of <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> mass but the chaotic motion at a large one. It is shown that the level mixing due to <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> serves as a new mechanism resulting in the J/ψ suppression.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> on the {{transition}} of a parton plasma into a hadron gas at RHIC energies. It is found that as expected, <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> posed itself as a significant barrier for hadronization. Parton-hadron conversion would therefore be delayed and prolonged when compared to that occuring in a vacuum. Due to the on-going expansion, the resulting hadron densities are lowered. Parton equilibration is also shown to be seriously disrupted in the process. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model to explain the bottomonium {{suppression}} in Pb+Pb collisions at mid rapidity obtained from Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energy, √(s_NN) = 2. 76 TeV. The model consists of two decoupled mechanisms namely, <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> during bottomonium production followed by gluon induced dissociation along with collisional damping. The quasi-particle model (QPM) is used as equation of state (EOS) for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium. The feed-down from higher Υ states, such as Υ(1 P), Υ(2 S) and Υ(2 P), dilated formation times for bottomonium states and viscous effect of QGP medium are other ingredients included in the current formulation. We further assume that the QGP is expanding according to (1 + 1) -dimensional Bjorken's boost invariant scaling law. The net suppression (in terms of p_T integrated survival probability) for bottomonium states at mid rapidity is obtained {{as a function of}} centrality and the result is then compared both quantitatively and qualitatively with the recent LHC experimental data in the mid rapidity region recently published by CMS collaboration. We find that the current model, based on the Debye <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> plus gluonic dissociation along with collisional damping, better describes the centrality dependence of bottomonium suppression at LHC energy as compared to <b>color</b> <b>screening</b> model alone. 0. 5 cm Keywords : <b>Color</b> <b>screening,</b> Gluonic dissociation, Collisional damping, Survival probability PACS numbers : 12. 38.
