5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration.

According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have <b>Paul</b> <b>Wolfowitz</b> named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E

5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site.

[...] It has indeed become an article of faith (literally in some cases) in Washington that American and Israeli interests are identical, but this was not always so, and [...] "Jewish interests" [...] are not the main reason for it now.|$|R
