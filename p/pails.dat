5|$|The pottery {{as well as}} iron {{mining and}} {{processing}} industries kept developing in Poland throughout the Roman periods, until terminated in the 5th century or so by the Great Migration. Clay pots were still often formed manually and these were more crude, while the better ones were made with the potter's wheel, used {{beginning in the early}} 3rd century. Some had inscriptions engraved, but their meaning, if any, is not known (Germanic people had occasionally used the runic alphabets). Wide-open, vase type Przeworsk culture urn from the 2nd century AD found in Biała, Zgierz County is covered with representations from Celtic and Germanic mythology, such as deer, horse riders, crosses and swastikas. The 3rd and 4th century buckets were made of wood and reinforced with bronze braces and sheets. Przeworsk culture's large globular clay storage containers from the 3rd and 4th century were 60cm to over one meter tall. The 4th and 5th century ceramic specimens from the late phase of this culture include pitchers, clay <b>pails,</b> beakers and bowls.|$|E

25|$|In late 1953, Kramer, then a {{temporarily}} retired player (due to {{his back}} troubles), signed Gonzales (a seven-year contract) {{to play in a}} 1954 US tour also featuring Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman and Donald Budge (the latter being replaced in March 1954 by Carl Earn for the last weeks of the tour). In the subsequent matches Gonzales beat Segura 30-21 and Sedgman by the same score. After this tour Gonzales won the U.S. Pro where all the best, except <b>Pails,</b> were present. Then the American played in a Far East tour (September–October 1954). He barely won over Segura and Kramer, who made his come-back in singles after a 14-month retirement. Then Gonzales had major success: he swept the Australian Tour in November–December 1954 by beating Sedgman 16-9, McGregor 15-0, and Segura, 4-2. Although Pancho was beaten by the Australian Pro <b>Pails</b> in the last competition of the year, Gonzales had clearly established himself as the top player in the world in 1954.|$|E

25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic <b>pails,</b> car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
500|$|Some <b>pails</b> were {{supplied}} with deodorants such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with pail closets by lining the pail with an absorbent material. [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller <b>pails.</b> [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden <b>pails</b> used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] <b>Pails</b> were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|E
500|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. [...] It used a wooden tub, or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. [...] The <b>pails</b> were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of the pail carried a cast iron rim about 3inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. [...] The <b>pails</b> were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during the day. [...] Each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. [...] While the pail was removed from the closet, a replacement was installed in its place. [...] In 1874, Rochdale Corporation employed five such wagons in full-time service, collecting from 3,354privies spread across the town. [...] By contrast, with a much larger population, Manchester Corporation employed 73wagons. [...] By 1875, 4,741pails were in use, and in 1876 the number was5,566. [...] A separate cart accompanied the wagon to collect other household refuse which was collected from a separate chamber in the pail closet.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the more}} {{advanced}} water closet (flush toilet) was popular in wealthy homes, {{the lack of an}} adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th-century England, in working-class neighbourhoods, towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods of waste disposal. [...] The <b>pail</b> closet was an evolution of the midden closet (privy midden or midden closet), an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health. [...] The <b>pail</b> system was popular in France and England, particularly in the historic Lancashire town of Rochdale, from which the system commonly took its name. [...] The <b>pail</b> closet was not without its own problems; if the <b>pail</b> was not emptied on a regular basis, it overflowed and became unhygienic. [...] Some manufacturers lined the <b>pail</b> with absorbent materials, and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise the smell.|$|R

500|$|About [...] {{of night}} soil were {{collected}} in Rochdale each year, from a population of about64,000—roughly [...] per person. [...] At the depot, the night soil was emptied into a storage tank. [...] The <b>pails</b> were washed in a large trough using a mixture of chloride of lime and water. [...] The night soil was then dried in revolving cylinders, using furnace heat from other borough refuse, before being transferred to so-called drying plates. [...] Gases were burnt in a furnace, the fumes escaping up a [...] chimney. [...] Clinker from the remains of burnt refuse was used to make mortar. [...] The manure works was a filthy environment, filled with dust. [...] Enginemen were paid 7¼d, firemen 6½d, and general labourers 4½d.
