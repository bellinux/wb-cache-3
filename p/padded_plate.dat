40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the printing plate onto the printing substrate. The pad printing is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of the printing elements, on the <b>pad</b> printing <b>plate</b> one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer <b>pad</b> printing <b>plate</b> production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the printing elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the printing elements.

40|$|With MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical systems) {{becoming}} increasingly commonplace {{in many different}} industries, {{the need for more}} robust microstructures that can withstand high-shock environments is growing in importance. Literature currently available is yet to reveal a MEMS shock-absorber which meets our set of requirements, namely that it is suitable for both space and terrestrial applications, is easily incorporated into current MEMS fabrication methods and can absorb significant amounts of energy without needing a power source or without adversely affecting the performance of the device. This thesis presents a novel solution for the shock protection of MEMS which successfully satisfies the requirements stated above. Metal microstructures, created through the reflow of solder, are successfully used to armour and protect delicate silicon MEMS suspensions. A brittle silicon-silicon impact is replaced with a ductile metal-metal impact. The metal protects the silicon from fracturing at the point of impact during a high-shock event and absorbs a significant proportion of the collision energy through plastic deformation. A model suspension system is used to assess the performance of metalarmouring as a MEMS shock-absorber. Two metal-bumper designs, surface-mounted solder bumpers and solder bumpers integrated into the sidewalls of the suspension system are fabricated and tested in a drop-test rig at acceleration levels of up to 6000 g. The surface-mounted bumpers, formed by reflowing solder on metallised <b>pads</b> (<b>plated</b> on the suspension surface), were found to fail on impact at the pad-wafer interface. The integrated bumpers are designed to combat the short-comings of the surface-mounted bumpers. Two solder balls are reflowed in through-wafer conduits within the suspension sidewalls, creating substantial solder bumpers which are mechanically keyed in place. The integrated bumpers proved to be shear resistant and to double overall the shock resistance of the MEMS suspension. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|The plastic ball {{grid array}} (PBGA) is an IC {{packaging}} technology developed in late 80 s. This package has many advantages over conventional modules. Among them are high I/O, low profile, good thermal/electrical performance, and robust assembly process. Furthermore, PBGA packages are compatible with surface mount technology (SMT). For surface mounted components (SMCs), the solder joints not only provides the passage of electrical signal and power, but also the mechanical support to hold the module in position on the printed circuit board (PCB). Therefore, the solder joint reliability {{is a major concern}} for PBGA packages. Currently the standard package configuration of PBGA is to place eutectic Pb/Sn solder balls on the bond pads at the bottom side of BT substrate. The surface finishing metallurgy on the solder bond pads is Ni/Au deposited by electrolytic plating. However, since this process requires routing traces to connect all bond pads together, a considerable amount of space is wasted on the BT substrate (which is relatively expensive). In order to avoid this deficiency, an electroless Ni/Au plating process was recently proposed for PBGA substrates. However, some previous studies indicate that, due to the relatively high phosphorous (P) concentration (usually 9 - 10 %) in the electroless Ni plating solution, substantial intermetallic compounds are formed. Such brittle materials could reduce the shear strength of PBGA solder balls and lead to problems with solder joint reliability. Possible remedies to this problem may be the use of low phosphorous-content (5 %) solution, or electroless Nickel-Boron (Ni-B) plating solution. This thesis aims to assess the reliability of solder ball attachment on the PBGA substrates with various bond <b>pad</b> <b>plating</b> schemes, namely, electrolytic Ni/Au, electroless Ni-l 0 %P/Au, electroless Ni-B/Au, electroless Ni- 5 %P/Au and electroless Ni-l 0 % P/Pd/Au. At first, BT-substrates are fabricated with appropriate thickness. After the solder ball placement and normal reflow process, mechanical tests are performed to evaluate the solder ball shear strength. In order to simulate the real industrial process, multiple reflows are conducted to investigate the long-term reliability issues. The experimental results indicate that the newly proposed electroless Ni plating solution can indeed reduce the intermetallic compound and improve the solder ball shear strength...|$|R

Among the fatigue phenomenon, especially fretting fatigue occurs in mechanical joints showing small relative movements between contact surfaces. Although the research was developed for one hundred years, occurrence mechanism is not clearly identified yet. INCOLOY alloy 800 is a iron-nickel-chromium alloy having excellent resistance to many corrosive aqueous media and high-temperature atmospheres. This alloy is used extensively in the nuclear power plants industry, the chemical industry, the heat-treating industry and the electronic industry. In this paper, the effect of fretting damage on fatigue behavior for INCOLOY alloy 800 was studied. Also, various kinds of mechanical tests such as tension and plain fatigue tests are performed.

By around 1000 AD, solid plates {{had fallen out of}} use in Europe and knights of the period were wearing mail {{in the form of a}} hauberk over a <b>padded</b> tunic. <b>Plates</b> protecting the torso reappeared during the 13th century in the form of the cuirass or alternatively as plates directly attached to a knightly garment known as the surcoat. Around 1300 this developed into the coat of plates which continued to be in use for about a century. True breastplates reappear in Europe in 1340 first composed of wrought iron and later of steel. They were between 1 mm and 2.5 mm thick. In order to prevent the wearer from being cut by their own armour, the design featured outward turned edges that also increased stiffness. In some cases, further strength was added by a ridge running down through the centre of the plate. These early breastplates only covered the upper torso with the lower torso not being protected by plate until the development of the fauld around 1400. Around 1450, the breastplate had expanded to cover the entire torso and could consist of one or two plates. The French term pancier, which became English pauncher and German panzer, was also used.

40|$|Most {{electronics}} {{companies have}} transitioned to lead-free processes, both {{to comply with}} government legislation and to avoid issues related to mixing of tin-lead and lead-free metallurgies. However, exemptions from lead-free legislation have been granted for certain products, especially those intended for high-reliability applications. One major concern with these exempt products is that, during assembly or rework, lead-free components {{will have to be}} used due to the unavailability of tin-lead components. This will result in the mixing of tin-lead and lead-free metallurgies. The mixing of metallurgies can induce new reliability concerns. This study is focused on mixed solder joints formed by attaching lead-free components with tin-lead paste. Solder interconnect reliability is influenced by the environmental imposed load, solder material properties and the microstructure formed between the solder and the metal surfaces to which the solder is bonded. Several lead-free metallurgies are being used for component terminals, board <b>pad</b> <b>plating</b> and solder materials. These metallurgies react to form the microstructure of a solder joint. Microstructure of a solder joint continuously evolves and affects solder joint properties. A fundamental understanding on the microstructure is required to analyze the changes occurring in a solder joint with time and temperature and make predictions on solder joint reliability under thermal loading conditions. This dissertation determines key microstructural features present in SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints. Changes in the microstructural features were determined for SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints exposed to isothermal aging conditions. The effect of microstructural changes on reliability was determined by conducting thermal fatigue reliability tests for SnPb and lead-free solder joints. Whereas, for mixed solder joints, hypotheses has been determined based on microstructural analysis on their thermal fatigue performance compared to SnPb joints. This dissertation doesn't include the effect of microstructural changes on the reliability of mixed solder joints. This dissertation doesn't include the reliability tests for mixed solder joints. Two microstructural features namely, intermetallic compounds (IMC) and Pb phase were characterized for SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints. IMCs are formed at the solder to pad metallization interface and in the bulk solder. It was determined that reaction between Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder and Ni/Au component side metallization result in interfacial IMCs consisting of Ni 3 Sn 4 IMC in the as-reflowed stage and IMCs such as (NiCu) 3 Sn 4, (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 and (Au,Ni) Sn 4 after thermal aging of 350 hours at 125 ºC. With pad metallization of ImAg, ImSn and OSP, IMCs such as Cu 6 Sn 5 are formed after reflow followed by formation of a new Cu 3 Sn IMC phase after thermal aging of 350 hours at 125 ºC. Cu 6 Sn 5 and Ag 3 Sn IMC were found distributed in bulk solder joints in the as-reflowed and aged (125 ºC for 100, 350 and 1000 hrs) solder joint. This dissertation demonstrated that under thermal cycling, intergranular crack propagates between Sn grains in the bulk solder and Cu 6 Sn 5 IMCs present at Sn grain boundaries in the bulk solder influence crack propagation. It was demonstrated that isothermal aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC causes coarsening of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles in the bulk solder which results in a 50 % reduction in number of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles in the bulk solder, thus promoting the crack to propagate faster along the grain boundary. This dissertation determined that isothermal aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC would cause a 25 % reduction in characteristic life for lead-free solder joints due to the changes associated with Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles. In conventional SnPb solder joints Pb phase present in the bulk solder coarsens as a function of time and temperature and influences thermal fatigue reliability. Due to the presence of Pb in mixed solder joint, this dissertation determined the extent of coarsening in mixed solder joints compared with SnPb joints. It was determined that mixed solder joints are not prone to Pb phase coarsening under aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC as opposed to SnPb solder joints and therefore would have better thermal fatigue performance compared to SnPb joint under these conditions. This dissertation demonstrated that the presence of Pb in mixed solder results in a 30 to 40 % lower IMC thickness compared to Pb-free and SnPb solder joints by being present at the interface as a diffusion barrier between Ni and Sn for IMC formation. Presence of Pb has been known to act as diffusion barrier for SnPb solder joints...|$|R

Beam lead processes are already established for silicon and gallium arsenide wafers. However, niobium circuits on quartz substrates present unique difficulties. SIS junctions introduce additional thermal and chemical constraints to process development. For quartz, wet etches are isotropic and dry etches with high etch rates require large ion energies.

Usually copper <b>pad</b> was first <b>plated</b> by electroless Ni-P and followed by electroless Au to eliminating lead wiring. Ni Local corrosion is usually developed if immersion Au plating is applied on the electroless Ni-P, because the electroless Au plating is displacement reaction and normally porus thin film. To obtain high reliability, a thick gold plating on Ni-P film was necessary, however a insertion of electorless Pd layer between electroless Au plating and electroless Ni-P plating was proposed to avoid local corrosion. The insertion of electroless Pd layer suppressed deterioration of solderability by annealing and it was independent of types of electroless Ni deposit as the under layer. However, share strength of solder ball and wire bonding strength was affected by under layer Ni-P film. Since the palladium layer was diffused into solder ball by annealing, the connecting strength depended on interface between solder and Ni-P film. Moreover, a surface condition of Au was depended on the electroless Ni-P film type, a diffused Ni detection on Au was also depend on the type of electroless Ni-P film. By observation of Ni-P film structure, the high connecting strength was obtain by using lamellar structure Ni-P film and the Ni-P film with columnar structure showed inferior connecting strength to that with lamellar structure. Therefore, it is concluded that the structure of under layer Ni-P film is important to obtain high reliability even for insertion of Pd layer...|$|R
40|$|To provide uniform cooling for a {{fuel cell}} stack, a cooling plate concept was evaluated. This concept {{utilized}} thin cooling plates to extract heat from the interior of {{a fuel cell}} stack and move this heat to a cooling manifold where it can be transferred to an external cooling fluid. The advantages of this cooling approach include a reduced number of ancillary components and the ability to directly utilize an external cooling fluid loop for cooling the fuel cell stack. A number of different types of cooling plates and manifolds were developed. The cooling plates consisted of two main types; a plate based on thermopyrolytic graphite (TPG) and a planar (or flat plate) heat pipe. The plates, along with solid metal control samples, were tested for both thermal and electrical conductivity. To transfer heat from the cooling plates to the cooling fluid, a number of manifold designs utilizing various materials were devised, constructed, and tested. A key aspect of the manifold was {{that it had to be}} electrically nonconductive so it would not short out the fuel cell stack during operation. Different manifold and cooling plate configurations were tested in a vacuum chamber to minimize convective heat losses. Cooling plates were placed in the grooves within the manifolds and heated with surface-mounted electric <b>pad</b> heaters. The <b>plate</b> temperature and its thermal distribution were recorded for all tested combinations of manifold cooling flow rates and heater power loads. This testing simulated the performance of the cooling plates and manifold within an operational fuel cell stack. Different types of control valves and control schemes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to maintain a constant temperature of the cooling plates. The control valves regulated the cooling fluid flow through the manifold, thereby controlling the heat flow to the cooling fluid. Through this work, a cooling plate and manifold system was developed that could maintain the cooling plates within a minimal temperature band with negligible thermal gradients over power profiles that would be experienced within an operating fuel cell stack...|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs {{are being}} {{negatively}} impacted by various causes worldwide, and direct intervention is often warranted following disturbance to restore or replace lost ecosystem structure and function. An experimental coral reef restoration study involving standardized artificial reef modules (ReefballsTM) {{was conducted in}} Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula in the towns of Puerto Morelos and Akumal. The purpose was to explore the use of artificial structure for restoration and mitigation applications in a highly diverse and dynamic Caribbean coral reef environment by applying and evaluating the performance of select experimental treatments hypothesized to accelerate development of the associated biota. The first treatment consisted of invertebrate enhancing artificial substrate padding material, which provided structurally complex refuge space for mobile epifaunal/infaunal invertebrates and other benthic organisms. The second treatment consisted of coral transplants, intended to provide additional structural complexity and kick-start development of stony coral populations. The third treatment consisted of settlement plates which were intended to provide data on coral recruitment and survival rates. Multiple hypotheses relating to the interactions between experimental treatments and the resulting macroalgal, non-coral invertebrate, stony coral, and coral reef fish assemblages were examined, and comparisons were made between natural and artificial substrates. In Puerto Morelos there were 40 modules; 10 controls and 10 of each of 3 treatments: substrate pads, coral transplants, and settlement plates. In Akumal there were 12 modules; 6 controls and 3 of each of 2 treatments: substrate <b>pads</b> and settlement <b>plates.</b> Following module deployment, 6 biannual monitoring trips were made {{over the course of}} three years to assess the development of the biota, with a final 7 th trip made six years post-deployment. Divers conducted non-destructive visual surveys to evaluate total abundance, species richness, size class distribution, and assemblage structure of coral reef fishes. Other monitoring work included coral recruit surveys, mobile epifaunal invertebrate collections from substrate pads, and digital imaging of coral transplants, natural reef reference corals, and benthic quadrat areas. Hurricane Dean compromised the Akumal study site {{during the first year of}} the study, but Puerto Morelos was unaffected. There the modules developed biotic assemblages that differed from what was found on the natural reef, and the data suggests that the substrate pads may have had an effect on the development of faunal assemblages. Lobophora variegata macroaglae and Desmapsamma anchorata sponge were the major contributors to benthic community composition, and both had significantly greater coverage on the substrate pads treatment modules. Lobophora grew rapidly and peaked within the first year, while sponges increased steadily throughout the first three years of the study, surpassing the coverage of macroalgae before the end of the second year, much to the detriment of coral transplants and many coral recruits. By the end of the study, over 75 % of the transplants were overgrown by D. anchorata, and density of new coral recruits on the Pads treatment modules was lower than the other treatments and controls. Coral recruitment was dominated by Porites astreoides on all treatments and controls, and the number of corals increased steadily throughout the study. The controls had consistently greater numbers of corals than the treatments, as well as lower percent coverage of macroalgae and sponges. Total abundance and species richness of reef fishes was generally unaffected by the treatments. However, at the family and species level, several differences were detected, particularly for the substrate pads treatment and to a lesser extent for the coral transplants treatment. For future restoration or mitigation efforts utilizing similar or identical treatments to artificial substrates, this study suggests that, in the absence of routine maintenance, greater success may be achieved after waiting several years post-deployment for the initial wave of unchecked growth by benthic organisms (i. e., macroalgae and sponges) to reach a balance point before a large investment of resources is devoted to coral transplanting. Further recommendations include routine monthly or quarterly on-site maintenance to enhance transplant survival, as well as a longer monitoring window to assess community development in response to experimental treatments. The results of this study suggest that the experimental treatments did indeed have an effect on the biota, but whether or not the effect was beneficial largely depends upon perspective. The Pads treatment in particular had the greatest effect on both reef fish and benthic community development, however, it was not beneficial for stony coral recruitment. Additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term performance and effects of the padding material on biotic assemblage development for future restoration or mitigation projects...|$|R
