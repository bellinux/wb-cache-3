The Japanese third-party manufacturer Hori also released Final Fantasy XII memory {{cards on the}} day of the game's release; stickers of Final Fantasy XII characters are included. Game <b>peripheral</b> <b>maker</b> Logicool (Logitech's Japanese branch) {{released a}} special edition Final Fantasy XII controller alongside the title on March 16. Suntory produced [...] "Final Fantasy XII Potion"—a drink containing such ingredients as royal jelly, chamomile, sage, thyme, and marjoram. The drinks became commercially available in Japan on March 7, 2006. Suntory also released a Final Fantasy XII Premium Box, which came with a Final Fantasy XII collector's card. The Potion was a limited edition product and is no longer available. Final Fantasy XII was also adapted into a manga by Gin Amou.

2500|$|Apple iMac was {{introduced}} in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted [...] "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party <b>peripheral</b> <b>makers</b> – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|R
40|$|Cigarette {{smoking and}} the use of nicotine-based {{products}} constitute a significant health burden, which considered a key factor in preventable morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries (Jha, Ranson et al. 2002). Despite the implementation of targeted and widespread prevention campaigns aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use, several epidemiological studies have suggested that the rate of cigarette smoking is on the rise in developing countries (Abdullah and Husten 2004), and highlight that these behaviours are inextricably linked to many <b>peripheral</b> <b>makers</b> of deleterious health outcomes. Although the impact of cigarette smoking on aspects of cardiovascular (Ambrose and Barua 2004) and psychiatric health (Lasser, Boyd et al. 2000) has been well documented, information regarding its effects on sleep physiology and architecture is, by comparison, poorly defined and under-studied. Consequently, little to no research currently exists which comprehensively assesses the effect of nicotine use, defined nicotine dependence, and instances of nicotine withdrawal in the experience of common sleep disturbances such as insomnia and short sleep duration and subsequent help-seeking behaviours...|$|R

5000|$|Announced {{in early}} 1986, VTech sold the Laser 128 in the US at a {{suggested}} retail price of $479, while Central Point Software sold it by mail for $395; by comparison, the Apple IIe sold for $945 in April 1986. Apple filed a lawsuit to stop distribution but VTech obtained United States Customs approval to export the Laser 128 to the United States in 1986, and the lawsuit reportedly {{had no effect on}} demand for the computer. Central Point—the most prominent dealer—sold the Laser 128 and accessories with full-page magazine advertisements, claiming that [...] "a computer without expansion slots is a dead-end that stays behind as technology advances". It even advertised the Laser 128 in Commodore computer magazines; the name was, Central Point president Mike Brown said, [...] "chosen to sound like the Commodore 128", and the company intended to appeal to those who wanted to use the large Apple software library with a computer that cost the same as the Commodore. By late 1986 other mail-order firms also sold the Laser 128, and at least one <b>peripheral</b> <b>maker</b> advertised its product's compatibility with the clone.|$|E

[...] Chike has received additional notice for full comboing Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames". [...] Both players' reputations have earned them spokespersons deals, Chike for The Ant Commandos, a third-party <b>peripheral</b> controller <b>maker,</b> and Johnson for eMazingGaming.com, a video game event promoter. Guinness also awarded the series ten world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008, including [...] "Best Selling Guitar Based Game" [...] and [...] "Biggest Funeral for a Fictional Object", when in November 2006 a funeral for the air guitar was held in London, England as a publicity stunt for Guitar Hero IIs release.|$|R
40|$|Ranking {{alternatives}} is {{a central}} issue in multi-criteria and multi-person decision making. Each member of a committee of experts has his own knowledge-base and a current information {{in order to make}} decisions. We assume the committee adopt the AHP as the tool that each expert uses to construct the personal ranking of alternatives. As described and formalized in (Carlsson et al., 1992; Eklund et al., 2007; Maturo, and Ventre, 2008) each decision maker is represented by a point of the Euclidean space R m, where the coordinates are the scores of the alternatives. Enhancing consensus in the group reduces to implementing a procedure that makes these points closer, {{so that they can be}} included in a suitably small neighborhood. In order to obtain consensus the more <b>peripheral</b> decision <b>makers</b> are invited by an impartial chairman, called the Demiurge, to modify their assessments. What seems to us worth to be considered is a further convergence procedure related to the weights of the criteria that in the first levels of the hierarchy induce the choices in the alternative set...|$|R
