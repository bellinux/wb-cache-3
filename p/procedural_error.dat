5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a <b>procedural</b> <b>error</b> by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E

40|$|This study {{detected}} <b>procedural</b> <b>errors</b> {{created by}} rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments during root canal preparation by two imaging methods. Forty extracted human maxillary and mandibular molars were divided randomly {{into two groups}} and treated by two endodontists (n= 10) and two undergraduate dental students (n= 10). The ProTaper UniversalTM Rotary System was used to shape the canals {{and then they were}} filled using AH PlusTM sealer and gutta-percha. Periapical radiographs (PR) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were obtained and two examiners, who evaluated them to verify the occurrence of <b>procedural</b> <b>errors</b> (fractured instruments, perforations, and canal transportation). The Chi-square test at 0. 05 level of significance was used for statistical analyses. There were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the imaging methods. In the analysis of <b>procedural</b> <b>errors,</b> {{there was no significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) between the groups of operators (endodontists vs. students) nor between tooth groups (maxillary molars vs. mandibular molars). In view of the low incidence of <b>procedural</b> <b>errors</b> during root canal preparation performed by students the introduction of rotary NiTi instruments has potential in undergraduate teaching. PR and CBCT permitted the detection of <b>procedural</b> <b>errors,</b> but the CBCT images offer more recourse for diagnosis...|$|R

Following a public outcry and {{objection}} by the New South Wales Corrective Services Minister, John Robertson, his release {{was put on}} hold, pending another parole hearing. In the New South Wales Supreme Court, that decision was quashed due to the Parole Authority making a <b>procedural</b> <b>error.</b> Lim was freed from Parramatta Correctional Centre on 1 March 2010 into the custody of immigration officers.

25|$|The term {{procedural}} impropriety {{was used}} by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GHCQ case", 1984) to explain that a public authority could be acting ultra vires (that is, beyond the power given to it by statute) if it commits a serious <b>procedural</b> <b>error.</b> His Lordship regarded procedural impropriety as one of three broad categories of judicial review, the other two being illegality and irrationality. Procedural impropriety generally encompasses two things: procedural ultra vires, where administrative decisions are challenged because a decision-maker has overlooked or failed to properly observe statutory procedural requirements; and common law rules of natural justice and fairness. United Kingdom administrative law has {{played a significant role}} in helping to shape Singapore law in this area, given the weight accorded to UK cases by the courts in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the <b>procedural</b> <b>error</b> and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a Christian {{organization}} {{asked to}} ban caricatures {{published by the}} satirical magazine La Grosse Bertha. One of its covers represented the Christ dying with the inscription: I suck was his name by Robert Obscene and Alain Porno from the Acadébite (a play on the words Academy and penis), on inside page a cartoon with the Christ saying Why have you forsaken Me Jerk? and the apostles {{at the foot of}} the cross carrying banners: pension forced to 33 years, Job insecurity, in back page, a drawing titled miscellaneous news item illustrated with a disemboweled slept naked woman a crucifix crashed in the vagina and on another cover under the title: the Pope at the transvestites, a drawing representing Pope John-Paul II sodomized by a transvestite who exclaims: welcome to Brazil. The courts of first instance and appeal decided that they didn't constituted an incitement to hatred towards the Catholics. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the first court of appeal had made a <b>procedural</b> <b>error,</b> and referred the matter back to another court which confirmed the absence of conviction decided by the lower courts and considered that mockery of the Catholic religion, the faiths, the symbols and the rites of the religious practice had not caused any state of mind for incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence and was no justification to restrict the liberty of the press.|$|E
25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and leadout man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the leadout man finished in second place right behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime leadout man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish was definitely not giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a <b>procedural</b> <b>error</b> {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages did anything to dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E

The books [...] "For the Sake of Example" [...] (1983) by Babington and [...] "Shot at Dawn" [...] (1989) by Sykes & Putkowski were openly intended {{to start a}} campaign for pardons. This campaign was rejected in February 1993 {{because there was no}} evidence of <b>procedural</b> <b>error</b> (i.e. they had been correctly convicted according to the law at the time) and it was felt not right to impose modern values on to the past. The case was rejected again in 1998 after a detailed two-year review, which found [...] "no white cases, very many black cases and a handful of grey cases" [...] in which medical evidence was ignored or not called. The decisions were reversed by the Government in 2006 and all men given pardons and recognised as victims of World War I.

2500|$|Turning to the {{particular}} facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant <b>procedural</b> <b>error.</b> [...] He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and [...] "thoroughly documented his reasoning." [...] In particular, the judge did not ignore {{the seriousness of the}} offense. [...] To be sure, he did not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. [...] Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. [...] "It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative." [...] Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case promotes respect for the law. [...] Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. [...] Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, [...] "a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing." [...] Finally, Gall understandably received a more lenient sentence because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{process of}} {{cleaning}} and shaping the canal {{is not an}} easy goal to obtain, as canal curvature played a significant role during the instrumentation of the curved canals. Aim: The present in vivo study was conducted to evaluate <b>procedural</b> <b>errors</b> during the preparation of curved root canals using hand Nitiflex and rotary K 3 XF instruments. Materials and Methods: <b>Procedural</b> <b>errors</b> such as ledge formation, instrument separation, and perforation (apical, furcal, strip) were determined in sixty patients, divided into two groups. In Group I, thirty teeth in thirty patients were prepared using hand Nitiflex system, and in Group II, thirty teeth in thirty patients were prepared using K 3 XF rotary system. The evaluation was done clinically as well as radiographically. The results recorded from both groups were compiled and put to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test was used to compare the <b>procedural</b> <b>errors</b> (instrument separation, ledge formation, and perforation). Results: In the present study, both hand Nitiflex and rotary K 3 XF showed ledge formation and instrument separation. Although ledge formation and instrument separation by rotary K 3 XF file system was less as compared to hand Nitiflex. No perforation was seen in both the instrument groups. Conclusion: Canal curvature played a significant role during the instrumentation of the curved canals. <b>Procedural</b> <b>errors</b> such as ledge formation and instrument separation by rotary K 3 XF file system were less as compared to hand Nitiflex...|$|R
