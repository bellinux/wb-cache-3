5|$|In rural areas, one <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{some were}} for years {{under the control}} of the MPLA-government, while others were {{controlled}} by UNITA. Some of the population fled to neighbouring countries, while others went into remote mountainous areas.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> despite {{economic}} resurgence, {{the state}} hardly received higher income. another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the modest {{capacity of the}} domestic industry was reaching its limits. Further investments and foreign capital were required to install new capabilities and continue with economic growth and recovery. This led to increased dependency on foreign loans and investments.|$|R
40|$|This study {{surveyed}} the problems 213 university students confronted while viewing an online video-based English program. Data were collected through self-reports and one-to-one interviews. The content analysis approach was used. Totally, 18 <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> identified and categorized into three cognitive-processing stages: perception, parsing, and utilization. Percentages for each <b>problem</b> <b>were</b> {{calculated for the}} whole group and for the three English proficiency groups. The whole group results indicated that most comprehension problems occurred at the perception stage, and that the most common perception <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the speech rate was too fast. The most common parsing <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the participants failed to form a mental representation {{of what they had}} heard or read, while the most common utilization <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they could not assign the intended meanings to words. Each proficiency group’s problems at the three cognitive stages were interpreted. Instructional recommendations to enhance learners’ video comprehension are presented...|$|R

5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{any small}} {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a sizeable {{number of individuals}} do not fit neatly into one category or another. Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability {{in the types of}} difficulties they experience.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{amplification}} {{system used}} in Nova and other high-power lasers of its era was limited {{in terms of}} power density and pulse length. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the amplifier glass responded {{over a period of}} time, not instantaneously, and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the high power densities led to the same sorts of self-focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs, but at such a magnitude that even measures like spatial filtering would not be enough, in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air.|$|R

25|$|A {{particular}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of non-response.

25|$|The other <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while radio {{transmissions}} can be broadcast in all directions, lasers are highly directional.
