5|$|Lisa {{suggests}} that Bart <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> is injured {{to get out}} of quarterbacking, which he eagerly does, but Homer claims that without Bart the team must forfeit. This causes Bart to become angry and quit the team. The next game, Nelson is made quarterback again and the team wins, but Homer has nobody to celebrate with and becomes lonely. Afterwards, Homer finds Bart and persuades him to rejoin the team. The next day, during the championship game, the score is tied when Chief Wiggum comes to arrest Nelson. Bart decides to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> is Nelson and the team finally wins the championship.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{had been}} uninvolved in the {{upbringing}} {{of all his}} children. This provided producers with scope to introduce estranged family members. In 2006, writers devised a long-running storyline in-which Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) plans a revenge campaign against his father. Robert's motives for his vendetta stem from Paul not being around while he grew up. Paul was happy that he had triplet children Elle, Robert and Cameron Robinson (also played by Hunter) back in his life. He tries to make amends with Robert and attempts to bond with him unaware that he is being plotted against. Writers decided to mark the show's 5000th episode with the story and Robert takes Paul hostage down a mineshaft. Dennis filmed the scenes in a filthy studio set surrounded by cameras, lighting and crew. He told Herbison (Inside Soap) that he {{found it difficult to}} <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> was trapped underground.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E
500|$|Griffin read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf {{when he was}} 14, and [...] "found all but one chapter {{extremely}} boring". He {{joined the}} National Front in 1974, {{while he was still}} 14, though he had to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> was 15, and at the age of 16 is reported to have stayed at the home of National Front organiser Martin Webster. In a four-page leaflet written in 1999, Webster claimed to have had a homosexual relationship with Griffin, then the BNP's publicity director. Griffin has denied any such relationship.|$|E
500|$|When Clayton first {{joined the}} fledgling U2, {{he did not}} have formal {{training}} in the bass. In the band's early years, he generally played simple parts in 4/4 time, usually strings of steady 8th notes. Bono said of Clayton's early bass playing, [...] "Adam used to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> could play bass. He came round and started using words like 'action' and 'fret' and he had us baffled. He had the only amplifier, so we never argued with him. We thought this guy must be a musician; he knows what he's talking about. And then one day, we discovered he wasn't playing the right notes. That's what's wrong, y'know?" [...] His style has remained subtle and primarily supportive, but gradually become more sophisticated by integrating elements of Motown R and reggae and by offering more variety in his basslines.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) nanny {{publishes a}} tell-all book, {{revealing}} {{that he has}} never actually had an affair with anyone, a secret he had shared only with Jack in [...] "The Ones". In order to restore his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business {{to spend more time with}} a stripper, but no one is convinced. To make matters worse, women begin to come forward and admit that they did not have sex with Tracy. His wife Angie even advises him to have an affair in order to save his career, a suggestion which Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) urges him to take seriously. Tracy attempts to proposition Liz, but is unable to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> wants to cheat on his wife. Liz rebuffs Tracy's advances, admitting she envies his happy marriage and urging him to embrace his monogamy.|$|E
500|$|The Griffins {{prepare to}} return to Quahog, where Peter faces the {{prospect}} of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming {{there is no room}} for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (Ã  la fighting between Peter and The Giant Chicken) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, then end up in Kang and Kodos' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing [...] "I will not think about Bart anymore" [...] several times on a chalkboard.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Christopher Connelly called Thriller [...] "a zesty LP" [...] with a [...] "harrowing, dark message". He compared {{the songs on}} the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall, while observing that he [...] "dropped the boyish falsetto" [...] and was facing his [...] "challenges head-on" [...] with [...] "a feisty determination" [...] and [...] "a full, adult voice". John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a [...] "sometimes too practiced ... performer", that at times Quincy Jones may [...] "depersonalize his individuality" [...] with his [...] "slightly anonymous production", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind [...] "layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils". He nonetheless deemed Thriller [...] "a wonderful pop record, the latest statement {{by one of the}} great singers in popular music today" [...] and that there are [...] "hits here, too, lots of them". Rockwell believed it helped breach [...] "the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music", especially as [...] "white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> isn't black after all". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway". He later wrote in retrospect, [...] "what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure." [...] A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, [...] "The pulse of America and {{much of the rest of}} the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'." [...] In 1989, Toronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of [...] "commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit." [...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world, a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection".|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, McKay {{wrote to}} Prime Minister Hughes {{on the subject}} of wages boards and {{collective}} bargaining, stating [...] "I do not agree with the basic wage for the Commonwealth. In {{other parts of the world}} it is a minimum wage for the minimum man and a maximum wage for the maximum man - each man according to his ability and capacity. God did not make men equal - it is no use trying to <b>pretend</b> <b>He</b> did, or to make laws as though He did, or to pay people according to their requirements instead of according to their services." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 April 2008, it was {{announced}} that DNA evidence confirmed Josef as the biological father of his daughter's children. Josef's defence lawyer, Rudolf Mayer, said that although the DNA test proved incest, evidence was still needed for the allegations of rape and enslavement. In their 1 May 2008 daily press conference, Austrian police said that Josef had forced Elisabeth to write a letter the previous year indicating that he may have been planning to release her and the children. The letter said that she wanted to come home but [...] "it's not possible yet". Police believe Fritzl intended to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> had rescued his daughter from her fictitious cult. Police spokesman Franz Polzer said police planned to interview at least 100 people who had lived as tenants in the Fritzl apartment building in the previous 24 years.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with WWE Magazine, Vince McMahon discussed Benoit's legacy saying [...] "it's not right to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> didn't exist. It's {{one thing to}} include him {{as part of a}} historical perspective, which I believe is okay, and it's another thing to promote him, which is not okay. The situation is very similar to that of O.J. Simpson despite his controversy, O.J. was still a part of the NFL scene. You can't deny that he existed." [...] In 2015, Benoit's name was mentioned as part of the WWE Network Monday Night Wars series that looks back at the fall of WCW. This marked the first time Benoit was mentioned by name on new WWE programming since 2007. The segment featured the 2000 invasion angle with Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn however when the footage was shown it focused more on the other three and less on Benoit.|$|E

2500|$|As a songwriter, Gibb contributed {{primarily}} to melody, {{with his brothers}} writing the lyrics that they would sing on the finished song (for the most part). It is difficult to identify his contributions because the songs were so shaped to the singer, but his brothers' continued writing collaboration with him on solo projects shows how much they relied on him. He was sometimes known as [...] "the quiet one" [...] for his less obvious contributions to the group, but privately {{he was a good}} teller of stories, who immensely enjoyed talking with fans. His reputation as a mild-mannered, stabilising influence with two very ambitious brothers continued through his life. His comic personality shone on stage during Bee Gees concerts when the brothers would perform an acoustic medley. Many times during the song [...] "Holiday", Maurice would mock Robin while he was singing or <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> was bored (Maurice did not sing on the original record).|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1964, Nilsen {{passed his}} initial {{catering}} exam and was officially {{assigned to the}} 1st Battalion the Royal Fusiliers in OsnabrÃ¼ck, West Germany, where {{he served as a}} private. In this deployment, Nilsen began to increase his intake of alcohol; he described himself and his colleagues as a [...] "hard-working, boozy lot", although his colleagues would recollect he often drank to excess in order to ease his shyness. On one occasion, Nilsen and a German youth drank themselves into a stupor. When Nilsen awoke, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} German youth's flat. Although no sexual activity had occurred, this incident fuelled Nilsen's fantasies: he began to develop sexual fantasies which initially involved his sexual partner â invariably a young, slender male â being completely passive. These fantasies would gradually evolve into his partner being completely unconscious or dead. On several occasions, Nilsen also made tentative efforts to have his own prone body sexually interfered with by one of his colleagues. In these instances, whenever he and his colleagues would drink to excess, he would <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> was inebriated in the hope one of his colleagues would make sexual use of his supposedly unconscious body.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{then moves}} to 1945. Sarafina comes to see Vito, {{telling him that}} Aldo has fallen in with a bad crowd. Vito sends Luca Brasi (Garry Chalk) to find Aldo and recruit him into the family. After {{teaching}} Aldo how to fight and get protection money, Brasi sends him to meet Paulie Gatto (Tony Alcantar), who introduces him to, Marty [...] "Monk" [...] Malone (Jason Schombing). Gatto has been assigned to take revenge {{on a group of}} men who attacked the daughter of an undertaker, Bonasera, a friend of Vito's. Gatto, Monk and Aldo beat up the gang, and Aldo then joins Brasi on a mission to meet with Bruno Tattaglia (Joe Paulino) and Virgil Sollozzo (Richard Newman). Several days previously, Vito refused to enter the cocaine trade with Sollozzo. Knowing that Sollozzo feels insulted by this refusal, Vito is concerned about retribution, and has sent Brasi to <b>pretend</b> <b>he</b> is discontented working for the Corleones, and wishes to join the Tattaglia family, who are supporting Sollozzo. However, Bruno and Sollozzo kill Brasi, witnessed by Aldo through a window. He flees, meeting Monk and his sister, Frankie (Jennifer Copping). As Aldo explains what happened, there is an attempted hit on Vito nearby. Aldo ensures Frankie is safe, before helping Fredo (Andrew Moxham) get Vito to the hospital.|$|E
