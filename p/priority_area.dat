25|$|As Cold War {{tensions}} rose {{still further}} during the 1950s, restrictions {{were placed on}} travel between the Soviet sector (East Berlin) and the western sectors (West Berlin). For {{the second time in}} its history, the Potsdam Gate (or what remained of it), was like a dividing line between two different worlds. Lying on this invisible frontier, Potsdamer Platz was no longer an important destination for Berliners. Similarly, neither East Berlin nor West Berlin regarded their half as a <b>priority</b> <b>area</b> for redevelopment, seeking instead to distance themselves from the traditional heart of the city and develop two new centres for themselves, well away from the troubled border zone. West Berlin inevitably chose the Kurfürstendamm and the area around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, while East Berlin built up Alexanderplatz and turned Frankfurter Allee (which they renamed Stalinallee in 1949, Karl-Marx-Allee in 1961), into their own showpiece boulevard. Potsdamer Platz, meanwhile, was more or less left to rot, as one by one the ruined buildings were cleared away, neither side having the will to repair or replace them. On the western side things did improve later on with the development of the Cultural Forum, whose site roughly equates with the former Millionaires' Quarter.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a <b>priority</b> <b>area,</b> with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had {{come to be known as}} a “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.|$|E

In this study, we searched for ‘‘hot spots’’ of amphibians in these two regions and assessed whether the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> established by the MMA coincided with those suitable for amphibian conservation. We determined amphibian hot spots by means of three estimates: areas of endemism, areas of high species richness, and areas with species that are threatened, rare, or have very limited distributions. We then assessed the degree of coincidence between amphibian hot spots and the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> of the MMA based on the current conservation units. We analyzed areas of endemism {{with the use of a}} parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) on quadrats. The Caatinga biome and semiarid region showed four and six areas of endemism, respectively, mainly associated with mountainous areas that are covered by isolated forests and positively correlated with species richness.

40|$|The {{approach}} of ecosystem services has shown promise {{for the evaluation}} of interactions between ecosystems and society, integrating environmental and socioeconomic concepts which require interdisciplinary knowledge. However, its usefulness in decision making is limited due to information gaps. This study was therefore developed in order to contribute to the application of principles of ecosystem services in the decision-making for water resources management. It aims to identify procedures and methodologies used for decision-making in order to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> to be included in projects or compensation programs for environmental services. To do so, we searched technical and scientific literature describing methods and experiences used to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas.</b> Key steps in the process of selecting <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> were identified; then a survey was conducted of the procedures adopted for each key step considering the literature selected; and, finally, the information collected was analyzed and classified. Considering the study’s sample, we noted that the selection of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> was based on the direct use of predetermined criteria. The use of indicators and spatial analyses are practices still scarcely employed. We must highlight, however, that most of the analyzed documents did not aim to describe the process of selecting <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in detail, which may have resulted in some omissions. Although these conditions may limit the analysis in this study, the results presented here allow us to identify the main objectives, actions and criteria used to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for programs or compensation projects for environmental services...|$|R

40|$|Policies and {{research}} increasingly {{focus on the}} protection of ecosystem services (ESs) through priority-area conservation. <b>Priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ESs should be identified based on ES capacity and ES demand and account for the connections between areas of ES capacity and demand (flow) resulting in areas of unique demand-supply connections (flow zones). We tested ways to account for ES demand and flow zones to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in the European Union. We mapped the capacity and demand of a global (carbon sequestration), a regional (flood regulation), and 3 local ESs (air quality, pollination, and urban leisure). We used Zonation software to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ESs based on 6 tests: with and without accounting for ES demand and 4 tests that accounted for the effect of ES flow zone. There was only 37. 1 % overlap between the 25 % of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> that encompassed the most ESs with and without accounting for ES demand. The level of ESs maintained in the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> increased from 23. 2 % to 57. 9 % after accounting for ES demand, especially for ESs with a small flow zone. Accounting for flow zone had a small effect on the location of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> and level of ESs maintained but resulted in fewer flow zones without ES maintained relative to ignoring flow zones. Accounting for demand and flow zones enhanced representation and distribution of ESs with local to regional flow zones without large trade-offs relative to the global ES. We found that ignoring ES demand led to the identification of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in remote regions where benefits from ES capacity to society were small. Incorporating ESs in conservation planning should therefore always account for ES demand to identify an effective priority network for ESs...|$|R
40|$|Grasslands provide many {{ecosystem}} services required to support human well-being and {{are home to}} a diverse fauna and flora. Degradation of grasslands due to agriculture {{and other forms of}} land use threaten biodiversity and {{ecosystem services}}. Various efforts are underway around the world to stem these declines. The Grassland Programme in South Africa is one such initiative and is aimed at safeguarding both biodiversity and ecosystem services. As part of this developing programme, we identified spatial <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ecosystem services, tested the effect of different target levels of ecosystem services used to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas,</b> and evaluated whether biodiversity <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> can be aligned with those for ecosystem services. We mapped five ecosystem services (below ground carbon storage, surface water supply, water flow regulation, soil accumulation and soil retention) and identified <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for individual ecosystem services and for all five services at the scale of quaternary catchments. Planning for individual ecosystem services showed that, depending on the ecosystem service of interest, between 4 % and 13 % of the grassland biome was required to conserve at least 40 % of the soil and water services. Thirty-four percent of the biome was needed to conserve 40 % of the carbon service in the grassland. <b>Priority</b> <b>areas</b> identified for five ecosystem services under three target levels (20 %, 40 %, 60 % of the total amount) showed that between 17 % and 56 % of the grassland biome was needed to conserve these ecosystem services. There was moderate to high overlap between <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> selected for ecosystem services and already-identified terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity <b>priority</b> <b>areas.</b> This level of overlap coupled with low irreplaceability values obtained when planning for individual ecosystem services makes it possible to combine biodiversity and ecosystem services in one plan using systematic conservation planning...|$|R
