5|$|The {{imperial}} <b>pheasant</b> {{is a rare}} bird {{found in}} the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to show that this <b>pheasant,</b> previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese <b>pheasant</b> Lophura hatinhensis and the subspecies annamensis of the silver <b>pheasant</b> L. nycthemera.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Beebe's {{return from}} this expedition, Anthony Kuser {{requested}} that Beebe produce a condensed, popular {{version of his}} <b>pheasant</b> monograph. The book which resulted from this, titled Pheasants: their Lives and Homes (also known by the title Pheasants of the World), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal. During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the <b>pheasant</b> expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled <b>Pheasant</b> Jungles about his adventures during this expedition. While A Monograph of the Pheasants had been a factual account of this expedition, <b>Pheasant</b> Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience in order {{to appeal to a}} wider audience.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} effects of castration on plasma lipids and on the fatty acid profile of abdominal fat in male <b>pheasants.</b> Thirty <b>pheasants</b> reared in a commercial pheasantry were included in the experiment. Half the <b>pheasants</b> were castrated at 8 weeks of age and the other half underwent sham surgery at the same age. Plasma levels of triglycerides and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were significantly higher in the castrated <b>pheasants.</b> Values for cholesterol tended to be higher in castrated <b>pheasants</b> although without statistical significance. The fatty acid content of the abdominal fat from castrated and intact <b>pheasants</b> were primarily composed of oleic acid (42. 58 %- 40. 33 %), followed by palmitic acid (25. 25 %- 27. 33 %), linoleic (14. 05 %- 12. 65 %) and stearic acid (8. 95 %- 9. 40 %). Castration also significantly influenced the fatty acid composition of abdominal fat. Compared to the intact <b>pheasants,</b> the fatty acid content of abdominal fat from castrated <b>pheasants</b> contained higher values for saturated fatty acids (SFA) and lower values for unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio (UFA/SFA) and polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio (PUFA/SFA) ...|$|R

5|$|The breed {{has been}} used to hunt <b>pheasant</b> and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover, and {{although}} the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina. The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game.|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, apricot, and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common <b>pheasant,</b> crane, and {{various types of}} fish were commonly consumed meats.|$|E
5|$|The woods were coppiced on {{rotation}} {{throughout the}} years with the timber being sold to local tanneries.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{castration}} on growth performance, carcass characteristics and chemical composition of m. iliotibilais cranialis and m. pectoralis superficialis of <b>pheasants</b> were examined. Forty <b>pheasants</b> reared in commercial pheasantry {{were included in}} the experiment. Half of the <b>pheasants</b> were castrated at 8 weeks of age. Values for live weight tended to be higher in castrated <b>pheasants</b> in the 24 th week (P< 0. 1) and values for weight gain were significantly higher between the 16 th and 24 th weeks (P< 0. 05). Feed-to-gainratio (8 th – 32 nd week) was significantly better (P< 0. 05) in castrated <b>pheasants.</b> Eviscerated weight and dressing percentage at 32 nd week were not significantly different between treatments. The chemical composition of m. iliotibilais cranialis and m. pectoralis superficialis showed significantly higher values of fat (P< 0. 01) and moisture (P< 0. 05) in castrated <b>pheasants</b> in comparison with intact ones. Protein content of both muscles was higher in intact <b>pheasants</b> (P< 0. 05). Body part weights were not influenced by the treatment with the exception of heart weight, which was significantly higher in the intact <b>pheasants</b> (P< 0. 05). We concluded that castration tended to improve growth performance only in the first 24 weeks of the fattening period and, therefore, continuation of fattening after that period is no longer feasible. The most important characteristic of the castrated <b>pheasant’s</b> meat was an increased amount of fat. More studies under different feeding and alternative breeding systems are necessary to improve production...|$|R

5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the <b>pheasant</b> pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common.

Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with <b>Pheasant</b> and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead <b>Pheasant</b> and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
