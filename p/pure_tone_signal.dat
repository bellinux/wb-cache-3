40|$|Detection of a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> in a {{narrowband}} noise masker can {{be improved}} {{by the introduction of}} coherently amplitude modulated masker bands in neighboring frequency regions, an effect called comodulation masking release (CMR). Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that detection of a spectrally complex signal in a comodulated masker critically depends on the signal∕masker interaction, with best sensitivity in conditions where the signal introduces across-frequency stimulus envelope differences. Consistent with this hypothesis, thresholds for a multi-frequency signal differed by approximately 10 dB depending on the relative patterns of signal∕masker interaction across frequency. In comodulated maskers, there was no improvement in threshold relative to the single-frequency signal threshold even in cases where the multi-frequency signal introduced across-frequency envelope differences. Experiment 2 tested conditions that have previously been associated with large spectral integration in comodulated but not random maskers. Results depended on the masker configuration used as the reference condition, with comparable integration for random and comodulated noise in some cases. The results suggest that CMR obtained with a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> can differ greatly from that obtained with a complex signal, and that spectral integration is inversely related to the amount of CMR under some conditions...|$|E
40|$|Comodulation masking release (CMR) {{enhances the}} {{detection}} of signals embedded in wideband, amplitude-modulated maskers. At {{least part of the}} CMR is attributable to acrossfrequency processing, however, the relative contribution of different stages in the auditory system to across-frequency processing is unknown. We have measured the responses of single units from one of the earliest stages in the ascending auditory pathway, the ventral cochlear nucleus, where across frequency processing may take place. A sinusoidally amplitudemodulated tone at the best frequency of each unit was used as a masker. A <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> was added in the dips of the masker modulation (reference condition). Flanking components (FCs) were then added at frequencies remote from the unit best frequency. The FCs were pure tones amplitude modulated either in phase (comodulated) or out of phase (codeviant) wit...|$|E
40|$|Detection {{threshold}} for a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> centered {{in a narrow}} band of noise may be reduced by inclusion of additional flanking masker bands, provided that they share coherent amplitude modulation (AM) across frequency. This comodulation masking release (CMR) associated with coherent AM across frequency is often much smaller if the signal and on-signal masker are presented to one ear and the flanking masker band(s) are presented contralaterally. An experiment was carried out to explore the role of peripheral effects (e. g., suppression) and central effects (e. g., grouping) in this finding. As frequently reported, CMR was smaller when two or more flanking maskers were presented contralaterally to the signal than when presented ipsilaterally. An intermediate condition, where a subset of flanking maskers was presented to each ear, provided comparable benefit to presenting all flankers ipsilateral to the signal. This result suggests that central effects may {{play a significant role}} in the reduced dichotic CMR under some conditions...|$|E

Two tuning forks of the same frequency are stricken and kept {{at a distance of}} 25 cm from each ear. When asked, the individual will claim to hear it in the normal ear. Then, the tuning fork is brought as close as 8 cm near the feigned ear while maintaining the tuning fork at the normal side at the same distance. The individual will deny hear anything if he/she is a malingerer. An individual with true deafness should continue to hear the sound on the normal side.

The first, like the crayfish experiment, consisted of a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> pressure <b>signal</b> at 23 Hz in a broadband noise background of varying intensities. A power spectrum analysis of the signals yielded maximum SNR for a noise intensity equal to 25 times the signal stimulus resulting in a maximum increase of 600% in SNR. 14 cells in 12 animals were tested, and all showed an increased SNR at a particular level of noise, meeting the requirements for the occurrence of stochastic resonance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Individuals {{with normal}} hearing are {{generally}} able to discriminate au-ditory stimuli {{that have the}} same fundamental frequency but different spectral content. This study concerns to what extent {{it is possible to}} perform the same dif-ferentiation considering vibratory tactile stimuli. Three perceptual experiments have been carried out in an attempt to compare discrimination thresholds in terms of spectral differences between auditory and vibratory tactile stimulations. The first test consists of assessing the subject’s ability in discriminating between three signals with distinct spectral content. The second test focuses on the measure-ment of the discrimination threshold between a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> and a signal composed of two pure tones, varying the amplitude and frequency of the second tone. Finally, in the third test the discrimination threshold is measured between a tone with even harmonic components and a tone with odd ones. The results show that it is indeed possible to discriminate between haptic signals having the same fundamental frequency but different spectral. The threshold of sensitivity for detection is markedly less than for audio stimuli. ...|$|E
40|$|The present studies {{examined}} the binaural masking level difference (MLD) for off-frequency masking. It {{has been shown}} previously that the MLD decreases steeply with increasing spectral separation between a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> and a 10 -Hz wide band of masking noise. Data collected here show that this reduction in the off-frequency MLD {{as a function of}} signal∕masker separation is comparable at 250 and 2500 Hz, indicating that neither interaural phase cues nor frequency resolution are critical to this finding. The MLD decreases more gradually with spectral separation when the masker is a 250 -Hz-wide band of noise, a result that implicates the rate of inherent amplitude modulation of the masker. Thresholds were also measured for a brief signal presented coincident with a local masker modulation minimum or maximum. Sensitivity was better in the minima for all NoSπ and off-frequency NoSo conditions, with little or no effect of signal position for on-frequency NoSo conditions. Taken together, the present results indicate that the steep reduction in the off-frequency MLD for a narrowband noise masker is due at least in part to envelope cues in the NoSo conditions. There was no evidence of a reduction in binaural cue quality for off-frequency masking...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{permanent}} noise-induced hearing loss on the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the micromechanical properties of cochlear hair cell stereocilia in guinea pigs was investigated. The threshold of {{movement of the}} stereocilia was measured by applying force from a fluid filled pipette. After exposure to a 1. 0 kHz <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> at 105 dB(A) for 72 h {{the threshold of the}} ABR was broadly elevated by approximately 50 dB. Inner hair cell stereocilia showed a decrease in threshold while the outer hair cell stereocilia bundles remained unaltered. This effect was localized to the 13 - 15 mm distance from the stapes corresponding to the region of maximal stimulation. The effect was recorded within 1 h of exposure and remained constant with exposures up to 7 days. Following a one month recovery period from sound exposure, normal threshold values of stereocilia movement were observed, indicating recovery. At this time, swelling of the afferent dendrites beneath the inner hair cells was observed throughout the cochlea together with approximately 30 % scattered loss of outer hair cells in the 13 to 15 mm region. The ABR showed some recovery (approximately 20 dB), yet a threshold shift remained...|$|E
40|$|Overestimation of {{loudness}} change typically {{occurs in}} response to up-ramp auditory stimuli (increasing intensity) relative to down-ramps (decreasing intensity) matched on frequency, duration, and end-level. In the experiment reported, forward masking is used to investigate a sensory component of up-ramp overestimation: persistence of excitation after stimulus presentation. White-noise and synthetic vowel 3. 6 s up-ramp and down-ramp maskers were presented over two regions of intensity change (40 - 60 dB SPL, 60 - 80 dB SPL). Three participants detected 10 ms 1. 5 kHz <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals</b> presented at masker-offset to signal-offset delays of 10, 20, 30, 50, 90, 170 ms. Masking magnitude was significantly greater {{in response to}} up-ramps compared with down-ramps for masker-signal delays {{up to and including}} 50 ms. When controlling for an end-level recency bias (40 - 60 dB SPL up-ramp vs 80 - 60 dB SPL down-ramp), the difference in masking magnitude between up-ramps and down-ramps was not significant at each masker-signal delay. Greater sensory persistence in response to up-ramps is argued to have minimal effect on perceptual overestimation of loudness change when response biases are controlled. An explanation based on sensory adaptation is discussed. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system is}} the toto[of organs that translates an acoustical signal into the perception of a sound. An acoustic signal is a vibration. It is decribed by physical parameters. The perception of sound is the awareness of a signal being present and the attribution of certain qualities to this awareness. These qualities are called percepts. Examples of percepts are pitchr loudness and timbre. The percepts reflect {{the way in which}} the auditory system analyses and processes acoustic signals. Hence they also determine the most useful ways of describing the signals in physical terms. Frequency analysis is one of the most important processes involved in hearing. It is described in mathematical form by Fourier theory. This theory states that every repetitive signal can be described uniquely as a sum of sine waves. These sine waves are called frequency components. The elementary signal, therefore, consists of only one frequency component and is a sine-wave signal. The sine wave thus is also the elementary signal for our ear; we call the perception of this <b>signal</b> a <b>pure</b> <b>tone.</b> <b>Signals</b> consisting of more than one component are perceived as complex sounds...|$|R
40|$|Detection of <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals</b> in the {{presence}} of noise has been thoroughly studied. Most of these studies have used monaural presentation of audio stimuli. Also, studies testing alarm detection in {{the presence}} of noise are limited. In 2013, Karunarathne et al., conducted a study and found out that human listeners were able to detect an alarm in negative signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), as low as − 24 dB. This study aims to investigate the effects of presentation method and duration of the alarms on detection threshold. Eight conditions varied by presentation method (monaural vs spatial) and alarm duration were tested. Sixteen human subjects with normal hearing were given the task of identifying which one of two sound intervals contained an alarm along with 80 dBA pink noise. Thresholds were estimated as the 79. 4 % points on the psychometric functions, using adaptive 2 -Interval Forced Choice (2 IFC) procedure with a 3 -down 1 -up rule. Results indicated that detection thresholds were statistically significantly lower in spatial condition compared to monaural. The effect of alarm duration was not significant in both spatial and monaural conditions. Thresholds lower than − 30 dB SNR were observed in the spatial condition, which agreed with the findings of Karunarathne et al. and further extended threshold boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Masked {{detection}} threshold for a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> {{depends on the}} coherence of masker envelope fluctuation across frequency, with lower thresholds for coherent fluctuation under some conditions. The benefit of coherent masker modulation is larger for detection than for suprathreshold tasks, such as pure tone intensity discrimination [Hall, J. W. and Grose, J. H. (1995). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98, 847 – 852]. In the present study, sensitivity to increments in signal intensity was measured for a 1000 -Hz signal, either a tone or a 20 -Hz-wide narrowband noise. In one set of conditions the masker was one or more bands of noise, each 20 Hz wide, and in another set of conditions the masker was a single 1620 -Hz-wide band of Gaussian noise or noise multiplied by the envelope of a 20 -Hz bandpass noise. Coherent masker envelope fluctuation improved {{detection threshold}}s in all conditions. Intensity discrimination for a tonal standard in comodulated noise was elevated for standard levels near detection threshold and improved with increasing signal-to-noise ratio, whereas performance was uniformly poor across level for the noise standard. Results are most consistent with the interpretation that the reduced benefit of coherent masker modulation in suprathreshold intensity discrimination {{is due to the}} disruptive effects of envelope fluctuation...|$|E
40|$|Thresholds for {{detecting}} a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signal</b> masked by a coherently amplitude modulated masker (a comodulated masker) which {{extends beyond the}} critical band centered on the signal are generally lower than for {{the case of a}} narrow masker centered on the signal that does not extend beyond the critical band centered on the signal or the case of an unmodulated masker. This phenomenon is called comodulation masking release (CMR). Three experiments were carried out to examine various aspects of this CMR. Experiment One explored the role of auditory object formation (e. g., grouping) in CMR. In contrast with previous findings, grouping manipulations did not alter the magnitude of the CMR for maskers overlapping in frequency. Experiment Two attempted to discriminate between two basic classes of models of CMR, one based on on-going envelope comparisons across frequency and the other on the use of masker envelopes distant from the signal to cue times of improved signal-to-noise ratio at the signal frequency. Data support a cued listening model where modulation minima of maskers distant from the signal trigger sampling at the output of the auditory filter centered on the signal frequency. Experiment Three used a limited set of reproducible noise maskers to examine particular aspects of randomly modulated stimuli that might dictate the pattern of thresholds obtained. Thresholds were consistent with several single-channel models, as well as one of the across-frequency comparison models tested. The results from these three experiments, taken together, suggest that: (1) cues to grouping do not place a role in CMR when the masker bands are overlapping in frequency, (2) thresholds {{for detecting}} a pure tone masked by a comodulated masker are consistent with some form of obligatory cued listening, and (3) thresholds for detecting a pure tone masked by a randomly modulated masker are influenced by both within and between channel cues. ...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Prof. Dr. -Ing. habil. Helmut Fleischer on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday In Germany, reference time signals from an atomic clock are distributed via a long-wave radio station called DCF 77. As a rule, both radio clocks and wrist watches set their actual time as well as the switching between summer and winter time using the DCF 77. Apart from this service which started in the 1970 ties, more recently studies are underway how to use the spare bits of the time code for civil protection emergency signals. A possible realization could be that emergency signals are radiated from smoke detectors. In the framework of such a scenario, the suitability of different <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals</b> as emergency signals was studied in psychoacoustic experiments. The effects of different durations and repetition rates were assessed using the methods of random access as well as semantic differential. For the selection of the signals, the hearing ability in an ageing population was also taken into consideration. Moreover, signals were tailored in such a way to minimize possible confusions with other signals from alarm clocks, smoke detectors etc. In the lecture, signals will be presented acoustically: on the one hand, signals which are most suitable for the intended purpose, {{and on the other hand}} signals which are less appropriate...|$|R

The animals were trained only to respond when they detected an acoustic signal (“go/no-go” response). Detection thresholds were obtained for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals</b> (frequencies: 0. 2 – 40 kHz; durations: 0. 5 – 5000 ms, depending on the frequency; 59 frequency-duration combinations). Detection thresholds were quantified by varying the signal amplitude by the 1 -up, 1 -down staircase method, and were defined as the stimulus levels, resulting in a 50 % detection rate. The hearing thresholds of the two seals were similar for all frequencies except for 40 kHz, for which the thresholds differed by, on average, 3. 7 dB. There was an inverse relationship between the time constant (τ), derived from an exponential model of temporal integration, and the frequency [log(τ) = 2. 86 − 0. 94 [*]log(f);τ in ms and f in kHz]. Similarly, the thresholds increased when the pulse was shorter than ∼ 780  cycles (independent of the frequency). For pulses shorter than the integration time, the thresholds increased by 9 – 16 dB per decade reduction in the duration or number of cycles in the pulse. The {{results of this study}} suggest that most published hearing thresholds ≤ 1  kHz for harbor seals are probably not absolute, as they were derived from signals with durations shorter than the time constants for those frequencies...|$|R

For PT, the change in signal thresholds with vowel intensity is expected to be about 3 - 4 dB. These results would correspond with the results from the Tyler & Lindblom study.

40|$|Mentally retarded {{children}} demonstrate an abnormally {{high incidence}} of hearing impairment, and many, particularly those with IQs below 40, are difficult for audiologists to test. Consequently, there is great need among this population for investigating response modes and conditioning of responses to auditory stimuli. A {{review of the literature}} reveals no studies of echoic vocalization as a conditioned response mode to <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli among the retarded. In this study, a heterogenous sample of 13 moderately and severely retarded children ranging in age from 7 years 7 months to 16 years 3 months were compared on two response modes to suprathreshold <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals</b> of 500 and 4000 Hz: (1) dropping poker chips, and (2) echoic vocalization (EVR). All subjects received both treatments but were divided into Groups A and B, the former receiving Treatment One (object dropping) first, the latter receiving Treatment Two (EVR) first. Operant procedures combined social and tangible reinforcement in each treatment to achieve stimulus control without specific verbal instructions. EVR included two unusual stages: (1) conditioning of imitations to the experimenter’s vocalizations, usually /a/ and (2) conditioning of response transfer from vocal to <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli. Acquisition and extinction to first 500, then 4000 Hz proceeded sequentially within each treatment. Acquisition criterion for vocal and <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli was eight consecutive responses. Extinction criterion was failure to respond to six out of eight tonal stimuli following withdrawal of reinforcement. Eleven of the 13 children achieved acquisition criterion for both response modes, with only three of the older subjects encountering substantial difficulty in response transfer in Treatment Two. Differences in acquisition data between treatments were not significant. Three times as much extinction occurred with EVR in Treatment Two than with object dropping in Treatment One, but there was a tendency toward more false responses in the latter mode. Otherwise, data up to achievement of extinction criterion in the extinction phases did not differ significantly between treatments Order of presentation of treatment and frequency of the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli were not significant factors in the results. It was concluded that despite substantially greater occurrence of extinction following withdrawal of reinforcement as compared with object dropping, echoic vocalization response {{has been shown to be}} an effective, practical response mode to suprathreshold <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli among the children in this sample. It was recommended that further investigation with EVR be directed toward: (1) the feasibility of eliminating response transfer by use of verbal assistance and direct conditioning of EVR to pure tones; (2) if response transfer is necessary, comparison of older and younger retardates on that procedure; (3) the possibility of increasing resistance to extinction in EVR through visual reinforcement; (4) comparison of EVR and object dropping on threshold determination among MR children; (5) the practicability of paring EVR and object dropping response modes; and (6) investigation of other forms of both breath expulsion and breath inspiration as response modes to <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> stimuli among mentally retarded children...|$|R

40|$|Florida {{manatees}} (Trichechus manatus latirostris) {{live in the}} shallow, often turbid inland {{and coastal}} waters of the southeastern United States. Since their vision is poor (Bauer et al., 2003), other senses probably guide orientation. Previous {{studies have found that}} manatees can hear over 40 kHz (Gerstein et al., 1999) and have the capacity for rapid auditory temporal processing (Mann et al., 2005). However, it is not known if manatees have the ability to localize underwater sounds. Two Florida manatees were trained to identify underwater sound source locations using a four-choice discrimination paradigm. Three broad-band signals (0. 2 - 20, 6 - 20, and 0. 2 2 kHz) were tested at four durations (3, 000, 1, 000, 500, and 200 ms) and two tonal signals (4 and 16 kHz) were tested with a 3, 000 ms duration. A total of 1, 008 test trials were analyzed per subject. Both manatees learned the task easily, and could localize all of the test signals at a performance rate well above the 25 % chance level. Within all of the broad-band conditions, performance accuracy ranged from 93 % - 79 % for Buffett, and 93 % - 51 % for Hugh. Broad-band signal duration did not have an effect on performance accuracy with Buffett who ranged from 89 % to 87 %, but did with Hugh who ranged from 87 % - 58 %. Broad-band frequency type did not have an effect on performance accuracy with Buffett who averaged 90 %, 86 %, and 89 %, but may have with Hugh who averaged from 76 %, 68 %, and 65 % at the 0. 2 20, 6 20, and 0. 2 2 kHz conditions. Both animals performed above chance levels with the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>signals,</b> but at a much lower accuracy rate with Hugh at 49 % and 32 % and Buffett at 44 % and 33 % with the 4 kHz and 16 kHz conditions.

The effect of each signal was judged by comparing the animals¿ surfacing locations and number of surfacings (i. e. number of respirations) during test periods with those during baseline periods. In all cases, both porpoises {{moved away from the}} sound source, but the effect of the signals on respiration rates was negligible. Pulsed 70 kHz signals with a source level (SL) of 137 dB had a similar effect as a continuous 70 kHz signal with an SL of 148 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms). Also, a pulsed 70 kHz signal with an SL of 147 dB had a much stronger deterring effect than a continuous 70 kHz signal with a similar SL. For pulsed 70 kHz signals (2 s pulse duration, 4 s pulse interval, SL 147 dB re 1 ¿Pa, rms), the avoidance threshold sound pressure level (SPL), {{in the context of the}} present study, was estimated to be around 130 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 064 and around 124 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 047.

A long-term experience with hearing preservation surgery, with tumour size and hearing as admission criteria, was evaluated to assess which size and hearing allowed {{a high rate of}} success. The hearing outcome in relation to size of tumour and pre-operative hearing was retrospectively reviewed in a consecutive series of 115 cases of sporadic acoustic neuroma which were operated on with hearing preservation surgery. Inclusion criteria were hearing with ≤ 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and ≥ 70 % Speech Discrimination Score. The size was ≤ 15 mm in the first series of 51 cases, and ≤ 10 mm in the second series of 64 cases. Pre-operative and post-operative <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average were measured at 0. 5 to 4. 0 KHz, and speech discrimination score at ≤ 40 dB above perception. Post-operative hearing within 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and 70 % speech discrimination score was considered socially useful hearing and successful outcome. The change to 40 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and 60 % speech discrimination score from a pre-operative 30 <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 70 % speech discrimination score was considered an acceptable outcome. Patients with a tumour of ≤ 10 mm size in the cerebello-pontine-angle and hearing within 20 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 80 % speech discrimination score had a success rate of 76 %. Patients with hearing between the 20 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 80 % speech discrimination score and 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 70 % speech discrimination score had a success rate of 41 %, which increased to 53 % if the limit to success was set at 40 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 60 % speech discrimination score.

The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10Hz, that being the difference between the 530Hz and 520Hz <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> presented to each ear.|$|R
40|$|An {{internal}} flow self-sustained oscillation system, {{which consists of}} a two-dimensional duct {{and a pair of}} baffles inside, is investigated experimentally. This system produces a high amplitude <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> when certain flow and geometrical conditions are satisfied. The frequency of this generated tone seems to be determined by the longitudinal acoustic modes of the duct, while the dependence of <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> production on flow and geometrical conditions seems {{to be related to the}} interaction between vortex shedding and acoustic feed back mechanism. Some features on self-sustained oscillation systems are reviewed briefly and Rossiter's idea on the cavity tone system is applied for interpretation of the mechanism of the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> production. Flow visualization shows stable vortical structure of the flow between the baffles when a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> is produced...|$|R
40|$|Iznosi se važnost sistematskih audioloških pregleda školske populacije i, osobito, radnika koji rade u buci. Opisuje se jedan novi postupak grupnog tonalnog audiometriranja koji se u dosadašnjem iskušavanju pokazao koliko jednostavan i jeftin toliko osjetljiv i efikasan. Tim se postupkom ne samo pouzdano selekcioniraju mali i parcijalni slušni gubici nego se odmah dobija i orijentacijska slika tonalnog audiograma. Systematic {{examinations}} of hearing are indispensable {{especially when the}} populations of school children and workers exposed to noise are concerned. The latter should undergo regular check-ups every {{three to six months}} at the beginning and later at least once a year. So far this has been the only reliable method of discovening excessive sensitivity to noise and protecting workers from noise before their hearing is considerably impaired. As such audio-logical check-ups are rather expensive they are undertaken for the time being only for demonstration and research sake and do not make part of a routine procedure. The existing group audiometry which is baked on signals-numbers is not very useful for such systematic check-ups; it has two shortcomings: a) it does not register small and partial defficiencies typical for the initial stage of a hearing impairment and b) it does not provide us with a tonal audiogram on which audiology has based its criteria for the interpretation of the hearing status. This was the reason why we made up a kind of group tonal audiometry. While experimenting with this new procedure we realized that it was as simple to carry out as it was sensitive and efficient. The time usually needed for individual audiometry is here shortened up to fifty times: the whole testing procedure lasts about 25 minutes and about SO people can be tested at a time. The equipment needed for this new audiometry is extremely simple: a tape-recorder, a test-tape and a test-form (Fig. 1). On the test-tape are recorded the same (<b>pure</b> <b>tone)</b> <b>signals</b> the routine tonal audiometry uses (250, 500, 1 000, 2 000, 4 000, 6 000, 8 000 cycles). Each of these tones is recorded at seven different intensity levels (50 dB above the threshold, 40 dB, 30 dB, 20 dB, 10 dB, 5 dB and O dB). The decision on the number of impulses (1, 2 or 3) in each item is left to chance. The examinee is supposed to draw as many lines on the paper as there are impulses he can perceive. In case he does not make any mark or draws the wrong number of lines it will mean that he did not hear (Fig. 1). Before each signal is heard the number corresponding to the numbers on the form will be announced. This kind of audiometry can be carried out in any room or hall (classroom, conference hall etc), the only condition being that the stationary noise level should not exceed 35 phons. The signals are perceived directly from the tape-recorder without earphones. After having listened to the whole of the 12 minute long test the examinees are given the correct answers. They will encircle the wrong answers and make a cross in the »Audiogram«. The audiogram obtained by linking together the crosses is {{more or less the same}} as the one obtained in individual testing. It can serve very well not only as a »screening« test but also as a final picture of the hearing status which is accurate enough to enable a longitudinal observation of the hearing status of workers exposed to noise...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recent {{research}} suggests tinnitus is a phantom phenomenon based on hyperactivity of the auditory system, {{which can be}} visualized by functional neuroimaging, and transiently modulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We present {{the results of the}} first implanted electrodes on the primary and secondary auditory cortex after a successful TMS suppression. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients underwent an auditory cortex implantation, 10 for unilateral and 2 for bilateral tinnitus, based on > 50 % suppression applying TMS. Results were analyzed for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and white noise tinnitus. RESULTS: TMS results in 77 % <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and 67 % white noise reduction. Electrical stimulation via an implanted electrode results in a mean of 97 % <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and 24 % white noise suppression. Mean Visual Analogue Scale score decreases from 9. 5 to 1. 5 for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> and from 8. 8 to 6. 8 for white noise postoperatively. DISCUSSION: <b>Pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus might be the conscious percept of focal neuronal hyperactivity of the auditory cortex. Once visualized, this hyperactivity can be modulated by neurostimulation. CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of the first implantations suggest that patients with unilateral <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus are good surgical candidates for electrode implantation and permanent electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex, provided that the tinnitus is of recent origin and can be suppressed by TMS. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: This {{article is}} aimed at: 1. {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Bone conduction <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> thresholds and speech reception thresholds via bone conduction in normal patients; 2. studying the stability and repeatability of the speech reception thresholds via bone conduction and 3.

When meaning words are used in the test, mental power works together with the speech sound hearing, resulting in the test of the speech understanding, and not the determination of the true speech hearing. As the result of tests conducted on many cases of hearing difficulty, it was ascertained that <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> hearing, speech sound hearing and speech understanding do not come to the equal result, and that there exists no definite relation between the results obtained by the above three tests...|$|R
