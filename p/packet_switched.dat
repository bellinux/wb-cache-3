40|$|Our work is {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} design <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> with large aggregate capacity and fast line rates. In this paper, we consider building a <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> from multiple lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> operating independently and in parallel. In particular, we consider a (perhaps obvious) parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> (PPS) architecture in which arriving traffic is demultiplexed over identical lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> switched to the correct output port, then recombined (multiplexed) before departing from the system. Essentially, the <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> performs packet-by-packet load balancing, or inverse multiplexing, over multiple independent <b>packet</b> <b>switches.</b> Each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{at a fraction of the}} line rate. For example, each <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> can operate at rate. It is a goal of our work that all memory buffers in the PPS run slower than the line rate. Ideally, a PPS would share the benefits of an output-queued switch, i. e., the delay of individual packets could be precisely controlled, allowing the provision of guaranteed qualities of service.

40|$|This work employs an {{approximate}} Markov chain to analyze that a parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> (PPS) can emulate a first-come first-served (FCFS) output-queued (OQ) <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> only operating {{slower than the}} external line rate. The PPS comprises multiple <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> operating independently and in parallel. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of parallel center-stage switches with memory buffers running slower than the external line rate. Each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{at a fraction of}} the external line rate R. For example, each <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> can operate at internal line rate R/K, where K is the number of center-stage switches. This work presents a proposed novel Markov chain model successfully exhibits these performance characteristics for throughput, cell delay and cell drop rate. This novel Markov chain model extends from our previous paper [Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Performance analysis of the sliding-window parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 40 th International Conference on Communications 2005, ICC 2005, May 16 - 20, 2005; Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Evaluation and analysis of the sliding-window parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 19 th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, vol. 2, 2005, pp. 355 - 358]. Simulation comparison demonstrates that the chains are accurate for practical network loads. With the proposed model, major finding are that: (1) it is theoretically possible for the throughput and cell drop rates of a PPS to emulate those of a FCFS-OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> when each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates at a rate of approximately R/K, and, (2) this work also demonstrates that it is theoretically possible for the cell delay of a PPS to emulate that of FCFS-OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> when each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates at a rate of approximately (3 R/cell delay of FCFS-OQ switch). Additionally, this work develops and investigates a novel PIAO PPS which distributes cells or variable-length <b>packets</b> to center-stage <b>switches</b> and uses multiplexers with push-in arbitrary-out (PIAO) queues.
