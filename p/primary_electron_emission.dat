The purpose of this investigation is to provide information necessary to develop high-efficiency multistage depressed collectors (MDC's) for microwave amplifier traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) for communications and aircraft applications. To attain the highest TWT signal quality and overall efficiency, the MDC electrode surface must have low secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> characteristics.

This investigation was conducted to provide information that would improve the efficiency of multistage depressed collectors (MDC's) for microwave amplifier traveling wave tubes in space communications and aircraft applications. For high efficiency, MDC electrode surfaces must have low secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> characteristics. Although copper is a commonly used material for MDC electrodes, it exhibits relatively high levels of secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> if its surface is not treated for emission control.

The {{purpose of the}} investigation was to explore the feasibility of using titanium as electrode material in the multistage depressed collectors (MDC's) used in microwave amplifier traveling wave tubes (TWT's) for space communications and aircraft applications. Because of its relatively low density and thermal expansion characteristics and relatively high strength, thermal emissivity, and melting temperature, titanium presents itself as a possible candidate for the MDC electrode application. A {{detailed description of the}} method of ion texturing the titanium is included. Although the ion-treated surface considered in this study is not presented as being optimum from the standpoint of secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> suppression, it nevertheless serves to demonstrate that the surface can be modified by this procedure to significantly reduce these emission characteristics relative to those of the untreated surface.

Such MDC's are used in microwave amplifier traveling wave tubes for space communications and other applications. OFHC copper is the material most commonly used for MDC electrodes because it has high thermal conductivity, it is easy to machine, and its fabrication and brazing procedures are well established. However, its untreated surface displays relatively very high levels of secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emissions.</b> Textured OFHC copper samples were tested for true secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> and relative reflected <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> yield at <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> beam energy levels from 200 to 2000 eV and at direct (0 deg) to oblique (60 deg) beam impingement angles.

As higher critical heat flux cooling techniques are found, the operating power of the microwave device may be increased if other limiting factors are not of importance.

During these brief periods, temporary temperature fluctuations {{on the walls of the}} microwave tube will be realized. It is hypothesized that the temperature fluctuations and to a much lesser extent temperature gradients may influence secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> resulting from <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> colliding with the microwave wall.

Further, aging effects resulting from heat stress cycling of the metal cavity may alter the state of the cavity walls leading to changes in the secondary <b>electron</b> <b>emission</b> properties.
