5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries seem to {{have been}} made to celebrate a marriage, <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would have once decorated the sky in most of the tapestries.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{retirement}} {{may have been}} involuntary, the Life of Cathróe of Metz and the Prophecy of Berchán portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where {{he is said to}} have been abbot, was <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of St Andrews. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming Céli Dé (Culdee) movement. The Céli Dé were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France.|$|E
5|$|Hulse {{identified}} the first {{hand of the}} Gamble manuscript is <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of poet Thomas Jordan (ca. 1612–1685), the same hand as manuscript PwV18 in the University of Nottingham, {{as well as other}} Jordan manuscripts in Harvard University and Bodleian Library. Hulse showed that Jordan and Gamble were involved in the same London circle of theatre musicians and composers for many years, culminating in Jordan's preface for Gamble's A Defence for Musick published in 1659. She identifies songs nos. 4, 16, 32, 45, 47, 99, 154, 155, 169, 170, 175, 176 and the text incipit of 96 as being copied by Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E
5|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E
5|$|Structure 10L-18 is on {{the southeastern}} side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Copán River, having lost its eastern side. Stairs {{on the south side}} of the {{structure}} lead down to a vaulted tomb that was looted in ancient times and was <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. It was apparently plundered soon after the collapse of the Copán kingdom. Unusually for Copán, the summit shrine had four sculpted panels depicting the king performing war dances with spear and shield, emphasizing the rising tensions as the dynasty came to its end.|$|E

5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work {{in that part of the}} manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> Easter and {{certainly}} by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 786 the {{creation}} of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured {{the creation of a}}n archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.|$|E

5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} area Väike-Pakri (Small-Pakri) is {{actually}} somewhat larger than Suur-Pakri (Big-Pakri). The {{reason for this}} contradiction is <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> Suur-Pakri had more inhabitants and better farming lands and was reckoned as more important.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{mathematics}} {{can be seen}} as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.|$|E

25|$|In {{one of the}} rebuildings, <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> {{which was}} carried out by Pope Clement V, a {{transverse}} nave was introduced, imitated no doubt from the one which had been added, long before this, to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Probably at this time the archbasilica was enlarged.|$|E
25|$|In western European culture {{narcissi}} and daffodils {{are among}} the most celebrated flowers in English literature, from Gower to Day-Lewis, while the best known poem is <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of Wordsworth. In the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological, floral art, or landscapes, from mediaeval altar pieces to Salvador Dalí.|$|E
25|$|After {{a fairly}} good start, the F.E.8 units quickly ran into {{problems}} with the new German fighters. The only ace on the type was Edwin Benbow. On 6 March 1917 he was credited with shooting down an Albatross D.III, very <b>probably</b> <b>that</b> of Manfred von Richthofen, who force landed with a holed fuel tank, narrowly escaping incineration.|$|E

25|$|When Western {{academics}} first {{investigated the}} Muslim conquest of Persia, {{they only had}} to rely on the accounts of the Armenian Christian bishop Sebeos, and accounts in Arabic that were written some time after the events they describe.
