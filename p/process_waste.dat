2500|$|Ironically {{there is}} a strong case for arguing that Leblanc <b>process</b> <b>waste</b> is the most {{endangered}} habitat in the UK, since the waste weathers down to calcium carbonate and produces a haven for plants that thrive in lime-rich soils, known as calcicoles. Only four such sites have survived the new millennium; three are protected as local nature reserves of which the largest, at Nob End near Bolton, is an SSSI and Local Nature Reserve - largely for its sparse orchid-calcicole flora, most unusual in an area with acid soils. [...] This alkaline island contains within it an acid island, where acid boiler slag was deposited, which now shows up as a zone dominated by heather, Calluna vulgaris.|$|E

The precipitates (heroin and DPH) are then collected, leaving behind all of the <b>process</b> <b>waste.</b> Lastly (and optionally) the super high purity (90%-99%) heroin-DPH mixture is added to a water solution and hydrochloric, acetic, or citric acid is carefully titrated to yield up to 99.9% pure [...] "cheese" [...] heroin in the salt form, which is again run through a micron filter and extracted to a powder via evaporation (water-soluble, and as such is the type used for injection and insuffalation ROA's) otherwise this step is excluded and the Cheese is in a super pure base form (which can be efficiently smoked).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the compostability of food industry <b>process</b> <b>wastes</b> with different bulking agents for disposal and recovery, and to determine the effect of treatment sludge which was used as inoculation agent.

Four different compost mixtures were prepared to investigate composting of <b>process</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>Process</b> <b>wastes</b> and sunflower stalk to first mixture (M 1) at ratio of 3 : 2; <b>process</b> <b>wastes,</b> treatment sludge and sunflower stalk to second mixture (M 2) at ratio of 3 : 1 : 2; <b>process</b> <b>wastes,</b> treatment sludge and corn cob to third mixture (M 3) at ratio of 3 : 1 : 2; <b>process</b> <b>wastes,</b> treatment sludge and corn cob to fourth mixture (M 4) at ratio of 3 : 1 : 3 were added. M 1 mixture was prepared without inoculation agent as control mixture.   Temperature, dry matter content, organic matter loss, C/N ratio, pH and electrical conductivity parameters were monitored during the composting process for 28 days. The highest organic matter losses and the highest temperature formed in the process were monitored in M 3 reactor. According to the results, for the efficiently composting process; <b>process</b> <b>wastes</b> with treatment sludge as inoculation agent and corn cob as bulking agent at ratio of 3 : 1 : 2 were determined. </p...|$|R

60|$|Unfortunately his indignation {{against the}} overweening pretensions of the verse-writer, the gazetteer, {{and the great}} band of socialists at large, led him into a general {{position}} with reference to scientific and speculative energy, which seems to involve a perilous misconception of the conditions of this energy producing its proper results. It is easy now, as {{it was easy for}} Rousseau in the last century, to ask in an epigrammatical manner by how much men are better or happier for having found out this or that novelty in transcendental mathematics, biology, or astronomy; and this is very well as against the discoverer of small marvels who shall give himself out for the benefactor of the human race. But both historical experience and observation of the terms on which the human intelligence works, show us that we can only make sure of intellectual activity on condition of leaving it free to work all round, in every department and in every remotest nook of each department, and that its most fruitful epochs are exactly those when this freedom is greatest, this curiosity most keen and minute, and this waste, if you choose to call the indispensable superfluity of force in a natural <b>process</b> <b>waste,</b> most copious and unsparing. You will not find your highest capacity in statesmanship, nor in practical science, nor in art, nor in any other field where that capacity is most urgently needed for the right service of life, unless there is a general and vehement spirit of search in the air. If it incidentally leads to many industrious futilities and much learned refuse, this is still the sign and the generative element of industry which is not futile, and of learning which is something more than mere water spilled upon the ground.|$|E

Operations that take place inside the HHE include raising and lowering the hearth using a hydraulic lift table, transporting the hearth within the HHE using an overhead monorail and hoist system, sampling and disassembly of the <b>processed</b> <b>waste</b> and hearth, weighing the hearth, rebuilding a hearth, and sampling HEPA filters.

40|$|If the US is to {{continue}} to effectively use its substantial coal reserves, new clean coal technologies must be developed to improve power production efficiency and reduce emissions from power plants. In order to gain information about wastes produced by advanced coal utilization processes, a research project is being conducted to characterize the geotechnical and geochemical properties of advanced coal <b>process</b> <b>wastes.</b> The University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) analyzed 34 of these wastes for their bulk chemical and mineral compositions and for the disposal-related physical properties listed in a table. This paper discusses potentially useful waste management practices for eight bulk waste samples obtained from four different clean coal processes: gas reburning with sorbent injection (GRSI); pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC); SO{sub x}, NO{sub x}, RO{sub x}, BOX (SNRB); and coal reburning (CR). All four processes have been demonstrated at either full-scale or pilot-scale facilities in the US. Since the properties of advanced <b>process</b> <b>wastes</b> are different from conventional coal combustion wastes, an analysis was performed to identify any potential problems that could occur when standard, off-the-shelf waste management technologies are used for handling and disposal of advanced <b>process</b> <b>wastes.</b> When potential problems were identified, possible alternative technologies were evaluated...|$|R
