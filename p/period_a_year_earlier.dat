Initial analysis of forced-draft, induced-draft and {{boiler feed pump}} motors shows the data to be repeatable and to demonstrate steady ageing effects. It also shows clear differences between the motor types and {{the ease with which}} motors suffering abnormally high deterioration may be distinguished from the majority. Thus, boiler feed pump motors appeared to age faster than fan motors. Measurements before and after an overhaul, involving the cleaning and re-varnishing of the windings, showed a general but very minor improvement, as might be expected. There was one exception, a motor where the PD level was greatly improved (back to acceptable levels) {{in the course of the}} overhaul—the surface of the windings had been noted as exceptionally dirty.

5000|$|The plot of {{the series}} up through Season 5 {{involves}} a conflict between King Arthur and his best knight, Lancelot. This begins with a few episodes in Season 1 in which we see that Lancelot {{is in love with}} Arthur's queen, Guenièvre. In Season 2 Lancelot begins to challenge Arthur; he feels that if Arthur were an effective king, justice would have been established and the knights of the Round Table would be great warriors instead of the clowns ("pantins") they actually are. In Season 3 Lancelot decides to go live in the woods as a [...] "chevalier errant" [...] or wandering knight, and in Season 4 his hermitage becomes a fortress and he begins recruiting men. In Season 4, Guenièvre joins Lancelot and Arthur breaks various “laws” by trying to remarry with Mevanwi, Karadoc's wife; however, at the end he retrieves his wife, who has had enough of camping out, and Lancelot despairs. Season 5's main plots show Lancelot and Arthur separately voyaging into their own pasts and futures as their conflict builds to a real cliffhanger in the final episode. We learn that these two men have been in competition for the throne of Britain since they were born. In Season 5, also, Arthur resigns his kingship and Leodagan and Karadoc attempt to rule. Season 6 consists of a flashback to <b>a</b> <b>period</b> 15 <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> showing how Arthur came to power in Britain {{as a representative of the}} Roman Empire but also as the chosen of the gods, the only man who can wield Excalibur. We also see how he ended up with such an odd group of [...] "knights" [...] and with a wife with whom he cannot be intimate.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{results were}} encouraging: initial demand for Eau Claire All Malt outstripped supply, {{prompting}} Healy {{to declare that}} “the acceptance has been incredible.

A total production goal of 30,000 barrels—slightly above break-even—was set for 1986, with a rise to 87,000 barrels foreseen by 1989. [...] Hibernia also was given excellent reviews from Michael Jackson, at the time the foremost expert on the brewing industry and the changes and trends taking place in America and how it was {{following in the footsteps of}} a similar evolution in Britain. The outcome justified the initial perspective of Healy that consumers would be willing to pay more for a better beer, under the premise that “we’re on our way into a brewery revolution. The groundswell has already started. We have an age category in this country (28 to 40) that’s very image conscious. If they’re going to drink beer, they want to drink the best beer possible, and if that means paying $2 a bottle, they’ll do it. That’s what I’m banking the future of this company on.” ...|$|E
