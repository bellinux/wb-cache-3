5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no <b>proof.</b> <b>House</b> treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

25|$|The LeMat {{revolver}} was manufactured from 1856 to 1865, {{with approximately}} 2,900 being produced. The first models were manufactured by John Krider of Philadelphia, {{with the second}} model (the first overseas model) being produced by Charles Frederic Girard and Son of Paris. Quality concerns prompted LeMat to consider production at the Birmingham Small Arms Company in Birmingham, England, but production was never mounted there. LeMat revolvers from France were shipped to the Confederate States forces via the United Kingdom, and all firearms landed in the UK were (and still are) required to be proofed. The LeMats which found {{their way through the}} Union blockade were stamped with British proof marks from the Birmingham <b>Proof</b> <b>House,</b> leading to the misapprehension that the pistols were actually manufactured in the UK. A handful are known to have been made illegitimately in the UK by an unknown manufacturer, believed to be the London Armoury Company, but only two examples survive to the present day and it is doubtful any of the English-made LeMats ever saw service during the U.S. Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Baroque {{architecture}} and Neoclassical architecture were also becoming popular in Birmingham {{during this time}} and early buildings which used the Neoclassical building style include the Birmingham <b>Proof</b> <b>House</b> by John Horton which was built in 1813, although Jacobean style gates were added in 1883. The style became predominantly popular in {{the centre of the}} town during the 1820s in a variety of building usages, which is reflected in Regency House on Waterloo Street. Although the architect is unknown, they are believed to have been influenced by Sir John Soane. The building features copies of the Corinthian columns used at the Tower of the Winds in Athens. Domestic buildings also used this style of architecture, such as the houses at 116-120 Moseley Road which were also built during the 1820s. The two houses feature stucco fronts with unusually large bay windows. St Thomas's Church, which was bombed during World War II, was built in 1827 and is an example of neoclassical architecture being used in the design of churches in Birmingham. It was designed by Henry Hutchinson of Rickman and Hutchinson and features a tower and quadrant Ionic porticoes.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of conflicting industry standards, efforts are currently made to produce a notion regarding [...] "reference cartridges" [...] similar to the system used by NATO armies (NATO EPVAT testing).

50|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, the C.I.P.’s concern {{has only been}} related to arms/ammunition safety from the user's point of view.

As a result, the compulsory ammunition safety control tests by the manufacturers themselves and their approval by the <b>proof</b> <b>houses</b> are only pressure related. The dimensional checking of the ammunition, as described in the C.I.P. Decisions, Texts and Tables, is left to the manufacturers themselves. Headspace is not checked, even on rimless cartridges with taper. The view is that in the very unlikely case (according to the current quality standards) the cartridge is too long, once pressed by the bolt, the pressure will rise too high causing rejection. If it is too short, firing will fail also causing rejection.|$|R
