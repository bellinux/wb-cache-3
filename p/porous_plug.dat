The <b>porous</b> polymer <b>plug</b> was fabricated within the separation channel as a select valve, which prevented the running buffer from buffer waste reservoir (BW) flowing back into the separation channel, but allowed electrophoretic migration along the separation channel. By applying a subatmospheric pressure to the headspace of sample waste reservoir (SW), sample and running buffer were drawn immediately to SW. At the same time, {{a branch of the}} sample stream was driven across the <b>porous</b> polymer <b>plug</b> by the electric force and formed a sample zone in the separation channel. The injected sample zone length was in proportion with the injection time. The proposed method was successfully applied to separation of Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) and Rhodamine 6 G (Rh 6 G). The limits of detection for Rh 123 and Rh 6 G based on S/N = 3 were 0. 63 and 0. 48 nmol L- 1, respectively.

The plugs in contact with liquid He on both sides act as a fountain-effect pumps (FEPs), while plugs exposed to vapor on one side behave as vapor-liquid phase separators (VLPSs). The total net rate of He II transfer into the receiving tank equals the mass flow rate through the FEP plugs minus the liquid loss from the VLPS plugs.
