5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and <b>pipe</b> <b>systems</b> for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system.|$|E
25|$|For {{agricultural}} purposes the Chinese {{had invented}} the hydraulic-powered trip hammer by the 1st century BC, during the ancient Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). Although it found other purposes, its main function was to pound, decorticate, and polish grain {{that otherwise would}} have been done manually. The Chinese also innovated the square-pallet chain pump by the 1st century AD, powered by a waterwheel or an oxen pulling on a system of mechanical wheels. Although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial <b>pipe</b> <b>systems,</b> it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with <b>pipe</b> <b>systems</b> which deceive beaver.|$|E

Because the seismic forcing function was {{more complex than the}} single-frequency increasing-amplitude sinusoidal forcing function used in the IPIRG- 1 <b>pipe</b> <b>system</b> experiments, considerable effort went into designing the function.

By the end of the Han dynasty in the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards. These would slowly spread west, revolutionizing farming in Northern Europe by the 10th century. (Glick, however, argues for a development of the Chinese plough as late as the 9th century, implying its spread east from similar designs known in Italy by the 7th century.) ...|$|E

Especially in the Gaza Strip, high losses {{are caused by}} illegal connections. Illegal use of water is often the result of water shortages and insufficient supply. Furthermore, the conditions of water supply utilities suffer from grave deficiencies causing high leakage rates and a weak water pulse in the system, [...] ascribed to both institutional weakness and the restrictions posed by the occupation {{on the development of}} the water and sanitation sectors, including the Gaza blockade.|$|E

The improved motion planning method provides basic algorithm support for indicating the feasible escape path of single a part. Our technic gradually reduces the complexity of the <b>pipe</b> <b>system</b> to generate a hierarchical structure which takes all geometric information of the system. The hierarchical structure is preserved and used for the generation of a disassembly relationship graph which indicates the feasible disassembly sequences...|$|R

By comparing the presented method with a classical three-reservoir problem, it might be said that the proposed method performs a hydraulic head correction in junctions in an inverse way.
