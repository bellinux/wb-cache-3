40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this article}} is to apply the Austrian {{analysis}} of the entrepreneur to the <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> By distinguishing the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> from the economic process, we will endeavour to show to what extent an analysis in terms of the <b>political</b> market <b>process</b> is both possible and relevant. The existence of an information conveyance which can be assimilated to a price system within the <b>political</b> <b>process,</b> with its resulting profits, are motivating elements for the political entrepreneur. The political entrepreneur is doubly specialised and possesses all the Kirznerian functions of the Austrian entrepreneur as a coordinating agent for the <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> Key Words: entrepreneur, political market, market and <b>political</b> <b>process,</b> Austrian school JEL classification: D 72...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam {{expressed}} his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national <b>political</b> <b>processes</b> and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E

40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at: [URL] article argues that, under certain conditions, {{allowing}} insurgents into the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> – through elections or government posts – can be a useful tool {{in the peace process}} and can help end insurgencies. However, bringing insurgents into the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> is unlikely to end insurgencies on its own, particularly if insurgents, the government, or the population believes that force is still a viable means of defeating the opponent and changing the status quo. The article begins with a brief overview of the causes of insurgency and on conflict resolution for internal wars. The article then considers two examples of insurgents that have entered the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> – the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland and Hezbollah in Lebanon – and the differing degrees of success in transforming these insurgents to non- violent participants in the <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> It concludes by suggesting how insurgents can be brought into the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> as part of conflict resolution and the implications for Afghanistan...|$|R

25|$|In February 1998, Kim Dae-jung {{was officially}} inaugurated.

25|$|Terms {{with similar}} {{etymology}} {{are also used}} in various social sciences and humanities to describe patriarchal or patriological aspects of social, cultural and <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> Adjective patriological {{is derived from the}} noun patriology that comes from two Greek words: πατέρας (pateras, father) and λογος (logos, teaching about). The term patriology originated in theological studies as a designation for particular theological discipline that studies the person and works of God the Father (see: Patriology (Christianity)). In modern times, the term was borrowed by social sciences and humanities and its meaning was widened in order to describe and define particular male-dominated and male-centered aspects of cultural and social life.|$|E
25|$|Generally, DG {{work can}} be seen as taking two approaches: one views democratization as a {{political}} struggle between democrats and non-democrats and directs aid toward <b>political</b> <b>processes</b> and institutions such as elections, political parties, and civil society; and the second views democratization as a slower, longer-term process and directs aid at a wide range of political and socioeconomic sectors. In terms of implementation, donor country development agencies, such as USAID, UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), design and fund programs (according to donor country interests and local needs) that are often carried out by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in coordination with local and international groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{work of the}} {{collective}} research in this thesis is to provide concise insights about the inputs {{that are responsible for}} the process by which young adults develop civic competence and how this translates into active participation among young adults in the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> over time. Research for this thesis explores how key concepts of socialization, task generalization, shifts in young adult voting trends between 1972 - 2008, the role of social research statistics, and political theory informs the role of socialization in the development of civic competence in young adult voters. This thesis also explores critical social contexts, direct and indirect influence of family units, how critical moments in the academic careers of young adults take effect in college and ultimately young adulthood, what shifts in voting trends further indicate, and lastly the role that social media plays in the modern landscape of young adults becoming politically active and in a larger effort to assess core features of the young adult involvement in the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> following the passage of the 26 th Amendment based on scholarly research in the aforementioned areas and relevant national studies. By all cited statistics, {{with the exception of the}} 2008 presidential election, voting among young adults since 1972 has fallen precipitously. Contrary to traditional beliefs, which suggest that young adults are disengaged with the <b>political</b> <b>process,</b> key research findings indicate a shift in the means by which young adults engage in the <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> For example, at an increasing rate since 1972 young adults seek demonstrate their participation in the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> through hands on mechanisms such as volunteerism. Secondly, given the advent of Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and other social networks, young adults have largely transitioned the ways that they gather information about the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> from traditional means, such as newspapers, televised news broadcasts to social networks. Personal suggestions for increasing rates of young adult participation in the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> include a critical need for civic education curriculum in schooling systems that present contextual lessons on civic duty and how individual participation fits in the <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> Ultimately, the aim of this research is twofold: (1) to explain what are the key drivers of young adult participation in the <b>political</b> <b>process,</b> and (2) to shed light on the role young adults have in reshaping the <b>political</b> <b>process</b> for current and future generations...|$|R

25|$|While modern states existed without European {{influence}} {{around the}} world before colonialism, post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention. While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, {{the development of the}} international norm of non-interventionism means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> John W. Meyer's World Society Theory contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power. In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.|$|E
25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E
25|$|Several Muslim-majority {{nations have}} passed laws to {{incorporate}} more {{women in their}} parliaments and <b>political</b> <b>processes.</b> For example, Indonesia passed a law in 2013 that required political parties to field at least 30% women candidates in elections or pay a financial penalty, a law which was later amended to stipulate {{that at least one}} in three candidates on every party's electoral list must be female and parties which do not fulfill this criterion will be barred from contesting the election; Tunisia's mandated electoral lists composed of 50% women in both the 2011 and 2014 legislative elections; and in 2012, Algeria set a minimum parliamentary female membership requirement of 30%. Following the May 2012 legislative elections, women constitute 31.6% of Algerian MPs. In Senegal, 50% of local and national electoral lists have to be female as of 2012. Kosovo has had a female quota for its assembly as far back as 2001, when it was de jure part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; the Muslim-majority (95.6%) Balkan republic guarantees women 30% of parliamentary seats as of 2016.|$|E

500|$|Simon {{described}} {{the second season}} as [...] "a meditation {{on the death of}} work and the betrayal of the American working class... it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw capitalism is destined to serve the few {{at the expense of the}} many." [...] He added that season 3 [...] "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that <b>political</b> <b>processes,</b> long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." [...] The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, which in Simon's view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America's underclass. This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims.|$|E
