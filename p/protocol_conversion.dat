40|$|Network-on-chip (NoC) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an attractive solution to the ever increasing interconnect problem in complex system-on-chip designs, particularly in those that include partial dynamically reconfigurable logic. To be integrated in NoC architecture, three issues for the design of a NoC-based reconfiguration system have to be considered at the same time. First, the processor cannot involve the entire reconfiguration process for the sake of NoC scalability. Second, NoC architecture as communication between IP cores is implemented by network protocols in NoC. Third, inclusion of reconfigurability into the chip demands additional chip area, besides the area penalty caused by the NoC itself. Tradeoffs between area and chip flexibility thus have to be carefully evaluated. In this article we describe a high-performance, low-area reconfiguration controller design that satisfies stringent performance and latency requirements. This proposed controller architecture is implemented at the transport layer, and all the operations related to reconfiguration are performed only on the network interface (NI) side to minimise the disturbance to the network performance. In addition, this NI also performs <b>protocol</b> <b>conversions</b> that are vital to ease the integration of IP cores obtained from various vendors using standard and/or propriety communication protocols. Experimental results with a Xilinx FPGA have confirmed the robustness and superiority of the proposed controller and the NI designs for NoC-based systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the technical and economical feasibility of converting three chemical scrubbers in series to biotrickling filters (BTFs) for the simultaneous removal of H 2 S and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The conversion of the full-scale scrubbers was based on previous <b>conversion</b> <b>protocols.</b> <b>Conversion</b> mainly required replacing the original carrier material and recycle pumps as well as modifying the controls and operation of the reactors. Complete removal of H 2 S and VOCs on a routine basis was reached at neutral pH in {{a longer period of}} time compared to previous conversions reported. Biotrickling filters operated at a gas contact time of about 1. 4 s per reactor and at pH controlled between 6. 5 and 6. 8. Inlet average concentrations below 10 ppmv of H 2 S and below 5 ppmv for VOCs were often completely removed. The first and second bioreactors played a primary role in H 2 S removal. Year-round operation of the biotrickling filters proved the ability of the system to handle progressive load increases of H 2 S and VOCs. However, fast, sudden load changes often lead to reduced removal efficiencies. Odor analyses showed average removal efficiencies above 80 %. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of selected samples showed that outlet odor concentration was due to limited removal of VOCs. The conversion showed was economically viable taking into account the theoretical consumption of chemicals needed for the absorption and oxidation of both H 2 S and VOCs.

40|$|Bus based {{interconnects}} {{are commonly}} used to connect Intellectual Properties (IPs) on System-on-Chip (SoC). However, {{as the number of}} high performance IPs with large communication requirements in a Multi Processor SoC (MPSoC) increases, the bus interconnects become a communication bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, the bus based interconnects are replaced by Networks-on-Chip (NoC) as the interconnect for IPs in an MPSoC. The ability to support multiple protocols, both legacy and newer, is essential for leveraging the advantages of the NoC. This thesis describes the <b>protocol</b> <b>conversions,</b> or shells, we design for the aethereal NoC, to provide a unified message format for the PLB, OPB and FSL protocols. Furthermore, to tolerate the latencies when accessing memory and to increase the throughput when possible, we add support for posted write and prefetch read in the shells and we design a mechanism to coalesce multiple single transactions into burst transaction when possible. To validate our design, we prototype it on a Virtex-II PRO FPGA. We use both synthetic applications as well as real life applications to benchmark and analyze the effect of factors, like computation-to-communication ratio, various link bandwidths and compiler loop unrolling on the performance of the system. The results show that reducing the link bandwidth up to a certain point does not affect the performance anymore, as the latency associated with NoC internals becomes dominant. Also the burst transaction can sustain the performance of the system up to a certain point, when the link bandwidth is reduced. The best result is obtained using a shell with posted write and prefetch read. Microelectronics & Computer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
