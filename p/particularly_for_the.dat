5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas's primary {{interest}} {{as an adult}} was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views, and feared that the post–Second World War socialist governments regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate {{for the creation of}} national parks in England and Wales, and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Observer newspaper and The Spectator, a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) includes selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{work began}} in 1734 to Wood's plan but {{disagreements}} between Wood and Allen {{led to his}} dismissal and Wood's Clerk of Works, Richard Jones, replaced him and made some changes to the plans <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> east wing. Jones also added the Palladian Bridge. The building was finished in 1743 and was occupied by Allen as his primary residence {{until his death in}} 1764.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis was {{collected}} in 1769 by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific. The type locality is Queen Charlotte Sound. It was named Dracaena australis by Georg Forster who published it as entry 151 in his Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus of 1786. It is sometimes still {{sold as a}} Dracaena, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> house plant market in Northern Hemisphere countries.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} Protestant and Catholic missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One {{of the consequences of}} the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E
5|$|He {{decided to}} set the series in a fictional town of Dillon, Texas, with some {{characteristics}} of Odessa. The football team was given the Panthers name. Berg deliberately carried elements from the film to the series, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pilot, which was {{closely related to the}} film. He cast Connie Britton as the wife of head coach Eric Taylor, and Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, a major businessman and football booster, in roles similar to those they played in the film.|$|E

The base also serves as the headquarters to NATO's Allied Command Transformation.|$|E
5|$|John's counter-offensive stalled at {{the siege}} of Wesenberg in 1574, when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other. This failure has also been blamed on the {{difficulties}} of fighting in the bitter winter conditions, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infantry. The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden, {{and by the end}} of 1573, Sweden's German mercenaries were owed 200,000 daler. John gave them the castles of Hapsal, Leal and Lode as security, but when he failed to pay they were sold to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Ledbury {{was engaged}} in escorting major {{warships}} and Fleet auxiliaries in the North Sea until late June 1942, when she {{was attached to the}} ocean escort of the convoy PQ17. Mariners that took part in convoys delivering supplies to Russia remember vividly the biting cold and the continual fear of attack by air or sea. The supplies were vital in that they were needed to keep Russia in the war following her invasion by German forces in 1941. The PQ17 convoy, which left Iceland at the end of June 1942, is known <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tremendous losses among the merchant ships.|$|E

The film was released theatrically on January 16, 2015, and grossed $43.9 million at the international box office. It received critical acclaim, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> performance given by Moore, who won numerous awards including the Academy Award for Best Actress.

5|$|The Manasollasa {{has been}} called an {{important}} source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> history of food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of great interest {{because it is the}} earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a professor of music and anthropology, has called Manasollasa an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas, <b>particularly</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two tropical species, {{and the rock}} martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E
