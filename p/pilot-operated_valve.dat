40|$|Design of a direct-acting valve (DAV) for {{a primary}} {{thruster}} which is fully interchangeable with a thruster equipped with pilot-operated valves is described. The DAV {{is based on}} a bellows to isolate propellants form the actuator for maximum resistance to iron nitrate and other contamination and to select optimum materials for the actuator. It provides improved seal performance under all operating conditions and insensitivity to pressure transients. As compared with the existing <b>pilot-operated</b> <b>valve,</b> the DAV design is much simpler, consists of fewer parts, and will be lower in cost...|$|E

Technically POPRV is the most generic term, but PORV is often used generically (as in this article) even though it should refer to valves in liquid service.|$|R

2500|$|The {{operators}} had {{not been}} trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. There was a temperature indicator downstream of the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> in the tail pipe between the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> and the pressurizer that could have told them the valve was stuck open, by showing that {{the temperature in the}} tail pipe remained higher than it should have been had the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> been shut. This temperature indicator, however, {{was not part of the}} [...] "safety grade" [...] suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators {{had not been}} trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight of the operators.|$|R
25|$|The release {{occurred}} when the cladding was damaged while the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> was stuck open {{and the loss of}} coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.|$|R
25|$|With the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> still open, the {{pressurizer}} {{relief tank}} that collected the {{discharge from the}} <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to controlling surge relief equipment. It all starts with the technology used in the specific application. Spring-loaded pressure safety <b>valves</b> and <b>pilot-operated</b> <b>valves</b> are controlled mechanically using the pressure from a compressed spring. Typically there is an adjustment stem that allows for minor adjustments on the set point by compressing or decompressing the spring. This design {{is limited by the}} pressure that can be generated by the spring in the valve.|$|R

40|$|Relief valves are {{integral}} part of almost any hydraulic power system; therefore special attention is given to ensure stable operation of these elements. The purpose of this work is to study internal dynamic processes in hydraulic <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valves</b> and define key parameters affecting dynamic performance and operational stability of the examined valves. Modeling involves creating a design scheme and a mathematical model for the specific valve. Flow balance equations for the selected model nodes and motion equations of valve's moving elements were formulated. The study revealed that internal dynamic processes in hydraulic <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valves</b> {{are influenced by the}} following parameters: size of the poppet valve orifice, value of the valve's enclosed volume and pump capacity. Moreover, analysis results showed that developed model is most sensitive to changes {{in the size of the}} poppet valve orifice. Developed mathematical model can be used as an effective tool for selecting rational dimensions for hydraulic <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valves</b> in order to provide specific dynamic properties. ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????, ???????????? ? ????????????????? ????????????? ????????? ????????. ??? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ? ????? ????????? ????? ? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ?????????????????? ???????. ??????????? ??????? ??????????, ? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????, ?????? ??????, ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ????????????????? ??????? ????????? ????????. ????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ??????? ? ????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????...|$|R
2500|$|At 6am, {{there was}} a shift change in the control room. A new arrival noticed that the {{temperature}} in the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> tail pipe and the holding tanks was excessive and used a backup valvecalled a [...] "block valve"to shut off the coolant venting via the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve,</b> but around [...] of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop. It was not until 165 minutes after the start of the problem that radiation alarms activated as contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluidâ€™s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief valve, spring-loaded pressure safety <b>valves,</b> <b>pilot-operated</b> <b>valves,</b> surge suppressors, and rupture disks.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> {{indicator}} light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|R

50|$|A {{safety valve}} is a valve {{that acts as}} a {{fail-safe}} in a thermal-hydraulics plant. An example of safety valve is a pressure relief valve (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a boiler, pressure vessel, or other system, when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. <b>Pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valves</b> are a specialized type of pressure safety valve.

5000|$|March 28, 1979: Three Mile Island accident. Partial nuclear meltdown. Mechanical {{failures}} in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> (PORV) in the primary system, allowed large amounts of reactor coolant to escape. Plant operators initially failed to recognize the loss of coolant, resulting in a partial meltdown. The reactor was brought under control but not before radioactive gases were released into the atmosphere. The accident has not been directly linked with a single death.|$|R
2500|$|The loss of heat {{removal from}} the primary loop {{and the failure of}} the {{auxiliary}} system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> [...] {{at the top of the}} pressurizera pressure active-regulator tankto open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the solenoid of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape {{from the primary}} system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape.

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve,</b> as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|R

50|$|Byzantine faults and {{cascading}} failures within {{instrumentation and control}} systems may cause severe problems in reactor operation, potentially leading to core damage if not mitigated. For example, the Browns Ferry fire damaged control cables and required the plant operators to manually activate cooling systems. The Three Mile Island accident {{was caused by a}} stuck-open <b>pilot-operated</b> pressure relief <b>valve</b> combined with a deceptive water level gauge that misled reactor operators, which resulted in core damage.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston valve}} can also {{refer to a}} 2-way 2-position, <b>pilot-operated</b> spool <b>valve.</b> The term is {{extremely}} popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back {{by the force of}} the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to quick exhaust valves.|$|R
50|$|Like the OPR-1000 and {{preceding}} C-E designs, the APR-1400 has two {{reactor coolant}} loops. In each loop, heated primary coolant leaves the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) through one hot leg, passing through one steam generator (SG), returning to the reactor vessel through two cold legs, each equipped with a reactor coolant pump (RCP). In loop 2, there is one pressurizer (PZR) on the hot leg, where a steam bubble is maintained during operation. The loops are arranged symmetrically, so the hot legs are diametrically opposed on the RPV's circumference. Because the SGs are elevated relative to the RPV, natural convection will circulate reactor coolant {{in the event of}} RCP malfunction. The PZR is equipped with a <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> which not only protects against Reactor Coolant System over-pressure, it also allows manual depressurization {{in the case of a}} total loss of feedwater.|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{pressurizer}} {{system is}} an over-pressure relief system. In {{the event that}} pressurizer pressure exceeds a certain maximum, there is a relief <b>valve</b> called the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> (PORV) {{on top of the}} pressurizer which opens to allow steam from the steam bubble to leave the pressurizer {{in order to reduce the}} pressure in the pressurizer. This steam is routed to a large tank (or tanks) in the reactor containment building where it is cooled back into liquid (condensed) and stored for later disposition. There is a finite volume to these tanks and if events deteriorate to the point where the tanks fill up, a secondary pressure relief device on the tank(s), often a rupture disc, allows the condensed reactor coolant to spill out onto the floor of the reactor containment building where it pools in sumps for later disposition.|$|R
40|$|Pump-controlled {{hydraulic}} circuits {{are more}} efficient than valve-controlled circuits, as they eliminate the energy losses due to flow throttling in valves and require less cooling effort. Presently existing pump-controlled solutions for single rod cylinders encounter an undesirable performance during certain operating conditions. This paper investigates the performance issues in common pump-controlled circuits for the single rod actuators. Detailed analysis is conducted that identifies these regions in a load-velocity plane and the factors affecting them. The findings are validated by experimental results. A new design is then proposed that employs a limited throttling valve alongside two pilot operated check valves for differential flow compensation to improve the performance. The valve is of the flow control type and is chosen to have a throttling effect over critical regions; it has the least throttling over other operating regions, thus maintaining efficiency. Experimental work demonstrates improved performance in a full operating range of the actuator as compared to a circuit that uses only the <b>pilot-operated</b> check <b>valves.</b> This circuit is energy efficient and capable of recuperating energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{principle}} {{and structure of}} a new kind of soft start-up equipment for heavy-duty motor named Hydro-viscous drive (HVD) set is introduced. Through theoretical analyses on start-up characteristics of the HVD set, the conclusions were drawn that the non-linearity of the pressure performance curve is one key cause of the poor start-up smoothness, and dynamic instability of oil pressure of the electro-hydraulic <b>pilot-operated</b> pressure relief <b>valve,</b> which is used for speed regulating purpose for the HVD set and usually works on low oil pressure and micro flow-rate condition, is another one. So a special speed regulating valve is developed for HVD set, with which the start-up smoothness of HVD set for heavy-duty motor is improved significantly...|$|R
5000|$|Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was unable}} to contain about 480 PBq of {{radioactive}} noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank. However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. [...] The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based {{on the status of}} its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position. [...] This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic sump pumps and/or insufficient containment sump capacity negated the containment building designed passive safety.|$|R
25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a <b>pilot-operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|R
5000|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by {{production of the}} [...] Gipsy Six Series II for use with the hydraulically actuated airscrews that de Havilland were by then producing under a licence acquired from Hamilton Standard in 1934. This was effectively the engine that the company {{did not have time}} to develop for the 1934 MacRobertson race, but without the significant increase in compression-ratio needed for the Comet. The Series II unit, while superficially similar to its predecessor, utilised a hollow, splined crankshaft to permit the fitting of the VP airscrew utilising boosted pressurised oil from the engine's dry-sump lubrication system via a <b>pilot-operated</b> control <b>valve.</b> As well as differences to the crankcase and crankshaft, different cylinder barrels, pistons and aluminium cylinder heads were utilised. There was also an added, very limited ability provided on the Series II to run accessories. The [...] "pilot-friendly" [...] constant speed units (CSUs) were not available for these engines until 1939. The Series II was also equipped with AMC (Automatic Mixture Control) a barometric device, without which it was exceedingly difficult to adjust for a correct mixture with a CSU fitted. This feature was also carried over onto the similar Queen II. Pilots were then able to simply select the required RPM and Boost pressure required. This reduction in over-leaning also tended to extend the TBO (time between overhauls). The twin down-draught, Claudel-Hobson A.I.48 carburetters were common to all these engines. It {{is interesting to note that}} in the mid-1930s, the induction system was skilfully designed to automatically obviate the effects of carburetter icing - a dangerous problem that still plagues most piston engines in current worldwide use in 2008, more than 70 years later.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA hybrid safety {{injection}} tank (H-SIT) {{can enhance}} the capability of an advanced power reactor plus (APR+) during a station black out (SBO) that {{is accompanied by a}} severe accident. It may a useful alternative to an electric motor. The operations strategy of the H-SIT has to be investigated to achieve maximum utilization of its function. In this study, the master logic diagram (i. e., an analysis for identifying the differences between an H-SIT and a safety injection pump) and an accident case classification were used to determine the parameters of the H-SIT operation. The conditions that require the use of an H-SIT were determined using a decision-making process. The proper timing for using an H-SIT was also analyzed by using the Multi-dimensional Analysis of Reactor Safety (MARS) 1. 3 code (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea). The operation strategy analysis indicates that a H-SIT can mitigate five types of failure: (1) failure of the safety injection pump, (2) failure of the passive auxiliary feedwater system, (3) failure of the depressurization system, (4) failure of the shutdown cooling pump (SCP), and (5) failure of the recirculation system. The results of the MARS code demonstrate that the time allowed for recovery can be extended when using an H-SIT, compared with the same situation in which an H-SIT is not used. Based on the results, the use of an H-SIT is recommended, especially after the <b>pilot-operated</b> safety relief <b>valve</b> (POSRV) is opened...|$|R
