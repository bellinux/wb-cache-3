40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a heat switch for autonomous temperature control of electronic components in a satellite. A heat switch can modulate when needed between roles of a good thermal conductor and a good thermal insulator. <b>Electronic</b> <b>boxes</b> on a satellite should be maintained within a typical optimum temperature range of 260 to 310 K. The heat sinking is usually by means of a radiator. When the operating temperature of the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> increases beyond 310 K, a good contact to the radiator is desired for maximum cooling. On the other hand, when the satellite is in a cold dormant state, the electronics box should be heated by the onboard batteries. In this state a weak thermal contact is desired between the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> and the heat sink. In the present study, we are developing a gas gap heat switch in which the sorber material is thermally anchored to the <b>electronic</b> <b>box.</b> A temperature change of the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> triggers the (de-) sorption of gas from the sorber material and subsequently the gas pressure in the gas gap.

With the development in high {{power semiconductor}}s, large scale power switching circuits will be used increasingly in a variety of electric utility applications. To ensure reliable operation of <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> circuits, it is necessary to consider the switching characteristics of power semiconductor devices, the switching control and transients of widely different time scales. This invariably makes the analysis and design process very complicated.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} tidal or wind generation into a power system, a <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> converter must be used. Therefore, {{the analysis of}} the reliability behavior of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> converter plays a vital role in the reliability assessment of power system with tidal and wind generations. A reliability model of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> converter, which considers operating temperature impacts on the failure rates of electronic components, is incorporated into the reliability analysis of power system with TPGS and wind power generation system (WPGS) in this paper. In most previous work for reliability evaluation of power system with wind or tidal power, the failure model of <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> converter has been missed.|$|R
30|$|As seen in Section  2, the FOR of a TPGS or WPGS {{is needed}} to {{calculate}} the expected tidal or wind power output in their chronological model. As mentioned in Introduction, a TPGS or WPGS includes a <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> converter {{in addition to a}} generator and other components. The mean FOR values of generators and other mechanical or electrical components can be easily estimated from statistical records and do not change over time. However, the failure rates of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> components depend on its voltage, junction temperature and other factors [21, 22]. The junction temperature, as the main factor affecting the failure rate of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> components, is related to its power loss, which is determined by the electric current flowing through the component. The electric current is determined by the power output of the generator unit (wind or tidal), which varies with time. A reliability model of <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> components associated with junction temperature, power loss and voltage is presented in this section. By calculating the power loss of <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> components, the junction temperature can be estimated. Therefore, the junction temperature related failure rates of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> component can be estimated.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the penetration levels of distributed generation in the modern power grid and its importance in future energy systems have accelerated the interest of developing new <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interfaces for the energy conversion process. The feasibility of applying the indirect matrix converter as the standard <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interface for applications with power ratings from several kW to few MW is addressed in this dissertation. Special attention is given to those applications where space dominates the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> requirements. The main motivation for using the indirect matrix converter is that eliminates the energy storage component {{in the way of}} a dc-link capacitor for the energy conversion process. This contributes to reduce size and weight, and potentially, increase reliability of the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interface. Two main new contributions are presented. First, a new <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interface that allows the connection of two ac power grids through a medium- or high-voltage dc system is proposed. The new topology contemplates the use of two high-voltage dc-link converters based on the modular multilevel converter, two indirect matrix converters and two medium-frequency transformers. Second, a new sensorless control technique working in the d-q reference is developed. The controller is used to interface a distributed generation unit to the power grid when the indirect matrix converter is used as the <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interface. The design and performance of the proposed <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> interface is validated through time-domain simulations and a laboratory prototype is built to experimentally validate the sensorless controller...|$|R
