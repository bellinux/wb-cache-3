50|$|Before 2010 the ticker (trading) symbols for US options {{typically}} {{looked like}} this: IBMAF.This {{consisted of a}} root symbol ('IBM') + month code ('A') + strike <b>price</b> <b>code</b> ('F'). The root symbol is {{the symbol of the}} stock on the stock exchange. After this comes the month code, A-L mean January-December calls, M-X mean January-December puts. The strike <b>price</b> <b>code</b> is a letter corresponding with a certain strike price (which letter corresponds with which strike price depends on the stock).|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the command}} sequence, the target returns a status code byte, such as 00h for success, 02h for an error (called a Check Condition), or 08h for busy. When the target returns a Check Condition in {{response}} to a command, the initiator usually then issues a SCSI Request Sense command in order to obtain a key <b>code</b> <b>qualifier</b> (KCQ) from the target. The Check Condition and Request Sense sequence involves a special SCSI protocol called a Contingent Allegiance Condition.|$|R
50|$|The {{initiator}} {{can take}} action based on just the K field which indicates if the error is minor or major. However all three fields are usually logically combined into a 20 bit field called Key <b>Code</b> <b>Qualifier</b> or KCQ.

In practice there are many KCQ values which are common between different SCSI device types and different SCSI device vendors.

40|$|Aim: To {{help parents}} assess {{disability}} {{in their own}} children using World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, Child and Youth Version (ICF-CY) <b>code</b> <b>qualifier</b> scoring and to assess the validity and reliability of the data sets obtained. Method: Parents of 162 children with spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy, muscular disorders, cerebral palsy, visual impairment, hearing impairment, mental disability, or disability following brain tumours performed scoring for 26 body functions <b>qualifiers</b> (b <b>codes)</b> and activities and participation <b>qualifiers</b> (d <b>codes).</b> Scoring was repeated after 6 [*]months. Psychometric and Rasch data analysis was undertaken. Results: The initial and repeated data had Cronbach α of 0. 96 and 0. 97, respectively. Inter-code correlation was 0. 54 (range: 0. 23 - 0. 91) and 0. 76 (range: 0. 20 - 0. 92). The corrected code-total correlations were 0. 72 (range: 0. 49 - 0. 83) and 0. 75 (range: 0. 50 - 0. 87). When repeated, the ICF-CY <b>code</b> <b>qualifier</b> scoring showed a correlation R of 0. 90. Rasch analysis of the selected ICF-CY code data demonstrated a mean measure of 0. 00 and 0. 00, respectively. <b>Code</b> <b>qualifier</b> infit mean square (MNSQ) had a mean of 1. 01 and 1. 00. The mean corresponding outfit MNSQ was 1. 05 and 1. 01. The ICF-CY code τ thresholds and category measures were continuous when assessed and reassessed by parents. Participating children had a mean of 56 codes scores (range: 26 - 130) before and a mean of 55. 9 scores (range: 25 - 125) after repeat. Corresponding measures were − 1. 10 (range: − 5. 31 to 5. 25) and − 1. 11 (range: − 5. 42 to 5. 36), respectively. Based on measures obtained at the 2 occasions, the correlation coefficient R was 0. 84. The child code map showed coherence of ICF-CY codes at each level. There was continuity in covering the range across disabilities. And, first and foremost, the distribution of codes reflexed a true continuity in disability with codes for motor functions activated first, then codes for cognitive functions, and, finally, codes for more complex functions. Conclusions: Parents can assess their own children in a valid and reliable way, and if the WHO ICF-CY second-level code data set is functioning in a clinically sound way, it can be employed {{as a tool for}} identifying the severity of disabilities and for monitoring changes in those disabilities over time. The ICF-CY codes selected in this study might be one cornerstone in forming a national or even international generic set of ICF-CY codes for the benefit of children with disabilities, their parents, and caregivers and for the whole community supporting with children with disabilities on a daily and perpetual basis...|$|R

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) The interaction of parallel waves, propagating in a water-filled cylindrical wave-guide, {{with a plate}} perpendicular to its axis {{is determined by the}} plate's speci-fic acoustic impedance, the product of density and wave speed. By means of an attached piezoelectric disk-shaped double transducer, (sensor and actuator), the apparent surface impedance of the plate is modified to equal the impddance of the medium, thus establishing a no-reflection situation. The actuator voltage is regulated by a feedback loop, based on an algorithm for complex-root finding. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 1 S.
