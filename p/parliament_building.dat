5|$|In 1907, the {{government}} of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia bought the <b>parliament</b> <b>building</b> and adjacent structures, starting construction of the present <b>parliament</b> <b>building.</b> At the same time, the Zagreb County government moved its headquarters elsewhere, leaving the Sabor as the sole user. The present <b>parliament</b> <b>building</b> was completed in 1911 using the design of Lav Kalda and Karlo Susan.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2004, the {{official}} {{home of the}} Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>Building,</b> in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek <b>Parliament</b> <b>Building,</b> 1843), and the Old <b>Parliament</b> <b>Building</b> (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>Building</b> proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1991, as the {{independence}} declaration moratorium expired, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia.

5|$|On May 3, 2013, the Afghan Green Trend - the {{grassroots}} movement led by Amrullah Saleh - organized a large athletic demonstration {{in support of}} the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). It also aimed at denouncing corruption, calling for a clean city and a clean municipality. The demonstration passed through the Afghan <b>parliament</b> <b>building.</b> The demonstrators chanted against the parliament's alleged corruption and denounced MPs who take bribes.|$|E

5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} resumed in Arusha, and {{the resulting}} set of agreements, known as the Arusha Accords, were signed in August 1993.

5|$|The National Parliament house, {{located on}} the hill above Hibiscus Avenue, built with American aid, is a {{concrete}} structure of conical-shape, which was inaugurated in 1993. The dome has exquisite tapestry, frescoes, and traditional artwork. The <b>parliament</b> <b>building</b> was built {{at a cost of}} US$5million in honour of the 450 US soldiers and 1,200 marines who died during the Guadalcanal operations during the war. Ironically the building was originally built by a Japanese firm.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>Building</b> has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs {{and the use of}} public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997. By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten times greater.|$|E

5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For {{strategic}} reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the <b>parliament</b> <b>building.</b> Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> of its own.|$|E

5|$|Comprising {{an area of}} 1.6ha (4 acres), with a {{perimeter}} of 480m (1570ft), the Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> is located 1km (0.6mi) east of Edinburgh city centre {{on the edge of}} the Old Town. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the Canongate stretch of the Royal Mile on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern side, where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western side. Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex.
