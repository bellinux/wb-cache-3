A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca).</b> However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca).</b> Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca),</b> lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca).</b> Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca).</b> Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{analyses}} of observer {{data collected from}} 2005 to 2009, 22 shark species were observed captured in the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery, with 80% of the shark catch representing five species: blue shark (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca),</b> silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus) and oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) (Bromhead et al., 2012).

40|$|Shark fin, {{used as a}} food, is a {{rich source}} of glycosaminoglyans (GAGs), acidic polysaccharides having {{important}} biological activities, suggesting their nutraceutical and pharmaceutical application. A comprehensive survey of GAGs derived from the fin was performed on 11 elasmobranchs, including several deep sea sharks. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were found in Isurus oxyrinchus, <b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca,</b> Scyliorhinus torazame, Deania calcea, Chlamydoselachus anguineus, Mitsukurina owatoni, Mustelus griseus and Dasyatis akajei, respectively. CS was only found from Chimaera phantasma, Dalatias licha, and Odontaspis ferox, respectively. Characteristic disaccharide units of most of the CS were comprised of C- and D-type units. Interestingly, substantial amount of CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) was found in the dried fin (without skin and cartilage) of Isurus oxyrinchus and <b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca.</b> 1 H-NMR analysis showed that the composition of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and iduronic acid (IdoA) in shark CS/DS was 41. 2 % and 58. 8 % (Isurus oxyrinchus), 36. 1 % and 63. 9 % (<b>Prionace</b> <b>glauca),</b> respectively. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of this CS/DS consisted of E-, B- and D-type units. Shark CS/DS stimulated neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons at a similar level as DS derived from invertebrate species.

A detailed examination of oligosaccharide residues, produced by chondroitinase ACII digestion, suggested that the IdoA and B-type units as well as A- and C-type units were found in clusters in shark CS/DS. In addition, it was discovered that the contents of B-type units in these IdoA-rich domain increased in a length dependent manner, while C- and D-type units were located particularly in the immediate vicinity of the IdoA-rich domain...|$|E

Historical catch rates from the early period of exploitation are of particular importance, since the biomass {{at that time was}} close to a virgin state. The objective of the present study, thus, was to recover and analyze the catch rates of blue sharks caught by five tuna longline vessels operating in the southwestern equatorial Atlantic Ocean, between 1958 and 1962, and to compare the results with the catch rates obtained in more recent years. The results show that both catch composition and blue shark CPUE of tuna longliners operating in the southwestern equatorial Atlantic Ocean, from 1958 - 1962, do not seem to differ much from more recent fishing operations (1986 to 2005).
