40|$|In this study, {{the heat}} {{transfer}} {{in an integrated}} double skin facade (DSF) and phase change material (<b>PCM)</b> blind <b>system</b> has been theoretically analysed. Both heat transfer and airflow models with CFD methods {{have been developed for}} the integrated DSF and <b>PCM</b> blind <b>system.</b> Data from an existing typical DSF building have been obtained in order to define input parameters for the simulation exercise and validate the numerical models. The temperature and velocity fields in DSF with the <b>PCM</b> blind <b>system</b> has been predicted under overheating scenario using the ANSYS Workbench FLUENT software and been compared with case of conventional aluminium blind system. This study has shown that the integrated <b>PCM</b> blind <b>system</b> was able to reduce the average air temperature and outlet temperature of the DSF while improving the convective heat transfer between the cavity air and the blades. Compared with the aluminium blind, the PCM blind can absorb large amount of excessive heat in the cavity.

30|$|An {{additional}} {{problem with}} passive <b>PCM</b> <b>systems</b> is their reliability. Weinlaeder et al. [36] reported that passive <b>PCM</b> <b>systems</b> {{might not work}} in cases such as during long hot days when the PCM could not be completely discharged during the night. Additionally, Soares et al. [51] stated {{that most of the}} studies have been focused on the performance of these systems for extreme summer or winter conditions, eliminating their functionality {{during the rest of the}} seasons. Another barrier reported in literature is the low thermal conductivity of many promising PCMs, which vary in the values between 0.15 and 0.2  W/mK for organic PCMs and around 0.5  W/mK for inorganic salts. The low thermal conductivity decreases the rate of heat absorption and releases throughout the PCM, so that the product may not fully utilize its full latent heat storage [50]. The results of Evola et al. [52] experiments indicated that the PCM wallboards utilized only the 45  % of the possible latent heat storage, due to several factors including thermal conductivity.|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{the work}} in Goia [29] was to {{investigate}} the location of the PCM layer and the nominal melting temperature of the PCM, which are two variables that play significant role in <b>PCM</b> glazing <b>systems.</b> Different <b>PCM</b> glazing configurations had been tested by means of a numerical analysis to assess their behavior with respect to the energy efficiency and thermal performance. The results indicated that the position of the PCM layer has a relevant influence on the thermophysical behavior of the <b>PCM</b> glazing <b>system.</b> <b>PCM</b> glazing <b>systems,</b> especially those with the PCM layer inside the outermost cavity can be beneficial in terms of thermal comfort, while a more complex evaluation is needed when the energy performance is addressed. The results of the work undertaken in Goia et al. [30, 31] have highlighted a good ability of the PCM glazing to store solar energy and to smooth and delay peak values of the total heat flux.|$|R
30|$|In Goia et al. [27], a {{prototype}} of a simple <b>PCM</b> glazing <b>system</b> was proposed, while its behavior was {{compared with that of}} a conventional reference double glazed unit.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to make quantization noise more audibly benign by applying dither. To do this, a noise-like signal {{is added to the}} original signal before quantization. Dither makes the digital system behave as if it has an analog noise-floor. Optimal use of dither (triangular probability density function dither in <b>PCM</b> <b>systems)</b> has the effect of making the rms quantization error independent of signal level, and allows signal information to be retained below the least significant bit of the digital system.|$|R

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) offer {{great potential}} as a latent heat energy storage technique to provide energy efficient systems in new and existing residential buildings. Due to their unique characteristic of high storage densities and latent heat properties, PCMs provide opportunities for greater energy storage in many applications for residential buildings. These applications include, {{but are not limited}} to, solar water heating, space heating/cooling, and waste heat recovery. This study reviews <b>PCM</b> <b>systems</b> in residential building applications, with a focus on their major disadvantages and concludes with proposals for future development. Several disadvantages of PCM use in the given application have been identified and include; super cooling, low thermal conductivity, phase segregation, fire safety, and cost. The issues caused by super cooling and phase segregation lead to thermal cycling degradation, limiting the useful lifecycle of the material. These issues could limit their potential in building applications, which require systems of a long lifespan. Low thermal conductivities can slow down the rate at which heat is distributed or absorbed from the building, which affect the occupants comfort and as well as the efficiency of the system. Ideas based on the current research on ways to limit these disadvantages are included in the study. This study also identifies that further research is required on novel maintenance ways for the <b>PCM</b> <b>systems</b> after they have been installed...|$|R
50|$|The BBC {{has begun}} using audio {{contribution}} over IP in Scotland {{as part of}} the Pacific Quay development in Glasgow. A similar system is being installed in the Regions of England and will be installed in Wales and Northern Ireland. The audio packets are sent using UDP over the BBC’s Layer-3 network. To reduce the chance that the audio is corrupted, quality of service (QoS) is set to ensure that the packets are given priority over other network traffic. The platforms used are the WorldNet Oslo for multiple channel contribution and distribution with the WorldCast Horizon deployed in stereo drop-off locations. The aptX algorithm is used with 24 bit depth and 48 kHz sampling. This is a higher specification than normal CDs, and is used to avoid concatenation effects. There have been problems found in the past when NICAM and MPEG audio paths have been used in sequence in the broadcast chain. The audio heard in the presentation studio has been acceptable, but listeners at home using DAB have complained about artifacts. To avoid this, aptX is used at high bit rates. This is a differential <b>PCM</b> <b>system</b> that does not use psychoacoustic processing. It is able to resynchronise after momentary loss of the IP path without noticeable clicking, and is licensed to most codec manufactures.|$|E
50|$|The main {{production}} run of O Stock consisted of 116 motor cars, which were formed into 58 two-car units. Trials {{began with a}} four-car formation on the District line between High Street Kensington and Putney Bridge in September 1937, and a six-car formation began working on the Hammersmith line in January 1938. There were some technical problems, caused by the demands put on the power supply system when a train of six motor cars started, {{and the amount of}} power that such a train attempted to return to the system when the regenerative brakes were used. This was partially mitigated by ordering a further 58 trailer cars, and converting each two-car unit into a three-car unit, by inserting a trailer car into the formation. A batch of P Stock was then ordered, to replace the trains on the Metropolitan line. Although O and P Stock units could be coupled together, the metadyne units in particular were not the same, and could not be interchanged between the builds. By the early 1950s, this was a serious disadvantage, when a series of failures occurred, which required extensive repairs. A decision was taken to remove the equipment {{and replace it with a}} Pneumatic Cam Motor (<b>PCM)</b> <b>system,</b> using spare controllers from the 1938 tube stock. The first converted train entered service on 31 March 1955, and the stock was redesignated at CO/CP Stock, since it contained cars from both batches. All of the metadyne equipment was subsequently replaced.|$|E

Thermal analysis shows that temperature distribution in the <b>PCM</b> <b>system</b> {{can be considered as}} uniform at any time instant according to the lumped capacitance method; the thermal behaviour of <b>PCM</b> <b>system</b> is thus simulated as a sequence of steady state analyses. Mechanical analysis adopts an axialsymmetric plane analytical model to compare elastic thermal stress distribution for different stainless steels and to identify AISI 316 as the most suitable material for the PCM container. A simple two-bars model and a stress index are also used to allow a physical understanding and a satisfactory interpretation of the <b>PCM</b> <b>system</b> response. Mechanical analysis shows that thermal stresses exceed the yield point of both stainless steels used in the container. A finite element elastic-plastic model is then developed to estimate the extension of the plastic zone. Finally, an alternative <b>PCM</b> <b>system</b> geometry based on concentric pipes is designed to keep the maximum stresses in the PCM container below the yielding point. A sensitivity analysis shows that the most relevant design parameters of the alternative geometry are the diameter of inner pipe and thickness of the external pipe...|$|E
