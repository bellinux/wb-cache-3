5|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from allergies to {{garlic and}} other species of Allium. Symptoms can include {{irritable}} bowel, diarrhea, mouth and throat ulcerations, nausea, breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Garlic-sensitive patients show positive tests to diallyl disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan and allicin, {{all of which are}} present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden lilies, ginger, and bananas.|$|E
25|$|Ladd-Franklin {{concluded}} that color vision evolved in three stages: achromatic vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity. Since red-green sensitivity {{was the last}} to evolve it explains why many <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from red-green color blindness. The next one that affects a small population is blue-yellow color blindness. Since achromatic vision was the first to evolve it explains why {{the majority of the population}} are not affected by black-white color blindness.|$|E

25|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{is the primary}} reason 3.5% of people present to the {{emergency}} department in the United States. Of these individuals, approximately 51% are {{admitted to the hospital}} and 13% are dead within a year. Some studies have suggested that up to 27% of <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from dyspnea, while in dying patients 75% will experience it. Acute shortness of breath is the most common reason people requiring palliative care visit an emergency department.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to large}} amounts of {{naphthalene}} may damage or destroy red blood cells, most commonly in people with the inherited condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which over 400 million <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from. Humans, in particular children, have developed the condition known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene. Symptoms include fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin. Exposure to {{large amounts of}} naphthalene may cause confusion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the urine, and jaundice (yellow coloration of the skin due to dysfunction of the liver).|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} reasons why some <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> from more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Different strains of viruses interacting {{with people with}} different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. Among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement, which happens when {{a person who has}} been previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third or fourth time. The previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} theoretic {{paradigms}} of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> {{when exposed to}} contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, ideals, and values; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative {{to his or her}} prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested to a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.|$|E
500|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI is increasing globally, {{due largely to}} an increase in motor vehicle use in low- and middle-income countries. In developing countries, automobile use has increased faster than safety infrastructure could be introduced. In contrast, vehicle safety laws have decreased rates of TBI in high-income countries, which have seen decreases in traffic-related TBI since the 1970s. Each year in the United States, about two million <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> a TBI, approximately 675,000 injuries are seen in the emergency department, and about 500,000 patients are hospitalized. [...] The yearly {{incidence of}} TBI is estimated at 180–250 per 100,000 people in the US, 281 per 100,000 in France, 361 per 100,000 in South Africa, 322 per 100,000 in Australia, and 430 per 100,000 in England. In the European Union the yearly aggregate incidence of TBI hospitalizations and fatalities is estimated at 235 per 100,000.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} usually resolves itself {{without causing}} permanent complications; however {{it may also}} have long-term ill effects on respiratory function. Most contusions resolve in five to sevendays after the injury. [...] Signs detectable by radiography are usually gone within 10days after the injury—when they are not, other conditions, such as pneumonia, are the likely cause. [...] Chronic lung disease correlates {{with the size of}} the contusion and can interfere with an individual's ability to return to work. Fibrosis of the lungs can occur, resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath), low blood oxygenation, and reduced functional residual capacity for as long as six years after the injury. As late as four years post-injury, decreased functional residual capacity has been found in most pulmonary contusion patients studied. During the six months after pulmonary contusion, up to 90% of <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> difficulty breathing. In some cases, dyspnea persists for an indefinite period. [...] Contusion can also permanently reduce the compliance of the lungs.|$|E

500|$|Deeming Azazel to be [...] "an angry soul", actor Fredric Lehne {{believed}} that the character having been [...] "denied Heaven and everything else that's good in the universe" [...] has [...] " [...] into anger and vengeance". A demon {{with a sense of}} humor, Azazel takes pleasure in seeing <b>people</b> <b>suffer.</b> [...] "The more painmostly psychological painhe causes, the happier he is ... He gets off on the power of turning people to his will", Lehne explained. This quality suggests to the actor why the demon favored Sam as the potential leader of his army. Being the [...] "most ripe for picking" [...] because he had the [...] "sweetest" [...] heart, Sam was [...] "most desirable for corrupting" [...] of all the children; Lehne described Azazel's thought process as, [...] "If I could turn him, then I had truly won." [...] The character's ultimate motivation, however, is to free Lucifer from his imprisonment in Hell. On this, Supernatural co-executive producer Ben Edlund mentioned his view of Azazel as one of [...] "a little cult of demonic true believers" [...] that encompasses many of the important demon characters in the series.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Al-Kateb centred {{on the fact that}} he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the Migration Act about refugees were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless people. In one such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, [...] "SHDB" [...] (in matters concerning asylum seekers, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice Kirby said that [...] "there often is a very good reason... because <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> great risks if their name goes on the Internet that that will become known to the country that they want to avoid," [...] to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, [...] "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country." ...|$|E

[...] Claudia Puig of USA Today groused on how [...] that [...] "there is an audience for a movie in which innocent <b>people</b> <b>suffer</b> hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [...] simply provokes disgust." [...] Justine Elias of The Village Voice asserted that [...] "this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders." [...] David Grove of Film Threat stated that [...] " [...] wasn’t much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which is silly and illogical."
