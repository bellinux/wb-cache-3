40|$|Abstract—To {{support the}} {{evacuation}} process of crowds from emergency situations, {{we have developed}} a wearable device, LifeBelt, for vibro tactile guidance of individuals in <b>panic</b> towards <b>exits.</b> Since visual and auditory perception is overwhelmed in situations of <b>panic,</b> <b>exit</b> sign and loudspeaker based evacuation often appears ineffective. LifeBelt as a coordinated navigation device builds on a subtle directional vibration stimulation to navigate and guide individuals to escape. This paper compares {{the effectiveness of a}} LifeBelt supported vs. non-supported evacuation from spaces with multiple exits. Based on an extended Moore’s model of neighborhood for next step behavior, and a predicted shortest time to escape metric, we investigate on the efficiency effect of (i) individuals following the nearest exit (without LifeBelt), and (ii) individuals adhering LifeBelt recommendations towards the earliest escape exit. Large scale simulations show that even in situations of growing panic, LifeBelt improves evacuation efficiency by more than 34, 5 %...|$|R

5000|$|Electrified exit hardware, {{sometimes}} called [...] "panic hardware" [...] or [...] "crash bars", {{are used in}} fire exit applications. A person wishing to exit pushes against the bar to open the door, making it the easiest of mechanically-free exit methods. Electrified exit hardware can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. A drawback of electrified exit hardware is their complexity, which requires skill to install and maintenance to assure proper function. Only hardware labeled [...] "Fire Exit Hardware" [...] can be installed on fire listed doors and frames and must meet both <b>panic</b> <b>exit</b> listing standards and fire listing standards.|$|R

50|$|Three explosions {{occurred}} {{near the}} country's national sports stadium, the , in the suburb of , resulting in four deaths, including the three suicide bombers. The explosions happened at 21:16, 21:19, and 21:53. The first explosion near the stadium was about 20 {{minutes after the}} start of an international friendly football match between France and Germany, which President Hollande was attending. The first bomber was prevented from entering the stadium after a security guard patted him down and discovered the suicide vest; a few seconds after being turned away, he detonated the vest, killing himself and a bystander. Investigators later surmised that the first suicide bomber had planned to detonate his vest within the stadium, triggering the crowd's <b>panicked</b> <b>exit</b> onto the streets where two other bombers were lying in wait. Ten minutes after the first bombing, the second bomber blew himself up near the stadium. Another 23 minutes after that, the third bomber's vest detonated nearby; according to some reports, that location was at a McDonald's restaurant; others state that the bomb detonated some distance away from any discernible target.|$|R

A locked door barred his way at its end, but a door upon his right opened and he stepped into a dimly-lighted chamber, about the walls of which were three other doors, each of which he tried in turn. Two were locked; the other opened upon a runway leading downward. It was spiral and he could see no farther than the first turn. A door in the corridor he had quitted opened after he had passed, and the third warrior stepped out and followed after him. A faint smile still lingered upon the fellow's grim lips.|$|R

5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim <b>Panic</b> <b>Exit</b> Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead bolt is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the spring latching capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|R

Panic can often occur during mass building evacuations caused by fires or explosions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{effectiveness}} of an evacuation process {{in an emergency}} situation is heavily dependent on {{the understanding of the}} dynamics of crowds. Evidence has been delivered supporting the hypothesis that crowd behavior is self referential in the sense that movement patterns of individuals constitutes crowd movement, which in turn impacts the behavior of individuals. In this paper we build on this evidence and propose a belt like wearable device for vibro tactile directional guidance, LifeBelt, to notify individuals in <b>panic</b> about <b>exits.</b> To assess the potential improvement in evacuation efficiency when using the LifeBelt instead of when not, we empirically analyze the behavior of individuals in panic on the microscopic level, and parameterize large scale simulations (of up to 2000 individuals) with this evidence on the macroscopic level. Simulations show that LifeBelt based guidance can dam...|$|R
