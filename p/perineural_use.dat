40|$|Editor’s {{key points}} † This study investigates {{the effects of}} perineural or {{systemic}} dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine on peripheral nerve block. † Perineural and systemic dexmedetomidine prolonged {{the duration of the}} nerve block with 60 % and 10 %, respectively. † No differences in side-effects were seen between treatments. † Further studies are required to test the safety of <b>perineural</b> <b>use</b> of dexmedetomidine. Background. Dexmedetomidine is an a- 2 -receptor agonist which might be used as an additive to local anaesthetics for various regional anaesthetic techniques. We therefore designed this prospective, double-blinded, controlled volunteer study to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine on peripheral nerve block. Methods. Ultrasound-guided ulnar nerve block (UNB) was performed in 36 volunteers with either 3 ml ropivacaine 0. 75 % (R), 3 ml ropivacaine 0. 75 % plus 20 mg dexmedetomidine (RpD), or 3 ml ropivacaine 0. 75 % plus systemic 20 mg dexmedetomidine (RsD). UNB-related sensory and motor scores were evaluated. Results. Sensory onset time of UNB was not different between the study groups, whereas motor onset time was significantly faster in Group RpD when compared with the other study groups [mean (SD) ] [21 (15) vs 43 (25) min in Group RsD and 47 (36) min in Group R, P, 0. 05 Group RpD vs other groups].

40|$|BACKGROUND: /st>Interscalene {{brachial plexus}} block (ISB) {{provides}} excellent, but time-limited analgesia. Dexamethasone added to local anaesthetics prolongs {{the duration of}} a single-shot ISB. However, systemic glucocorticoids also improve postoperative analgesia. The hypothesis was tested that perineural and i. v. dexamethasone would have an equivalent effect on prolonging analgesic duration of an ISB. METHODS: /st>We performed a prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients presenting for arthroscopic shoulder surgery with an ISB were randomized into three groups: ropivacaine 0. 5 % (R); ropivacaine 0. 5 % and dexamethasone 10 mg (RD); and ropivacaine 0. 5 % with i. v. dexamethasone 10 mg (RDiv). The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, defined as the time between performance of the block and the first analgesic request. Standard hypothesis tests (t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test) were used to compare treatment groups. The primary outcome was analysed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: /st>One hundred and fifty patients were included after obtaining ethical committee approval and patient informed consent. The median time of a sensory block was equivalent for perineural and i. v. dexamethasone: 1405 min (IQR 1015 - 1710) and 1275 min (IQR 1095 - 2035) for RD and RDiv, respectively. There {{was a significant difference}} between the ropivacaine group: 757 min (IQR 635 - 910) and the dexamethasone groups (P I.

40|$|ObjectivesPostoperative {{stump pain}} after major lower limb {{amputation}} {{is a significant}} impediment to the recovery of amputees. The vast majority of patients require opioid analgesics following surgery, which are associated with opioid-related side-effects. Here, we investigate whether intraoperative placement of a peripheral nerve stump catheter followed by continuous infusion of local anesthetic is as effective at pain control as current analgesic practices. If beneficial, this procedure could potentially reduce post-amputation opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse effects. MethodsA retrospective chart review was conducted of 198 patients over a 4 -year period who had undergone a major lower limb amputation for indications related to peripheral vascular disease. Postoperatively, 102 patients received a perineural catheter were compared to 96 patients who did not. The primary outcomes {{of this study were}} the amount of morphine equivalents used in the first 72 hours postoperatively and postoperative pain intensity in the first 24 hours. ResultsA total of 198 lower-limb amputations were selected for analyses. Multiple regression analyses indicated that <b>perineural</b> catheter <b>use</b> was associated with a lower cumulative postoperative opioid consumption over the first 72 hours but not postoperative pain scores at 24 hours. <b>Perineural</b> catheter <b>use</b> led to a 40 % reduction in opioid use during the first 72 hours postoperatively.

40|$|Ultrasound {{guidance}} is now {{common in}} regional anaesthesia practice, but remains limited by poor visibility {{of the needle}} tip and poor quantification of local anaesthetic spread. Sonoelastography based on tissue compression is a technique depicting tissue strain. Hitherto used largely for tumour diagnosis, we used it in both Thiel embalmed cadavers and two patients receiving interscalene and femoral blocks to observe changes in tissue strain during local anaesthetic injection. The primary aim of our study was to measure the area under the curve (weighted for time) of the strain pattern in Thiel <b>perineural</b> tissue when <b>using</b> a range of volumes of embalming fluid (0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 ml) for interscalene and femoral blocks using sonoelastography. Our secondary aims were to evaluate static images of anatomy and videos of needle insertion and <b>perineural</b> injection <b>using</b> combined B-Mode ultrasound and sonoelastography. Independent raters assessed the anatomy and spread using a 7 -point Likert scale, ranked from extremely poor to extremely good. We performed 83 blocks in cadavers. Concordance between both raters was good, with weighted Kappa (95 % CI) 0. 66 (0. 61 – 0. 71). The characteristics of spread were similar with both interscalene and femoral block; spread increased with injectate volume up to 1 ml. Analysis of variance showed differences in spread between injection volumes (p = 0. 009), but not between regional blocks (p = 0. 05). Post-hoc analysis showed greater spread with 1 and 2. 5 ml volumes compared with 0. 25 ml. In patients, visibility of strain during injection was better with sonoelastography than with B-Mode ultrasound and showed a dose response from 1 to 5 ml volumes of local anaesthetic. Colour strain recognition using sonoelastography offers the ability to differentiate between nerve and surrounding tissue during local anaesthetic injection by improving visibility of spread (p = 0. 04) ...|$|R

Although various O-mannosylated proteins {{have been identified in}} the recent years, the distribution of O-mannosyl glycans in the mammalian brain and target proteins are still not well defined. In the present study, rabbit monoclonal antibodies directed against the O-mannosylated peptide YAT(α 1 -Man) AV were generated. Detailed characterization of clone RKU- 1 - 3 - 5 revealed that this monoclonal antibody recognizes O-linked mannose also in different peptide and protein contexts. Using this tool, we observed that mono-O-mannosyl glycans occur ubiquitously throughout the murine brain but are especially enriched at inhibitory GABAergic neurons and at the <b>perineural</b> nets. <b>Using</b> a mass spectrometry-based approach, we further identified glycoproteins from the murine brain that bear single O-mannose residues. Among the candidates identified are members of the cadherin and plexin superfamilies and the perineural net protein neurocan.

40|$|Herniated {{intervertebral}} disc causes {{in a great}} number of cases of lumbar nerve root compression, especially in the segment L 5 /S 1. Other reasons responsible for stress to the lumbar spinal root are the spinal canal stenosis and the postdiscotomy syndrome. For patients without neurological deficiencies, the conservative treatment includes different epidural injection techniques. Steroids are often applied. A specific injection technique needing only a small drug amount is the epidural <b>perineural</b> approach <b>using</b> a special two-needle technique. The anatomical spaces of the nerve roots have received little attention in therapy. We have determined the anterolateral epidural space nerve volume of the nerve root L 5 /S 1, and compared the data collected in an anatomical study with operative measurements during discectomy. The volume determination in the human cadavers was performed with liquid silicone filling the anterolateral space after dissection. The in vivo measurements were performed during surgery {{at the site of the}} anterolateral space after discectomy. The anatomical studies showed us a mean value volume of 1. 1  ml. The surgical volume determinations result in a mean volume of 0. 9  ml.

40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDA) is a fatal and insidious {{malignant disease}} for which clinicians’ tools are restricted {{by the current}} limits in knowledge of how tumor and stromal cells act during the disease. Among PDA hallmarks, neural remodeling (NR) and perineural invasion (PNI) drastically influence {{quality of life and}} patient survival. Indeed, NR and PNI are associated with neuropathic pain and metastasis, respectively, both of which impact clinicians’ decisions and therapeutic options. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact and clinical relevance of the peritumoral microenvironment, through pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP/REG 3 A) expression, on PNI in pancreatic cancer. First, we demonstrated that, in PDA, PAP/REG 3 A is produced by inflamed acinar cells from the peritumoral microenvironment and then enhances the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells. More specifically, <b>using</b> <b>perineural</b> ex vivo assays we revealed that PAP/REG 3 A favors PNI through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in cancer cells. Finally, we analyzed the level of PAP/REG 3 A in blood from healthy donors or patients with PDA from three independent cohorts. Patients with high levels of PAP/REG 3 A had overall shorter survival as well as poor surgical outcomes with reduced disease-free survival. Our study provides a rationale for using the PAP/REG 3 A level as a biomarker to improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. It also suggests that therapeutic targeting of PAP/REG 3 A activity in PDA could limit tumor cell aggressiveness and PNI. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Perineural</b> {{catheter}} insertion <b>using</b> ultrasound guidance {{alone is}} a relatively new approach. Previous studies have shown that ultrasound-guided catheters take less time to place with high placement success rates, but the analgesic efficacy compared with the established stimulating catheter technique remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter insertion relying exclusively on ultrasound guidance results in superior postoperative analgesia compared with stimulating catheters. Preoperatively, subjects receiving a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter for foot or ankle surgery were assigned randomly to either ultrasound guidance (bolus via needle with non-stimulating catheter insertion) or electrical stimulation (bolus via catheter). We used 1. 5 % mepivacaine 40  mL for the primary surgical nerve block and 0. 2 % ropivacaine (basal 8  mL·hr− 1; bolus 4  mL; 30  min lockout) was infused postoperatively. The primary outcome was average surgical pain on postoperative day one. Forty of the 80 subjects enrolled were randomized to each treatment group. One of 40 subjects (2. 5 %) in the ultrasound group failed catheter placement per protocol vs nine of 40 (22. 5 %) in the stimulating catheter group (P =  0. 014). The difference in procedural duration (mean [95 % confidence interval (CI) ]) was − 6. 48 (− 9. 90 - − 3. 05) min, with ultrasound requiring 7. 0 (4. 0 - 14. 1) min vs stimulation requiring 11. 0 (5. 0 - 30. 0) min (P <  0. 001). The average pain scores of subjects who provided data on postoperative day one were somewhat higher for the 33 ultrasound subjects than for the 26 stimulation subjects (5. 0 [1. 0 - 7. 8] vs 3. 0 [0. 0 - 6. 5], respectively; P =  0. 032), a difference (mean [95 %CI]) of 1. 37 (0. 03 - 2. 71). For popliteal-sciatic perineural catheters, ultrasound guidance takes less time and results in fewer placement failures compared with stimulating catheters. However, analgesia may be mildly improved with successfully placed stimulating catheters. Clinical trial registration number NCT 00876681...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{regional}} anaesthesia and regional postoperative analgesia {{are common in}} perioperative management of patients in traumatology-orthopaedics. One of most challenging fields of traumatology-orthopaedics is shoulder surgery. Shoulder surgery is associated with intense and long-lasting postoperative pain. It affects patients’ well-being, limits limb function and worsens results of surgical treatment. Determination of optimal methods for postoperative pain relief {{is very important in}} clinical practice. Several modern studies compared methods of systemic analgesia with continuous interscalene infusion of bupivacaine 0, 15 - 0, 25 % solution. Application of these concentrations of bupivacaine resulted in sufficient analgesia but profound motor blockade and anaesthetic toxicity were observed. There are few studies on interscalene infusions of small concentrations of bupivacaine. Data on effects of small doses of bupivacaine on intensity of motor blockade and adjuvant drugs on postoperative analgesia is lacking. AIM OF THE STUDY: to evaluate the quality of post-operative pain treatment after shoulder surgery <b>using</b> continuous <b>perineural</b> infusions of different concentrations (0. 1 % and 0. 15 %) of bupivacaine and bupicacaine (0. 1 %) in combination with adjuvant clonidine and effects on operated hand motor function. To assess clinical advisability of interscalene brachial plexus identification and catheterization using G. Meier’s technique. 159 patients scheduled for elective shoulder surgery were included in the study. Preoperatively all patients received interscalene plexus brachialis blockade and <b>perineural</b> catheterisation <b>using</b> technique described by G. Meier. 80 patients randomly assigned into two groups were included in double blind placebo controlled prospective study which dealt with technical and clinical aspects of interscalene blockade described by G. Meier. Analgetic efficacy of continuous interscalene perineural infusion 10 ml/h of bupivacaine 0, 15 % was evaluated. 79 patients randomly assigned into three groups were included in double blind placebo controlled prospective study which dealt with optimal dose of bupivacaine finding and effects of clonidine on quality of analgesia of continuous interscalene perineural infusion. Clinical aspects of continuous (5 ml/h) patients controlled (additional boluses 2, 5 ml/ 0, 5 h) interscalene infusions of bupivacaine 0, 15 %, bupivacaine 0, 1 % and bupivacaine 0, 1 % plus clonidine 1 mcg/ml were assessed. 9 of 159 patients were excluded from the study due to catheter dislocation and incomplete blockade in the postoperative period. During the study pain intensity, quality of analgesia, intensity of motor blockade, side effects, complications and vital sign were assessed for three postoperative days. RESULTS: 1. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade using G. Meier’s technique ensured adequate anaesthesia, sufficient extent of sensory block and high success rates of postoperative brachial plexus analgesia with minimal rate of side-effects and complications. 2. Continuous perineural infusions of 10 ml/h of bupivacaine 0. 15 % resulted in more effective analgesia as compared to systemic pain relief. 3. Continuous patient-controlled perineural infusions of bupivacaine 0. 1 % were less successful in reducing post-operative pain than bupivacaine 0. 15 % perineural infusions. 4. The use of clonidine enhanced the effect of local anaesthetics: the intensity of post-operative pain was comparable in patients having received continuous patient-controlled perineural infusions either of bupivacaine 0. 15 % or of bupivacaine 0. 1 % in combination with clonidine but was higher in patients having received bupivacaine 0. 1 % infusions. 5. The use of continuous patient-controlled perineural infusions of 0. 1 % bupivacaine in combination with clonidine resulted in the lowest intensity of hand motor blockade as compared to patient-controlled perineural infusions of bupivacaine 0. 15 % and 0. 1 % and continuous infusion 10 ml/h of bupivacaine 0. 15 %. DISCUSSION. The study shows that continuous interscalene perineural local anaesthetic infusion is a safe method of postoperative analgesia. It is more effective that current methods of systemic pain relief. Addition of clonidine to local anaesthetic solution enabled to decrease local anaesthetic concentration preserving quality of analgesia and minimising motor blockade of operated arm. Results of the study are important in clinical practice. It allows early postoperative rehabilitation and recovery of arm function with minimal side effects.
