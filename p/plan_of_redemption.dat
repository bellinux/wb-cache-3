2500|$|Hildegard of Bingen [...] "presents {{the most}} complex Mariology of Medieval German women writers." [...] While {{following}} the traditional juxtaposition of Eve and Mary, in the illustrated Scivias, Adam is depicted as listening to the tempter, and thus bears equal blame. Of the sixty-three songs in Hildegard's Symphonia, sixteen focus {{on the role of}} Mary in salvation history, the most dedicated to any one figure. In Hildegard’s Mariology, Mary assumes the status of an essential, active partner in the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> A second characteristic Marian theme, is that of the Virgin Mother healing the brokenness brought into the world by the first mother, Eve. Hildegard belongs more to the Romanesque than the Gothic Age. Untouched by a new affective style of piety that friars will popularize across Europe, Hildegard’s Mary, like her overall spirituality is monastic.|$|E

This view explains why the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> cannot be waived in the initial loan documents, and why it can be waived in subsequent workouts only if the court is convinced of the fairness of the waiver. Moreover, this article demonstrates that, even if the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an efficient term in most mortgages, an adverse selection dynamic may prevent parties from including it in their contracts, thus justifying the judicial insistence that the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> be a mandatory, rather than default, term...|$|R

2500|$|The resurrection story {{appears in}} more than five {{locations}} in the Bible. In several episodes in the Four Gospels Jesus foretells his coming death and resurrection, which he states is the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> God the Father. Christians view the resurrection of Jesus as part <b>of</b> the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> salvation and <b>redemption</b> by atonement for man's sin. Belief in a bodily resurrection of the dead became well established within some segments of Jewish society in the centuries {{leading up to the}} time of Christ, as recorded by Daniel , from the mid-2nd century BC: [...] "Many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting peril". Josephus (1st century AD) gives the following outline: The Pharisees believed in Resurrection of the Dead, and the Sadducees did not. The Sadducees, politically powerful religious leaders, rejected the afterlife, angels, and demons as well as the Pharisees' oral law. The Pharisees, whose views became Rabbinic Judaism, eventually won (or at least survived) this debate. The promise of a future resurrection appears in the Torah as well as in certain Jewish works, such as the Life of Adam and Eve, c 100 BC, and the Pharisaic book 2 Maccabees, c 124 BC.|$|R
