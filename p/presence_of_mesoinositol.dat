40|$|Tissus {{cultures}} of Tecoma stans Juss. cultivated on modified Murashige-Skoog medium (RT-k) were phytochemically analysed {{by means of}} chromatographical methods (PC, TLC). The following products were found as metabolites: phenolic acids - chlorogenics, caffeic, ferulic, vanillic, o-coumaric and sinapic; steroids - β-sitosterol; triterpenes - ursolic and oleanolic acids, α-amyrine; sugars - glucose, fructose, sucrose, xylose. Meso-inositol was isolated in 0. 8 % yield. In intact plant leaves, some differences concerning the content and/or number of individual compounds were observed, namely: lack of sinapic acid and occurrence of p-coumaric acid, lower content of β-sitosterol, lack of oleanolic acid, occurrence of β-amyrine and of one unidentified triterpenoid, lack of xylose, occurrence of maltose, raffinose, and stachiose. The level <b>of</b> <b>mesoinositol</b> inn leaves was distincly lower than in the callus tissues. Neither in callus tissues nor in leaves iridoid glycosides were found...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the association between clinical parameters and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active caries lesions on the occlusal surface of first permanent molars. Forty eight children (5. 8 - 13. 8 years-old) with at least one first permanent molar present were selected. The clinical parameters evaluated were gender, age, DMF-T and dmf-t, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active white spots in other teeth, general plaque index, tooth's dental arch (upper or lower), tooth's side (right or left), <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> visible plaque and eruption degree of the first permanent molars. The first permanent molars were evaluated through visual inspection by two examiners in order to assess the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active or inactive caries lesions on the occlusal surface. Univariate and multivariate analyses for determination of the association between clinical parameters and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active caries lesions in these teeth were performed. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active white spots in other teeth was associated with the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active caries lesions in the first permanent molars, in both univariate and multivariate analyses (Odds ratio = 8. 8 and 1. 9, respectively). The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> abundant visible plaque on the occlusal surface of the first permanent molars (Odds ratio = 3. 5 in the univariate analysis, and 3. 9 in the multivariate one) also presented a significant association. In conclusion, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active white spots in other teeth and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> considerable visible plaque were associated with the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> active caries lesions on the occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars...|$|R

After 8 h of exposure to nitrate in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 1 mM Asn, tissue nitrate accumulation was reduced at 250 [mu]M external nitrate, but not at 5 mM Asn. The induction of nitrate reductase (NR) activity was reduced at both external nitrate concentrations. In the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 1 mM Gln or 1 % Suc, tissue nitrate concentration was not significantly altered, but the induction of root NR activity was reduced or enhanced, respectively. The induction of root nitrite reductase (NiR) activity was also reduced in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Asn or Gln and enhanced in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Suc. Transcript levels of NR and NiR in roots were reduced in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the amides and enhanced in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Suc. When Suc was present in combination with either amide, there was complete relief from the inhibition of NiR transcription observed in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> amide alone.
