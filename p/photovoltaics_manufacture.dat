Photovoltaic devices are comprised of layered structures where the electrical, chemical, and physical properties at the multiple interfaces {{play a significant role in}} the operation of the completed device. This thesis attempts to establish a relationship between interfacial properties and overall device performance by investigation of both the organic/organic heterojunction interface, as well as the interface between the inorganic substrate and the first organic layer with useful insights towards enhancing the efficiency of organic solar cells. It has been proposed that residual chemical species may act as barriers to charge transfer at the interface between the transparent conductor (TCO) and the first organic layer, possibly causing a large contact resistance and leading to reduced device performance. Previous work has investigated the surface of the TCO but no baseline characterization of carbon-free surfaces has previously been given. In this work clean surfaces are investigated to develop a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic spectra such that further analyses of contaminated surfaces can be presented systematically and reproducibly to develop a chemical model of the TCO surface. The energy level offset at the organic/organic heterojunction has been proposed to relate to the maximum potential achievable for a solar cell under illumination, however, few experimental observations have been made where both the interface characterization and device performance are presented. Photovoltaic properties are examined in this work with titanyl phthalocyanine used as a novel donor material for enhancement of spectral absorption and optimization of the open-circuit potential. Characterization of the interface between TiOPc and C 60 coupled with characterization of the interface between copper phthalocyanine and C 60 shows that the higher ionization potential of TiOPc does correlate to greater open circuit potentials.

Design/methodology/approach: The topography of laser textured surfaces were investigated using DSM 940 OPTON scanning electron microscope and LSM 5 Pascal ZEISS confocal laser scanning microscope. The reflectance of produced textures was measured by Perkin-Elmer Lambda spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Electrical parameters of manufactured solar cells were characterized by measurements of I-V light characteristics under standard AM 1. 5 radiation. Findings: Solar cells manufactured from laser-textured polycrystalline silicon wafers demonstrate worse electrical performance than cells manufactured from the non-textured wafers after saw damage removal as well as wafers textured by etching in alkaline solutions. Etching of textured surface in 20 % KOH solution at temperature of 80 ºC subsequent to laser processing shows to have a greatly increased impact on electrical performance of solar cells. Research limitations/implications: Continued etching to remove laser induced defects cause the texture to flatten out reducing it optical effectiveness.

40|$|If {{photovoltaic}} {{solar cells}} and modules {{are to be}} used as a major source of power generation it is important to have a good knowledge and understanding of their long-term performance under different climatic and operating conditions. A number of studies of the long-term performance of commercially available <b>photovoltaic</b> modules <b>manufactured</b> using different technologies have now been reported in the literature. These have shown clear differences in the seasonal and long term performance and stability of different solar cell techniques. In addition to general module engineering factors that result in a loss of performance in all modules some types of solar cells, such as those made from thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), also suffer specific losses in performance due to fundamental material changes, such as photodegradation or the Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE). A field evaluation of the long term performance of state-of-the-art crystalline and amorphous silicon photovoltaic modules in Australian conditions is currently being undertaken at Murdoch University. The initial results from this monitoring program are reported. This paper also reports on laboratory and field studies being undertaken on the nature of the Staebler-Wronski effect in amorphous silicon solar cells and how the stability of these cells is affected by different operating conditions. Based on a mechanism for the SWE in a-Si:H solar cells developed as a result of our research we propose a number of possible ways to reduce the Staebler-Wronski effect in a-Si:H solar cells. Data on the long-term performance of commercially available photovoltaic modules culled from the literature show differences in the seasonal and long-term operation and stability of various cells.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} processes and outcomes of Chinese government {{efforts to address}} national environmental problems through master planned "green development" projects. These large-scale spatial planning projects include eco-city and eco-industrial parks, and integrate goals for industrial, urban and rural development. Such efforts explicitly attempt to simultaneously "green" the economy, society and space; that is, to reduce the negative environmental impact of economic growth, to produce the social norms to support optimized use of resources, and to construct the human-ecological places where an "ecological civilization" can flourish. I find that the ideology of green development, taken from international and national sources, is projected onto local processes of place making. This process works to construct environmental resources at trans-local scales, and to justify rural dispossession as environmentally rational. I then document how national environmental governance agendas target rural society and space as backward and as the necessary site for intervention. I argue that green development in China extends practices of rural dispossession and deepens patterns of urban-rural inequality. Furthermore, I demonstrate that these patterns present significant negative environmental externalities as local governments transform rural landscapes to provide cheap land and financing for projects of China's "Green Leap Forward. " To explore the policies, institutions and practices that make up these processes, this dissertation focuses on Yixing, a third-tier city in Jiangsu province, where the construction of eco-city, solar and other `green' industry projects have been yoked as the engines for rural transformation. To begin, I describe the national and regional contexts of environmental industry construction and eco-city planning. I document the growth of solar manufacturing, eco-city construction and linked projects for agricultural modernization and ecological conservation that have required the enclosure of over 330 square-kilometers of rural land and the displacement of over 55, 000 residents since 2006. The local government expects to displace another 50, 000 residents in master planned rural-urban transformation by 2020. I further document how these primarily state-led processes of dispossession and development planning refigure rural state-society and social-environmental relationships in the rapid construction of "new" ecologically rational city-regions. I argue that these processes are fundamentally linked to a revaluation of rural environmental resources and forms of agrarian transition that entail dispossession {{and the elimination of}} the land ownership system, which is bifurcated between state-urban and collective-rural structures. I analyze three processes through which this strategy unfolds. First, I examine the construction of a model of green development based on master-planned eco-urbanization and rural environmental governance at regional and national scales. I document and analyze the institutionalization of green development in the national policies of the Chinese government, the practices of municipal agencies, and in the approaches of transnational experts and businesses operating in China. I demonstrate that this model envisions a reallocation of rural land resources for master planned urban expansion. As its primary rationale, the model seeks to address the historical environmental failures of China's present model of industrial modernization and is predicated on restructuring municipal authority over rural land use. Second, I document how these changes shape agrarian transition by revaluing rural land as an environmental resource. I examine the environmental justification of rural dispossession and the dissolution of collective land tenure rights as economically and environmentally untenable. I argue that as rural livelihoods come to be designated as environmentally irrational and rural land is made into an object of planning, environmental value is paradoxically abstracted and divided from actual landscapes. I demonstrate that rural cash assets as well as land are enclosed into green development and contribute to circuits of accumulation based on "exporting sustainability. " I show how the processes of eviction and resettlement re-inscribe historical urban-rural inequalities into a new geography of peri-urban segregation and class differentiation. Third, I argue that environmentalization in China is fundamentally tied to structural changes in territorial-administrative authority. Through an examination of local governmental practices in planning and land management, I document the construction of spatial uniformity and land resources at the national scale. I argue that in deploying a national land-use quota system, local governments fundamentally reshape the land management regime so that instead of managing the land itself, abstracted quanta of land are the objects that are being governed. This leads to negative social-environmental consequences that manifest in specific localities, and that undermine goals of sustainability at all scales. As a case study, I examine the rapid state-facilitated construction of the solar photovoltaics industry in Yixing through subsidies in land, infrastructure and finance capital. Such practices link rural dispossession in China to the global green economy. Additionally, large-scale and rapid construction on greenfield sites produces direct and indirect land-use change impacts on the carbon efficiency of solar <b>photovoltaics</b> <b>manufactured</b> in Yixing and elsewhere...|$|R
