5000|$|The {{requirement}} {{to include an}} antiquark means that many classes of <b>pentaquark</b> are hard to identify experimentally - if the flavour of the antiquark matches the flavour of any other quark in the quintuplet, it will cancel out and the particle will resemble its three-quark hadron cousin. For this reason, early <b>pentaquark</b> searches looked for particles where the antiquark did not cancel. In the mid-2000s, several experiments claimed to reveal <b>pentaquark</b> states. In particular, a resonance with a mass of [...] (4.6 &sigma;) was reported by LEPS in 2003, the [...] This coincided with a <b>pentaquark</b> state with a mass of [...] predicted in 1997.
