Janet had scarcely reached the end of her circumstantial narrative how the attack came on and what were her aunt's sensations--a narrative to which Mrs. Patten, in her neatly-plaited nightcap, seemed to listen with a contemptuous resignation to her niece's historical inaccuracy, contenting herself with occasionally confounding Janet by a shake of the head--when the clatter of a horse's hoofs on the yard pavement announced the arrival of Mr. Pilgrim, whose large, top-booted person presently made its appearance upstairs.

6000|$|All {{this time}} he was acutely aware of the {{existence}} of the Young Lady in Grey and her companion in brown, as a child in the dark is of Bogies. Sometimes he could hear their pneumatics stealing upon him from behind, and looking round saw a long stretch of vacant road. Once he saw far ahead of him a glittering wheel, but it proved to be a workingman riding to destruction on a very tall ordinary. And he felt a curious, vague uneasiness about that Young Lady in Grey, for which he was altogether unable to account. Now that he was awake he had forgotten that accentuated Miss Beaumont that had been quite clear in his dream. But the curious dream conviction, that the girl was not really the man's sister, would not let itself be forgotten. Why, for instance, should a man want to be alone with his sister {{on the top of a}} tower? At Milford his bicycle made, so to speak, an ass of itself. A finger-post suddenly jumped out at him, vainly indicating an abrupt turn to the right, and Mr. Hoopdriver would have slowed up and read the inscription, but no!--the bicycle would not let him. The road dropped a little into Milford, and the thing shied, put down its head and bolted, and Mr. Hoopdriver only thought of the brake when the fingerpost was passed. Then to have recovered the point of intersection would have meant dismounting. For as yet there was no road wide enough for Mr. Hoopdriver to turn in. So he went on his way--or to be precise, he did exactly the opposite thing. The road to the right was the Portsmouth road, and this he was on went to Haslemere and Midhurst. By that error it came about that he once more came upon his fellow travellers of yesterday, coming on them suddenly, without the slightest <b>preliminary</b> <b>announcement</b> and when they least expected it, under the Southwestern Railway arch.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} new {{evidence}} on the rationality of di#erent data releases of industrial production (IP) and prices (both PPI and CPI). A number of features di#erentiate our work from earlier research. First, we examine new monthly "realtime " data sets which include the entire revision history of the data, rather than just <b>preliminary</b> <b>announcements</b> and fully revised data. This allows us to consider the properties of all historical releases of the data. In particular, {{we are able to}} assess whether earlier releases are in any sense "less rational" than later releases, and our findings suggest that both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted IP releases become rational after around 3 - 6 data revisions. Additionally, the same result holds for unadjusted PPI, while all releases of unadjusted CPI are rational. However, all seasonally adjusted price data remain irrational for at least 12 months after initial release. In addition, the approach we take enables us to include revision histories in the information sets used to examine the rationality of a particular release of data. This in turn allows us to assess whether the revision process itself is predictable, and hence of use for providing "better" preliminary releases of data, for example. For all variables examined, we find evidence of this form of predictability. Since business cycle asymmetry is a stylized characteristic of economic activity, we argue that {{there is no reason to}} preclude the possibility that nonlinearities in economic behavior manifest themselves in the form of nonlinearities in the rationality of early releases of economic data. We therefore test whether nonlinearities are present in the revision process, based on separate analysis of expansionary and recessionary economic episodes, and based on a s [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates empirically {{the impact}} of {{earnings}} on credit risk in the multi-trillion dollar Credit Default Swap (CDS) market. In contrast to bonds and secondary loans, CDSs are almost “pure ” credit risk instruments being relatively free of covenants, guarantees, imbedded options and coupons.

40|$|Attribution bias {{refers to}} the {{tendency}} of people to attribute successes to their own abilities but failures to external factors. In a business context an internal factor might be the restructuring of the firm and an external factor might be an unfavourable change in exchange or interest rates.

40|$|Gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) {{is one of}} the most important economic performance indicators for any country that is closely watched by governments, businesses and financial communities. GDP often influences economic decisions and policy-making. These decisions are however often based on <b>preliminary</b> initial <b>announcements</b> by statistical agencies. The preliminary estimates are then revised as more comprehensive information becomes available. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the initial GDP announcements are unbiased, efficient and can be relied on. This study focuses on seasonally adjusted and annualised (qq) growth rates at constant prices for the following national accounts aggregates: GDP, gross domestic expenditure (GDE), final consumption expenditure by households and general government, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), Exports and imports of goods and services, gross national income (GNI) and disposable income of households. The research methodology used is based on descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression estimations. The results of the study indicate that little confidence should be attributed to interpretations of the initially announced estimates for GDP, GDE, final consumption expenditure by households, GNI and disposable income by households. The study found evidence that suggests that the initial announcements are biased and inefficient. This implies that the initial announcements contain measurement errors that could be eliminated in order to become a better forecast of the final or true value. This further suggests a lack of expected reliability of existing and future initial announcements of the estimates. For short-term analysis the users of GDP data are encouraged to focus on different measures. It is also recommended that the statistical agents producing South Africa’s national accounts aggregates improve their statistical compilation processes.

It can occur prior to the base FPP, between the base FPP and SPP, and following the base SPP. 1. Pre-expansion: an adjacency pair that may be understood as preliminary to the main course of action. A generic pre-expansion is a summon-answer adjacency pair, as in [...] "Mary?"/ [...] "Yes?".It is generic {{in the sense that it}} does not contribute to any particular types of base adjacency pair, such as request or suggestion.

Insert expansion allows a possibility for a second speaker, the speaker who must produce the SPP, to do interactional work relevant to the projected SPP.
