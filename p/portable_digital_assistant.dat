It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the SuperH and MIPS architectures in the <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant</b> market. Microsoft subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their Pocket PC platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the StrongARM intellectual property was sold to Intel. They continued to produce StrongARM, as well as developing it into the XScale architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to Marvell Technology Group in 2006.|$|E

40|$|Many {{regulations}} {{mandate that}} government employees inspect economic entities {{on a regular}} basis. In this paper, we show that a small innovation in inspection technology can make substantial differences in inspection outcomes. For restaurant hygiene inspections, the state of Florida has introduced a handheld electronic device, the <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant</b> (PDA), which reminds inspectors of about 1, 000 potential violations that may be checked for. Using administrative data on inspections conducted from July 2003 to June 2009, {{we find that the}} adoption of PDAs led to 11 % more detected violations. Subsequent inspection outcome suggests that restaurants may have increased their compliance efforts gradually. Although there could be other explanations for the inspection outcome, we find that PDA use is significantly correlated with a reduction in restaurant-related foodborne disease outbreaks...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an ongoing}} study into issues {{relevant to the}} design of learning objects for educational applications via <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant</b> (PDA) technology. The specific areas of inquiry in this study are: the kinds of learning objects that are effective for PDA delivery; contexts for their effective educational applications; and learning object designs that overcome the limitations of the small display area characteristic of this kind of technology. Initial qualitative data was collected through interviews with respondents who had previously used this technology in teaching and learning. This preliminary data suggests that a learning object effective for PDA delivery should be designed as a resource that supports student-centered learning activities, such as inquiries and problem solving. In particular, two types of learning objects appear to emerge as appropriate for PDA delivery: information objects and conceptual models. The preliminary data of this ongoing study also suggests some interesting ideas regarding more effective design of learning objects for delivery via PDA technology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This has resulted in wide diversity of video content with spatial and temporal properties fitting into their intended rendering devices. However the sheer ubiquity of video content creation and distribution mechanisms has effectively blurred the classification line resulting in the need for interchangeable rendering of video content across devices of varying spatio-temporal properties. This results in a need for efficient and effective conversion techniques; mostly to increase the resolution (referred to as super resolution) in-order to enhance quality of perception, user satisfaction and overall the utility of the video content...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to implement multimedia access platforms: reconfigurable oriented co-design. Nowadays we observe a rapid and mutant evolution of multimedia standards and its de facto adoption into many consumer electronics, such as audio/video appliances, digital set-top boxes for TV access networks, mobile technologies and <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants</b> (PDAs). Among the disadvantages of current multimedia access platforms, we can mention the relative high cost, the very short obsolescence cycles, the communication and computational performance limitations, the large sizes of software components, and system architectures that do not match future multimedia standards requirements. To overcome these, we propose {{the use of a}} reconfigurable computing architecture to implement a family of multimedia access platforms. As an example, we present an implementation of a multimedia access platform that runs a web browser (HTML 3. 2 compatible) over a 32 -bit RISC microprocessor, described using less than 256 Kbytes of data to represent software and hardware components on a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Portable {{computers}} including laptops, notebooks, sub- notebooks and <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants</b> are {{a rapidly}} growing segment of the computer market. Manufacturers of portable computers {{have an opportunity to}} win public praise and to avoid censure and liability by embracing green design and sensible product disposal systems. This paper analyzes the environmental issues associated with disposal, re-use and recycling of these machines, focusing on potential design changes to alleviate environmental burdens. Portable computers can replace larger machines, resulting in lower energy use and lower overall material demand. Since the number of portable computers purchased may be as many as 100 million over the next decade, environmental concerns become increasingly important. Portable computers use batteries with toxic components, so there are disposal or recycling problems. Another significant issue in assessment of disposal and recycling processes is the expected life time of portable computers. Machine design with capability for easy upgrade can be expected to have a longer useful life. The paper uses experience gained in several generations of wearable computer designs at Carnegie Mellon University for illustration. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks use the delaytolerant {{architecture}} and protocols {{to overcome the}} disruptions in network connectivity. These concepts help {{in cases where the}} network is sparse or with large variations in density or there is no end-to-end connectivity, by providing a communications solution for non real-time applications. This paper presents data fragmentation techniques to optimize the efficiency of data delivery for the case of the short node contacts that characterize vehicle networks. The techniques were tested in a laboratory environment with <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants</b> and Lego Mindstorm NXT robotic cars. If no fragmentation is used, only small messages are successfully transferred. Proactive fragmentation fragments messages to a predefined size in the source node. Reactive fragmentation adjusts the fragment sizes to the real duration of the contact when it is broken. Reactive fragmentation showed a good efficiency in adapting the fragmentation in real time to the contact duration. Proactive fragmentation can perform slightly better if the fragment sizes are carefully chosen as it requires less processing. As this choice is difficult, reactive fragmentation is more practical to use. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of modem portable computational {{devices such as}} cellular phones and <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants</b> (PDAs) is currently limited {{by the lack of}} an effective method for text entry. The currently available input options (such as the 12 -key phone pad and PDA touch screens) are a quarter to a third of the speed of the standard desktop QWERTY keyboards. Therefore, it is slow and frustrating for people to use these systems for any significant text input, such as writing emails, taking notes in a meeting, or writing down thoughts while on-the-go. The proposed solution is a one-handed, hand-held, wireless, portable keyboard that would allow the mobile device user to achieve speeds closer to the desktop standard while performing text-entry tasks. Previously developed handheld input devices employ unfamiliar typing systems, are too large, or are not ergonomically comfortable, which may be the reasons they have not been widely adopted by the public. The device described in this paper is small enough to store in one's pocket, is inconspicuous during use, and is adjustable so that the keys reach the fingers in their natural curved position...|$|R

40|$|Current {{risk from}} {{transfusion}} is {{largely because of}} noninfectious hazards and defects in the overall process of delivering safe transfusion therapy. Safe transfusion therapy depends on a complex process that requires integration and coordination among multiple hospital services including laboratory medicine, nursing, anesthesia, surgery, clerical support, and transportation. The multidisciplinary hospital transfusion committee has been traditionally charged with oversight of transfusion safety. However, in recent years, this committee may have been neglected in many institutions. Resurgence in hospital oversight of patient safety and transfusion efficacy is an important strategy for change. A new position, the transfusion safety officer (TSO), has been developed in some nations to specifically identify, resolve, and monitor organizational weakness leading to unsafe transfusion practice. New technology is becoming increasingly available to improve the performance of sample labeling and the bedside clerical check. Several technology solutions are {{in various stages of}} development and include wireless handheld <b>portable</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants,</b> advanced bar coding, radiofrequency identification, and imbedded chip technology. Technology-based solutions for transfusion safety will depend on the larger issue of the technology for patient identification.
