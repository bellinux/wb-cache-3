40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the impact of excise duty increases on the retail price of gasoline and diesel in the Czech Republic. This study is primarily concerned with the issue of tax burden shifting because of transport fuel excise duties. This paper analyses the tax shifting process by focusing on <b>periodic</b> excise <b>duty</b> increases to identify whether overshifting occurs and what the consequences are for the Pigovian principle of environmental taxation. The research results show that overshifting of tax burden occurs with gradual tax rate increases in selected countries. Therefore, this enables it to be emphasized that overshifting violates the rationale of corrective taxation, increasing the distortionary effects of environmental taxes and substantially decreasing taxes’ efficiency in pollution abatement...|$|R
50|$|Born in Aragon (Spain), Segundo de Chomón {{reportedly}} {{got into}} film {{through the efforts}} of his actress wife, Julienne Mathieu, who appeared in early Pathé Frères productions. Around 1900 he became an agent for Pathé Frères in Spain, publicizing and distributing their films out of Barcelona. In 1901, De Chomón began producing actuality films in Spain on an independent basis and distributing them through Pathé; his first trick film was Gulliver en el país de los gigantes (1903). De Chomón also specialized in producing stencil colored film prints {{and was one of the}} developers of the Pathéchrome process, patented by Pathé in 1905. Charles Pathé also noted the quality of De Chomón's trick films and, from 1903, began to support these efforts with the desire of competing with Georges Méliès. De Chomón was expert enough at making trick films and had proven himself so valuable to Pathé that in 1905 he and Mathieu moved from Barcelona to Paris, and De Chomón was placed in charge of a color stencilling shop in addition to his <b>periodic</b> <b>duties</b> as a director. Through 1907, De Chomón worked in close collaboration with Pathé's top director, Ferdinand Zecca; the partnership worked so well that in 1907 Zecca selected De Chomón to co-direct a major project, the remake of Zecca's own 1903 Vie et Passion de Notre Seigneur Jésus Christ. Shortly afterward, Zecca moved into an executive position at Pathé and did little direction from that time; De Chomón's most productive years as a filmmaker lasted from 1907 to 1912, a period during which Méliès' production went into a steep decline. De Chomón often worked with other directors; in addition to Zecca he collaborated with Gaston Velle, Juan Fuster, Alberto Capellani and Émile Cohl. Although he remained with Pathé, in 1910 De Chomón returned to Barcelona and started an independent production company, Iberico Films, which proved short-lived.|$|R
50|$|Warren {{was born}} in Pella, Iowa. Little is known about his early life. Like Wyatt and Morgan, {{he was too young}} {{to take part in the}} American Civil War, as his older {{brothers}} James, Virgil, and Newton did. He was eighteen years younger than Newton. He joined his brothers in Tombstone, Arizona in 1880, and worked occasionally as a deputy for Virgil collecting taxes and for <b>periodic</b> guard <b>duty.</b> Wyatt landed the Faro concession at the Oriental Saloon. Virgil was the deputy marshall and in mid-1881 became the Tombstone city marshal as well. James was his deputy. The Earps had ongoing conflicts with a loose federation of outlaws known as The Cowboys, who were implicated in ongoing livestock thefts and had repeatedly threatened to kill the Earps if they interfered.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{dynamic and}} {{unpredictable}} nature of energy harvesting sources {{that are used}} in wireless sensor networks necessitates the need for adaptive duty cycling techniques. Such adaptive control allows sensor nodes to achieve energy-neutrality, whereby both energy supply and demand are balanced.

40|$|Numerous Location-Based Applications (LBAs) {{have been}} {{emerging}} in our smartphones {{over the past}} several years. Most of them are user-triggered LBAs which heavily depend on manual operations of end users, therefore  easy to lose their accessibility and usability when fail to get instructions in time. While <b>periodic</b> <b>duty</b> cycling of location sensing can guarantee the accuracy of the location and reliability of the desired triggered events, this pattern brings severe battery draining problem caused by power-intensive sensor, let alone redundant high-energy-consumption sensing operation from multiple LBAs without coordination. In contrast, location-triggered applications take the responsibility to manage the location sensing intelligently. They bring better  user experiences by performing actions automatically when reaching predefined locations. This paper proposes adaptive approaches to design energy-efficient location-triggered applications and further models the middleware to build integrated application framework for multiple location-triggered applications in general for energy concern. In the evaluation, business-independent location-triggered applications are implemented in the unified application framework and tested under various scenarios. The results have verified improved usability, higher customization capability and energy efficiency validity of the location-triggered applications and underlying application framework. The establishment of the unified location-triggered application framework provides the reference model for general intelligent energy-efficient LBA development in the future, while broadening the actual use of location-based service for mobile cloud computing...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 by the American Thoracic Society. Rationale: Measures of {{unstable}} ventilatory control (loop gain) can {{be obtained}} directly from the <b>periodic</b> breathing <b>duty</b> ratio on polysomnography in patients with Cheyne-Stokes respiration/ central sleep apnea and can predict the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Objectives: In this pilot study, we aimed to determine if this measure could also be applied to patients with complex sleep apnea (predominant obstructive sleep apnea, with worsening or emergent central apneas on CPAP). We hypothesized that loop gain was higher in patients whose central events persisted 1 month later despite CPAP treatment versus those whose events resolved over time. Methods: We calculated the duty ratio of the periodic central apneas remaining on the CPAP titration (or {{second half of the}} split night) while patients were on optimal CPAP with the airway open (obstructive apnea index < 1 /h). Loop gain was calculated by the formula: LG = 2 π/[(2 πDR 2 sin(2 πDR) ]. Patients were followed on CPAP for 1 month. Post-treatment apnea-hypopnea index and compliance data were recorded from smart cards. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-two patients with complex sleep apnea were identified, and 17 patients had full data sets. Eight patients continued to have a total of more than five events per hour (11. 8 ± 0. 5 /h) (nonresponders). The remaining nine patients had an apnea-hypopnea index less than 5 /h (2. 2 ± 0. 4 /h) (responders). Loop gain was higher in the nonresponders versus responders (2. 0 ± 0. 1 vs. 1. 7 ± 0. 2, P = 0. 026). Loop gain and the residual apnea-hypopnea index 1 month after CPAP were associated (r = 0. 48, P = 0. 02). CPAP compliance was similar between groups. Conclusions: In this pilot study, loop gain was higher for patients with complex sleep apnea in whom central apneas persisted after 1 month of CPAP therapy (nonresponders). Loop gain measurement may enable an a priori determination of those who need alternative modes of positive airway pressure...|$|R
30|$|A lot of {{work has}} been done on {{reducing}} the power consumption since the first standardization of the 802.15. 4 MAC in 2003 [3]. Most of the proposed low-powered MAC layer protocols are contention based (CSMA) and can be put into either, one of the two classifications, synchronous or asynchronous. The basic idea behind a synchronous MAC is to let the sensors sleep periodically, and to have them somehow aware of each other's sleeping schedules. In order to work efficiently, a very basic requirement is to have sensors tightly coupled or synchronized to each other. Some synchronous protocols found in the literature are S-MAC [8] and T-MAC [9]. S-MAC introduces <b>periodic</b> coordinated sleep/wakeup <b>duty</b> cycles, and as a result, the battery lifetime for sensors is increased. One problem of S-MAC is that the duty cycle requires to be tuned to a specific traffic load. Thus, its performance suffers under varying traffic loads. The T-MAC sleeping technique [9] satisfies the varying traffic requirements. The T-MAC also uses an adaptive listening technique in neighbor's transmissions, and sensors are able to immediately pass the data, avoiding the timeout introduced in T-MAC. Therefore, as T-MAC duty cycle varies adaptively, this improves the energy and throughput performance under varying traffic loads.|$|R
