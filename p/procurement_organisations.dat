Little is therefore known about the part played by correspondence exchanged between these two groups; in particular how they perceive the agency of organ donation. This is the first analysis to address the representation of the act of donation from the viewpoint of both donor and recipient families through interrogation of archived correspondence data, using linguistic techniques. The data was drawn from a collection of letters, from four USA Organ <b>Procurement</b> <b>Organisations,</b> exchanged between donor and transplant recipient families. Donor families consistently linguistically ascribed agency and accountability for donation to the person who died, the donor. For the recipient families, on the other hand, the ‘giver’ was mainly implied, ambiguous or ascribed to the donor family...|$|E

40|$|How can we {{understand}} the dynamics of procurement management?” An {{answer to this question}} has predominantly been explained by procurement management experiencing dissatisfaction with the status quo, where the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> was viewed from other entities in the company as an insignificant, reactive and an administrative part of the business. The potential, however, for the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> to be significant in the company was argued to be vast (Ammer 1989, Ellram & Carr 1994, Van Weele 2005). In order to change the situation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation,</b> <b>procurement</b> management was informed that they should in gradual steps develop the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> towards more sophistication and significance (Reck & Long 1988) producing strategies that were aligned with the overall company strategy including the development of policies, procedures, systems, tools and processes (Cousins 2002, Cousins et al 2008). This process changed the perspective of the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> which among other things, allowed the procurement entity to contribute to the implementation of the concept of supply chain management (Freeman & Cavinato 1990). Ever since I first got familiar with the practices of procurement and its management, I have been puzzled by its complexity. At the same time, I have wondered about how the same space of complexity in the procurement management domain literature has explained the same practices by reductionism, smoothness and simplicity as just described...|$|R

Theoretical: The theoretical chapter illustrates different <b>procurement</b> <b>organisations,</b> multiple and single sourcing, brand equity, consumer behaviour and involvement, Efficient Consumer Response including supply chain and category management and finally Demand Chain Management. Method: For the case studies, three food retail companies have been interviewed: Reitan Servicehandel AB, Vi-butikerna and ICA AB. To illustrate how consumer behaviour influences retail food market, several secondary consumer research studies have been analysed. Conclusions: The results indicate that the procurement organisation can achieve a better competitive strength by a centralised organisation, which make it possible to improve conditions of terms when ordering higher purchase volumes. The sourcing strategies can improve a company’s power within the supply chain. All companies within the study had a very good knowledge about consumer behaviour. Information technology is a very important tool to achieve enhanced efficiency within the organisation. It also indicates that the procurement organisation by its knowledge in sales and marketing can improve a company’s competitive strength...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is an {{increasing}} gap {{between the number of}} patients on the waiting list and the number of transplanted patients. In France, more than 10000 patients waited for an organ transplantation in 2002. Due to the graft shortage, "marginal" donors are now considered. The patients who present brain death after accidental or voluntary poisoning belong to this category. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The data available from European or North American organ <b>procurement</b> <b>organisations</b> show that poisoned donors represent about 1 % of all organ donors. It seems likely that a significant number of poisoned patients are not referred because poisoning is regarded as a contraindication to organ donation. When organ procurement can be achieved, the results expressed as recipient survival or graft survival are quite encouraging. TOXIC PRODUCTS: The most frequently involved toxins are either drugs (psychotropic agents, analgesics [...] .), illicit substances, or environmental agents (gases, alcohols [...] .). The literature data are discussed; some issues remain controversial. PRACTICAL APPROACH: Several criteria have to be applied when poisoned patients are considered as potential organ donors. Besides a firm diagnosis of "brain death", the knowledge of the "target organs" of poisoning is of paramount importance, together with careful analysis of the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. In most cases, routine biological and morphological data are sufficient to assess graft function...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} {{environment in}} the roundwood trade in Finland in the 1990 ’s include several changes. They are changes {{in the structure of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership, forest taxation, in forest legislation, in price recommendation agreement, diminishing resources of forestry extension services, etc. At the same time, the roundwood demand has been rising. All these developments cause uncertainty in wood <b>procurement</b> <b>organisations,</b> and call for research {{to find out how to}} adapt into the changing environment. The objective of this study is to produce information for roundwood purchasing planning and cus-tomer satisfaction management to be used by Stora Enso Metsä Customer Service, Helsinki. For this pur-pose, data needs to be gathered about the urban NIPFs and their forest estates, behaviour related to forestry and timber-selling, customer satisfaction in their latest timber selling transaction, and their opinions about Enso’s new customer service office and its service concept. To fulfil the objective of the study, a NIPF -owner -survey (N= 1064, response rate 39, 7 %) was con-ducted in October 1998 -January 1999. The sample was made on the basis of the marketing database of Stora Enso Oyj Forest Customer Service in Helsinki. In planning the frame of reference of the empirical study, the model of service quality by Grönroos was applied. The following aspects were included in the 7 -page questionnaire: demographic, sosio-economic and forest estate background, relation to the forest service supply, behaviour related to forestry, timber-selling motives and behaviour, last contact organisation and its image in forestry business, expectations and percep-tions in the latest timber-selling transactions, and behavioural intentions. The results revealed that the share of women, pensioners and academically educated people among forest owners was quite high. The majority of the forest estates of the metropolitan forest owners were situ-ated in the provinces of South Finland and East Finland. The average forest estate area was considerably smaller than in a previous study. Economic and recreational objectives were most important in the use of forests. Forest Associations were involved in half of the roundwood sales transactions of the respondents in the metropolitan area. The wood quantity of transactions was considerably higher than the average in the whole country. Bank-organised forest-related activities, taxation infos and trips to the forest were the most popular activities. Among the services, silvicultural advices were needed mostly and stub treatment least. Brochure material related to stumpage timber sales and taxation were considered most important compared to material related to delivery sales. The service expectations were at highest for women and they were less satisfied with the service than men. 2 nd and 3 rd generation residents of the metropolitan area thought about the new customer service concept more positively than the 1 st generation residents. Internet users under 60 years thought more positively about new satellite picture-based woodlot search concept. Cross-tabulation of factor scores against background variables indicated that women with relatively low education level a greater need to sell roundwood than entrepreneurs, white-collar workers and directors, and Internet users. Suspiciousness towards timber <b>procurement</b> <b>organisations</b> was relatively strong among women and those whose forest income share of the total income was either null or over 20 %. The average customer satisfaction score was negative in all nine questions. Statistical differences be-tween different companies did not exist in the average satisfaction scores. Stora Enso’s Helsinki forest cus-tomer service could choose the ability to purchase all timber grades as its competitive advantage. Out of nine service dimension included in the questionnaire, in this particular service dimension, Enso’s Helsinki forest customer service’s score exceeded most all organisations’ average customer satisfaction score. On the basis of importance – performance matrix, advice and quidance could have been provided more to the forest owners in their latest timber–selling transaction...|$|E

40|$|This Master’s thesis was {{commissioned}} by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery,subdivision Industrial Gas Turbines (PGI 4) in Finspong, Sweden, and in Lincoln, England. The company {{has been part of}} Siemens Power Generation Industrial Applications since its acquisition in 2003. In this connection, the strategic importance of procurement became more recognised and the procurement organisation has undergone many changes. Procurement, however, is a function very much affected by changes in the business context,making constant adaptations and transformations necessary. In order to ensure that the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisations</b> in Finspong and Lincoln are well prepared for future challenges, the purchasing director at Siemens PGI 4 asked us to investigate competency requirements on procurement beyond the year 2010, based on the impact of macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, a gap analysis was requested in order to compare the current competency level with the required future competency level. The task was approached by studying literature and interviewing well-known purchasing professors. From this we concluded that the macroeconomic trends of greatest relevance for Siemens PGI 4 are globalisation, outsourcing, development of information technology, increasing demands on corporate social responsibility and changing consumer patterns. Our investigation of the impact of these trends on procurement resulted in several requirements for the future. For example, risks must be managed throughout the whole supply chain, as the complexity of supply increases as a result of globalisation and outsourcing. The requirements are presented in terms of competencies and roles that need to be assumed. We mapped the current competency level by means of questionnaires filled in by the personnel concerned. We then compared this with the required future level. The gap analysis indicated that gaps within management of relations, for example, exist for several of the studied function profiles and that today’s way of handling risks will not be sufficient in the future. Still, the majority of the competency gaps are not very large. We believe therefore that by taking care of the existing gaps and installing a supply chain risk management team, the procurement function can live up to the future requirements until the year 2010. We recommend the identified crucial roles and competencies to be taken into consideration when recruiting new employees and when developing existing personnel. However, continuous review and update of competencies will be needed {{in order to keep the}} company competitive...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{involvement}} and role of procurement professionals in industrial projects. The role of <b>procurement</b> in industrial <b>organisations</b> with continuing operations has attracted considerable attention {{over the last several}} years; however, the role of procurement in industrial projects is rather under-researched. The literature review undertaken confirms that existing procurement literature based on continuous operations is in itself consistent and describes in depth the organisational principles as well as the role of procurement. From a project management point of view, procurement is mainly considered a transactional task, and remarkably few project management standards consider procurement at all. To overcome this gap, a Procurement Project Involvement Matrix has been developed in this thesis from the literature. This matrix defines, with examples, four possible project types in which procurement experts might be involved: an engineering project, a product development project, a multidisciplinary project, and a project portfolio. Based on these four project types, the research analyses what procurement experts do and what they should do. This thesis develops an integrated framework based on four interdependent research steps. The framework then allows the definition of the appropriate procurement tasks for all procurement job levels in relation to the project type. In addition, as both the <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> and leadership tasks are of significant importance, a Project <b>Procurement</b> <b>Organisation</b> Model is developed. In general, the project procurement job tasks framework as well as the Project <b>Procurement</b> <b>Organisation</b> Model will help to implement, improve and audit the involvement level of procurement in projects. The thesis draws its findings from the analysis {{of a wide range of}} data. First secondary sources, such as job advertisements, public training programmes and presentations held at the BME (German member of the International Federation of Purchasing and Supply Management) symposium, were accessed. This was followed by an in-depth analysis of four consulting projects performed by the researcher in a project-based environment.

40|$|In {{health care}} supply chain management, {{particularly}} {{in the area of}} organ transplantation, organ procurement and the transplantation network play an important role. The organ <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> (OPO) should coordinate so that organs are prepared and transported to the recipients when donors become available. The scarcity of organ supply leads to life-challenging issues for the organ recipient. In this research, the importance of the location of OPOs to coordinate with the transplant centres in India is considered, and a solution is provided by facilitating the identification of locations where organs can be procured and distributed to the nearest transplant location. The location of the distribution centres of organs are identified, based on the p-median model. This model minimises the weighted distance of the organ recipients. Initially, the demand or the population density of organ recipients with respect to particular location is recognised. Then, based on the p-median model, the location of OPOs is effectively identified. Experimental analysis proves that the proposed model performs well in facilitating the location of OPOs. The robustness of the proposed work is validated using a sensitivity analysis of the differences in the selection of OPOs when the estimated demand for organs varies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To present {{examples}} of historical British antecedents of innovative construction <b>procurement,</b> project <b>organisation</b> and social structures, through an historical case study. To highlight how contemporary innovative ‘newness’ {{can sometimes be}} preceded by historical antecedents. Methodology: Informal analysis of extant literature and historical archives, to synthesise those antecedents presented; and reflect on these in light of contemporary construction practice and innovation. Findings: The case study project, capturing the period c. 1894 - 1904, demonstrates numerous historical but significant innovations relating to project organisation and social structures. The extent of these may result from more lax regulation and workplace controls of the time. The case also epitomises how a publicly accountable authority, can realise a high quality constructed product in good time, using direct labour and without recourse to competitive procurement. Research implications: The blending of historical construction research with contemporary construction innovation (CI) thinking may open new academic opportunities in both fields. Practical implications: The findings suggest that a less regulatory-constrained environment appears conducive to incremental and process-oriented CI activity.

40|$|Products {{generate}} {{environmental impacts}} during their life cycle by consuming {{raw materials and}} energy, releasing emissions and producing waste. A <b>procurement</b> <b>organisation</b> can be a considerable driving force for more environmentally friendly products e. g. by requiring that products meet certain environmental criteria. The scope for environmental consideration when procuring materiel can be limited by lack of reliable information about the environmental characteristics of the product or service. Different types of tools (e. g. eco-labels, guidelines, checklists and tools for environmental assessment) can contribute some knowledge and help identify environmentally preferable products. This thesis focuses on use of tools for environmental consideration in Swedish defence acquisition but the results are also relevant for other <b>organisations,</b> since the <b>procurement</b> process analysed is rather general and the legal requirements are similar for other public organisations in Europe. A Swedish government decision in 1998 requires the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF) and Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) to take environmental consideration in all phases of the acquisition process. The importance of a life cycle perspective is stressed in several SAF and FMV environmental documents. The starting point of this thesis was that environmental consideration should be taken in the Swedish acquisition of defence materiel, considering the whole life cycle of products, {{with the aim of}} formulating proposals on environmentally friendly procurement. Some Ecodesign tools were reviewed and evaluated, two methods for simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were compared, tools and methodology were recommended, and used to study military materiel, and environmental Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was examined. In environmental work lacking a life cycle perspective, the most significant aspects risk being overlooked. Use of quantitative and/or simplified LCAs and inclusion of environmental costs in LCC are therefore recommended. LCA proved an appropriate tool for involving environmental consideration in the acquisition process, since it focuses on products and their life cycle. The MECO method proved best for simplified LCA. These suggested methods were evaluated by interviews with actors in the acquisition process. Four areas for LCA use in acquisition were identified: learning about environmental aspects of products; fulfilling customer requirements; setting environmental requirements; and choosing between alternatives. The interviewees were interested in using LCA, but {{there is a need for}} an initiative by one or several actors if the method is to be used regularly and the results must be communicated within the <b>organisations</b> involved in <b>procurement.</b> Environmental consideration should be taken early in the acquisition process and environmental matters integrated into other activities of the organisations involved. Environmental costs are not explicitly considered in the LCCs used by the interviewees today, but internal environmental costs should be included. Costs likely to be internal can also be included.

40|$|As markets become {{increasingly}} competitive {{the role and}} positioning of <b>Procurement</b> within <b>organisations</b> has been {{seen by many as}} becoming more significant. It has certainly been a role in which the skill requirements are seen to be moving from dominantly technical to more behavioural and associated with effective leadership (particularly in the more senior procurement roles). This paper describes an empirical study which was designed to explore the extent to which this asserted shift in skill mix is encountered in practice and differences in the perceptions of critical skills between a sample currently in a Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) role and a sample aspiring to move into such a role. Using a questionnaire survey data was gathered from 55 CPOs and 96 “aspiring” CPOs. The data provided covered technical, cognitive, behavioural and leadership skills, together with data on leadership effectiveness. Analysis of the data indicated that existing CPOs do indeed place greater emphasis on the non-technical skill areas than the “aspirant” sample. Furthermore, there are indications that current CPOs perceive a behavioural/leadership skills gap in the “aspirant” population. Evidence was obtained of a positive relationship between the CPOs’ perceptions of priority skill areas and the leadership effectiveness of the “aspirant” sample. The implications of these findings are discussed, together with the limitations of the study and areas for further research. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Governments use {{sustainable}} {{public procurement}} {{to reduce the}} negative aspects of production and consumption. The more sustainable {{the goods and services}} that the government buys are, the greater the impact on the market and the environment. However, studies show that the degree of sustainable procurement is not constant within a public organization, but varies across procurement projects. Studies into sustainable public procurement identify several organizational factors that drive or hinder the implementation of sustainable (public) procurement. However these studies have not yet examined how these factors influence the implementation and thus degree of sustainable public procurement. This paper tries to fill that gap and tests whether behaviour acts as a mediator between knowledge, commitment to change, and the application of sustainable procurement in procurement projects in the Dutch national government. To test our hypotheses a survey was held amongst public procurers working in the Dutch national government. The results show that sustainable procurement behaviour positively mediates the relationship between on the one hand affective commitment to change and knowledge, {{and on the other hand}} the application of both compulsory and voluntary sustainable public procurement in procurement projects. Especially voluntary sustainable procurement proved receptive for knowledge and affective commitment to change. It is therefore concluded that to increase the application of sustainable <b>procurement</b> public <b>organisations</b> should focus on increasing knowledge about sustainability and the environment, affective commitment to change and sustainable procurement behaviour...|$|R
