40|$|The {{processes}} of electroless and immersion gold plating from cyanoaurate solutions were investigated. It was shown that gold reduction with hypophosphite dissolved in the solution or with nickel and copper from the substrate {{is accompanied by}} the side {{processes of}} Ni or Cu dissolution owing to the reduction of hydrogen ions or the dissolved oxygen. This dissolution is provoked {{by the appearance of}} galvanic couples. The dissolved nickel and copper are partially codeposited with gold. These metals include in the near surface gold film zone and then they again take <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>gold</b> cementation or they catalyse the reaction of hypophosphite oxidation. Gold films are limited in thickness (0. 1 - 0 - 3 mm) mainly owing to the adsorption of the gold cyanide in a trace quantity. The results of this investigation were used for working out the technology of electroless gold film plating...|$|E
40|$|Since the 60 ’s, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) {{is under}} question. From recent events, {{particularly}} {{related to the}} 2008 Financial Crisis, financial assets appear as uncorrelated with their fundamentals and their prices are subject to strong fluctuations. In this context, including behavioral finance in financial system dynamics could be a response. On a more limited scope, the goal of present project {{is to establish a}} modeling process of gold price trend based on 1980 Grossman-Stiglitz model by integrating behavioral component for a better representation of markets reality. The modeling process is based on simulations and the article presents selected cognitive biases. The analysis of the results, and the corrections that followed, lead to the formulation of a mathematical model. Thus, the impact of cognitive biases on dynamics of gold price formation is demonstrated, and evaluated through their influence on informed (rational and irrational) and uninformed investors. The result of this study suggests that behavioral finance has a crucial <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>gold</b> price formation...|$|E
