Compared with conventional route using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer, the method has advantages of simple technology process, 100 % raw materials utilization ratio and totally zero emission during mass production；while {{the raw materials}} utilization ratio was only 22. 8 % and 48. 6 % for using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer under the same conditions. Furthermore, the proposed green route to production <b>of</b> <b>triammonium</b> citrate will save at least 813. 3 kJ and 948. 4 kJ of energy for manufacturing each kilogram of product than using NH 4 HCO 3 and NH 3 ·H 2 O (25 %) as neutralizer, respectively...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{changes in}} organic <b>phosphates</b> <b>of</b> turkey {{erythrocytes}} (RBC) have been determined {{in relation to}} the changes in oxygen affinity of whole blood during growth of the embryo and poult. On a molar basis, 2, 3 diphosphoglyceric acid (2, 3 -DPG) is the predominant organic <b>phosphate</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes from turkey embryos during the last week of incubation. However, on the basis <b>of</b> relative % <b>phosphate,</b> 2, 3 -DPG is the major organic <b>phosphate</b> <b>of</b> the erythrocytes from turkey embryos on day 23 and 25 of incubation only. With the exception of day 23 and 25 of incubation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) represents the major organic <b>phosphate</b> <b>of</b> the erythrocytes of the turkey embryo and poult during the last week of embryonic development and through the first 29 days after hatching. The whole blood P 50 during the last week of incubation and the first 8 days after hatching correlates best with the amount of ATP in the erythrocytes. The effects of inositol pentaphosphate on P 50 of the whole blood is much more gradual and appears to become of major influence after 2 - 3 weeks post-hatching...|$|R
