40|$|Two skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> can be {{equivalent}} for the Hamming metric only if {{they have}} the same length, and only the zero code is degenerate. The situation is completely different for the rank metric, where lengths of codes correspond to the number of outgoing links from the source when applying the code on a network. We study rank equivalences between skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> of different lengths and, with the aim of finding the skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>code</b> of smallest length that is rank equivalent to a given one, we define different types of length for a given skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>code,</b> relate them and compute them in most cases. We give different characterizations of rank degenerate skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> using conventional polynomials and linearized polynomials. Some known results on the rank weight hierarchy of <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> for some lengths are obtained as particular cases and extended to all lengths and to all skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes.</b> Finally, we prove that the smallest length of a linear code that is rank equivalent to a given skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>code</b> can be attained by a pseudo-skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>code.</b> Throughout the paper, we find new relations between linear skew <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> and their Galois closures...|$|R
