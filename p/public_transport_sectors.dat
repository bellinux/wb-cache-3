40|$|In {{order to}} deepen {{understanding}} of path dependence in urban transport, {{this article presents}} {{a case study of}} urban passenger transport institutions in Melbourne, Australia over 50 years. The institutional capacity of the roads and <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> are explored separately and the trends are then compared and contrasted. The main components of the analysis are: structural changes to the organisations, participation on planning committees, access to financial resources, accountability frameworks, membership of forums and relationships with other actors. The conclusion is that, whilst the historical picture is complex, the trend is a strengthening of road planning institutions, and weakening public transport planning. This situation appears to be out of alignment with current needs. Path dependence Urban transport governance Transport organisational history Australia Melbourne...|$|E
40|$|For 2003, the Austrian {{manufacturing}} industry {{as well as}} the electricity, gas, water and <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> plan to invest € 6. 8 billion at current prices. The plans indicate a minor increase in investment spending, up 1. 8 percent compared to 2002, but slower than foreseen in October-November 2002, when a plus of about 5. 7 percent was forecast for 2003. The reason for the decline is that industries producing non-durable consumer goods substantially cut back on their investment plans. Another reason for the poor overall investment performance is that investments in buildings will decrease sharply by about 30 percent. In contrast, investment in machinery and equipment including ICT investment will grow by 6. 4 percent. This increase will be substantial enough to offset the decline in investment in structures.

40|$|Hong Kong was {{the first}} place in the world to {{implement}} a trial scheme to convert all public light buses (PLBs) on the road from diesel to alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The scheme, however, did not receive much support from PLB operators. At present, there is a rich literature on households' demand for AFVs (especially in the USA). However, there have not been many studies about the demand for commercial AFVs in the business and <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors.</b> Since light buses running on alternative fuels are not widely available in the Hong Kong market, a stated preference (SP) survey was conducted to solicit the preferences of PLB operators on eight commercial vehicle attributes and seven forms of government support. The SP data are analyzed by multinomial logit (MNL) models. Detailed analyses on market segmentation and price elasticities follow. The results are of theoretical and practical significance. © Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The fuel levy, a {{domestic}} transport cost component {{added to the}} basic fuel price, has long been South Africa?s main source of income to fund the construction and maintenance of roads as well as lend support to public transport (National Treasury, 2014 b). During the 2012 / 2013 financial year the fuel levy contributed R 40. 4 billion to the National Revenue Fund administered by National Treasury (The Citizen, 2013). Of this amount, R 17. 6 billion (44. 0 %) and R 19. 9 billion (49. 0 %) were allocated to the road and <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sectors</b> respectively. Recent comments regarding the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (e-toll) has raised questions and strong opinions about the continuing use of the fuel levy as the main or only source of income from road users to fund land transport operations and infrastructure in South Africa. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess if a review of the fuel levy is needed, and to be supplemented or replaced by a viable alternative, in order to secure a long term sustainable income source for the country?s aging transport road infrastructure. This paper will provide a historic overview of the South African fuel levy, from its origins in the 1920 ?s to the present day and will review the current demands on the fund. This will be followed by a comparison between the fuel levy in South Africa and other countries, including selected BRICS nations and selected European countries. Various societal trends will then be considered including alternative fuels, electrical and more fuel efficient vehicles and the impact of these trends on the fuel levy will be assessed. It was found through this assessment that alternative fuels, electrical and more fuel efficient vehicles have had an impact on the fuel levy whereby the registered vehicle population in South Africa grew with 47. 2 % between the periods 2003 to 2012. For the same periods the vehicle kilometres driven by the registered vehicle population grew with 38. 5 % while the fuel sales only grew by 21. 9 %. This had a result where the fuel levy is losing productivity by experiencing declining revenues. The paper concludes that a review of the current fuel levy is needed, as increasing the fuel levy each year will only be a temporary solution. An alternative financing mechanism must be implemented that is not affected by societal trends.

40|$|In many {{countries}} strikes hit the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> {{from time to}} time. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> strikes are important for transportation research because they can impact upon the perceived reliability of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> services. Moreover, the traveller's most preferred alternative {{is removed from the}} choice set. The traveller is forced to make up his mind about his preferences; doing so may induce a shift from inert, habit-driven behaviour to rational behaviour. In this paper we review 13 studies of strikes in the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector,</b> discuss criteria that determine the kind and size of the effects of a <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> strike, and present the results of a survey carried out after a short, unannounced railway strike in the Netherlands. Our survey confirms the results of other studies. In the short-term mainly captive travellers are affected; these are mostly commuters without alternative modes of transport who are highly inflexible in their departure or arrival times. As a result, on average 10 - 20 % of the trips are cancelled. Most travellers switch to the car (either as driver or passenger) and as a result road congestion increases. Longer-term effects include a decrease in market share for <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> which various studies estimate to be between 0. 3 and 2. 5 %. The effect of a strike on <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> rider-ship can be temporary or permanent, {{depending on the type of}} strike and the policy response to it. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to explore}} the role of {{knowledge}} management practices in supporting current and emerging passengers’ and customer needs, aiming to create value. Specifically, the research examines the importance of customer-centred knowledge management {{in the delivery of}} innovative services and practices in the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector,</b> promoting the role of interactions between mobility stakeholders and travellers. Design/methodology/approach – A theoretical framework is developed and supported by the background literature on customer-centric knowledge management approaches, business model innovation, as well as on inter-organisational and network co-operations. Findings – Results show that the development of sustainable innovation and technologies in the <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> requires knowledge management practices, which enable the access to knowledge about users’ needs, the mapping and evaluation of innovative knowledge, the promotion of knowledge-based innovation through collective approaches, as well as the acquisition and integration of new knowledge. Research limitations/implications – The conceptual framework developed in the paper remains limited to a theoretical understanding. Further research should empirically examine knowledge issues related to the intangible character and intellectual capital intensiveness of innovation in the <b>transport</b> <b>sector.</b> Practical implications – Researchers, <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> companies and <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> authorities are expected to benefit from this research, by developing mechanisms for customer-centred knowledge management, which is found to lead to innovative services and practices in the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector.</b> Another practical implication regards the adoption of knowledge management practices, leading to technological innovations in <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> and advancing the level of sustainability in transport systems. Originality/value – The originality of this study lies {{in the development of a}} customer-focussed knowledge management framework, which provides a novel perspective of value creation in an attempt to engage researchers and practitioners from the transport industry in the conceptualisation and development of innovative solutions...|$|R

Though there is little research that explicitly examines the relationship between regulatory reform and technological innovation in the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector,</b> we utilise, in this thesis, various theories and studies correlating to the issue as well as empirical evidence (case studies) to support the analyses. In this thesis, the main research question asks: ‘What effect does regulatory reform (in the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> market) have on innovative capability, and which routes of innovation will prevail?’ The thesis is based on two theoretical perspectives: innovation theory and institutional and organisational studies. This thesis provides a broader perspective on innovation; it focuses on both the technological and organisational aspects of innovative activities. In this thesis, the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> service is exemplified by the ‘twin characteristics’ approach which defines <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in terms of three sets of characteristics: technical characteristics, competence, and service characteristics. It then classifies innovation into three subgroups: service innovation, pure technical innovation, and competence development.

40|$|<b>Transport,</b> {{especially}} <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> {{has been}} at the centre of professional attention from time to time. Although the effect of transport innovation shortly appears and it works high effectively in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> (as you think of the innovation of bus transport and its dynamic progression) the attention is not due to these results, but due to problems of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and to strains in its social contradictions. (Sometimes the transport innovation starts already in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> system, for example innovation of subway and high speed train.) Economic crisis especially highlights social contradictions, when the market is decreasing and enterprises are struggling to survive or to hold monopoly status. New enterprises could go on the market or the existing ones could stay in competition only if they are able to influence and convince passengers to choose them “by getting on”. The third that benefits is often the individual transport, and behind the automobile industry with extended power and influence. My hypothesis is that <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> is economically very different to classical categories of market sector, while personal utility and real value do not determine the whole market (included supplies and demands) but the phenomena of pseudo market does it. The sustainability of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> does not depend on the individual in the sense of passenger, but on the community and on the options of common weal of it. The Institution of Transport Sciences ((KTI)), which celebrated its 70 th anniversary in 2008, has been focusing on the market of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in the last 8 years, because strain of the market has been realized.
