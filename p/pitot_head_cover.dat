500|$|... 20 August 1959: XH668 a B2 of the A lost a <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> and dived {{into the}} sea off Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{found that}} the <b>pitot</b> <b>heads</b> had ice damage which caused the crew to receive {{incorrect}} airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall.|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the flightcrew had not {{activated}} the <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> heaters and the pitot tubes had become blocked with ice which caused the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall.|$|R
2500|$|.....the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the loss of control of the aircraft because the flightcrew failed to recognize and correct the aircraft's high angle of attack, low-speed stall and its descending spiral. The stall was precipitated by the flightcrew's improper reaction to erroneous airspeed and Mach indications which had resulted from a blockage of the <b>pitot</b> <b>heads</b> by atmospheric icing.|$|R
50|$|Airspeed {{indication}} {{is provided}} by a single pointer, dual scale airspeed/ mach meter. The pointer responds to the dynamic pressure from the <b>pitot</b> <b>heads</b> on the nose compartment. The conventional airspeed scale is calibrated in knots and the Mach scale is calibrated in percentage of Mach and connected to an aneroid that moves the scale to compensate for changes in pressure altitude.|$|R
50|$|From the NTSB report's abstract:...the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the loss of control of the aircraft because the flightcrew failed to recognize and correct the aircraft's high angle of attack, low-speed stall and its descending spiral. The stall was precipitated by the flightcrew's improper reaction to erroneous airspeed and Mach indications which had resulted from a blockage of the <b>pitot</b> <b>heads</b> by atmospheric icing.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Lancasters {{were produced}} with Rolls-Royce Merlin XX engines and SU carburettors. Minor details were changed throughout the production series - {{for example the}} <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> design was changed from being on a long mast {{at the front of}} the nose to a short fairing mounted on the side of the fuselage under the cockpit. Later production Lancasters had Merlin 22 and 24 engines. No designation change was made to denote these alterations.|$|R
30|$|Moreover {{patients}} {{were asked whether}} and when they used a <b>head</b> <b>cover.</b> Every patient who wore a <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> at least once during CT, was rated as <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> user.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a landing}} {{accident}} {{in which the}} retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics, and was re-designated the P.111A. Four [...] "petal" [...] airbrakes {{were added to the}} fuselage to lower landing speeds and the undercarriage doors were changed to reduce the trim change. A long nose probe carrying a <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> was added. The most immediately obvious change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the [...] "Yellow Peril".|$|R
30|$|In some {{publications}} the SC {{success rate}} was indirectly calculated from <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> use (Van den Hurk et al. 2010; Mols et al. 2009). According to our evaluation of <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> use, 51.7 % {{of the patients}} did not use any <b>head</b> <b>cover,</b> although all of them received (neo-)adjuvant CT-regimens in comparatively high doses.|$|R
25|$|Tropicalising {{measures}} {{included the}} installation of an air filter and intake in the upper forward fuselage, just behind the engine cowling, and {{the replacement of the}} L-shaped <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> under the outer port wing by a straight rod projecting from the port outer wing leading edge. All production aircraft were powered by a (2,590hp/1,932kW) Centaurus V driving a 12ft 9 inch (3.89 m) diameter Rotol propeller. Tempest Mk.IIs produced during the war were intended for combat against Japan, and would have formed part of a proposed British Commonwealth long-range bomber force based on Okinawa, Tiger Force. The Pacific War ended before they could be deployed.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} a brief {{presentation of the}} different losses developed in high head Francis turbines, where special {{attention is paid to}} the losses in the guide vanes due to the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> deflection. The different factors determining the extent of the leakage flow are thoroughly examined. Also, since the guide vane facing plate and the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> are exposed to serious wear due to the presence of sand particles in a high accelerating flow, efficiency measurements of sand eroded and repaired turbines are presented. In addition, results from efficiency measurements of Francis turbines with different clearance gaps are included to underline the severity of the clearance gap between the covers and the guide vanes. The thesis presents a numerical approach to calculate the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> deflection. And the scope of this work is to develop a simplified 2 -D model, which calculates the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> deflection within a certain order of accuracy. Thus a 3 -D modelling of the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> deflection is also included with the purpose of validating the 2 -D modelling. Furthermore, a discussion of the efficiency with respect to the design of the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> is performed to describe the potential of increasing the hydraulic efficiency by altering the design method. Also, a numerical computation of the leakage flow in the guide vanes due to the <b>head</b> <b>covers</b> deflections, is presented to better visualize the effect from the clearance gap between the <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> and guide vane facing plate. Also, to underline the severity of large clearance gaps, the guide vane has been modeled with four different sized clearance gaps. Finally, an analytical interpretation of the leakage flow is included to evaluate the numerical calculation of the leakage flow.

500|$|The first {{prototype}} Victor B.2, {{serial number}} XH668 made its maiden flight on 20 February 1959. It had flown 100 hours by 20 August 1959, when, while high-altitude engine tests were {{being carried out}} by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A), it disappeared from radar screens, crashing into the sea off the coast of Pembrokeshire. An extensive search operation was initiated to locate and salvage the wreckage of XH668 to determine the cause of the crash. It took until November 1960 to recover most of the aircraft; the accident investigation concluded that the starboard <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> had failed inflight, causing the flight control system to force the aircraft into an unrecoverable dive. [...] Only minor changes were needed to resolve this problem, allowing the Victor B.2 to enter service in February 1962.|$|R
2500|$|F4U-5: A 1945 design {{modification}} of the F4U-4, first flown on 21 December 1945, was intended to increase the F4U-4 Corsair's overall performance and incorporate many Corsair pilots' suggestions. It featured a more powerful Pratt and Whitney R-2800-32(E) engine with a two-stage supercharger, rated at a maximum of [...] Other improvements included automatic blower controls, cowl flaps, intercooler doors and oil cooler for the engine, spring tabs for the elevators and rudder, a completely modernized cockpit, a completely retractable tail wheel, and heated cannon bays and <b>pitot</b> <b>head.</b> The cowling was lowered two degrees to help with forward visibility, but perhaps most striking as the first variant to feature all-metal wings (223 units produced). Maximum speed was [...] and max rate of climb at sea level 4,850 feet per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The Lancaster B III was {{powered by}} Packard Merlin engines, {{which had been}} built {{overseas}} in the United States, but was otherwise identical to contemporary B Is. In total, 3,030 B IIIs were constructed, {{almost all of them}} at Avro's Newton Heath factory. The Lancaster B I and B III were manufactured concurrently and minor modifications were made to both marks as further batches were ordered. The B I and B III designated was effective interchangeable simply by exchanging the engines used, which was occasionally done in practice. Examples of modifications made include the relocation of the <b>pitot</b> <b>head</b> from the nose {{to the side of the}} cockpit and the change from de Havilland [...] "needle blade" [...] propellers to Hamilton Standard or Nash Kelvinator made [...] "paddle blade" [...] propellers.|$|R

30|$|The {{frequency}} of wearing a <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> might {{be influenced by}} culture, self-esteem, sex and mentality of the patients. Moreover, like the success rate of SC, the <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> rate is very much dependent on CT regime and its dosage. For example by increasing the epirubicin dose in the FEC-regime from 90 to 100 ¬†mg/m 2, the rate of patients using a <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> increased from 33 % to 52 %, respectively (Katakunnel & Berger 2008). Van den Hurk et al. (2010) and Mols et al. (2009) showed that 52 % of breast cancer patients in various adjuvant CTs with SC did not use a wig while only 2.7 % of the control group required none. In another study van den Hurk et al. (2012) found a <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> rate of 49 % with a change from 5 % (no cooling) to 49 % (cooling, factor 10).|$|R
