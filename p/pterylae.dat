5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called <b>pterylae.</b> The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
25|$|Contour {{feathers}} are not uniformly distributed on {{the skin}} of the bird except in some groups such as the penguins, ratites and screamers. In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called pterylae; between the <b>pterylae</b> there are regions which are free of feathers called apterylae (or apteria). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae. The arrangement of these feather tracts, pterylosis or pterylography, varies across bird families and has been used in the past as a means for determining the evolutionary relationships of bird families.|$|E

40|$|Cytokeratins (CK&# 65533;s) {{are a major}} {{component}} of the cytoskeleton in all epithelial cells. To determine the expression pattern in normal chicken skin, the reactivity from a broad range of commercially available monoclonal antibodies were studied using a immunohistochemical method. In preliminary examinations the application of 12 monoclonal antibodies to normal skin sections from four 5 -week-old meat-type chickens was assessed. The panel of monoclonal antibodies were employed as primary antibodies using a biotin-steptavidin (B-SA) detection system on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The avian epidermis only reacted positively with four antibodies: AE 1, AE 3, LP 34 and LL 002. In the main examination which followed the four positive antibodies were tested in skin samples obtained from 24 layer-type and 24 meat-type chickens in six different age groups (18 th embryonic day, 1 st day after hatching, 5 th, 11 th, 15 th and 22 weeks after hatching). Within these age groups, a selection of six skin regions (pars pectoralis of apterium ventrale, pars pectoralis of <b>pteryla</b> ventralis and pars cruralis of <b>pteryla</b> membri pelvici, metatarsus, crista carnosa and pulvinus metatarsalis) were examined and compared. As a result, the antibodies AE 1 and AE 3 stained the basal cell layer and the suprabasal cell layers in the epidermis and the inner sheath cells of feather. LP 34 antibody marked the epidermis in suprabasal cell layers from scutate and reticulate scales and in inner sheath cells of feather. The antibody LL 002 stained only cells from stratum corneum formation. The exclusive reactions in horny layers are the reason for the assumption that LL 002 is more non-specific than other positive antibodies. In separate age groups, only AE 1 was marked specificly. An influence of skin region only was found with LP 34. The results of positive antibodies suggested the prevalence of certain cytokeratins in chicken epidermis. In contrast to mammals, the expression of CK 6 and CK 16 suggests the prevalence of the so-called &# 65533;hyperproliferation keratins&# 65533; in normal chicken skin, which stabilize the thin chicken skin...|$|R
50|$|Ratites {{in general}} have many {{physical}} characteristics in common, {{which are often}} not shared by the family Tinamidae, or tinamous. First, the breast muscles are underdeveloped. They do not have keeled sterna. Their wishbones (furculae) are almost absent. They have a simplified wing skeletons and musculature. Their legs are stronger {{and do not have}} air chambers, except the femurs. Their tail and flight feathers have retrogressed or have become decorative plumes. They have no feather vanes, which means they do not need to oil their feathers, hence they have no preen glands. They have no separation of <b>pterylae</b> (feathered areas) and apteria (non-feathered areas), and finally, they have palaeognathous palates.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{spread out and}} peaks from December to May in southern India and March to October in northern India. Breeding may occur {{once or twice a}} year. The courtship display of the male involves head bowing, spreading the tail and drooping wings. The nest is cup-shaped, and is built on bushes, thatched walls or small trees. It is woven of fine twigs, roots, and grasses, and embellished with large objects such as bark strips, paper, or plastic bags. Clutches typically contain two to three eggs. Adults (possibly the female) may feign injury to distract potential predators away from the nest. The eggs have a pale mauve ground colour with speckles becoming blotches towards the broad end. Eggs measure 21 mm and are 16 mm wide. Eggs take 12 days to hatch. Both parents take part in raising the young. Young birds are fed on caterpillars and insects which are replaced by fruits and berries as they mature. The chicks are psilopaedic (having down only in the <b>pterylae).</b> Eggs and chicks may be preyed on by the greater coucal and crows.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReciprocal epithelio-mesenchymal {{interactions}} between the prospective epidermis and the underlying dermis are the major driving forces {{in the development of}} skin appendages. Feather development is initiated by a still unknown signal from the dermis in feather-forming skin. The morphological response of the ectoderm to this signal is the formation of an epidermal placode, which signals back to the mesenchyme to induce dermal condensations. Together, epidermal and dermal components constitute the outgrowing feather bud. The bHLH transcription factor cDermo- 1 is expressed in developing dermis and is the earliest known marker of prospective feather tracts. To test its function during feather development, we forced cDermo- 1 expression in embryonic chicken dermis using a retroviral expression vector. In featherless (apteric) regions, cDermo- 1 misexpression induced dense, thickened dermis normally observed in feathered skin (<b>pterylae),</b> and leads to the development of regularly spaced and normally shaped ectopic feather buds. In <b>pterylae,</b> cDermo- 1 misexpression enhanced feather growth. In hindlimb skin, according to the local skin identity, misexpression of cDermo- 1 induced ectopic scale formation. Thus, we show that forced cDermo- 1 expression in developing dermis is sufficient to launch the developmental program leading to skin appendage formation. We propose a role of cDermo- 1 at the initial stages of feather induction upstream of FGF 10...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —A {{cladistic}} {{analysis of}} the tinamous, including the 47 currently recognized species and some distinct subspecies, was conducted based on 80 integumentary characters from adult and natal plumage, ramphoteca (corneum sheath of bill), and podoteca (horny scales of legs). For the adult plumage (50 characters), we studied feather pigmentation patterns from different <b>pterylae</b> (feather tracts). A criterion of overlap of basic pigmentation elements was used to assign costs to the transformation between the states {{in most of these}} characters {{in such a way that}} transformations between more similar conditions were less costly. The consensus tree was almost fully resolved, and about 50 % of its groups were relatively well supported. Because the only outgroup that could be used provided a poor root, two possible rootings of the ingroup subtree were considered; in both cases, only one of the two traditional subfamilies (the steppe tinamous) was recovered, and the other (the forest tinamous) appeared as paraphyletic. The results of the present analysis are compared with those from an osteological data set, using a strict supertree technique. The combined tree has a large number of nodes, indicating a high degree of congruence between the two data sets. [Integumentary characters; Sankoff parsimony; supertrees; Tinamidae. ] Tinamous are terrestrial birds with limited flight capabilities and are endemic to the Neotropical region.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} pea comb (P) and naked neck (Na) genes on apteria width were {{examined}} on 1020 chicks. Either Na or P resulted in significantly (P< 0. 001) increased sternal and lateral pelvic apteria width. When present together these mutations interacted {{resulting in a}} further increase in apteria width (P< 0. 05). Both P and Na mutations showed a dosage effect on feather tract width. Poultry Science 56 : 1683 - 1685, 1977 Naked neck and pea comb are morphological traits caused by the incompletely dominant genes Na and P, respectively. The naked neck mutation results in {{a reduction in the}} <b>pterylae</b> or feather tracts, particularly the head tract, as well as the elimination of down and semiplumes from the apteria (Hutt, 1949). The P gene causes the characteristic pea comb and is associated with breast ridge, a slight ridge of thickened skin running lengthwise along the keel bone (Munro and Kosin, 1940; Crawford, 1961). This study was designed to study the effects of the P and Na genes on certain feather tracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS The population used in this study was segregating for the P and Na genes and had been maintained as a closed population for approxi-mately 10 years. Within line matings were conducted in order to compare all combina-tions of pea comb and naked neck genotypes. Heterozygous Plp+ males were also mated to unrelated Brown Leghorn females. Determination of comb and breast ridge phenotype, sex and appropriate apteria widths were made at day of age. The sternal apterium (SA) was measured on na+/na+ and Na/na+ chicks, while the lateral pelvic apterium (LPA) was measured on Na/na+ and Na/Na birds. The SA and LPA measurements were made at approximately mid-breast and above the hip joint, respectively. A total of 1020 birds wer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{appearance}} of whole carcass and skin-on cut-up products {{is an important}} attribute that deeply affects the consumer’s choice. Skin pigmenta-tion is affected mainly by genetics, concentration and dietary source of pigments, health status of the birds, and scalding-plucking conditions during slaughtering, although other factors might play an important role. Retailers request batches of broiler chicken carcasses characterized by uniform skin pigmentation to be sold as whole carcass or parts. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the variability of skin color of yellow-skinned broilers reared under intensive conditions. For the study, a total of 2, 300 medium size broiler chickens (2, 300 to 2, 500 g of live weight) from 23 flocks (100 birds/flock; n = 12 flocks of males and n = 11 flocks of females; n = 12 flocks of Ross 508 and n = 11 flocks of Ross 308) were randomly selected in a single slaughterhouse. The color measurements were carried out on both breast and thigh <b>pterylae</b> as well as on shank skin adopting the L * a * b * system and using a Minolta colorimeter CR 300. The overall range in measured yellowness (b*) was fairly large for all skin color measurement posi-tions. For breast, a mean value of 22. 77 (SD = 5. 12) was observed, with values ranging from 7. 45 to 39. 12. Average values of thigh and shank were 20. 23 (SD = 5. 02; range 1. 99 to 37. 82) and 53. 99 (SD = 8. 13; range 24. 22 to 78. 65), respectively. A higher skin yellowness was observed in females in all body parts as well as in Ross 308. Yellowness values of breast and thigh were significantly correlated (r = 0. 85; P < 0. 01), suggesting that the color evaluation may be carried out only on one measurement position of the skin.
