5|$|Three soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Darby Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is <b>prevalent</b> in the northwest part of the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is <b>prevalent</b> throughout the watershed except in its lower reaches. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. The Urban Land-Wetbrook-Pitts soil association is <b>prevalent</b> {{in the southern part}} of the watershed. It consists of silty, sandy, and deep soil that rests on coastal sediments. Roughly 53% of the land in the Darby Creek watershed is classified as having slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|Although less <b>prevalent</b> {{in modern}} post-industrial Western societies, the {{offering}} of premasticated foods to infants {{is found in}} many traditional cultures and offers their infants numerous benefits. In North America, premastication is still commonly used by Black and Hispanic mothers, and commonly used by women of Inuit and Aleut peoples.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} books in the series, the themes of seven, sin and virtue are <b>prevalent</b> throughout Sir Thursday providing the personality characteristics {{for many of the}} main characters.|$|E
5|$|B-line. Founded by Bolzano, born 1915. Bolzano's {{less common}} line, {{although}} strong in Austria, is not <b>prevalent</b> elsewhere. The line is spreading nevertheless; the U.S. and several European countries including Great Britain are establishing Bolzano lines.|$|E
5|$|Both William Penn and the Lords Baltimore {{encouraged}} Irish Protestant immigration, {{hoping they}} could obtain indentured servants {{to work on}} their estates and on colonial developments. Often areas of the Middle Colonies displayed <b>prevalent</b> Irish cultural influence.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton x turgidulus is a {{naturally}} occurring hybrid cross of B.rupestris with the kurrajong B.populneus subsp. populneus. It is particularly <b>prevalent</b> east of Boonah.|$|E
5|$|During 2005, {{the largest}} {{recorded}} epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak {{was associated with}} mutations in the rotavirus A genome, possibly helping the virus escape the <b>prevalent</b> immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Human-raised R. norvegicus {{are more}} prone to {{specific}} health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are <b>prevalent</b> in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} where {{narcissi}} are <b>prevalent,</b> their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. For instance, the slopes around Montreux, Switzerland {{and its associated}} riviera come alive with blooms each May (May Snow) at the annual Narcissi Festival. Festivals are also held in many other countries.|$|E
5|$|James Lewis {{argues that}} {{scientific}} themes are so <b>prevalent</b> in The Satanic Bible because LaVey was {{appealing to the}} authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is <b>prevalent,</b> which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is very rare. There are approximately 150 cases of McLeod syndrome worldwide. Because of its X-linked mode of inheritance, {{it is much}} more <b>prevalent</b> in males.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Europeans favoured self bows as hand bows, {{but they}} made {{composite}} prods for crossbows. The prods were usually well protected from rain and humidity which are <b>prevalent</b> in much of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{in adults}} {{is a complicated}} disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. Bulimia nervosa and gastroparesis are especially <b>prevalent</b> among the misdiagnoses of rumination.|$|E
5|$|Stela 19 {{demonstrates}} the foreign influences <b>prevalent</b> at Seibal during the Late Classic. It depicts a lord wearing a mask representing the central Mexican wind god Ehecatl.|$|E
5|$|Subduction of the Guadalupe Plate/Farallon Plate beneath Baja California was <b>prevalent</b> in {{the region}} until 12,5–11 million years ago; {{volcanic}} activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated {{with the development of}} the Gulf of California. Earlier subduction-related volcanism during the Miocene formed the volcanic deposits of the Comondú Group.|$|E
5|$|The Czech {{population}} (living {{mainly in}} the northern part of the area: Bohumín, Orlová, etc.) declined numerically at the end of the 19th century, assimilating with the <b>prevalent</b> Polish population. This process shifted with the industrial boom in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Matrikas {{are usually}} {{depicted}} {{in a group}} of seven called Saptamatrika(s) (Seven Mothers). However, they may be eight Matrikas called Ashtamatrika(s). In South India, Saptamatrika worship is <b>prevalent</b> whereas the Ashtamatrika are venerated in Nepal.|$|E
5|$|The Synod of Whitby, which {{debated whether}} the Northumbrian church should follow the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, {{was held in}} 664. Deusdedit {{does not appear to}} have been present, perhaps because of an {{outbreak}} of the plague <b>prevalent</b> in England at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} these riots is still evident in the North 24th Street district, with high numbers of vacant lots and general {{economic}} depression still <b>prevalent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors <b>prevalent</b> in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common. The most <b>prevalent</b> precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.|$|E
5|$|The {{province}} of Punjab, in which Faisalabad {{is the second}} largest city, has <b>prevalent</b> sociocultural distinctions. Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure, high age dependency ratio, {{a higher percentage of}} males, a higher proportion of married population, and heterogeneity in castes and languages.|$|E
5|$|The scandal fuelled the {{attitude}} that male homosexuality was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still <b>prevalent</b> in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde of being an active homosexual.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing time-out) has become <b>prevalent</b> and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the phallus has existed since the Stone Age, and was {{particularly}} <b>prevalent</b> during the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|This breed {{is equally}} {{suitable}} {{as a family}} dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two <b>prevalent</b> conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} {{of using a}} variety of clarinets to achieve coloristic variety was common in 20th-century classical music and continues today. However, many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on B or E clarinets, which are often of better quality and more <b>prevalent</b> and accessible.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more <b>prevalent</b> among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of {{the most}} <b>prevalent</b> lines today, {{descendants}} include the second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was brought back to stud {{at the age of}} 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns that the line would not survive, and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|After their year {{of active}} service, Western Han-era {{soldiers}} were demobilized and sent home, {{where they were}} obligated to join the local militia that convened every eighth month of the year. This obligation was intended to curb local and regional warlordism that nonetheless became <b>prevalent</b> {{by the end of}} Han. Militias dismissed members who reached the age of fifty-six. By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired soldiers to join local militias was removed.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} <b>prevalent</b> if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>prevalent</b> form of {{religion}} in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings. Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers {{is one of the most}} important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.|$|E
