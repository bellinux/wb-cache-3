5|$|McGugin {{took time}} off from {{coaching}} {{to work in the}} mining business during the First World War. On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. <b>Poor</b> <b>Little</b> Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E

For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E
25|$|Victor Alonso of Spanoramic records got {{interested}} in Poventud's musical work. Before her death, Alonso promised Poventud's mother that he {{would give him a}} career opportunity. He made Poventud an offer that included the recording of Poventud's first record album titled Pobre Huerfanito (<b>Poor</b> <b>Little</b> Orphan) in New York City. At this point, Poventud's father again resisted the boy's musical career, and his older brother Carlos argued with the father about Miguelito's future. After this argument, Carlos took young Poventud to live with him in New York City, and became his legal guardian.|$|E
25|$|Seymour Kneitel {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} in 1964, and Paramount brought in comic book veteran Howard Post to run the cartoon studio. Under Post's supervision, Paramount began new cartoon series and {{characters}} such as Swifty and Shorty and Honey Halfwitch (the latter having originated from the Modern Madcaps series in the 1965 short <b>Poor</b> <b>Little</b> Witch Girl), and allowed comic strip artist Jack Mendelsohn to direct two well-received cartoons based upon children's imaginations and drawing styles: The Story of George Washington and A Leak in the Dike (both 1965).|$|E

25|$|Improved {{literacy}} bolsters {{both the}} informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively <b>poor,</b> <b>little</b> evidence {{was found that}} the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E

No one can realize more than [...] how <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> Johnnie meant to [...] who hardly knew him..." [...] He went on to state [...] "I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." [...] In her final mention of John in her diary, Queen Mary wrote simply [...] "miss the dear child very much indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Mississippi's governor, Hugh L. White, deplored the murder, {{asserting that}} local {{authorities}} should pursue a [...] "vigorous prosecution." [...] He sent a telegram {{to the national}} offices of the NAACP promising a full investigation and assuring them [...] "Mississippi does not condone such conduct." [...] Delta residents, both black and white, also distanced themselves from Till's murder, finding the circumstances abhorrent. Local newspaper editorials denounced the murderers without question. Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, [...] "The white people around here feel pretty mad about the way that <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> boy was treated, and they won't stand for this." ...|$|E

500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Angelou was partially {{descended from the}} Mende people of West Africa. [...] A 2008 PBS documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the Civil War, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. [...] Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being {{the father of her}} child. [...] After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite the discovery that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County poorhouse in Missouri with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother. Angelou described Lee as [...] "that <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> Black girl, physically and mentally bruised." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{am sorry}} to say that {{difficulties}} have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate defeat. it seems the Appellee [...] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the Appellor [...] in single combat which if not accepted by the Appellor the suit is lost and, if accepted, and the Appellee can hold out from sun rise to sun set, then he wins the contest and claims his discharge, otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing but also the pain of death into the bargain. It is rumoured here that is the plea intended {{to be set up}} by the Def. and unless we can devise any means by arguement to induce the Court not to allow it, I am very apprehensive our <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> Knight {{will never be able to}} contend the Battle with his brutish opponent.|$|E
500|$|Pauline was grief-stricken {{and later}} said [...] "My <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> boy. If only I {{had been with}} him...I would have nursed him as I nursed his father". She came to blame Borghese for his {{decision}} to send Dermide to Frascati and called him [...] "the butcher of my son", believing that, {{had it not been}} for her husband, her son [...] "would still be alive". Leclerc's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide, leaving him to die under the care of servants, when she could have left him in France, to live with them. Nonetheless, Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert, next to General Leclerc. Dermide's inheritance reverted to his father's family and, in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert, Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825.|$|E
500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this <b>poor</b> <b>little</b> old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me."
