5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E
500|$|The {{irradiation}} of 232Th with neutrons then processing {{it has to}} be mastered {{before these}} advantages can be realised, and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> cycle; research continues in this area. Another common criticism centres around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle: some entities like the Nuclear Energy Agency predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance—a situation which may persist [...] "in the coming decades". The isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are mostly not transuranic, but some of them are still very dangerous, such as 231Pa, which has a half-life of 32,760years and is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E
40|$|A variance-to-mean noise technique, {{modified}} to eliminate systematic errors from drifting of reactor power, {{has been used}} to infer integral values of effective beta for uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fueled</b> fast reactor modk-ups. The measurement technique, including corrections for a finite detector-electrometer time response, is described together with preliminary beta measurement results...|$|R
40|$|One of {{two major}} {{facilities}} used for <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuels</b> research and development studies at Battelle-Northwest is the <b>Plutonium</b> <b>Fuels</b> Laboratory (PFL). This facility was specifically designed and equipped {{for research and development}} studies involving multikilogram quantities of plutonium and its mixtures, compounds, and alloys. As at other sites, the design and operation philosophy of the PFL is one of complete plutonium containment. Primary plutonium containment is provided by glove boxes, secondary containment is provided by individual laboratories, and tertiary containment is supplied by the building proper. Air samples, taken throughout the facility, are constantly being monitored for free contamination. Personnel exposure caused by X, gamma, and neutron radiation has been primarily omitted by inspiring good work habits and housekeeping practices in personnel (i. e., uncontrolled accumulations of plutonium are avoided, plutonium is confined as much as possible, exposure times are limited, and shielding equipment is used whenever necessary). Rules for the prevention of an inadvertent criticality in the PFL are based upon the criteria that at least two control conditions must fail before criticality is imminent...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, India had 18 {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactors in operation, with another four projects of 2.8 GW capacity launched. The country plans to implement fast breeder reactors, using <b>plutonium</b> based <b>fuel.</b> <b>Plutonium</b> is obtained by reprocessing spent fuel of first stage reactors. India {{is in the}} process of launching its first prototype fast breeder reactor of 500 MW capacity in Tamil Nadu.|$|R

50|$|Thermal-neutron {{reactors}} (today's {{nuclear power}} stations) can reuse reactor-grade plutonium {{only to a}} limited degree as MOX fuel, and only for a second cycle; fast-neutron reactors, of which there {{is less than a}} handful operating today, can use reactor-grade <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> as a means to reduce the transuranium content of spent nuclear fuel/nuclear waste.|$|E

50|$|Permissive Action Links are {{powered by}} low-maintenance {{radioisotope}} generators. Instead {{of a conventional}} battery, these generators produce electricity based on the heat evolved from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. Although half-life of 238Pu is 87.7 years, these generators have shorter lifespans. This {{is due to the}} pressurization of the generator from helium produced by the alpha decay of the <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1978, the U.S. led {{the world}} in numbers and {{efficiency}} of nuclear power plants. The chemistry of wartime reprocessing had been adapted to the commercial fuel cycle. Experimental breeder reactors, which could burn <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> more efficiently and also make more new <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> than it could consume, had furnished experience for the design and construction of commercial-sized demonstration plants. The European nations, Russia and Japan particularly, were building nuclear power plants and looking ahead to breeder reactors for the future. Therefore, President Carter’s dramatic changes in U.S. nuclear energy policy to discontinue reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and terminate the U.S. Breeder Reactor Program, a program Ferguson himself had worked on and believed in, were abrupt and difficult for most countries to understand. Carter hoped that in setting this example, the U.S. would encourage other nations to follow its lead. Most nations went ahead with reprocessing and breeder development until high costs and loss of political support delayed plans in nuclear projects around the world.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{generating}} the world's first electricity from atomic energy, EBR-I {{was also the}} world's first breeder reactor {{and the first to}} use <b>plutonium</b> <b>fuel</b> to generate electricity (see also the Clementine nuclear reactor). EBR-1's initial purpose was to prove Enrico Fermi's fuel breeding principle, a principle that showed a nuclear reactor producing more fuel atoms than consumed. Along with generating electricity, EBR-1 would also prove this principle.|$|E

Reaction rate results, including sodium activation are given for ZPPR- 18 A. Also included are spatial decoupling results from ZPPR- 18. As a successor to JUPITER-III, the Io program investigated the effects of uranium fuel distribution in mixed uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>fueled</b> assemblies.
