5000|$|If light {{levels are}} high {{the use of}} neutral density filters will reduce the light {{entering}} the lens, thus enabling the exposure to be extended. A <b>polarising</b> <b>filter</b> can also be fitted to the lens. This has a dual effect of reducing reflections within the image and reducing the light by about two stops. Photographers set the camera's ISO setting to the lowest available on the camera (commonly 100), as this reduces the camera's sensitivity to light and so gives the slowest possible shutter speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of screens and projectors, the source light is first polarised by a filter in one {{direction}} and then passed on to another filter, filled with liquid crystals. By changing the voltage applied to this crystal filter, it will work as a switching <b>polarising</b> <b>filter,</b> giving different gray scales of the light coming out. The light is changed only once for each image frame. The light valve thus consists of the two polarising filters, where one has a voltage controlled switch function thanks to the properties of the liquid crystals.

50|$|Until {{recent years}} {{focusing}} {{of a camera}} lens to achieve a sharp image on the film plane was achieved {{by means of a}} very shallow helical thread in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the film plane. This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.|$|R
50|$|A {{polarizing}} / <b>polarising</b> <b>filter</b> {{is often}} {{placed in front}} of the camera lens in photography in order to darken skies, manage reflections, or suppress glare from the surface of lakes or the sea. Since reflections (and sky-light) tend to be at least partially linearly-polarized, a linear polarizer can be used to change the balance of the light in the photograph. The rotational orientation of the filter is adjusted for the preferred artistic effect. For modern cameras, a circular polarizer is typically used; this comprises firstly a linear polarizer which performs the artistic function just described, followed by a quarter-wave plate which further transforms the now-linearly polarized light into circularly-polarised light before entering the camera. This additional step avoids problems with auto-focus and light-metering sensors within some cameras, which otherwise may not function reliably with a simple linear polariser.|$|E
50|$|In digital {{photography}} {{the majority of}} filters used with film cameras have been rendered redundant by digital filters applied either in-camera or during post processing. Exceptions include the ultraviolet (UV) filter typically used to protect the front surface of the lens, the neutral density (ND) filter, the <b>polarising</b> <b>filter</b> and the infra red (IR) filter. The neutral density filter permits effects requiring wide apertures or long exposures {{to be applied to}} brightly lit scenes, while the graduated neutral density filter is useful in situations where the scene's dynamic range exceeds the capability of the sensor. Not using optical filters in front of the lens has the advantage of avoiding the reduction of image quality caused by the presence of an extra optical element in the light path and may be necessary to avoid vignetting when using wide-angle lenses.|$|E

50|$|Filters {{modify the}} images recorded. Sometimes {{they are used}} to make only subtle changes to images; other times the image would simply not be {{possible}} without them. In monochrome photography coloured filters affect the relative brightness of different colours; red lipstick may be rendered as anything from almost white to almost black with different filters. Others change the colour balance of images, so that photographs under incandescent lighting show colours as they are perceived, rather than with a reddish tinge. There are filters that distort the image in a desired way, diffusing an otherwise sharp image, adding a starry effect, etc. Linear and circular <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> reduce oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces.|$|R

40|$|AIMSâ€”The {{effect of}} local {{anaesthetics}} on optic nerve function can be investigated by quantifying the relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). â€¨METHODSâ€”The study compared {{the depth of}} induced RAPD following posterior sub-Tenon's, retrobulbar, and peribulbar local anaesthetics using crossed <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> before cataract surgery (time 1 Â =Â  5 Â minutes), immediately after surgery (time 2 Â =Â  42 Â minutes (av)), and once again on the ward (time 3 Â =Â  107 Â minutes (av)). â€¨RESULTSâ€”All patients developed a RAPD.

This effect was reduced when the shorter operation time for this group was entered as a cofactor (pÂ =Â  0. 063).

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a method for}} reconstruct-ing the {{polarisation}} components from unpolarised imagery. Our approach rests on a model of polarisation which accounts for reflection from rough surfaces illuminated at moderate and large angles of incidence. Departing from the microfacet structure of rough surfaces, we relate the maximal and minimal polarimetric intensities to the diffuse and specular components of an un-polarised image via the Fresnel reflection theory. This allows us to reconstruct the polarimetric components from a single unpolarised image. Thus, the model presented here provides {{a link between the}} microfacet structure and polarisation of light upon reflection from rough surfaces. We evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed polarisation components and illustrate the utility of the method for the simulation of a <b>polarising</b> <b>filter</b> on real-world images. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an airborne experiment using horizontal and vertical <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> on a pair of co-mounted 12. 8 megapixel Canon 5 D digital cameras. These cameras were mounted in the underside camera port of a light aircraft, both cameras inclined at 30 degrees off-nadir. One camera had the polarisation filter oriented vertically and the other oriented horizontally. Forward-looking, overlapping, oblique aerial photography was captured over known seagrass meadows off the Adelaide metropolitan coastline, plus inland urban water bodies. The portrait oriented field of view allowed a progression on the image from near-nadir to beyond the critical Brewster angle of 53 degrees. Results show the removal of sky reflectance, turbulence and wave action on the vertically-oriented filter imagery compared to the horizontally-oriented filter imagery in both clear and turbid waters. For clear waters the removal of sky reflectance, waves and surface turbulence allowed visualisation of the seafloor suitable for benthic mapping in areas of seagrass. However in turbid water the removal of surface effects still did not allow the seafloor to be visualised due to multiple scatter {{in the body of the}} water. This method therefore also has application in differentiating clear and turbid waters on oblique photography...|$|R
40|$|Putting {{on a pair}} of polarised {{sunglasses}} is {{as close}} as most of us get to seeing polarised light. Photographers also use <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> and, in both cases, the reason for placing such filters in front of eye or camera is to reduce glare and increase contrast within the image or scene viewed. Animal visual systems also utilise polarised light for these purposes, along with navigation, sexual signalling and detecting water. They rarely, if ever, use optical filters to achieve polarisation sensitivity; instead it is an intrinsic property of their photoreceptors. Linear polarising sensitivity is common in the animal kingdom, particularly in invertebrates such as arthropods (insects, crustaceans and spiders) and cephalopods. Linear polarising sensitivity is also known in vertebrates, including fish, birds and a few amphibians and reptiles. In truth, this ability is probably more widespread than we think, and in the cephalopods and many crustaceans it may replace colour vision. While circular polarising photography â€” used for cancer detection in medical imaging and for (explosive) mine detection underwater â€” might be considered an obscure man-made optical trick, some animals also have circular polarising sensitivity. Before going on to describe how and why animals utilise polarised light, we briefly examine what polarised light is, why it is called linear or circular, where it comes from and where it is frequently found in natural environments (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Can {{non-contact}} SIAscopy {{be used in}} {{the diagnosis}} and quantification of pigmentary skin changes associated with photodamage? Introduction Non-contact SIAscopy is a new imaging technique where a standard polarised photographic image of the skin is decomposed to produce independent colour, blood and melanin images using SIAscopy (a form of reflectance spectroscopy). Photodamage {{is a product of the}} physiological changes caused by chronic sun exposure on the skin. Measuring the extent of photodamage has always been difficult, with most analysis requiring subjective user interpretation of results. No one available method appears better at clearly identifying and quantifying photodamage within the skin and no truly objective method exists which enables automatic measurement of these characteristics without expert evaluation. Methods and results 1140 images of skin of various ages and levels of damage were acquired using standard digital colour photography obtained through crossed <b>polarising</b> <b>filters.</b> The sample was split into a model and test set and analysis algorithms were employed to quantify features including dyspigmentation, sallowness, erythema and vessel dilation. Relevant features were isolated and the relationship with age was determined using linear regression. From this a predictive skin photodamage age was generated and tested with a sample set of images. Conclusions Specific pigmentary characteristic of photodamage can be identified and quantified using non-contact SIAscopy. It is an independent, repeatable, robust and inexpensive method of assessing the level of photodamage from a standard digital photograph and the results can be used to identify individuals most at risk of developing skin cancers...|$|R

This paper can also be found at: [URL] advances in automated production processes have resulted in the need for detecting, reading and decoding 2 D datamatrix barcodes at very high speeds. This requires the correct combination of high speed optical devices that are capable of capturing high quality images and computer vision algorithms that can read and decode the barcodes accurately. Such barcode readers should also be capable of resolving fundamental imaging challenges arising from blurred barcode edges, reflections from possible polyethylene wrapping, poor and/or non-uniform illumination, fluctuations of focus, rotation and scale changes. Addressing the above challenges in this paper we propose the design and implementation of a high speed multi-barcode reader and provide test results from an industrial trial. To authors knowledge such a comprehensive system has not been proposed and fully investigated in existing literature. To reduce the reflections on the images caused due to polyethylene wrapping used in typical packaging, <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> have been used.

The enhanced images are subsequently used for barcode detection and recognition. We provide experimental results from a factory trial of using the multi-barcode reader and evaluate the performance of each optical unit and computer vision algorithm used.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery {{has been a}} major advance in the practice of medicine as it reduces the morbidity associated with larger incisions required for open surgery. A videoscopic system is used to capture and transmit two-dimensional images of the patient during a procedure. In open surgery, the binocular configuration of the human visual system is used to generate key depth information. Minimally {{invasive surgery}} requires interpretation of monocular visual cues to perform visuospatial judgments and complex psychomotor skills. The absence of binocular depth cues extends the learning curve during which there is an increased risk of surgical error. Stereoendoscopes produce binocular visual cues by presenting horizontally disparate images of the operative field to each eye. Stereoscopic surgery is associated with improvements in surgical performance but historical projection mechanisms generated intolerable viewing conditions resulting in visual fatigue. Time-parallel passive polarising stereoscopic displays use <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> to simultaneously designate alternate pixel rows of horizontally disparate images. Circular polarising eyewear corresponding to the display surface filters allows disparate images to be viewed separately by each eye. The difference between these images is interpreted as a binocular depth cue. This thesis aims to identify the potential impact and tolerance of time-parallel passive polarising stereoscopic displays for minimally invasive surgery. Accommodative dynamic responses were used to objectively measure visual fatigue following stereoscopic viewing. Visual perception of stereoscopic stimuli was investigated by psychophysical performance during visual search and by quantifying attention deployment while viewing stereoscopic surgery. This work provides insight into the future role of stereoscopic visualisation for minimally invasive surgery. It indicates that time-parallel passive polarising displays improve performance of surgical skills and are well tolerated by experienced minimally invasive surgeons under stereoscopic conditions. Novice surgeons may experience increased visual fatigue while learning minimally invasive surgery due to disturbance of normal visual attention mechanisms. This thesis forms the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate the impact of this technology on the performance of minimally invasive surgery...|$|R
40|$|The unique {{advantages}} for astronomy on the Antarctic plateau are now well established. In particular, Dome C, Antarctica is potentially {{one of the}} best new sites for optical, infrared and sub-millimeter astronomy, presenting the opportunity to build unique astronomical instruments. Located high on the Antarctic plateau, Dome C offers low wind, clear skies, and negligible precipitation. This thesis addresses three additional properties of the site relevant to optical astronomy-sky brightness, atmospheric extinction and optical turbulence. The sky at an optical astronomy site must be dark, and the atmosphere very clean with minimal light extinction. At present little is known from an astronomer's perspective about the optical sky brightness and atmospheric extinction at most Antarctic sites. The high latitude of Dome C means that the Sun spends a relatively small amount of time far below the horizon, implying longer periods of astronomical twilight and less optical dark time than other sites, especially those close to the equator. We review the contributions to sky brightness at high-latitude sites, and calculate the amount of usable dark time at Dome C. We also explore the implications of the limited sky coverage of high-latitude sites, and review optical extinction data from the South Pole. A proposal to extend the amount of usable dark time through the use of <b>polarising</b> <b>filters</b> is examined, and we present the design and calibration of an instrument (called Nigel) to measure the brightness, spectrum and temporal characteristics of the twilight and night sky. The atmospheric turbulence profile above an astronomical site limits the achievable resolution and sensitivity of a telescope. The atmospheric conditions above high plateau Antarctic sites are different to temperate sites; the boundary layer of turbulence is confined very close to the surface, and the upper atmosphere turbulence very weak. We present the first winter-time turbulence profiles of the atmosphere above Dome C, and characterise the site in terms of the achievable precision for photometry and astrometry, and the isoplanatic angle and coherence time for the adaptive optics...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a <b>polarised</b> optical <b>filter</b> is more {{complicated}} than that of a filter where the polarisation effect does not exist (at a normal angle of incidence). An error in the optical parameters, such as the physical thickness or refractive index of a layer, results in a change in the spectral performance of the multilayer structure. The correlation between error sensitivity and the polarisation effect of light in structures designed at an oblique angle was investigated. To illustrate the correlation, a perpendicular (S) and parallel (P) polarised beam splitter, at 0. 9818 Âµm central wavelength, designed by genetic algorithm, was used. The beam splitter changes its state of polarisation according to the error in thickness simultaneously induced in each of the layers. The error was calculated by optimising the original design. The observation of the change of the state of polarisation as a result of error sensitivity leads to a different method of designing pure S-polarised or P-polarised optical filters...|$|R
40|$|Mapping {{of marine}} benthic flora using remote sensing {{techniques}} has, {{over the past}} decade, been used to locate environmentally stressed areas in the South Australian marine environment. These studies used panchromatic/colour aerial photography and/or medium resolution multispectral satellite imagery to create a time series showing location and rate of seagrass loss. While successful within their project parameters, these studies were limited by conditions at time of image capture, such as sun-glare, wave action and low contrast in deeper waters due to absorption and scattering. This research thesis reports the successful use of polarisation on the capture of visible and near infra-red optical imagery as a method to minimise these limiting factors. Two experimental test flights were undertaken using commercial off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted in the camera port of a light aircraft. The first flight compared vertical polarisation using co-mounted visible and infra-red cameras. The second flight compared vertical and horizontal polarisation using co-mounted identical visible spectrum cameras. The main finding of this series of airborne polarisation experiments is that sea surface reflection is removed by using vertically <b>polarised</b> <b>filters</b> at, and around, the Brewster angle of 53 degrees off nadir, especially when viewing sunwards. The effect is {{the same in the}} visible and infra-red parts of the spectrum. This reflection includes sky reflectance, lambertian sun glare, reflection due to wave action, and turbulence, but not direct solar specular reflection. Vertical polarisation filters improve the imaging of benthic flora compared to horizontally polarised imagery and, by extension, non-polarised imagery. The successful use of polarisation to remove surface reflectance over water is limited to imagery captured at or near the Brewster angle. By using successive overlapping frames this can be achieved, as shown by the experiments. Ideally all of the image should be at the Brewster angle. A conceptual design for a conical optical scanner which builds wide-swath imagery where each pixel in each band is solely a record of the vertically polarised signal at the Brewster Angle is presented {{as a result of these}} experiments.

40|$|Purpose and background: This {{study has}} {{particular}} significance in ophthalmic dispensing {{as well as}} for optometry when considering the use of readymade readers (RMRs) both in private practice and in the public health sector. This study investigated firstly whether the optical centre (OC) distance for a sample of RMRs correlates with the nearâ€“inter-pupillary distance (near-IPD) for presbyopic patients, whether induced prism occurs with convergence when reading and whether RMR lenses are free of optical strain. Â  Methods: Near-IPDs (measured by a single individual) were obtained from record cards of 1080 patients (540 male patients and 540 female patients). The OC distances were determined for 60 RMRs using a Nikon PL- 2 screen vertometer, and induced prismatic effects were calculated for vertical and horizontal meridians. The presence of optical strain was analysed and graded using crossed <b>polarised</b> <b>filters</b> (within a polariscope). Â  Results: The measured average near-IPD was 59. 04 mm (s. d. Â± 2. 87) for the 540 female patients and 61. 59 mm (s. d. Â± 3. 08) for the 540 male patients. The measured average RMR OC distance was 64. 49 mm (s. d. Â± 3. 74) for female patients and 62. 77 mm (s. d. Â± 1. 57) for male patients. Based on the mean near-IPD and the corresponding RMR OC distance, the average horizontal prismatic effect found in RMRs designed for female patients with induced prism was 0. 11 pd base-out (5. 06 mm outwards) and 0. 04 pd base-in (1. 26 mm inwards). For male RMRs, this was 0. 03 pd base-out (1. 32 mm outwards) and 0. 02 pd base-in (1. 28 mm inwards). When comparing RMR distances with near-IPDs, t = - 7. 87, p < 0. 001 for female patients and t = - 3. 69, p < 0. 001 for male patients. The average vertical differential prismatic effect for female patients was 0. 67 pd and it was 0. 68 pd for male patients. Optical strain was observed in 66. 67 % and 56. 67 % of RMR lenses for female and male patients, respectively. The strain pattern was found to be most severe in the inferior temporal periphery for 34 RMRs for female patients and for 20 RMRs for male patients, followed by the inferior nasal periphery for 27 and 18 lenses (RMRs) for male and female patients, respectively. Â  Conclusion: Most RMRs were found to be within international standard tolerances for horizontally induced prismatic effects, but 10 % of female and 36. 67 % of male RMRs had vertical prismatic effects, which exceeded international standards. Significant optical strain was found in the inferior nasal reading portion of the RMRs.

Discrete square-based pyramidal co-ordination complexes have been targeted in which the apical Mâ€“X or M=O bonds display {{a high degree of}} intermolecular alignment. Chapter 1 provides an overview of X-ray polarisation dependence, existing X-ray polarimeters and current materials offering X-ray polarisation capabilities. Finally, a molecular design strategy for the thesis is outlined. In Chapter 2, [(4, 4 â€²-Me 2 bipy) 2 Cu 2 Br 2 (Î¼-C 2 O 4) ] (1 a) has been subjected to a successful dichroic evaluation at the Cu (8. 9 keV) and Br K-edges (13. 5 keV). The origins of the X-ray dichroism in 1 a have been modelled using two complementary theoretical methodologies; i) TD-DFT and ii) multiple scattering theory, which have identified the importance of the apical Cuâ€“Br bond in SBP 1 a. In Chapter 3 the motif [(Î±-diimine) MBr(Î²-diketonate) ] has been targeted as an all purpose platform for the Cu (3 â€“ 5, 8. 9 keV), Ni (6, 8. 4 keV), Co (7, 7. 7 keV), Fe (10, 7. 1 keV) and Mn (11, 6. 4 keV) ] K-edges. Highly aligned SBP 3 a has been shown to display X-ray dichroism at the Cu K-edge. For 6, 7, 10 and 11, five co-ordinate metal centres can indeed be accessed using suitably tailored pyridylarylimine chelates; however, the geometries of the metal centres can be anywhere between distorted trigonal bipyramidal and distorted square-based pyramidal while the intermolecular alignment is variable. In Chapter 4 macrocyclic tetraphenylporphyrinato (TPP 2 -) has been employed as a rigid support to fill the basal co-ordination sites in SBP [(TPP) MX] (M = Co, X = Cl (15 a); M = Co, X = Br (15 b); M = Fe, X = Br (16); M = Mn, X = Br (17) ] and [(TPP) MO] [M = V (18), Ti (19) ]. Notable X-ray dichroism has been observed at the Co (7. 7 keV), Fe (7. 1 keV), V (5. 5 keV) and Ti (4. 9 keV) K-edges in highly aligned 15, 16, 18 and 19, respectively. The observed dichroic features in 15 a and 18 have also been modelled using multiple scattering theory. In addition, compact hybrid filters were developed using TPP-modified [(Y 2 -TPP) FeX] [(Y = Cl, X = Br (20 a); Y = Br, X = Cl (20 b); Y = X = Br (20 c) ], which offer multiple K-edges in one molecule. Chapter 5 explores exclusively halides and oxides of the earlier transition metal elements [Cr (5. 9 keV), V (5. 5 keV), Ti (4. 9 keV) ], in which the pre-edge has been observed to reveal the most dominant X-ray polarisation dependence. Hence, M(III) complexes [(nacnac) MCl(Î²-diketonate] [M = Cr, Î²-diketonate = dbm (21), acac (22); M = V, Î²-diketonate = acac (23 a), dbm (23 b); M = Ti, Î²-diketonate = dbm (24) ] have been targeted and selected examples have been deliberately oxidised to generate M(IV) oxides [(nacnac) MO(dbm) ] [M = V (25), Ti (26) ]. The FEFF code has been used to predict the polarised XAS spectra in an attempt to evaluate the feasibility of materials of this structural type. Chapter 6 gives overarching conclusions of the key themes of the thesis with a summary that highlight the contributions to the area and science in general.
