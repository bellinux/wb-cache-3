50|$|The {{locomotive}} part of {{the business}} is now {{part of the}} Hunslet Engine Company. Locomotive-building was always only one part of a diverse product inventory that included underground diesel-powered mining locomotives, hydraulic <b>pit-props</b> and related mining equipment.|$|R
50|$|Volunteers {{manning the}} Rocket House saved {{the lives of}} many {{seafarers}} from the ships wrecked along the Weybourne coast. The crew of the coal ship Emily however were not so lucky when it was lost: they all lost their lives except the master who survived. In 1823 a brig from Naples, Italy, carrying a cargo of olive oil broke up, but six of her crew were saved. When the Norwegian barque Ida was wrecked carrying <b>pit-props</b> to Cardiff, all the crew was rescued using a rocket line. The crew and some villagers salvaged some of the <b>pit-props</b> and it is said that many of these timbers survive in barns and cottages around Weybourne to this day. In January 1915 the bodies of six sailors from the S.S. George Royal were washed up on Weybourne beach. There is a tombstone in the churchyard sacred to their memory. The Rocket House still stands but is now a private residence.|$|R
50|$|Manufactures mainly {{cluster in}} or near the city of Aberdeen, but {{throughout}} the rural districts one finds much milling of corn, brick and tile making, smith-work, brewing and distilling, cart and farm-implement making, casting and drying of peat, and timber-felling, especially on Deeside and Donside, for <b>pit-props,</b> railway sleepers, laths and barrel staves. A number of paper-making establishments operate, most of them on the Don near Aberdeen.|$|R
50|$|Around 1940, Tarrant {{purchased}} Hafod Estate at Eglwys Newydd, near Cwmystwyth above Aberystwyth in Wales {{and moved}} to live there soon afterwards. He soon began felling trees for use as <b>pit-props</b> for the war-effort and also started to plan {{the restoration of the}} neglected mansion there. He died on 18 March 1942 at Hafod Mansion, {{as a result of a}} coronary thrombosis and was buried in the Hafod churchyard.|$|R
50|$|U-123s first patrol {{began with}} her {{departure}} from Kiel on 21 September 1940. Her route took {{her across the}} North Sea, through {{the gap between the}} Faroe and Shetland Islands and into the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland. She sank six ships in October, including Shekatika which was hit with no less than five torpedoes before she went to the bottom east southeast of Rockall. Nevertheless, her partial load of <b>pit-props</b> floated free before she went down.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{therefore}} uncommon to find {{large pieces of}} chestnut in building structures, but {{it has always been}} highly valued for small outdoor furniture pieces, fencing, cladding (shingles) for covering buildings, and <b>pit-props,</b> for which durability is an important factor. In Italy, chestnut is also used to make barrels used for aging balsamic vinegar and some alcoholic beverages, such as whisky or lambic beer. Of note, the famous 18th-century [...] "berles" [...] in the French Cévennes are cupboards cut directly from the hollowed trunk.|$|R
60|$|Driscoll was sorting <b>pit-props,</b> {{throwing}} {{them on to}} piles {{at the bottom of}} the shaft, when Thirlwell stopped to hook a small, flat lamp to his hat. The man sometimes worked in the mine for a few weeks when the trapping season was over, and Scott was generally willing to engage him because he was skilful with the axe and labor was scarce. He made no friends among the men, and gave Thirlwell a sour look without speaking when the latter picked up his lamp.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a town}} {{which grew}} out of the {{industrial}} revolution, The commune was created in 1846, carved out of the communes de Laval, Portes, Sainte-Cécile-d'Andorge, and Les Salles-du-Gardon. It became the seat of the canton 12 years later in 1858. During the Middle Ages, the valley was one of the cradles of the Cevennes coal industry, but it really was not until around 1780 on the initiative of Pierre-François Tubeuf that industrial mining techniques were used. Shafts were sunk, and the galleries were supported with wooden <b>pit-props.</b>|$|R
50|$|Defenders {{could also}} dig counter mines. From these they could then {{dig into the}} attackers' tunnels and sortie into them to either kill the miners or to {{set fire to the}} <b>pit-props</b> to {{collapse}} the attackers' tunnel. Alternatively they could under-mine the attackers' tunnels and create a camouflet to collapse the attackers' tunnels. Finally if the walls were breached, they could either place obstacles in the breach, for example a cheval de frise to hinder a forlorn hope, or construct a coupure. The great concentric ringed fortresses, like Beaumaris Castle on Anglesey, were designed so that the inner walls were ready-built coupures: if an attacker succeeded in breaching the outer walls, he would enter a killing field between the lower outer walls and the higher inner walls.|$|R
50|$|The wood {{is used in}} Nigeria in hut-building {{for making}} walls, doors and window-frames, and in Liberia for planks. In Ghana small trees are cut for poles and find use as mine <b>pit-props</b> and bridge-piles. The twigs are used in Ghana as candlesticks, and the smaller ones as chew-sticks and tooth-picks in Ghana and Gabon. The inner bark {{contains}} a sticky yellow resin. The bark has anodynal properties. In the Region it is pounded and rubbed on the body to relieve painful conditions. In Gabon a decoction is taken for dysentery and as a mouthwash for toothache and in Congo (Brazzaville) for stomach-pains. In Congo a decoction of the bark or the leaves is taken for cough, asthma, bronchitis and other bronchial affections while the lees from this preparation are rubbed over areas of pain after scarification.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought of}} my river, the Afon-Lwydd, {{that my father had}} fished in youth, with rod and line for the leaping salmon under the {{drooping}} alders. The alders, he said, that fringed the banks ten deep, planted by the wind of the mountains. But no salmon leap in the river now, for it is black with furnace washings and slag, and the great silver fish have been beaten back to the sea or gasped out of their lives on sands of coal. No alders stand now for they have been chopped as fuel for the cold blast. Even the mountains are shells, groaning in their hollows of emptiness, trembling to the arrows of the <b>pit-props</b> in their sides, bellowing down the old workings that collapse in unseen dust five hundred feet below.Plundered is my country, violated, raped." ...|$|R
2500|$|A part {{engraved}} jewel {{has also}} {{been found in the}} vicinity. Such activities would have needed skilled, not slave labour. No workshops or furnaces have yet been found, but it is likely that both existed on site. Ingots of gold would have been easier to transport than dust or nuggets, although a high-temperature refractory furnace will have been needed to melt the gold, which has a melting point of 1064°C. Pliny mentions such special furnaces in his Naturalis Historia. A workshop will have been vital for building and maintaining mining equipment such as the drainage wheels, flumes for washing tables, shuttering for aqueducts, crushing equipment and <b>pit-props.</b> [...] Official mints would have produced gold coins, a key component of Roman currency. After the military occupation the mine may have been taken over by Romano-British civilian contractors some time after 125 AD, although the final history of the site has yet to be determined.|$|R
500|$|In 1971 Le Mesurier {{played the}} lead role in Dennis Potter's {{television}} play Traitor, in which he portrayed a [...] "boozy British aristocrat who became a spy for the Soviets"; his performance won him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts [...] "Best Television Actor" [...] award. Writing for the British Film Institute, Sergio Angelini considered [...] "Le Mesurier is utterly compelling throughout in an atypical role". Chris Dunkley, writing in The Times, described the performance as [...] "a superbly persuasive portrait, made vividly real {{by one of the}} best performances Mr Mesurier [...] has ever given". The reviewer for The Sunday Times agreed, saying that Le Mesurier, [...] "after a lifetime supporting other actors with the strength of a <b>pit-prop,</b> gets the main part; he looks, sounds and feels exactly right". Reviewing for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith called the role [...] "his Hamlet", and said that it was worth waiting for. Although delighted to have won the award, Le Mesurier commented that the aftermath proved [...] "something of an anticlimax. No exciting offers of work came in".|$|R
50|$|Within one month, however, by 26 July 1934, 225 lumbermen of the Labrador Development Company {{returned}} to St John's {{because they were}} dissatisfied with their working conditions. Although the men were keen to work they found poor accommodation and little food. The company controlled everyone through the very strict manager and because Williams prohibited any buying and selling outside his store. (Although one enterprising local did bring a boatload of goods upriver to Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, moored offshore and proceeded to do a brisk trade before he was stopped.) Workers were paid from $1.75 to $2.00 per cord (48 to 55-cent/m³) of <b>pit-props,</b> using a bucksaw for 12 hours per day. They were put on rations of mostly beans and porridge and bought deteriorating food from the company store. Men {{had to go out}} hunting to obtain sufficient food for themselves and their families. Many of the non-Inuit, not accustomed to the way of life came with dreams of prosperity but soon realised that conditions were the same as the fishery. They were always in debt! Eventually forcing most of them to move back to Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|As {{the trees}} became {{established}} and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots {{up to six}} feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was pre-thinning this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At {{this time there was}} much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into <b>pit-props</b> destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.|$|R
40|$|Le {{district}} minier Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes) est connu pour avoir été exploité dès la fin du Chalcolithique et au Bronze ancien. Le minerai, une bornite massive très riche, était traité sur un atelier situé à 250 m en contrebas de la mine. Les travaux miniers les plus importants se situent sur la branche ouest du gîte à l’endroit appelé Tranchée des Anciens, où les mineurs ont exploité la veine verticale de minerai, comprise entre des quartzites et des chloritoschistes. L’exploitation en surface de la branche est du gîte est plus discrète. Mis à part quelques grattages vers 2 650 m d’altitude, le travail le plus intéressant se situe {{au niveau}} d’une recherche moderne (travers-banc 0). C’est une amorce de tranchée taillée au feu datée du début du Bronze ancien soit entre 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) et 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), ce qui est exceptionnel dans les Alpes. On y a observé une série de cuvettes thermiques creusées dans les schistes, résultant de l’allumage de foyers, remplies de charbons et de roches éclatées. Un foyer placé contre la paroi, dernier état d’une attaque abandonnée, a montré trois niveaux bien individualisés, dont le plus profond était riche en bois carbonisés. Un maillet en riébeckite a servi à détacher le minerai de la roche encaissante. Le charbon de bois issu du remplissage a permis de réaliser une étude anthracologique qui a corroboré les résultats déjà obtenus sur la mine et l’atelier. Les trois espèces arborescentes identifiées dans les échantillons révèlent un choix délibéré dans l’utilisation du combustible pour l’abattage au feu, en l’occurrence le pin cembro. Le mélèze et le bouleau sont anecdotiques, tandis que dans la mine la préférence est allée au pin sylvestre/ pin à crochets. L’étude confirme aussi que les hommes ont utilisé le bois qu’ils avaient à proximité, que la végétation alpine autour du site était bien plus forestière qu’elle ne l’est {{de nos jours}} et que l’activité minière a contribué à la déforestation du versant ainsi qu’à la raréfaction du pin cembro. The copper deposit of Clausis Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France) is a lens of ore included between an oceanic substratum, with serpentinite and shale, and a sedimentary cover with marble and quartzite with riebeckite. The sulphide ore is a high-grade massive bornite (45 / 65 % copper) associated with native copper. Prehistoric mining activity was located between 2 400 and 2 600 metres, and thus represents the highest mine in Europe for this period. The miners excavated the ore systematically in the oxidation rich outcrop, from the soft shale, {{in contact with the}} ore, up to a wall of quartzite. The mined ore was then taken down into the valley, 250 metres below the level of the mine, to the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop of Cabane des Clausis for treatment. The metallurgists used all the technical processes necessary to change the ore into copper metal : hand-picking, washing, crushing and smelting. The earliest date obtained is 3815 ± 50 BP (2460 - 2140 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 22621), cf. Barge, 2002 and 2003; Barge ed., 2006. On the main vein, the most important extraction was from an open cut called Tranchée des Anciens. In places, the irregular and rounded rock faces show tool-prints (fine grooves, hammer marks) resulting from green stone picks and grooved mauls. Numerous well-conserved waterlogged wood fragments (<b>pit-props,</b> floor planks, sticks from torches) have dated the exploitation to between 3656 ± 44 BP (2189 - 1888 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36604) and 3418 ± 43 BP (1877 - 1618 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36603). However the presence of charcoal remains is not necessarily proof of fire-setting in the mine, as they could come from torches. A second old mine working was discovered on the eastern branch of the copper deposit, {{at the top of the}} outcrop at an altitude of 2 650 m. Here, short excavations were dug into small secondary mineral veins (native copper ?). They show the prehistoric workers’ intensive search to collect copper ore from the slightest irregularities of the rock. Contrary to all expectations, traces of the fire-setting technique were found in this second zone, little studied previously. This exploitation, situated near a modern prospection (gallery no. 0) on a quartzite outcrop between shale and ophiolite, has been dated to the Early Bronze Age, between 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) and 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), which remains exceptional in the Southern Alps. This open cut, excavated over a surface of 5 m 2, show a succession of circular or oval thermal hollows containing broken stones and charcoals. These hollows are the result of successive and contiguous fires with a diameter of 0. 60 m. A hearth structure was preserved against the rock face and represents the last stage of an abandoned fire-setting attempt. The cross-section shows three particularly well characterised levels : a superficial filling material above a dense level of brown and grey sediments with numerous small plates of shale and quartz, then an unstable level with small plates of shale and quartz and charcoal. The ore was extracted with stone tools like those discovered in situ, including a riebeckite maul bearing percussion marks. Numerous small and dense cup-like marks are also visible on the green shale. More than one kilo of charcoals was collected during the excavation of the fire-setting open cut and from thermal hollows or hearths. From the point of view of species selection, it is obvious that the anthracological assemblage is not very rich. Only three species were identified, all trees. They were Pinus Cembra, largely dominant in our results, larch and pubescent birch. No shrubs, such as juniper, bilberry or rhododendron, were identified, pointing to a deliberate choice of the wood used. Pinus Cembra was especially selected for fire-setting, while larch and birch were merely occasional. On the contrary, the results of the anthracological study of the underground workings showed a preference for Norway pine/ Mugho pine. These results confirm those of the anthracological analysis of the fire-setting open cut, the underground workings and the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop. Therefore, anthracological analysis of the material found in the fire-setting open cut at Saint-Veran provides interesting information about the choice of the combustible used preferentially for fire-setting, i. e. Pinus Cembra. It also proves that the alpine vegetation around the site was more wooded than at present and that prehistoric men used the wood found nearby. Thus, the mining activity largely contributed to deforestation of the mountainside and to rarefaction of the Pinus Cembra. Barge-Mahieu Hélène, Talon Brigitte.
