40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a special {{three-dimensional}} interface element has been formulated for stress and displacement analyses in bonded joint between two adjacent <b>plate</b> bending and <b>brick</b> elements. Interface element has 16 nodes with 5 {{degrees of freedom}} in each node adjacent to plate bending element and 3 D. O. F in each node adjacent to brick elements. The interface element has ability to transfer three translations from each side of interface element and two more rotations in the side adjacent to the plate element. Stiffness matrix of this element was formulated and implemented in three dimensional finite element code. Using experimental and numerical work of strengthened RC concrete beams carried out by researchers, application of this element including variation of deflection, slip between <b>plates</b> and <b>bricks,</b> normal and shear stresses distributions in FRP plates have been verified. The results show, that this interface element is effective {{and can be used}} for structural components with this type of interface element...|$|R

The load-bearing structure is made of reinforced concrete and consists of monolith roof and storey <b>plates,</b> <b>brick</b> walls, beams and columns. In {{the analysis of the}} structure all impacts, that may influence the structure in its lifecycle are considered. The analysis of the plates was performed with a commercial program SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc. 2009) and the analysis of the frame was made with a program ETABS (Computers and Structures, Inc. 2010). The design of typical structural elements is shown in detail, i. e. all the chosen beams, columns and a plate above the ground floor. The presented vertical load-bearing elements are designed according to the method of capacity design. The quantity of reinforcement, which is required according to Eurocode standards, is compared to the quantity of reinforcement built-in and required by the old Yugoslav regulations JUS. The comparison indicates that the difference in reinforcement is a consequence of a different model which was used for the design in the thesis. In the design of the beams it was found out that there are small differences in the quantity of reinforcement, but bigger differences appear {{in the design of the}} columns, because the Eurocode standards require larger quantity of reinforcement compared to the built-in reinforcement. Results of the analysis are presented in the text, visually in tables and images. The amounts and locations of reinforcement in the analyzed elements are shown in reinforcement drawings...|$|R

5000|$|His {{most famous}} game {{occurred}} on June 23, 1917, against the Washington Senators {{in the first}} game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park. Ruth started the game, walking the first batter, Ray Morgan. As newspaper accounts of the time relate, the short-fused Ruth then engaged in a heated argument with apparently equally short-fused home <b>plate</b> umpire <b>Brick</b> Owens. Owens tossed Ruth out of the game, and the even more enraged Ruth then slugged the umpire a glancing blow before being taken off the field; the catcher, Pinch Thomas, was also ejected. Shore was brought in to pitch, and came in with very few warmup pitches. With a new pitcher and catcher, runner Morgan tried to steal but was thrown out. Shore then proceeded to retire the remaining 26 Senators without allowing a baserunner, earning a 4-0 Red Sox win. For many years the game was listed in record books as a [...] "perfect game", but officially it is scored as a no-hitter, shared by two pitchers. Following the game, Ruth paid a $100 fine, was suspended for ten games, and issued a public apology for his behavior.|$|R

The experiment was conducted with the use of state of the art equipment: VBOX (Racelogic, UK) that could trace the bicyclists' movement and collect data of position, speed etc using GPS signal. Each participant accelerated the bike on 15 km/hr or 20 km/hr, kept the speed steady riding the bike in straight line and then applied the brakes with maximum force until the bike stops. This test was revised for each pavement type. After the data analysis, we estimated the braking time and distance for each pavement type for the two speed levels according to the bicyclists' weight. Finally, we concluded that the shortest braking distance was noticed on the pavement made from asphalt. Furthermore, we concluded that a 5 km/hr rise of bicyclists' speed resulted to a much longer braking distance...|$|R

25|$|If the {{starting}} pitcher {{is removed from}} the game before the first recorded out by the opposing team, the pitcher that replaces him can still be eligible for a shutout if the game ends with the opposing team failing to score a run. However, the replacement pitcher cannot be credited with a game started or complete game. In addition to that, the replacement pitcher must complete the rest of the game without being taken out himself for another pitcher {{at any time during the}} game. An instance of this occurred on June 23, 1917 when Babe Ruth of the Boston Red Sox walked the first batter of the Washington Senators, Ray Morgan, in the bottom of the first inning. Ruth engaged in an argument with home <b>plate</b> umpire <b>Brick</b> Owens, whereby Ruth was ejected and escorted off the field. Ruth's replacement, Ernie Shore, proceeded to finish the game without allowing the Senators to score. In fact, Morgan was caught stealing, and Shore retired the next 26 batters in a row to complete a perfect game. The game was regarded as a perfect game for many years until it was officially downgraded to a no-hitter since another pitcher took part in the game. Shore and Ruth were credited with a combined no-hitter, even though Ruth pitched unsuccessfully to only one batter in the game. Shore was credited with a shutout for his effort, despite not starting the game or pitching a complete game. However, if Ruth had conceded a run in the first inning without recording an out, such as allowing consecutive walks or hits, Shore would not be able to record a shutout since the other team had scored a run.|$|R
50|$|Lego trains {{were first}} {{introduced}} in 1966 with Lego set number 080. The train sets used blue rails, {{and the first}} train sets were simply push-along. Set number 115 introduced 4.5 volt battery-operated trains (initially the battery box was handheld, but train sets soon contained a railcar that carried the battery box), and train sets numbered 720 (1969) and up operated on 12-volt electrified rails, introduced in 1969. In 1972, 4.5-volt trains gained a monolithic railcar that carried the batteries and contained both a bottom-mounted stop button to be actuated by signals, {{as well as a}} side-mounted lever for manual go/stop/back control and tripping by a track-side pivot. All three kinds (push trains, 4.5-volt battery-operated trains and 12-volt electric trains) existed next to each other and even allowed for upgrade. The motors were the same size, the push trains used a motor-shaped dummy block of bricks, and all used the same wheel style. These wheels had the same press-fit metal axles as used in the two larger sizes of rubber-tire Lego wheels, which also meant that both 4.5-volt and 12-volt motors were not restricted to use in trains. A push train could be updated to a battery-operated train, and a battery-operated train could be updated to an electric train. Since 1969 the motor housings for 4.5-volt and 12-volt are equal and can be equipped with either a 4.5-volt or 12-volt Bühler motor unit. These motor units were sold separately as a replacement part until around 1990. In or before 1976, the 4.5-volt motor gained a hole for driving the then white cross-axles of the size that would later be known as Technic. Railcars began as spartan constructions of train-specific wheels and couplers attached to car bases made from universal <b>plates</b> and <b>bricks,</b> but these were quickly replaced by black single-piece bases in two lengths that included captive wheels and couplings.|$|R

The experiment is designed to characterize the interactions of nt resulting of the nm-nt oscillation. The main element of the detector is a brick 10 : 2 cm 12 : 8 cm cross-section consisting of 56 emulsion sheets 100 mm wide, interleaved with 1 mm lead <b>plates.</b> These <b>bricks</b> are assembled in walls of B 7 m side. A total of 72 walls is foreseen for the OPERA experiment with a total fiducial mass of 2 ktons: When a neutrino interaction occurs, the tracks of the charged particles are recorded in the emulsions with a high accuracy and the topology of the event is fully reconstructed with an automatic scanning of the emulsions. The role of the target tracker in OPERA is to locate the brick where the primary neutrino interaction occurs, to provide triggers {{and to make a}} coarser reconstruction of the events. It consists of two planes of scintillator strips located after a brick wall. The scintillation photons are collected by WLS fibers and read by a multi-pixels photodetector. We present results obtained with 61 pixels HPD’s readout by auto-triggerable front-end electronics of the VA–TA series.

40|$|AbstractThe brick infill walls {{cease to}} {{contribute}} to the lateral strength and stiffness of a structure as soon as they fail in a brittle manner {{in the early stages of}} an earthquake. Recent studies indicated that the perforated steel plates externally bonded to both faces of a wall lead to two benefits. First, the increase in the lateral strengths and rigidities of the walls increase the overall lateral strength and stiffness of the structure. Secondly, the increase in the ductilities of the walls allows the walls to absorb higher amounts of the earthquake-induced energy before failure so that smaller amounts of energy are required to be absorbed by the bearing structural members. The present study is dedicated to investigate the efficiency of this technique on the behavior of brick walls under out-of-plane bending moments, induced by the blast effect of an explosion or pressure from the soil, wind or snow next to the wall. A brick wall strengthened with perforated steel <b>plates</b> and a <b>brick</b> wall strengthened with perforated steel plates and steel strips on both faces were subjected to four-point bending.

Anyway, such applications have been mentioned about sintering of thermoplastic powders in the scientific literature. In this study, sintering has been used {{for the first time to}} agglomerate thermoset powders coming from recycling of fiberglass. This way, two interesting results have been obtained. First of all, new products have been produced by recycling fiberglass without any addition of virgin resin or linking agent. Moreover, it has been shown that sintering can lead to very high thickness products which are very difficult to obtain by typical molding processes because of shrinkage or frozen stresses. In order to show the feasibility of this new process, some powders have been collected from the waste of industrial partners.

In the following paper a modelling technique based on the finite elements method able to describe the dynamic properties of a typical fuselage panel is implemented and numerically validated: natural frequencies and damping properties of a panel treated by viscoelastic layer are evaluated. This technique is essentially based on: proper choice of structural elements for the model of panel, proper link of the different elements and a correct description of the boundary conditions.

This body positions occur repeatedly, so it can cause muscular and back bone injury. This monotonous and repetitive work, plus unergonomic working tools can cause Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) to workers, and will have impact to work productivity. Because of that, analysis was conducted to assess work risk relating to worker muscular disorder {{in the work place}} by using Quick Exposure Check (QEC) to every task elements, and working position that have potential to cause WMSDs. QEC assess damage to the back, shoulder, wrist, and neck. Research results shows that parts of {{manufacturing process}} of brick and well rings that have potentials to cause WMSDs are material mixture and the bucket filling, with exposure level of 73. 8 % and 71. 5 %.

These methods include: the method of electric arc deposition, chemical-thermal treatment, gas-powder deposition, gas-powder and plasma spraying, electric arc metallization. As a result of studies of wear of the working surfaces of the <b>plates</b> of silicate <b>brick</b> press boxes, we define that the plates wear out unevenly and {{the thickness of the}} worn layer varies between 0. 3 [...] . 2 mm. Technological method is chosen as the method of the plate reliability enhancement and maintaining. One of the main technological stages of reliability formation is machine parts strengthening using the methods of strengthening technologies, namely electric arc metallization. Wire models Нп- 65 Г, ФМИ- 2, Нп- 40 Х 13 are used to develop wear-resistant coatings with desired properties. Technological process of the plates repair consists of the following basic operations: plate preparation, wire preparation, plate coating, plate grinding, final checking. Single and complex reliability indicators are determined by testing a set of the plates and registering all the indicators (operating time, failures, faults). The value of the economic reliability index of the plate Kе equals to 0, 10. Higher plate reliability is achieved at the expense of extra cost for plate strengthening using wire Нп- 40 Х 13, and the price of Bн plate reliability is 104, 83 UAH. Complex indicators of reliability of the reconditioned plate of the silica bricks press boxes are used for more complete reliability assessment. Availability coefficient Kг. equals to 0, 995 and characterizes two different properties simultaneously: reliability and maintainability. Coefficient of technical use Kт. в. equals to 0, 974 and most fully characterizes the reliability of the plates because it considers time in the process of maintenance, repair and failure restoration. ...|$|R

The boundaries for the research include the four main university types that constitute HE in England (i. e. ancient, red <b>brick,</b> <b>plate</b> glass and post- 1992). The research uses a qualitative critical and extreme case of business academics, where the sample size consists of 32 academics. The data gathered from the interviews with academics from the four university types were first analysed thematically within each type, before the results of each were compared with the whole. The computing software package, MAXQDA is used for the data analysis. The research findings provide evidence that the NHE context in England is deeply marked by a growing managerialist style and the expectation of meeting certain goals. The data show that the proliferating culture of accountability, audit and performance characterising this NHE environment is currently impacting on academics’ working lives. The findings add to the debate against new managerialism, by demonstrating that it is perceived by many academics to be on the increase and affecting their psychological contracts. In addition, these findings also indicate that the contemporary policies and practices of new managerialism in England negatively impact upon academics’ perceptions {{of the extent to which}} the ideological currency of their psychological contract is fulfilled. The research provides insights by showing how practice differs across the university types being compared. The four main university types under study demonstrate both the similarities and differences of the impact of managerialism on the academic environment in England...|$|R

In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor <b>plates.</b> A small <b>brick</b> chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation 4 ft high, due to its location on sloping ground. At the center of this elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|R
40|$|The {{home is the}} {{territory}} of ceramics and crafts. It is a major site for the consumption, use and display of ceramics. However, ideas about the consumption of ceramics in the home have not been fully explored within its writing or practices. This research proposes a critical and theoretical framework for ceramics which relocates it in the contemporary context of consumption, {{in the home and}} the everyday (Attfield, 2000). This work draws on recent studies of material culture and consumption (Miller, 2001) which focus on the social role of the domestic object and which explore our relationships with things. This research is practice-based where my art practice is the main research method and methodology, art practice as research. The research began with a literature and contextual review of the field of ceramics and craft writing and practice. Conclusions drawn from this research identified the over-riding research question - what differentiates art, craft and design? and formed the basis of the Practice Manifesto which identified the issues and approaches the practical research would adopt, a starting point and a guide for the studio research. The completed practical research consists of a new series of work entitled About Ceramics [...] . This work explores the meaning of ceramics, how ceramics are used, experienced, valued and understood. It rejects traditional concerns and approaches to the subject and instead adopts a critical, conceptual approach. The resulting artworks embrace elements from across the disciplines of art, craft and design. Although predominantly made up of industrially made objects, the work also contains a significant craft or hand-made element. As such, the work inhabits the spaces "in between" established categories and provides an alternative, hybrid model for practice. The work is made using ordinary, everyday, mass-produced objects and materials, privileging a lower class of objects and practices (such as DIY & home/ hobby crafts) previously excluded from the ceramics and craft fold. For example, Basketweave explores ideas about ceramics, DIY and home decoration and is made entirely from wallpaper (brick wall pattern). This work blurs the boundaries of art, craft and design - at what point does the decoration become the form, or the craft become art? Collection of Objects (about ceramics) explores ideas about collections and display and the status of objects. A collection of objects (which includes an enamel facsimile of an 18 th century Sevres porcelain <b>plate,</b> a <b>brick</b> teapot and a wooden mug tree) are displayed on a pine kitchen dresser. The objects presented here are not valuable as craft objects or antiques, or for their aesthetic status, but because they have a relationship to, have been influenced by, or simply would not exist without ceramics. The central work in this series is What sort of mug do you take me for? It consists of a forest of over-sized mug trees (made from wood, MIDIF & pegs), each mug tree displaying a separate mug collection. This work further explores ideas about collections and collecting in the home, linking the processes collecting and display in the home with those of identity construction. Although ideas about taste and class, and about the aesthetic status of objects are central to this work, the objects employed here are not simply acting as symbols of class or as "bad" taste, they are also acting as signifiers of identity. This work demonstrates how the seemingly insignificant objects in our homes (such as a ceramic mug), and the ways we own, use and display those objects, {{play an important role in}} the construction and expression of self. This work invites its and your classification, asking What sort of mug do you take me for? In The Value of Things, Cummings and Lewandowska (2000) identify that the drive to collect is the same regardless of whether a collection is for the home or the museum. It is the hierarchies of art, craft and design which dictate the value and status of things. These hierarchies however are not in operation in the majority of homes and this makes the home an important site for understanding ceramics and for extending current concepts of art, craft and design. This research offers new perspectives and provides an alternative model for both writing and practice. It proposes a theoretical and critical framework for ceramics which relocates ideas about the subject in the context of its consumption and use in the home, linking ideas about the use and display of everyday domestic objects with the processes of identity construction...|$|R
