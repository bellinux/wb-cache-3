The maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>pressure</b> is calculated using the equal-potential method, which takes advantage of knowledge gained from periodic hydrostatic proof tests and uses the test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) as input. The maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases with increasing time between hydro tests but is increased each time a test is conducted. The minimum values that occur just prior to a test either increase or decrease with time, depending on the vessel temperature.

On {{the basis}} of the three-dimensional,compressible,unsteady-state,viscous N-S Equation and k-ε {{turbulence}} model,the simulation calculation is made with the finite volume method on the aerodynamic effect of two high-speed trains passing each other at the same speed through a tunnel,simulating the pressure change,analysising regularity of the pressure,researching comfort in the train. The following conclusions have been drawn from research:The maximum of transient pressure is concerned with the meeting point,when the two high-speed trains meet in tunnel. When the length,the speed and the sealing factor of the train are same,the transient pressure is maximum with the trains meeting at the midpoint of tunnel.

40|$|The static (unloaded) {{electrical}} parameters of a capacitor bank are {{of utmost importance}} {{for the purpose of}} modeling the system as a whole when the capacitor bank is discharged into its dynamic electromagnetic load. Using a physical short circuit across the electromagnetic load is usually technically difficult and is unnecessary. The discharge can be operated at the highest pressure permissible in order to minimize current sheet motion, thus simulating zero dynamic load, to enable bank parameters, static inductanceL 0, and resistancer 0 to be obtained using lightly damped sinusoid equations given the bank capacitanceC 0. However, for a plasma focus, even at the highest <b>permissible</b> <b>pressure</b> it is found that there is significant residual motion, so that the assumption of a zero dynamic load introduces unacceptable errors into the determination of the circuit parameters. To overcome this problem, the Lee model code is used to fit the computed current trace to the measuredcurrent waveform. Hence the dynamics is incorporated into the solution and the capacitor bank parameters are computed using the Lee model code, and more accurate static bank parameters are obtained...|$|E

A hypothetical example was tested against different levels of uncertainties and different levels of reliability. The results showed that the minimum cost, for the studied pipe network system, increases as the reliability level or the uncertainty level increases.

40|$|The use of {{rotary shaft}} seals made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence of}} their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable {{rotary shaft seals}}, there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary shaft seals. The relieved rotary shaft lip seal represents a special design among PTFE rotary shaft seals. Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary shaft seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the <b>permissible</b> <b>pressure</b> range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary shaft seal. Earlier designs of the relieved rotary shaft seal, similar to other commercially available rotary shaft seals, sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

The geometry configurations applied for a 2 -D turning diffuser are outlet-inlet configurations, W 2 /W 12 -D= 2. 160, X 2 /X 12 -D = 1. 000 and an inner wall length to an inlet throat width ratio, Lin/W 12 -D= 4. 370, whereas for a 3 -D turning diffuser, they are W 2 /W 13 -D= 1. 440, X 2 /X 13 -D = 1. 500 and Lin/W 13 -D= 3. 970. The operating conditions represented by inflow Reynolds numbers, Rein are varied from 5. 786 E+ 04 to 1. 775 E+ 05. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to examine the flow quality, and a digital manometer provides the average static pressure at the inlet and outlet of the turning diffuser.

Recently the ‘Low-High-Low’ (L-H-L) cyclic test for metal roofing was introduced into the Building Code of Australia (2007). Following advances in wind tunnel data acquisition and full-scale wind loading simulators, this paper presents a comparison of wind-induced cladding damage, from a “design” cyclone proposed by Jancauskas, et al. (1994), with current test criteria developed by Mahendran (1995). Wind tunnel data were used to generate the external and net pressure time histories {{on the roof of}} a low-rise building during the passage of the “design” cyclone. The peak pressures generated at the windward roof corner for a tributary area representative of a cladding fastener are underestimated by the Australian/New Zealand Wind Actions Standard.

However, the L-H-L test underestimated the magnitude and number of large load cycles, but overestimated the number of cycles in the mid ranges. Cladding elements subjected to the L-H-L test showed greater fatigue damage than when experiencing a five hour “design” cyclone containing higher peak pressures.

Therefore for maintenance of the accepted level of safe conditions of the person interaction with electro installations in the certain environment the new concept of electro traumatism risk reduction is offered. It is noticed that for maintenance of the accepted level of safe conditions of person interaction with electro installations in the certain environment the sudden, unapproved exit of electric energy from electro technical systems on the person should not exceed its limiting values; maximum permissible values of electric energy absorbed by a body of the person should be established taking into consideration parameters of the concrete person, limiting values of touch pressure, a current which proceeds through a body of the person, sorts, frequencies, and time of action of a current.

The design essentially boils down to defining the diametrical interference fit of the die/ring assembly. There are two methods of design: analytical one based on Lame’s solution and numerical one based on finite element modelling (FEM). None of these methods includes roughness of the interface surfaces of the die insert and the shrink ring. However, when designing the pre-stressed micro-dies, the interface roughness cannot be disregarded and the classical design of the diameter interference must be corrected. In this paper, a semi-physical modelling of interface roughness (SPMIR) is used as novel method which determines the interference correction value. A set of FEM models created on the base of Abbot-Firestone curves, determined from the roughness profile, enables determination of a contact surface stiffness curve and further the interference correction. Relative correction of the die diameter interference increases with the diameter decrease, which might be recognized as a pre-stressed micro-die assembling scale effect. In the experimental part, three miniature dies, with interface diameter 2. 8 mm and different levels of interface surface roughness, Ra= 0. 16, Ra= 0. 43, Ra= 0. 60, have been manufactured by WEDM. Relative interference corrections calculated by the SPMIR method reached respectively 17. 6, 27. 9 and 43. 3 %.

2500|$|The sum {{of partial}} {{pressures}} of the gas that the diver breathes must necessarily balance with the sum of partial pressures in the lung gas. In the alveoli the gas has been humidified and has gained [...] carbon dioxide from the venous blood. Oxygen has also diffused into the arterial blood, reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. As the total pressure in the alveoli must balance with the ambient pressure, this dilution results in an effective partial pressure of nitrogen of about 758mb (569mmHg) in air at normal atmospheric pressure. At a steady state, when the tissues have been saturated by the inert gases of the breathing mixture, metabolic processes reduce the partial pressure of the less soluble oxygen {{and replace it with}} carbon dioxide, which is considerably more soluble in water. In the cells of a typical tissue, the partial pressure of oxygen will drop, while the partial pressure of carbon dioxide will rise. The sum of these partial pressures (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) is less than the total pressure of the respiratory gas. This is a significant saturation deficit, and it provides a buffer against supersaturation and a driving force for dissolving bubbles. Experiments suggest that the degree of unsaturation increases linearly with pressure for a breathing mixture of fixed composition, and decreases linearly with fraction of inert gas in the breathing mixture. As a consequence, the conditions for maximising the degree of unsaturation are a breathing gas with the lowest possible fraction of inert gas – i.e. pure oxygen, at the maximum <b>permissible</b> partial <b>pressure.</b> This saturation deficit is also referred to as inherent unsaturation, the [...] "Oxygen window". or partial pressure vacancy.|$|R
40|$|A Wright GR- 1820 -G 200 {{cylinder}} {{was tested}} {{over a wide}} range of fuel-air ratios at maximum permissible power output as limited by knock with three different degrees of valve cooling. The valves used were stock valves (solid inlet valve and hollow sodium-cooled exhaust valve), hollow valves with no coolant, and hollow valves with flowing water as a coolant. Curves showing the variation in maximum permissible values of inlet-air pressure, indicated mean effective pressure, cylinder charge, and indicated specific fuel consumption with change in fuel-air ratio and valve cooling are shown. The use of valves cooled by a stream of water passing through their hollow interiors permitted indicated mean effective pressures 10 percent higher than the mean effective <b>pressures</b> <b>permissible</b> with stock valves when the engine was operated with fuel-air ratios from 0. 055 to 0. 065. Operation of the engine with lean mixtures with uncooled hollow valves resulted in power output below the output obtained with the stock valves. The data show an increase in maximum permissible indicated mean effective pressure due to cooling the valves, which averages only 2. 1 percent with fuel-air ratios from 0. 075 to 0. 105...|$|R
40|$|The two‐dimensional {{supersonic}} irrotational flow {{of a gas}} in a jet is {{studied by}} use of the Kármán‐Tsien pressure‐volume law. There are two limitations to such a study: (1) since the fluid flow is not continued from the subsonic range, arbitrary boundary conditions must be prescribed; (2) use of the Kármán‐Tsien pressure‐volume relation implies a restriction on the <b>permissible</b> range of <b>pressure,</b> density, and velocity. On the other hand, use of the Kármán‐Tsien law furnishes several advantages: (1) the velocity potential and stream function satisfy the wave equation in the hodograph plane and hence these functions can be easily determined; (2) the mappings between the physical and hodograph planes may be completely characterized and studied in detail. This gain in information should be valuable in the qualitative understanding of phenomena {{as well as in}} obtaining first approximations to quantitative solutions. In the case of jets, with free stream lines as boundaries, it is shown that two functions possessing certain desired properties completely determine the Kármán‐Tsien flow. Further, the phenomenon of the periodic recurrence of the free stream jet boundary is explained by a folding property of the map of the flow in the hodograph plane...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} failure {{pressure}} on the API 12 F shop welded steel tanks and performs a fatigue evaluation to estimate the <b>permissible</b> number of <b>pressure</b> cycles for these equipment. Four different analyses were carried out on more than 350 finite element models to determine various failure pressure modes of these storage tanks. An elastic analysis considering potential buckling modes was developed to determine the yielding pressure of the tanks. The redistribution of stresses due to inelastic deformations and plastic collapse were evaluated through an elastic-plastic stress analysis considering the plastic hardening of the material. A wind load analysis was performed to evaluate the stress levels at all regions of the tank and estimate the uplift deformations. Moreover, the increase of the design pressure was investigated regarding the stress levels and bottom uplift. Additionally, an elastic stress analysis following the ASME Boiler 2 ̆ 6 Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 2, Design-by-Analysis rules was implemented to determine the fatigue life of the storage tanks. This research provides engineering calculations to evaluate the current design of the API 12 F tanks and the design internal pressures guaranteeing a safe performance of the equipment. ...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{point and}} line rocker {{bearings}} {{are used in}} civil engineering, especially in bridge construction. Technical literature does not provide any data of the rolling-off resistance in the rocker parts of such bearings. Therefore the experimental determination of this resistance was the main objective of this research project. Using a special tilting device, tests were conducted on point rocker sliding bearings with pressure contact plates of steel St 52 and stainless steel whereby the level of loading (Hertzian stress in the contact surfaces) and the thickness' of the contact components were varied. The rolling-off resistance at rocker's maximum rotation of tan a= 0. 01 were calculated from the measured results and presented in diagrams. Also permanent deformations of the contact plates were measured. In addition the Hertzian formulas and the material stress' for point contact were described in more detail. Rolling-off and rolling resistance were compared using empirically derived formulas. Test results show the following: The rolling-off resistance is influenced significantly by the Hertzian stress' in the contact surfaces, the material quality, the level of preloading, plastic deformations and thickness of the contact components {{as well as the}} rotation angle. Contrary to present regulations, not only the geometric excentricity but also the rolling-off resistance should be taken into account when Hertzian stress' in the contact surface are significantly higher than those at local yielding of the contact plates. According to the present state of knowledge, the permissible Hertzian stress' given in different standards should be reduced for rocker bearings. As for roller bearings, the <b>permissible</b> contact <b>pressure</b> should be correlated with the amount of the rolling-off resistance. At the tilting angles investigated, the rolling-off resistance of rocker bearings is significantly smaller than the rolling resistance of roller bearings. The rolling-off resistance was experimentally determined {{for the first time with}} the investigations presented here. In view of the numerous factors of influence, several questions could not be answered in a complete and final manner. (orig.)
