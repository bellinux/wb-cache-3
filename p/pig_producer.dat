40|$|Extension and {{communication}} needs amongst small-scale <b>pig</b> <b>producers,</b> described as <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> {{with less than}} 100 sows, have been previously identified. These producers, who are believed to pose a biosecurity risk to commercial livestock industries, are characterized {{by a lack of}} formal networks, mistrust of authorities, poor disease reporting behaviour and motivational diversity, and reliance on other producers, veterinarians and family for pig health and production advice. This paper applies stakeholder identification and analysis tools to determine stakeholders' influence and interest on pig producers' practices. Findings can inform a risk communication process and the development of an extension framework to increase producers' engagement with industry and their compliance with biosecurity standards and legislation in Australia. The process included identification of stakeholders, their issues of concerns regarding small-scale <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> and biosecurity and their influence and interest in each of these issues. This exercise identified the capacity of different stakeholders to influence the outcomes for each issue and assessed their success or failure to do so. The disconnection identified between the level of interest and influence suggests that government and industry need to work with the small-scale <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> and with those who have the capacity to influence them. Successful biosecurity risk management will depend on shared responsibility and building trust amongst stakeholders. Flow-on effects may include legitimating the importance of reporting and compliance systems and the co-management of risk.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of a Mycobacterium avium (Ma) test on <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> incentives to control Ma in finishing pigs. A possible Ma control system which includes a serodiagnostic test and a penalty on finishing pigs in herds detected with Ma infection was modelled. Using a dynamic optimization model and a grid search of deliveries of herds from pig producers to slaughterhouse, optimal control measures for pig producers and optimal penalty values for deliveries with increased Ma risk were identified for different sensitivity and specificity values. Results showed that higher sensitivity and lower specificity induced use of more intense control measures and resulted in higher <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> costs and lower Ma seroprevalence. The minimal penalty value needed to comply with a threshold for Ma seroprevalence in finishing pigs at slaughter was lower at higher sensitivity and lower specificity. With imperfect specificity a larger sample size decreased <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> incentives to control Ma seroprevalence, because the higher number of false positives resulted in an increased probability of rejecting a batch of finishing pigs irrespective of whether the <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> applied control measures. We conclude that test sensitivity and specificity must be considered in incentive system design to induce pig producers to control Ma in finishing pigs with minimum negative effect...|$|E

To investigate whether Vietnamese household <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> practice economies of scale, researchers from Center for Agricultural Policy (CAP) and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) surveyed 700 household <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> from six provinces in Vietnam. After providing background on Vietnam’s pig industry and the survey design, this paper reports relevant results from this survey. The findings show that potential economic advantages due to greater scale did not strongly emerge from analysis of household survey data. On the other hand, potential economic benefits were observed among Vietnamese households from specialization in different stages of pig production. In assessing the economics of household pig production, it is important {{to take into account the}} opportunity costs of the resources used in this production. Given the current stage of Vietnam’s economic transition, the opportunity cost of the labor employed in household production seems to be low. Furthermore, small-scale producers depend more heavily on home-grown and local produce for pig food compared to larger producers who are more reliant on processed pig food with an imported content. Low opportunity costs continue to make small-scale household pig production in Vietnam economical but with continuing economic development, the opportunity costs of agricultural households will increase. Larger-scale commercial producers will thus, likely account for a growing proportion of Vietnam’s pig supply, particularly given current policies in their favour.

We observed significant effect of interaction between gene polymorphism and dry ham producer on seasoning losses, indicating that the effect of studied genes differ in relation to manufacturing practice or product type, despite narrow consortium constraints. The analysis was thus made separately for each producer; in case of producer B, PRKAG 3 affected salting, resting and overall losses (Val/Val higher than Ile/Ile or Ile/Va l) but in case of producer A, the effect of PRKAG 3 was significant only for salting losses (Ile/Val lower than Ile/Ile or Val/Val). Effects of CAST polymorphisms were significant only in case of producer A; CAST 249 Arg/Arg hams showed the highest first salting, drying, and overall seasoning losses, whereas CAST 638 Arg/Arg hams had the highest drying, ripening, and overall seasoning losses.

40|$|Antibiotics {{have been}} used in animal {{production}} for several decades. Antibiotics are used routinely now in pork production (NAHMS 2002). There is increasing concern about the use of antibiotics in animal production. There is no hard evidence supporting the link of antibiotic use in animals to observations of antibiotic resistance infections in people. Nonetheless a careful examination of the value of continued antibiotic use in agricultural, and in pork production in particular is warranted. Therefore, the objective of our study is to validate the productivity and economic impacts of antibiotic use for <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> at the farm level. We use data from the NAHMS 2000 swine survey. We estimate the combined affects from antibiotics used for growth promotion (AGP) and antibiotics used for disease prevention (ADP) on 4 productivity measures. We also estimate the economic impact of AGP and ADP for individual <b>pig</b> <b>producers.</b> We estimate these 4 productivity measures using seemingly unrelated regression analysis. We evaluate 4 scenarios which ban antibiotic use, and use a simple synthetic firm partial budget to estimate the economic consequences of these scenarios. We find that pig productivity is improved with AGP, but decreased with ADP. A total ban on AGP would cost <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> $ 1, 271 in lost profits per 1, 020 head pig barn. A total ban on ADP however, would result in <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> improving profits slightly. This occurs because productivity is negatively influenced by ADP. A ban of both AGP and ADP results in a small loss of producer profits ($ 376 / 1, 020 head barn) because of the offsetting effects of ADP compared to AGP. Producers have higher profits when AGP and ADP are applied at levels where pig productivity is maximized. In this case, producers gain $ 4, 146 for each 1, 020 head barn compared to no antibiotic use. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Food borne illness today still {{results in}} high {{societal}} costs, even though FBOs have implemented food safety control systems. In addition, the susceptibility to food borne {{diseases of the}} human population {{is likely to increase}} in the coming decades. Thus food safety control needs to be improved. Since 2005, a new EU food safety policy aims to improve food safety through shifting primary responsibility for food safety from government to FBOs and through shifting food safety control from company level to supply chain level. This research aims to contribute to improvement of food safety by analyzing private incentive mechanisms aimed at food safety control on supply chain level. It focuses on the two stage supply chain between pig producers and slaughter company in the Netherlands. A framework for designing and developing incentive mechanisms for food safety control is developed. An incentive mechanism aimed at food safety control is defined as the set of the performance and compliance measurement system and the compensation scheme between buyer and supplier, which aims to induce the supplier to apply measures to control food safety hazards as the buyer requests. The framework includes all important characteristics of incentive mechanisms for food safety and their relationships. In this thesis the influence on supplier behaviour of four important characteristics of incentive mechanisms for food safety control are analysed, namely 1) the type of performance compensation, 2) the causes for variability in performance between suppliers, 3) the accuracy of a test to determine supplier performance, and 4) the reliability of information provided by the supplier. It uses different food safety hazards in pork: lesioned livers, Mycobacterium avium, and residues of antibiotics. Results show that a penalty for each lesioned liver was more effective to induce pig producers to use control measures than a collective premium. Variability in liver lesion prevalence between pig producers with a penalty for each lesioned liver occurred because each <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> used different control measures with different effectiveness. The accuracy of a Mycobacterium avium test showed to {{have a significant impact on}} <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> behaviour to use control measures if an incentive mechanism was in place. Finally, information about the use of antibiotics provided by pig producers without an incentive system for the reliability of the information was insufficiently reliable to guarantee absence of residues in pork. It is concluded in this thesis that private incentive mechanisms can be used to reduce opportunistic behaviour of pig producers, thereby improving food safety control on supply chain level and helping to raise food safety control to the next level. For optimal inducement it is important that the performance and compliance measurement system is attuned to the compensation scheme...|$|E

Many smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>producers</b> still practice traditional or low levels of production technology (in terms of breed raised, breeding technique, and disease prevention methods used). They cannot adopt new production technologies that demand higher investment and higher production cost, given their limited financial resources and skills. The quality of service for preventing and treating epidemic diseases provided by {{both public and private}} sectors leaves much to be desired, thereby restricting the application of new production technologies. Since there is a high variability in production systems in terms of breed, feed, and breeding methods used, a wide variation of pork meat quality is also produced, and generally perceived as of low quality with corresponding low market prices. The linkage between producers and market actors is also weak, thereby raising risks in production and marketing.

According to the research, the consumers are willing to pay extra to know that the meat they buy comes from animals that have lived happy lives. The best way to market this is by clear and simple labeling. Organic production requires approximately twice the amount of farmable land to grow the same amount of grains as conventional and some scientists mean that organic is not the given solution for a sustainable agriculture.

Slaughter animals of at least 9 months of age and 160 kg live weight are required to provide heavy cuts with excellent meat. Breeds are limited to Italian Large White and Landrace, selected for specific parameters such as loss at 1 st salting of the ham, and their crosses. Crosses with Duroc and hybrids can be used if obtained from selection and crossing schemes that fit the objectives of Italian selection. Backfat thickness must be “sufficient” to obtain retailed fresh hams with fat cover ranging from 20 to 30 mm, depending on ham weight, and the content of linoleic acid in ham fat cover cannot exceed 15 %. Fat quantity and quality in feeds should be carefully controlled to satisfy the quality of fat in the ham. The feeding level is also relevant, due to the imposed minimum age at slaughter. Feed restriction is a necessary practice to respect the rules for ham production. For castrate males of medium genetic value, the restriction should reduce fat deposition, but the diet composition can be adapted to maintain the maximum growth of protein. For strains with high lean deposition potential and particularly for gilts, protein deposition should also be limited to maintain a sufficient fat cover of ham...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyRichard 'Dick' HesseCarol WyattOver {{the last}} two decades {{molecular}} laboratory techniques have enabled researchers to investigate the infection, replication and pathogenesis of viral disease. In the early eighties, Dr. George Smith developed a unique system of molecular selection. He showed that the fd bacteriophage genome could be manipulated to carry a sequence of DNA coding for a protein not contained in the phage genome. Infection of the recombinant bacteriophage or phagemid into a specific strain of the bacterium, Escherichia coli, produced progeny phage with the coded protein displayed as a fusion with the phage's coat protein. Antibody phage display utilizes the same technology with the DNA encoding an antibody fragment. The DNA insert can carry the information to produce either a single chain variable fragment (scFv) producing the heavy chain variable and light chain variable (VH-VL) portion or a Fab fragment which also contains the heavy chain constant 1 with the light chain constant (CH and CL) portion of an antibody. Screening an antibody phage display library has the possibility of producing an antibody not produced in the normal course of immune selection. This decade also saw the emergence of a viral disease affecting the porcine population. The Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) {{has been one of the}} most costly diseases affecting the <b>pig</b> <b>producer.</b> Molecular investigations found that PRRSV is a single, positive-stranded RNA virus which codes for five structural and 12 - 13 nonstructural proteins producing an enveloped, icosahedral virus. An interesting characteristic of PRRSV is the ability to produce infective progeny with genomic deletions, insertions and mutations within the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp 2). With this knowledge, many researchers have produced marker vaccines containing fluorescent tags with the hope of developing a DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine. In my Master‟s studies, I studied the techniques of antibody phage display technology and how to apply these methods to producing scFvs which recognize a recombinant PRRSV nsp 2 fragment protein and the native protein during infection of MARC- 145 cells...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers that analyse {{various aspects of}} contracts in agriculture. Four papers concern collaborative arrangements between farmers. Different types of gains from partnerships are analysed, such as gains from risk-sharing and diversification, biological effects, cost savings on machinery and labour and improved farm efficiency. Also a potential cost of partnerships – the risk of opportunistic behaviour among partners – is analysed. The objective of the first paper is to analyse if there are incentives for a partnership between a specialised piglet and fattening <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> (vertical co-ordinated integration). Using data for average Swedish pig producers, it is shown that improved production results in vertically coordinated production as well as risk reduction create incentives for specialised piglet and fattening pig producers to collaborate. The second paper analyses the incentives for collaboration between a crop and a dairy farm by applying {{a model of a}} share contract. This study uses data from two pair of case farms representing crop and dairy farms of various sizes. The results suggest that gains from risk sharing, diversification, improved crop rotation and machinery- and labour-sharing can be substantial in a partnership. Paper IV analyses farmers' decision to engage in partnership arrangements, involving machinery- and labour-sharing with other farmers. A theoretical framework is used to illustrate that any incentive to act opportunistically is deterred by presence of social norms. The empirical analysis, based on a questionnaire to Swedish farmers in combination with FADN-variables, suggests that moral hazard problems are perceived to be relatively limited in existing partnerships, which are characterized by a considerable a degree of trust and good social relations. In the last paper, the impact of machinery- and labour-sharing arrangements on farm efficiency is analysed using the same data sources as in Paper IV. The results suggest that average efficiency is greater among the partnership farms, compared with the non-partnership farms. Moreover, partnership farms with the most extensive collaboration, i. e. that share all machinery, display the highest average efficiency scores. One paper deals with farmers' participation in agri-environmental payment programs. In that study, farmers' decision to participate in agri-environmental payment programs is analysed, as well as the impact of program participation on economic performance. It is found that larger farms {{are more likely to be}} program participants and that program participation has a positive impact on farm performance (profitability).

Slaughterhouses were selected on {{basis of their}} annual number of slaughtered pigs, which {{should be at least}} 10 200. This criterion was fulfilled by 19 out of 38 pork slaughterhouses in Belgium. Ten of them were interested to participate and questionnaires were sent and filled in by 8 slaughterhouses. Following topics were asked for: -	Number of intact / immunocastrated boars slaughtered each week + reasons for this -	Presence of a boar taint detection system and its characteristics -	Requirements for a boar taint detection system if not present yet -	Destination of carcasses with boar taint Six out of 8 slaughterhouses accepted intact or immunocastrated boars and the numbers of these animals per week ranged from 180 to 3200 for individual slaughterhouses. Based on numbers of weekly slaughterings of all male pigs, 3. 3 % were intact boars and 4. 9 % immunocastrated boars. Main reasons for the decision of slaughtering intact or immunocastrated boars is on demand of the customer. One of the 2 abattoirs slaughtering only castrated males does not consider to change its strategy in the future {{because of a lack of}} a potential market. The other will change its strategy in 2014. The results of the questionnaire indicated a clear need for a reliable boar taint detection system which should score on a 2 -point scale; presence of absence of boar taint. It should be preferably located immediately after veterinary inspection at the slaughter line. Results should be reported to the <b>pig</b> <b>producer.</b> Other preferred characteristics of a future detection system should be: -	easy adaptation to changing boar taint parameters; -	easy to clean and safe; -	no interference with food safety; -	full automatic; -	acceptable for customers buying the intact boar meat; -	results available immediately after analysis. Only 2 slaughterhouses currently used a boar taint detection system, which twice was the sensory method. Both abattoirs analyze all intact males, one does the analysis on the carcass, the other in the laboratory. Slaughterhouses abilities to change over towards more weekly slaughtering of intact boars is mainly controlled by the consumers market. The absence of reliable boar taint detection systems at the slaughterhouse acts as a brake. Notwithstanding these limitations, Belgium has a unique position in Western-Europe as the only country marketing intact boars and immunocastrates. nrpages: 225 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The video {{starts with}} a {{geographic}} discription of Sichuan, a town located in South East China. Sichuan is a major <b>pig</b> <b>producer</b> in China. Pig here is mostly raised in backyard crop-livestock smallholder systems with sweet potato {{as one of the}} major crops. Sweet potato is widely planted in this area and used as feed by over 75 % of the household which includes pig, chicken, ducks, and cow. In many farm households, pig contributes a larger share of the family's income. In spite of the overall volume of pig produced in Sichuan, productivity per farm has been low. Pork production is 81. 5 % of the total meat production in Sichuan. Farmers are short of knowledge and technology. In response to this situation, the ILRI Crop-Animal Systems Research Network (CASREN) Project team conducted participatory diagnosis of the problem on farm. This video gives a voice introduction about the CASREN project in Sichuan. Tian Le village is a representative of the subhumid subtropics. It is located in Renhe, one of the towns of Zitong County. After applying the criteria defined by the CASREN project for site selection, the team has selected Tian Le village in Zitong County as the benchmark site (BMS) where the project will operate. Tian Le village in Zitong County was selected as a benchmark site based on conditions including - farmers are very poor - sweet potato is the main forage crop - pig production plays a very important role in farmers' income. The identification of the bench mark site (BMS) was applied in combination with secondary information on household surveys and participatory rural appraisal techniques. The household survey was conducted in six villages. According to the survey, over 300 households were involved. The video also illustrates how feed is prepared and packed in plastic bags mixed with supplements and concentrates to increase the efficiency of using sweet potato and to make a balanced diet for the pigs. It also shows the variety trial fields, and presents the experimental results. The evaluation trials include high yielding varieties, root and vine yields, and chemical composition. One variety is recommended for promotion among farmers. It was found to be better than the local variety. The project team also trains farmers for sweet potato planting, crop management, storage, disease control, and variety improvement. The Sichuan Academy of Animal Sciences (SAAS) is the new partner in the CASREN Project. SAAS joined CASREN in 2002 to work on the improvement of smallholder crop-livestock systems in which sweet potato tubers and vines play an important role as feeds for pig. Memorandum of understanding between ILRI and SAAS was conducted to help enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. The cooperation of the two institutes with the smallholders is expected to decrease poverty, hunger, and environmental degradation...|$|E
