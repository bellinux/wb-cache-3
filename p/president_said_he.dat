500|$|Although labor strife was muted {{after the}} {{settlement}} of the railway strike, it continued through Truman's presidency. The President's approval rating dropped from 82% in the polls in January 1946 to 52% by June. This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, when Republicans took control of Congress {{for the first time}} since 1930. The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come, including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon. When Truman dropped to 32% in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign; the <b>President</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did not care what Senator [...] "Halfbright" [...] said.|$|E

[...] An adviser to the U.S. <b>President</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could not confirm whether the voice was that of bin Laden. In the past, the CIA has usually confirmed Al Jazeera reports on tapes attributed to bin Laden.|$|E

2500|$|Schilling's {{wife and}} 10 {{children}} attended the congressional swearing-in on January 5, 2011, attracting some notice and {{an interview with}} Diane Sawyer. His early actions as a congressman included joining 25 other freshman Republicans in voting against extending the USA PATRIOT Act; Schilling stated {{he believed that the}} bill may not provide sufficient safeguards on who is allowed to access personal information, and that the 45 minutes allotted for floor debate was inadequate to discuss these concerns. [...] Following Obama's late January 2011 State of the Union address in which the <b>President</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "eager" [...] to work with critics of his health care reform law, Schilling sent a letter to Obama requesting a one-on-one meeting.|$|E

60|$|Whether {{he should}} {{complete}} the parallel, and skip, too, {{was a point}} which {{he had not yet}} acknowledged to himself that he had decided. He never had believed that it need come to that; but, for an instant, when the <b>president</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident, it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip. He had the choice to kill himself, which {{was supposed to be the}} gentlemanly way out of his difficulties, and would leave his family unstained by his crime; that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence, and every one had agreed that it was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back. There was something else that a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do, and that was to stand his trial for embezzlement, and take his punishment. Or a man, if he was that kind of a man, could skip. The question with Northwick was whether he was that kind of man, or whether, if he skipped, he would be that kind of man; whether the skipping would make him that kind of man.|$|E

60|$|The <b>President</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> saw {{and felt}} {{the force of the}} objection; it was a fearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best; {{that he did not know}} how this scheme was {{received}} by the members from the free States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been, and he could not tell how they would vote. And in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and should continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now. Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North as of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as the South was morally bound to do its full and equal share. He thought the institution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized the rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can exist and does legally exist. He thought such a law wrong, but the rights of property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious law, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and offering inducements to give it up.|$|E
