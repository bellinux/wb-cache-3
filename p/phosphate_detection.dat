40|$|Archaeologists use soil {{analysis}} to detect chemicals, like phosphate, to indicate areas of anthropogenic activity. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> is a multi-step process, which makes standard techniques time consuming. Kinetic studies decreased the analysis {{time for the}} malachite green (MG) method of <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection.</b> The 3 -minute method allows extraction and analysis to be complete in 15 minutes. Continued studies resulted in two-color spectral monitoring, which provided values instantaneously. Arsenate (As(V)) interfere with the MG method and results in overestimation of phosphate. As(V) must be reduced to non-interfering arsenite. Two As(V) reducing agents [...] L-Cysteine and thiosulfate [...] were investigated. The thiosulfate method was suitable for field implementation with the 3 -minute malachite green method. L-Cysteine is compatible with both MG time scales, but pre-reduction could not be improved beyond 20 minutes. The 3 -minute malachite green method was utilized at an archaeological site in Virginia. The survey led to delineation of the site boundaries...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we report}} the {{development}} of a highly sensitive capacitance chemical sensor based on a copper C, C, C, C-tetra-carboxylic phthalocyanine-acrylate polymer adduct (Cu(II) TCPc-PAA) for <b>phosphate</b> ions <b>detection.</b> A capacitance silicon nitride substrate based Al-Cu/Si-p/SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 structure was used as transducer. These materials have provided good stability of electrochemical measurements. The functionalized silicon-based transducers with a Cu(II) Pc-PAA membrane were characterized by using Mott-Schottky technique measurements at different frequency ranges and for different phosphate concentrations. The morphological surface of the Cu(II) Pc-PAA modified silicon-nitride based transducer was characterized by contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy. The pH effect was also investigated by the Mott-Schottcky technique for different Tris-HCl buffer solutions. The sensitivity of silicon nitride was studied at different pH of Tris-HCl buffer solutions. This pH test has provided a sensitivity value of 51 mV/decade. The developed chemical sensor showed a good performance for <b>phosphate</b> ions <b>detection</b> within the range of 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 5) M with a Nernstian sensitivity of 27. 7 mV/decade. The limit of <b>detection</b> of <b>phosphate</b> ions was determined at 1 nM. This chemical sensor was highly specific for phosphate ions when compared to other interfering ions as chloride, sulfate, carbonate and perchlorate. The present capacitive chemical sensor is thus very promising for sensitive and rapid <b>detection</b> of <b>phosphate</b> in environmental applications...|$|R

A. cylindrica, Oscillatoria tenuis, and O. brevis) frequently occurring in drinking-water supplies. The cyanobacterial LPS contained glucose, xylose, mannose, and rhamnose, but {{differed from the}} LPS derived from most gram-negative bacteria because of the variable presence of 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate, heptose, galactose, and glucosamine. Cyanobacterial lipid A is characterized by long-chain saturated an unsaturated fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acids which show great diversity. Unlike lipid A from heterotrophic gram-negative bacteria, lipid A from cyanobacteria usually lacks <b>phosphates.</b> The <b>detection</b> of distinct O-antigen chemotypes indicates that LPS {{may be used for}} taxonomic classification. Isolated cyanobacterial LPS always induced Limulus amoebocyte lysate gelation. A. flos-aquae LPS gave a positive Schwartzman reaction. Endotoxins from A. cylindrica and O. brevis were toxic to mice when injected intraperitoneally. The cyanobacterial endotoxins showed generally lower biological activity than did LPS derived from common heterotrophic gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|The {{detection}} of small amounts (nanomoles) of inorganic phosphate {{has a great}} interest in biochemistry. In particular, <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> is useful to evaluate the rate of hydrolysis of phosphatases, that are enzymes able to remove phosphate from their substrate by hydrolytic cleavage. The hydrolysis rate is correlated to enzyme activity, an extremely important functional parameter. Among phosphatases there are the cation transporting adenosinetriphosphatases (ATPases), that produce inorganic phosphate by cleavage of the γ-phosphate of ATP. These membrane transporters have many fundamental physiological roles and are emerging as potential drug targets. ATPase hydrolytic activity is measured to test enzyme functionality, but it also provides useful information on possible inhibitory effects of molecules that interfere with the hydrolytic process. We have optimized a molybdenum-based protocol that makes use of potassium antimony (III) oxide tartrate (originally employed for <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> in environmental analysis) to allow its use with phosphatase enzymes. In particular, the method was successfully applied to native and recombinant ATPases to demonstrate its reliability, validity, sensitivity and versatility. Our method introduces significant improvements to well-established experimental assays, which are currently employed for ATPase activity measurements. Therefore, it may be valuable in biochemical and biomedical investigations of ATPase enzymes, in combination with more specific tests, as well as in high throughput drug screening...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a project aimed at developing a low-cost, portable, on-site, user-friendly system for detecting different concentrations of phosphate in drinking water. Phosphate {{is a natural}} chemical, but toxic in large concentrations; detection is therefore important to avoid drinking contaminated water. Despite this fact, no cheap, and/or nontoxic system for <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> is yet on the market. The detection system utilizes a paper-based microfluidic device to automate the electrochemical detection process, which normally requires expert use of lab equipment. When combined with a portable potentiostat that works with a mobile app, the device will allow untrained users to determine if any source of drinking water contains unsafe levels of phosphate without equipment or training, and to communicate that information to a central database for further analysis. Those of any background, particularly in developing countries, {{will be able to}} maintain health and raise awareness about clean water. Microfluidic devices are useful tools for the detection of water contaminants, but there is a gap in technology for the detection of phosphate. Our <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> system is a paper-based microfluidic device with an already-developed voltammetry device that automates the detection process so that any user can safely find phosphate in water. The system will provide a binary analysis about whether the water is safe to consume or not.

40|$|Four {{different}} {{serological tests}} for detection of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) in banana sap are compared: (i) a triple-antibody sandwich ELISA for BBTV, utilising anti-BBTV polyclonal antibodies for virus capture, and anti-BBTV monoclonal antibodies, alkaline phosphatase-labelled sheep anti-mouse antibodies, and p-nitrophenyl <b>phosphate</b> for <b>detection</b> (ELISA-NPP); (ii) an alternative enzyme-substrate system for ELISA involving an amplification step (Ampak(TM) enzyme amplification kit) (ELISA-A); (iii) a colorimetric dot immunobinding assay (DIBA-C), {{in which the}} enzyme-substrate system was alkaline phosphatase and nitroblue tetrazolium/ 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-phosphate; (iv) an enhanced chemiluminescent form (DIBA-ECL), in which the enzyme-substrate system was horseradish peroxidase and luminol. For both DIBA-C and DIBA-ECL, maximum sensitivity was obtained by pre-coating the nitrocellulose membrane with anti-BBTV polyclonal antibodies, by using 0. 05 M sodium carbonate (pH 9. 6) as the coating buffer, and by clarifying the sap by centrifugation and extraction with chloroform or dichloromethane. Treatment of the sap before centrifugation by snap-freezing at - 70 degrees C, or heating at either 30 or 50 degrees C for 10 min, {{had no effect on}} sensitivity; heating at 70 degrees C for 10 min eliminated antigenicity. ELISA-NPP, ELISA-A, and DIBA-ECL had equivalent sensitivity, but DIBA-C was up to 8 -fold less sensitive than the former 3 assays.

30|$|The Lu group {{developed}} an effective fluorescent sensing platform for <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> based on MOF and ZnO quantum dot (QD) conjugates [55]. The MOF material (MOF- 5) {{was used as}} the substrate, and positively charged ZnO QDs capped by (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS–ZnO QDs) were attached to the negatively charged MOFs via amine–Zn interaction and electrostatic interaction. This interaction resulted in the ZnO QD fluorescence quenching owing to the electron transfer process. After introducing phosphate into the QD–MOF system, the presence of phosphate could inhibit the quenching effect and recover the fluorescence of ZnO QDs. The fluorescence intensity depended on the phosphate concentration and was not affected by other interfering species. This fluorescent sensing platform had good sensitivity with a linear working range of 0.5 – 12  μM and a detection limit of 53  nM. In this study, the sensing platform also shows a satisfactory sensing performance with real water samples. However, such luminescence-functionalized MOF (LMOF) sensors are not reusable.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> {{in water}} samples is still {{completed}} using colorimetric standard methods, {{which have a}} number of disadvantages, to such as being time consuming, requiring filtration, a number of different reagents, frequent calibration and proper disposal of waste chemicals generated. Hence, a simple cost effective analytical method and instrumentation is highly desirable to aid the optimisation of treatment processes and assist the water industry in their efforts to comply with stringent regulations such as the EU's Water Framework Directive. A sensor based on molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) and a conductance transducer was developed for direct and label-free detection of phosphate in water. The sensor was able to measure the presence of phosphate in wastewater samples with good reproducibility, a linear range of 0. 66 - 8 mg P L- 1 and a lower detection limit of 0. 16 mg P L- 1. The sensor was further tested to measure phosphate concentrations in unfiltered field samples such as domestic wastewater treatment influent and river water and demonstrated a close correlation with reference measurements.

30|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} (IA) is {{a life-threatening}} infection in immunocompromised patients, rapid and sensitive detection of Aspergillus from clinical samples {{has been a}} major challenge in the early diagnosis of IA. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA-ELISA) was developed to fulfil the need for the efficient diagnosis of these infections. The primers targeting 18 S rRNA were selected for the amplification of Aspergillus RNA by the isothermal digoxigenin (DIG)-labeling NASBA process. The DIG-labeled RNA amplicons were hybridized with a specific biotinylated DNA probe immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. The hybrids were colorimetrically detected by the addition of an anti-DIG antibodies linked to ALP and substrate (disodium 4 -nitrophenyl <b>phosphate).</b> The <b>detection</b> limit of the Aspergillus NABSA-ELISA system was 1 CFU and the RNA in non-target bacteria or fungus was not amplified. The performance of this NASBA-ELISA compared to RT-PCR and galactomannan (GM) was evaluated by testing blood samples from 86 patients at high risk for IA. The sensitivity of NASBA-ELISA, RT-PCR and GM-ELISA was 80.56  % (95  % CI 63.98 – 91.81), 72.22  % (95  % CI 54.81 – 85.80), 58.33  % (95  % CI 40.76 – 74.49), respectively, and the specificity was 80.00  % (95  % CI 66.28 – 89.97), 84.00  % (95  % CI 70.89 – 92.83), 82.00  % (95  % CI 68.56 – 91.42). The efficiency of the three methods in various combinations was also evaluated. Combination of NASBA-ELISA and GM-ELISA testing achieved perfect specificity (100  %; 95  % CI 92.89 – 100) and perfect positive predictive value (100  %; 95  % CI 83.16 – 100). The best sensitivity (97.22  %; 95  % CI 85.47 – 99.93) and the highest Youden index (0.652) were obtained by testing with both NASBA and RT-PCR in parallel. In conclusion, the NASBA-ELISA assay consists of an alternative process for large-scale samples detection with semi-quantitative results and provides good clinical performance without resorting to expensive equipment. This assay makes it possible for the NASBA based RNA diagnosis to become a routine work in laboratories in less developed countries with fewer resources.|$|R
40|$|Nitrate and {{phosphate}} {{concentrations in}} the Lower Boise River become increasingly elevated with distance downstream. While there is correlative evidence that there is algal growth from elevated nutrients, no one has formally evaluated the algal growth response from nutrient loading. We quantified algal biomass in response to increased nutrient concentrations by sampling benthic algal biomass from natural substrata (rocks) and artificial substrata that also assessed nutrient limitation along a 64 mile reach from near Diversion Dam {{to the city of}} Parma that exhibited an increase of nitrate (0. 01 mg/L to 3. 40 mg/L) and <b>phosphate</b> (below <b>detection</b> to 0. 56 mg/L). Samples were collected from August to October of 2013. We observed low values for algal biomass accrual rate on the unamended artificial substrata in the upper section of the Boise (above Lander Street, Mile 12) of 1. 41 – 1. 60 mg chlorophyll a/m 2 /day, accrual rate values increased to 7. 03 – 9. 88 mg chlorophyll a/m 2 /day near Caldwell (Mile 41), then declined to 6. 42 mg chlorophyll a/m 2 /day at the confluence with the Snake River. Trends in nutrient limitation were similar for both August and October, showing lack of algal biomass response to nutrient additions (nutrient limitation) downstream of the Lander wastewater treatment plant discharge (Mile 12). This observation corresponds to higher algal biomass growth downstream. The increased algal biomass growth in the lower Boise is interpreted to be in response to nutrient loading, primarily from wastewater discharge. In the lowermost portion of the Boise River (below Mile 55) a decline in algal biomass is observed, presumably due to light limitation by turbid water in the lower portion of the river. Reductions in nutrients in this section of the river may not reduce algal biomass. Above Lander wastewater treatment plant (Mile 12), nitrate limitation is observed. This suggests that declines in phosphorus loading alone in the lower Boise River may not reduce algal biomass levels to those observed above the Lander wastewater treatment plant...|$|R

There was good agreement (R- 2 = 0. 9848) between the commercial phosphate testing kit and the phosphate sensor in measurements of synthetic wastewater in a SBR system. This sensor maintained a high working stability (> 85 %) after 12 h of operation and involved a simple operation procedure. It therefore serves as a useful tool for rapid and accurate phosphate measurements in the SBR system and probably for process control...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative 99 mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99 mTc-DMSA) renal {{scintigraphy}} {{was used}} to asses ifosfamide-induced changes in renal function in 11 children who received chemotherapy for various malignancies. Serial measurements of absolute 99 mTc-DMSA renal uptake, calculated on conjugated views, were performed during and after chemotherapy. Data of 37 studies obtained before and at different cumulative dose levels of ifosfamide were analysed in relation to clinical and biochemical parameters. A highly significant relationship between 99 mTc-DMSA uptake and cumulative ifosfamide dose was found (P < 0. 001). The most frequently observed abnormal pattern on scintigraphic images was decreased kidney uptake together with increased accumulation in bladder. 99 mTc-DMSA uptake was more consistent than beta 2 -microglobulin values in urine and more sensitive than quantitative hyperaminoaciduria and tubular resorption of <b>phosphate</b> for the <b>detection</b> of ifosfamide-induced tubular dysfunction. 99 mTc-DMSA uptake was decreased in both patients with and patients without clinical toxicity. Persistently reduced 99 mTc-DMSA uptake was observed in four patients during follow-up; in one of them, who was asymptomatic after ifosfamide therapy, sudden onset of Fanconi syndrome was observed when he was retreated with carboplatin 1 year later. It is concluded that 99 mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is a suitable method to assess progressive ifosfamide-induced tubular injury whereas scintigraphic imaging is helpful for interpreting renal uptake changes. The test is able to detect subclinical injury and may potentially predict high risk at retreatmen...|$|R
40|$|Birnessite-type {{manganese}} oxide {{is a highly}} efficient oxidant that has been investigated widely for As(III) oxidation. Nevertheless As(III) oxidation rate is inevitably reduced due to favorable adsorption of coexisting ions and As(V) which passivate its surface. In this paper we explore a novel strategy to significantly improve As(III) oxidation performance by controlling birnessite morphology. The batch experiment {{results show that the}} nanoflower-like birnessite (Bir-NF) exhibits an incredible improvement in As(III) oxidation activity compared to nanowire-like (Bir-NW) and nanosheet-like (Bir-NS) birnessites. The morphology of birnessite varies from nanosheet to nanoflower not only promotes As(III) oxidation rate from 1. 4 to 24. 7 lmol g 1 min 1, but also reduces the adverse effect of adsorption of As(V) and coexisting ions on As(III) removal. The origin of morphology-dependent enhancement of As(III) removal was experimentally and theoretically studied by As(V) adsorption on birnessites, <b>phosphate</b> adsorption kinetics, <b>detection</b> of dissolved Mn 2 + concentration, average Mn oxidation state, the point of zero charge, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results reveal that significant enhancement of As(III) oxidation activity in Bir-NF as compared to Bir-NW and Bir-NS is attributed to its highly efficient contact between As(III) species and {{manganese oxide}}, as well as its fast charge transfer from As atom to Mn atom due to its highest oxygen vacancy defect concentration, thus significantly promoting As(III) oxidation activity...|$|R

The extraction process has been introduced above. To accurately determine the metabolites concentration, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method (Wu et al. 2005) was used. Extracted metabolites were resuspended in 1  mL deionized water, and 200  µL of 13 C-labeled intracellular metabolites were added as internal standards. The uniformly 13 C-labeled metabolites were extracted from the P. pastoris biomass cultivated in a fed-batch fermentation using uniformly 13 C-labeled glucose as sole substrate. The obtained labeled cell extract contained the whole yeast metabolome. After internal standards added, samples were injected into a liquid chromatography (Waters Acquity T 3 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) with dimensions 150  mm ×  2.1  mm ×  1.8  mm was used for organic acids and sugar phosphates, ACQUITY UPLCR BEH Amide (Waters) 1.7  μm ×  2.1  ×  100  mm for nucleosides, Xselect™ HSS T 3 1.8  μm ×  2.1  ×  100  mm Column for amino acids) coupled to a Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with electrospray ionization.

40|$|A {{real-time}} soil nutrient sensor {{would allow}} the efficient collection of data with a fine spatial resolution, to accurately characterize within-field variability for site-specific nutrient application. Our goal was to evaluate the applicability of a phosphate membrane to the measurement of phosphate levels in soil extractants and to determine how previously developed nitrate and potassium membranes {{would be affected by}} the presence of phosphate. A type of PVC-based phosphate membrane containing an organotin compound, bis(p-chlorobenzyl) tin dichloride, was evaluated, along with the nitrate and potassium membranes, in pH 7 Tris buffer solution and Kelowna soil extractant for sensitivity and long-term stability. The phosphate membranes in the Tris buffer solution of pH 7 exhibited a response over a range of 10 - 5 to 10 - 1 mol/L phosphate concentrations with an average slope of - 28. 2 + 1. 5 mV per activity decade of dibasic phosphate. The response speed of tested electrodes containing phosphate, nitrate and potassium membranes was rapid, reaching an equilibrium response in less than 15 s. However, the phosphate membrane in the Kelowna solution of pH 8. 5 was almost insensitive to different phosphate levels from 10 - 6 to 10 - 2 mol/L due to the presence of a high concentration of fluoride in the solution. In addition, the tin compound-based phosphate membranes had limited lifetimes of less than 14 days. It is not expected that the tested phosphate membranes could be used for <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> in other soil extractants, such as Bray P 1 and Mehlich III solutions, because they also contain high concentrations of fluoride...|$|E
40|$|During {{bacterial}} cell division, the essential protein FtsZ assembles {{in the middle}} of the cell to form the so-called Z-ring. FtsZ polymerizes into long filaments in the presence of GTP in vitro, and polymerization is regulated by several accessory proteins. FtsZ polymerization has been extensively studied in vitro using basic methods including light scattering, sedimentation, GTP hydrolysis assays and electron microscopy. Buffer conditions influence both the polymerization properties of FtsZ, and the ability of FtsZ to interact with regulatory proteins. Here, we describe protocols for FtsZ polymerization studies and validate conditions and controls using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis FtsZ as model proteins. A low speed sedimentation assay is introduced that allows the study of the interaction of FtsZ with proteins that bundle or tubulate FtsZ polymers. An improved GTPase assay protocol is described that allows testing of GTP hydrolysis over time using various conditions in a 96 -well plate setup, with standardized incubation times that abolish variation in color development in the <b>phosphate</b> <b>detection</b> reaction. The preparation of samples for light scattering studies and electron microscopy is described. Several buffers are used to establish suitable buffer pH and salt concentration for FtsZ polymerization studies. A high concentration of KCl is the best for most of the experiments. Our methods provide a starting point for the in vitro characterization of FtsZ, not only from E. coli and B. subtilis but from any other bacterium. As such, the methods can be used for studies of the interaction of FtsZ with regulatory proteins or the testing of antibacterial drugs which may affect FtsZ polymerization. ...|$|E
40|$|An amperometric {{biosensor}} {{was constructed}} {{for analysis of}} human salivary phosphate without sample pretreatment. The biosensor was constructed by immobilizing pyruvate oxidase (PyOD) on a screen-printed electrode. The presence of phosphate in the sample causes the enzymatic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), which was monitored by a potentiostat and was {{in proportion to the}} concentration of human salivary phosphate. The sensor shows response within 2 s after the addition of standard solution or sample and has a short recovery time (2 min). The time required for one measurement using this phosphate biosensor was 4 min, which was faster than the time required using a commercial phosphate testing kit (10 min). The sensor has a linear range from 7. 5 to 625 mu M <b>phosphate</b> with a <b>detection</b> limit of 3. 6 mu M. A total of 50 salivary samples were collected for the determination of phosphate. A good level of agreement (R- 2 = 0. 9646) was found between a commercial phosphate testing kit and the phosphate sensor. This sensor maintained a high working stability (> 85 %) after 12 h operation and required only a simple operation procedure. The amperometric biosensor using PyOD is a simple and accurate tool for rapid determinations of human salivary phosphate, and it explores the application of biosensors in oral and dental research and diagnosis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the degradation products and pathway of chlorfenvinphos (CFVP) in water treated by photo-Fenton driven by solar irradiation, as well as to develop an analytical procedure for the degradation experiments. Degradation products and pathway were determined in a laboratory experimental setup. Routine water sample analysis was done by standard laboratory wet chemistry procedures and the use of laboratory equipment such as HPLC-UV and ionic chromatography (IC). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used to extract analytes from an aqueous matrix, and GC-MS was used to identify intermediate degradation products. The use of an HPLC-TOF-MS provided more results on degradation products and more insight was gained into how degradation takes place. in all experiments, strong mineralisation and degradation of CFVP was observed. CFVP and its degradation products, like 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorobenzoic acid and triethylphosphate were decomposed into organic substances like acetate, formate, maleate, and inorganic ions like chloride and <b>phosphate,</b> within the <b>detection</b> limits (12. 5 mu g/L for CFVP in the GC-MS and 40 mu g/L in HPLC-UV) of the equipment used. in fact, Cl(-) emerges in nearly stoichiometric concentrations and PO(4) (3 -) is precipitated as FePO(4). The remarkably complete absence of chlorinated aliphatic substances and chlorinated acids leads to the conclusion that chlorine is removed very quickly, and that residual DOC does not correspond to any chlorinated compound.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus strains have {{previously}} {{been reported to}} be deficient in surface negative charge; this has been correlated with methicillin resistance and ascribed to a deficiency of teichoic acid at the cell surface (A. W. Hill and A. M. James, Microbios 6 : 157 - 167, 1972). Teichoic acid was present in walls of MR organisms as revealed by appreciable <b>phosphate</b> levels and <b>detection</b> of ribitol residues. Phosphate levels in walls from five MR strains (0. 54 to 0. 77 μmol/mg of wall) were lower than in three unrelated methicillin-sensitive (MS) strains (0. 86 to 1. 0 μmol/mg of wall). However, two MS strains derived from two of the MR strains had wall phosphate levels very {{similar to those of the}} MR strains. No evidence for unusual wall polymers was found. Simple deficiency of wall teichoic acid does not result in methicillin resistance since an independently isolated teichoic acid-deficient strain (0. 1 μmol of phosphate per mg of wall) was not methicillin resistant. In studies of biological properties possibly related to wall teichoic acid, it was discovered that walls isolated from MR organisms grown in the presence of methicillin autolyzed more rapidly than those isolated from organisms grown in the absence of the drug. Since methicillin resistance is enhanced by NaCl and suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, the effects of these compounds on autolysis of isolated walls were studied. NaCl (1. 0 M) and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (1. 0 mM) inhibited the autolysis of walls isolated from MR and MS strains. An MR strain bound phage 47, 52 A, and 3 A only slightly less well than their respective propagating strains...|$|R
