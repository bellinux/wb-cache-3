40|$|The most bandwidth-efficient {{communication}} {{methods are}} imperative {{to cope with}} the congested frequency bands. <b>Pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> methods have excellent effects on narrowing bandwidth and increasing band utilization. The position of the baseband filters for the <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> is crucial. Post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> (a low pass filter is located after the modulator) can change signals from constant envelope to non-constant envelope, and non-constant envelope signals through non-linear device (a SSPA or TWT) can further spread the power spectra. Pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> (a filter is located before the modulator) will have constant envelope. These two <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> methods have different effects on narrowing the bandwidth and producing bit errors. This report studied the effect of various pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters with respect to bandwidth, spectral spikes and bit error rate. A pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -ary Phase Shift Keying (8 PSK) modulation was used throughout the simulations. In addition to traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters, such as Bessel, Butterworth and Square Root Raised Cosine (SRRC), other kinds of filters or pulse waveforms were also studied in the pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> method. Simulations were conducted by using the Signal Processing Worksystem (SPW) software package on HP workstations which simulated the power spectral density of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -PSK signals, end to end system performance and bit error rates (BERS) as a function of Eb/No using <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> in an AWGN channel. These results are compared with the post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaped</b> 8 -PSK results. The simulations indicate traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filters used in pre-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> may produce narrower bandwidth, but with worse BER than those in post-modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping.</b> Theory and simulations show pre- modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> could also produce discrete line power spectra (spikes) at regular frequency intervals.

Some particular pulses (filters), such as trapezoid and pulses with different transits (such as weighted raised cosine transit) were found to reduce bandwidth and not generate spectral spikes.

Interest in this technology is increasing with the advent of high-flashpoint, nonhazardous scintillating fluids coupled with significant advances in signal processing electronics. Together, these developments have provided the enabling technologies to allow liquid scintillators to be implemented outside of a laboratory environment. Another important aspect of this detector technology is that it can be used with the current installed infrastructure of safeguards assay instruments and data acquisition electronics. It is also an excellent candidate for the replacement of 3 He-based systems in many applications. As such, a comparison to an existing 3 He-based system will be presented to contrast the differences and benefits for several applications. This paper will describe the experiments and associated modeling activities engaged to carefully characterize the detection system and refine the models. The latest version of MCNPX-PoliMi Monte Carlo modeling code was used to address the specific requirements of liquid scintillators.

40|$|Tremendous {{improvement}} {{has been}} made possible in wireless technology due to success of OFDM system which is a multi carrier modulation technique with capability to support high data rates. Despite its many advantages OFDM has failed against inter symbol interference (ISI), high sensitivity to Inter carrier interference (ICI), high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), phase noise and band limited channel. Hence the performance of an OFDM system is highly affected by the aforementioned undesired phenomenon. For this reason bandlimited system often employs <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> techniques. In this paper <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> of multi carrier signal is introduced by using various <b>pulse</b> <b>shapes</b> like Rectangular <b>pulse</b> (REC), Raised cosine pulse (RC), Better than raised cosine pulse (BTRC), Sinc power pulse (SP) and Improved sinc power pulse (ISP).

40|$|International audiencePer-tone <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} time domain spectral shaping for DMT transmitters, e. g. VDSL modems. It shapes the spectrum of individual tones such that the stop band energy of each tone can be minimized. This in particular enables transmitter to use more tones without violating the PSD mask constraint for data transmission. In pertone <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> based DMT transmitters a fixed length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter is typically used for every tone. The tones {{in the middle of the}} pass band however, contribute less to the overall stop band energy, so that using a high order <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter for these tones does not result in a significant reduction of the stop band energy. As a result a significant number of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter taps are wasted on the tones in the middle of the pass band and do not bring any performance gain. Using a variable length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter which is designed such that the PSD mask constraint is not violated can then significantly reduce the total number of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter taps without compromising performance. In this paper, a resource allocation technique is presented for variable length <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter design using a dual problem formulation. This optimally solves the problem of <b>pulse</b> <b>shaping</b> filter tap distribution over tones for given PSD mask constraints, with a relatively low complexity...|$|R
