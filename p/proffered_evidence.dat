50|$|In a trial, to proffer (sometimes profer) is {{to offer}} {{evidence}} in support of an argument, or elements of an affirmative defense or offense.

50|$|In {{the context}} of a trial or a hearing, a {{presiding}} judge may issue a ruling denying a party the right to <b>proffer</b> <b>evidence.</b> The party aggrieved by this ruling then has the right to indicate for the record what the evidence would have shown had the adverse ruling not been issued.

The union of Madeline and Porphyro symbolizes the reconciliation of the two opposing types of love in an apocalyptic marriage styled on the Biblical union of Christ and the Church. The irony inherent in the poem arises from Keats's use of Christian myths, symbols, and sacraments to accomplish this purpose...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there came}} a request from Babington that Dick Shand would go over to them there for a day. At Babington opinion was divided. Aunt Polly and her eldest daughter, and with them Mr. Smirkie, still thought that John Caldigate was a wicked bigamist; but the Squire {{and the rest of}} the family had {{gradually}} gone over to the other side. The Squire had never been hot against the offender, having been one of those who fancied that a marriage at a very out-of-the-way place such as Ahalala did not signify much. And now when he heard of Dick Shand's return and <b>proffered</b> <b>evidence,</b> he declared that Dick Shand having been born a gentleman, though he had been ever so much a sinner, and ever so much a drunkard, was entitled to credence before a host of Crinketts. But with Aunt Polly and Julia there remained the sense of the old injury, robbing Shand of all his attributes of birth, and endowing even Crinkett with truth. Then there had been a few words, and the Squire had asserted himself, and insisted upon asking Shand to Babington.|$|E

40|$|Studying {{transition}} amplitudes in (2 + 1) -dimensional causal dynamical triangulations, Cooperman and Miller discovered speculative {{evidence for}} Lorentzian quantum geometries emerging from its Euclidean path integral.

We argue against this conjecture: we propose a more straightforward explanation of their findings, and we <b>proffer</b> <b>evidence</b> for the Euclidean nature of these seemingly Lorentzian quantum geometries.

5000|$|In US law, {{a pretext}} usually {{describes}} false reasons that hide the true intentions or motivations for a legal action.

5000|$|In the {{district}} court for Pennsylvania, the defendant Eaton did not dispute having used Evans' improved hopperboy, but sought to show either that the patent only covered the improved method as a whole (and not the hopperboy specifically), or alternatively that the patent had been anticipated by earlier machines. In particular, the defendant introduced evidence of a crude kind of hopperboy that was in use at some mills in Pennsylvania in the 1760s. Persuaded that the patent could only cover the improved method as a whole, rather {{than any of the}} improved machines, the court instructed the jury {{in such a way that}} the jurors had no choice but to return a verdict for the defendant, as they did.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to what has been}} termed the “replicability crisis, ” great changes are currently under way in how science is conducted and disseminated. A question therefore arises over how such change impacts law’s treatment of scientific evidence. The present standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts in the U. S. asks judges {{to play the role of}} gatekeeper, determining if the <b>proffered</b> <b>evidence</b> conforms with several indicia of scientific validity. The replicability crisis, however, has demonstrated that these indicia frequently fail to adequately capture, or have lagged behind, science’s best practices. Therefore, this article suggests that as much as the replicability crisis highlights serious issues in the scientific process, it should have similar implications and actionable consequences for legal practitioners and academics. The Article concludes with some suggestions to help ensure that legal decisions are influenced by the best science has to offer...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} admitting evidence of a third party’s guilt. Part II addresses several different approaches {{for dealing with the}} problem of admitting evidence of a third party’s guilt and will argue that under these approaches or tests, two factors are critical to the admission of such evidence: (1) the nexus or connection between the third party and his commission of the charged crime, as demonstrated by the <b>proffered</b> <b>evidence,</b> and (2) the weight of that evidence or the strength of that connection. Part III argues that under the prevailing approach in several courts, the burden of proof has been unconstitutionally placed on the wrong party—the defendant. This article argues that the burden is properly placed upon the state to oppose the introduction of evidence of a third party’s guilt. This conclusion is based on the following factors: (1) these defenses are not affirmative defenses, (2) these defenses go to a critical element of the government’s case, to wit, the identity of the perpetrator, which the government constitutionally has the burden of proving, and (3) it is unconstitutional to burden the defendant with this obligation...|$|E

50|$|In {{limiting}} the defendant's burden merely to producing evidence and placing the entire {{burden of persuasion}} on the plaintiff, the Court {{made it more difficult}} for the plaintiff to succeed with a disparate treatment claim. A defendant could sustain his or her duty to produce evidence simply by articulating a nondiscriminatory justification for the employment decision. Because this burden is so easily met, the plaintiff will almost always be forced to persuade a court that the defendant's reasons are pretexts and not the true reasons for the employment decision. The plaintiff's burden, therefore, is magnified because he will have to <b>proffer</b> convincing <b>evidence</b> analyzing the employer's intent. Consequently, this higher evidentiary burden has created an increased incentive for plaintiffs to allege discrimination under the disparate impact theory where the employer's intent is not at issue.|$|R
