40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe liver plays a {{major role}} in the {{metabolism}} and elimination of many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including <b>perampanel.</b> Some of the metabolites identified for <b>perampanel</b> are likely formed via reactive intermediates, which have the potential to covalently bind to protein and cause idiosyncratic toxicities, including hepatotoxicity. The approved AED <b>perampanel</b> is a selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. The safety and tolerability of <b>perampanel</b> have been well documented in 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III studies. Here we report the effects of <b>perampanel</b> on liver function in patients from the phase III studies to assess the potential for liver toxicity. MethodsFollowing 6 -week baseline, patients (≥ 12 years old) with drug-resistant partial seizures were randomized to once-daily double-blind treatment (6 -week titration, 13 -week maintenance) with 2, 4, 8, or 12 mg <b>perampanel</b> (n= 1038) or with placebo (n= 442). Clinical laboratory tests for hepatobiliary laboratory parameters were evaluated at baseline and at end of treatment. These included alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and total bilirubin. Treatment-emergent markedly abnormal values (an increase in NCI-CTC grade relative to baseline and a grade ≥ 2) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to hepatobiliary parameters were also recorded. ResultsMean hepatobiliary values were within normal ranges at baseline and end of treatment for all <b>perampanel</b> groups and placebo. Mean changes from baseline to end of treatment were small. The incidence of markedly abnormal results was very low for <b>perampanel</b> and placebo. TEAEs related to hepatobiliary parameters occurred in 0. 4 % of <b>perampanel</b> patients and 0 % of placebo patients. Hepatobiliary disorders included cholelithiasis (n= 3 in <b>perampanel)</b> and abnormal hepatic function (n= 1 in <b>perampanel).</b> None of the events were serious or led to <b>perampanel</b> discontinuation. No subject had values that met the criteria for Hy's Law. ConclusionHepatobiliary laboratory data and related TEAEs were not notably different between <b>perampanel</b> and placebo treatment groups, and no dose-related trends were observed. Based on the laboratory results from the 3 Phase III studies, <b>perampanel</b> (2, 4, 8, and 12 mg) demonstrated no clinically important effects on liver function tests, indicating <b>perampanel</b> is an AED with a low potential for drug-induced liver toxicity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Perampanel</b> is {{approved}} for adjunctive therapy of focal epilepsy {{with or without}} secondarily generalized seizures in patients aged > 12 years. This narrative review uses real-world and clinical trial data to elucidate perampanel's role in the clinic. Audit data show good tolerability with <b>perampanel</b> and higher freedom-from-seizure rates in elderly vs younger patients. When using <b>perampanel</b> in elderly patients, special attention {{should be given to}} comorbidities and co-medication to avoid potential interactions or adverse events. Slower titration is generally recommended, and seizure control should be reassessed at a dose of 4 mg before further dose increases. <b>Perampanel</b> efficacy is similar in adolescents and adults; however, somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and aggression are more frequent in adolescents vs the overall population. Individualized and slow-dose titration can minimize adverse events. Low serum concentrations of <b>perampanel</b> may occur in patients also receiving some enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs; a <b>perampanel</b> dose increase may be required. Adverse events of importance with <b>perampanel</b> include dizziness; anger, aggression, and hostile behavior (particularly in adolescents); and falls (particularly in patients > 65 years). An individualized approach to dosing, including slower up-titration and bedtime dosing, reduces dizziness risk. Other drugs may cause or aggravate dizziness; reducing concomitant drugs may be necessary when up-titrating <b>perampanel.</b> It would seem clinically appropriate to give due consideration to avoiding use in patients with a history of anger or hostile/aggressive behavior.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPerampanel is a selective, noncompetitive AMPA {{receptor}} antagonist approved as adjunctive {{treatment for}} partial seizures. To assess potential for delayed cardiac repolarization, a Phase I thorough QT study was performed, supplemented by plasma concentration–QT data modeled from 3 pooled Phase III studies. MethodsThe Phase I thorough QT study (double-blind, combined fixed-sequence, parallel-group) quantified {{the effect of}} <b>perampanel</b> (6 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by dose escalation to a single 8 -mg dose, a single 10 -mg dose, then 12 mg once daily for 7 days), moxifloxacin positive control (single 400 -mg dose on Day 16), and placebo on QT interval duration in healthy subjects (N= 261). Electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline, Day 7 (post 6 mg dose), and Day 16 (post 12 mg dose). Statistical comparisons were between the highest approved <b>perampanel</b> dose (12 mg) versus placebo, a “mid-therapeutic” dose (6 mg) versus placebo, and moxifloxacin versus placebo. Acknowledging that the Phase I thorough QT study could not incorporate a true “supratherapeutic” dose due to length of titration and tolerability concerns in healthy subjects, Phase III studies of <b>perampanel</b> included expanded electrocardiogram safety evaluations specifically intended to support concentration–QT response modeling. The lack of effect of <b>perampanel</b> on the QT interval is shown from pooled analysis of 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 19 -week, Phase III studies with <b>perampanel</b> doses ≤ 12 mg (N= 1038, total perampanel; and N= 442, placebo) in patients with partial seizures. QT measures were corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's (QTcF; the primary endpoint) and Bazett's (QTcB) formulas. ResultsIn the Phase I thorough QT study, the positive control moxifloxacin caused peak time-matched, baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected (ΔΔ) QTcF of 12. 15 ms at 4 h postdose, confirming a drug effect on QTc interval and study assessment sensitivity. Mean baseline-adjusted (Δ) QTcF versus nominal time curves were comparable between <b>perampanel</b> 12 mg and placebo, with most ΔQTcF values being slightly negative. Healthy subjects receiving <b>perampanel</b> 6 and 12 mg doses for 7 days showed no evidence of effects on cardiac repolarization. Peak ΔΔQTcF was 2. 34 ms at 1. 5 h postdose for <b>perampanel</b> 6 mg and 3. 92 ms at 0. 5 h postdose for <b>perampanel</b> 12 mg. At every time point, the upper 95 % confidence limit of ΔΔQTcF for <b>perampanel</b> 6 and 12 mg was 450 ms, with no dose-dependent increases or large incremental changes from baseline of > 60 ms. Regression analysis of individual plasma <b>perampanel</b> concentrations versus corresponding QTc interval values in Phase I thorough QT and Phase III studies demonstrated no relationship between <b>perampanel</b> concentrations and QT interval duration. ConclusionTreatment with <b>perampanel</b> 6 mg and 12 mg for 7 days did not delay cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers. In a population analysis of 1480 patients with partial seizures treated with <b>perampanel</b> doses ≤ 12 mg or placebo, no clinically significant trends in QT interval data were noted.

The key secondary endpoint (primary endpoint for European Union registration) was 50 % PGTC seizure responder rate (patients achieving $ 50 % reduction in PGTC seizure frequency; maintenance vs baseline). Treatment-emergent adverse events were monitored. Results: Of 164 randomized patients, 162 comprised the full analysis set (placebo, 81; perampa-nel, 81). Compared with placebo, <b>perampanel</b> conferred a greater median percent change in PGTC seizure frequency per 28 days (238. 4 % vs 276. 5 %; p, 0. 0001) and greater 50 %PGTC seizure responder rate (39. 5 % vs 64. 2 %; p 5 0. 0019).

MethodsPatients who completed the three multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III core studies (studies 304, 305, or 306) were eligible to enroll in the extension study (study 307). Patients completing the double-blind treatment (6 -week titration, 13 -week maintenance) with placebo (DB-PBO) or <b>perampanel</b> (DB-PER) began the extension study with a 16 -week blinded conversion period, during which DB-PBO patients were switched to <b>perampanel.</b> Doses were titrated in 2 -mg increments (biweekly) to an individualized maximum tolerated dose of <b>perampanel</b> (up to 12 mg/day). Patients then entered a planned, open-label treatment period. ResultsPerampanel treatment during the extension study reduced total seizure frequency/ 28 days relative to the double-blind prerandomization baseline regardless of prior <b>perampanel</b> or placebo treatment in the core studies. In the DB-PBO patients, median percent reductions in seizure frequency at the end of the double-blind period, at the end of the conversion period, and at Weeks 40 – 52 in the open-label maintenance period were 18. 6 %, 44. 3 %, and 55. 0 %, respectively. Seizure control was also improved in the DB-PER patients during the extension period compared to the end of the double-blind period. Responder rates were similar between the 2 patient groups at the end of the conversion period. <b>Perampanel</b> was well tolerated, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events being dizziness, somnolence, weight increase, irritability, fatigue, and headache. For those patients randomized to the 12 mg group (DB-PER 12 mg), 78. 4 % reached the daily dose of 10 or 12 mg by the end of the 6 -week titration period of the double-blind phase. By the end of the 16 -week conversion period of the extension study, 64. 0 % of DB-PBO patients reached the daily dose of 10 or 12 mg.

Concomitant AEDs were categorized according {{to whether or not}} they were enzyme-inducing AEDs (EIAEDs; known to reduce <b>perampanel</b> plasma concentrations) or sodium channel blockers (SCBs). Post hoc analyses assessed {{the impact of}} co-administration of non-EIAED SCBs and the overall number of concomitant AEDs on changes in seizure frequency, 50 % responder rates, rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and rates of discontinuation due to TEAEs, in patients randomized to receive daily placebo or <b>perampanel</b> 2, 4, 8, or 12 mg. ResultsAmongst 1480 randomized and treated patients, most were receiving two or more concomitant AEDs (n= 1273, 86. 0 %), one or more EIAEDs (n= 1083, 73. 2 %), and/or one or more SCBs (n= 1203, 81. 3 %) at Baseline. The magnitude of seizure reduction appeared unaffected by the presence of non-EIAED SCBs, but lower in the presence of multiple AEDs.

40|$|Background: Epilepsy {{is usually}} controlled, but not cured, with medication. However, over 30 % {{of people with}} {{epilepsy}} do not have seizure control even with the best available medications. A new antiepileptic drug as adjunctive therapy for patients with partial onset seizures has been discovered. <b>Perampanel</b> (E 2007) is an orally active, noncompetitive, and highly selective AMPA (α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionic acid) -type glutamate receptor antagonist. AMPA receptor antagonist is a potential pharmacologic treatment for partial onset seizures by blocking excessive neuronal materials activation. [1] <b>Perampanel</b> was well tolerated and displayed favorable pharmacologic properties, including oral bioavailability and a long half-life in Phase I studies[2]. <b>Perampanel</b> has not been shown to interact with other ionotropic glutamate receptors and is without the behavioral phencyclidine-like adverse events that may be observed with some NMDA-receptors antagonists[3]. Objective: The aim of the meta-analysis is to demonstrate the magnitude of safety and efficacy of <b>perampanel</b> in treating the refractory partial onset seizures when compared to placebo. Methods: A systematic review of Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>perampanel</b> was conducted. An electronic literature was identified by searching Medline, Embase and the Cochrane database. The primary efficacy end points were the 50 % responder rate and treatment emergent adverse effects (TEAS). The secondary efficacy end points were the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to pre-perampanel baseline and incidence of withdrawal. In order to compare <b>perampanel</b> and placebo, we used Revmen to calculate Odds Ratio (OR), Confidence intervals, Risk Ratio (RR) and Risk Differences (RD). Results: A total of five RCTs {{were included in the}} studies. During Phase II studies (labeled as studies 206 [4] and 208 [4]) 201 patients were involved. During Phase III studies (labeled as 304 [1], 305 [3] and 306 [5]) 1331 patients were included. For 50 % responder rate, the pooled odds ratio of 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg <b>perampanel</b> compared with placebo was 1. 76 [95 %CI: 1. 15, 2. 69], 2. 26 [95 %CI: 1. 66, 3. 08] and 2. 11 [95 %CI: 1. 35, 3. 32] respectively. The pooled odds ratio of <b>perampanel</b> for adverse events: headache 1. 03 [95 %CI : 0. 79, 1. 34]; dizziness 3. 48 [95 %CI: 1. 94, 6. 24]; somnolence 2. 09 [95 %CI: 1. 39, 3. 15] and fatigue 1. 83 [95 %CI: 1. 23, 2. 71] respectively. Conclusion: The pooled odds ratio suggested <b>perampanel</b> might be more effective than placebo comparing the 50 % responder rate. However, the risks of the TEAs were higher in the <b>perampanel</b> group when comparing with the placebo group. The use of 12 mg <b>perampanel</b> was shown be highly related with dizziness and somnolence. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

Although initially licensed as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 12  years or older, the US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved its use in the treatment of primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures (PGTCS). This paper reviews the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of <b>perampanel</b> as an antiepileptic drug. Results: After oral ingestion, <b>perampanel</b> is rapidly absorbed (Tmax, 0. 5 – 2. 5  hours), has a bioavailability of ~ 100 %, and is highly protein bound (~ 95 %) in plasma. It undergoes extensive (> 90 %) hepatic metabolism, primarily via cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4), with a half-life of 48  hours. Carbamazepine and other antiepileptic drugs can enhance its metabolism via induction of CYP 3 A 4. Efficacy of <b>perampanel</b> in focal seizures has been extensively evaluated in Phase II and randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trials. The efficacy in PGTCS has been reported in one class I study. In the treatment of focal seizures, <b>perampanel</b> showed significant dose-dependent median seizure reductions: 4  mg/d, 23 %; 8  mg/d, 26 %– 31 %; 12  mg/d, 18 %– 35 %; and placebo, 10 %– 21 %. The 50 % responder rates were 15 %– 26 %, 29 %, 33 %– 38 %, and 34 %– 36 % for placebo, 4  mg/d, 8  mg/d, and 12  mg/d <b>perampanel,</b> respectively. Freedom from seizures was recorded in 0 %– 1. 7 % of the placebo group, 1. 9 % of the 2  mg group, 2. 6 %– 4. 4 % of the 8  mg group, and 2. 6 %– 6. 5 % of the 12  mg group. For PGTCS, the median seizure reduction was 76. 5 % for <b>perampanel</b> and 38. 4 % for placebo. The 50 % responder rate was 64. 2 % for <b>perampanel</b> and 39. 5 % for placebo. Seizure freedom during maintenance phase was 30. 9 % for <b>perampanel</b> and 12. 3 % for placebo. Adverse effects included dose-dependent increases in the frequency of dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, irritability, falls, and probably nausea. Conclusion: <b>Perampanel</b> is effective in treating both partial-onset seizures and PGTCS.

40|$|Objective Assess {{cognitive}} {{effects of}} adjunctive <b>perampanel</b> in adolescents. Methods In this double-blind study (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT 01161524), patients aged 12 to < 18 years with partial-onset seizures despite receiving 1 – 3 antiepileptic drugs were randomized (2 : 1) to <b>perampanel</b> or placebo. <b>Perampanel</b> was increased weekly in 2 -mg increments to 8 – 12 mg/day (6 -week titration; 13 -week maintenance). Changes in neuropsychological outcomes were assessed {{at end of}} maintenance: Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score (primary end point), five CDR System domain T-scores (secondary end points), letter fluency, category fluency, and Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT). Results One hundred thirty-three patients were randomized. In the full analysis set, {{there were no differences}} of <b>perampanel</b> (n = 79) vs. placebo (n = 44) in CDR System Global Cognition Score (least squares mean change, − 0. 6 vs. 1. 6; p = 0. 145), Quality of Working Memory (1. 1 vs. 2. 0; p = 0. 579), or Power of Attention (− 6. 9 vs. − 2. 7; p = 0. 219). There were small differences with <b>perampanel</b> vs. placebo in other CDR System domains: improvements in Quality of Episodic Memory (3. 0 vs. − 1. 2; p = 0. 012), and worsening in Continuity of Attention (− 3. 3 vs. 1. 6; p = 0. 013) and Speed of Memory (0. 3 vs. 7. 0; p = 0. 032).
