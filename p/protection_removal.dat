40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural river banks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion. Important river features for flora and fauna have disappeared and the ecological quality of the river reduced dramatically. Recently, the importance of the ecological function of rivers has been getting more attention. One river restoration measure is the removal of man-made bank protections to increase habitat diversity and biodiversity of riparian areas and the river basin. The river morphology may change due to the freely eroding banks in the restored section. Reference projects show that the removal of bank protection along rivers may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Schirmer et al., 2014). Bars increase morphological diversity, providing specific habitats for flora and fauna (Kurth and Schirmer, 2014). There is a lack of knowledge about the formation of bars related to the length and location of the removal of bank protection. The length of river bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> is usually limited, due to human activities along the riversides. Therefore, a guideline is needed for the design of bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> to enhance habitat diversity through bar formation to make this a feasible river restoration method.

The Child <b>Protection</b> <b>Removal</b> Assessment (ChiPRA) instrument adopts a structured professional judgement (SPJ) approach to decision-making and was developed from a literature review of studies identifying factors associated with severe child abuse. A study comparing the predictive validity of ChiPRA and an actuarial instrument was conducted using court file data from 298 child protection cases. A logistic function from all ChiPRA items, &# 0967; 2 (11) = 147. 546, p < 0. 000, correctly classified 86. 3 % of cases (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0. 799, p < 0. 000, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 738 &# 8211; 0. 859). The abuse subscale of the actuarial instrument yielded a modest but significant AUC (0. 595, 95 % CI: 0. 530 &# 8211; 0. 660).

40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural riverbanks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into the effects of removing riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank protection removal; length, location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6. 2 metre long and 0. 2 metre wide straight channel with 0. 5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of the channel, bank protection could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours {{at the end of each}} test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the longitudinal bed profile was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Duró et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e. g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> length up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i. e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended to remove riverbank protections over a length of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable to remove the bank protection on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of the bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA mobile-bed, {{undistorted}} {{physical model}} (1 : 40) {{has been used}} to investigate different sediment supply strategies to the Old Rhine through bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal</b> and modifications of groyne dimensions and configuration, which cause bank erosion. This trained channel was previously the main bed of the upper Rhine downstream of Basel (Switzerland), but it has an artificially low flow regime since the construction of the Grand Canal d'Alsace, a navigation canal, and a flow control dam at Kembs (France). Training works and subsequent channel incision have also greatly reduced sediment transport rates and created a heavily armoured bed. The modelled pilot site has a groyne field on the left bank. Results show that the currently existing groynes at the site are not effective in creating high bank-side velocities conducive to bank erosion, even for flow rates significantly higher than the mean annual flow rate. The river bank has also proved to be more resistant than previously thought, allowing long stretches of bank protection to be safely removed. The physical model testing process has produced a new configuration for the groyne field, where two higher, larger island groynes are placed further apart than the three existing attached groynes. This innovative approach has proved effective, causing bank erosion for flow rates below the mean annual flow rate, with consistent erosion being observed. It has also been found that such a configuration does not pose a hazard for the Grand Canal d'Alsace, which is situated next to the Old Rhine, through excessive bank erosion during high flow events...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the analyses and conclusions {{of a study}} on the planform evolution of the Geul river in the last 80 years. The results are compared with those of studies carried out by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA). The Geul river is to tributary of the Meuse River (The Netherlands). It has been straightened and protected against the erosion in the past, but since 1980 some stretches are allowed to meander freely. A meandering stretch near the Belgian border has been analysed. Historical planform changes are analysed with aerial photographs between 1935 and 2003. Channel migration is observed through the movement of the centreline of the river for each photograph. Channel width evolution, the presence of trees and its effects are also studied from the photos. In order to simulate the planform changes of the Geul river, the river planform model Miandras (Crosato, 1990) has been applied. Flow parameters (discharge, Chézy factor [...] .) are analysed and discussed. After the calibration of some of them, erodibility coefficients needed for Miandras computations are obtained. The results of the aerial photos analysis show that bank erosion and channel width increase with time, as expected, due to the bank <b>protection</b> <b>removal.</b> Bank stability analysis is more affected by the properties of riverbanks than by the flow properties. The flowing ground water from the hills to the rivers and though the valley has an importance influence of the stability. Centreline coordinates obtained from the aerial photos are affected by inaccuracies in the photos, and the river migration obtained from them does not correspond with the one observed tn field analysis. This renders aerial photos unsuitable to monitor small displacements of this type of rivers. The results obtained with Miandras reproduce the migration trend as derived from the field observations for a short scale of time.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to remove a}} child from the family home is affected by a multitude of factors. The literature describes difficulties experienced by child protection practitioners when making these decisions. Difficulties arise from uncertain contexts and unclear information, leading practitioners to rely upon heuristics {{that may lead to}} errors in judgement. In an effort to improve decision-making in child protection, a body of literature on risk assessment instruments has emerged. Currently, in child protection the prevailing body of literature relates to consensus and actuarial instruments. Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) is a third approach to guiding decision-making and is yet to be meaningfully explored in the field of child protection practice. The aim of the thesis is to report on the development and pilot evaluation of a newly devised SPJ instrument. The Child <b>Protection</b> <b>Removal</b> Assessment (ChiPRA) was developed {{as a part of the}} current program of research studies that aim to assist child protection practitioners decide whether protective concerns should be managed while the child resides within or outside the family home. The thesis is organised in three parts (A, B & C). Part A is a literature review of risk assessment in child protection practice and comprises two manuscripts. In the first part of the chapter, decision-aids adopting consensus, actuarial and SPJ are described and compared. In the first manuscript, intuitive and analytical cognition is described and cognitive theory is linked with the development of decision-aids. In the second manuscript, the importance of critically evaluating the empirical research used to inform the development of a decision-aid is described. Limitations of studies establishing a link between the well-established risk factor, substance misuse during pregnancy with subsequent child protection involvement are described. This manuscript highlights the importance of selecting studies that measure relevant outcomes and are conducted in similar contexts in which the instrument will subsequently be used. Part B details the development of ChiPRA and comprises two manuscripts. The results of a selective literature review of studies identifying risk factors associated with child removal and child abuse-related fatalities are presented. Included in the literature review are manuscripts describing the antecedent factors associated with maternal infanticide and neonaticide. Processes involved in developing, establishing a framework and scoring ChiPRA, are also described in this part of the thesis. In Part C, the expanded methodology and empirical results of the program of studies are presented in three manuscripts. Risk variables associated with child removal in the sample are presented. Following this, the specific analyses of relationships between parental substance misuse and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status with child removal are presented in two manuscripts. In the final manuscript, the validity of ChiPRA is compared with an actuarial instrument (Family Risk Evaluation-Structured Decision Making™, FRE-SDM™). The study identified promising preliminary results, however given this is a pilot study, further research is warranted.
