5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|After its founding, {{the party}} {{promoted}} {{itself as the}} legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of the party. Zeidler also helped re-organizing the party structure during its early years. He was later nominated as the party's candidacy for the presidential office, with Zeidler believing the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> be able to collaborate with other socialist parties nationwide to spread the message of socialism.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the referendum, the Legislative assembly agreed to accept the results, and the Federal government agreed on the following conditions: continued support from the electorate; all <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> agree on a new boundary, all <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> agree on the division of powers between all levels of government, and the settlement of land claims.|$|R
5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his <b>party</b> <b>would</b> pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the floods, several citizens' groups and {{political}} parties, notably the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), strongly recommended that Tiruchirappalli be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant government land and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader S. Ramadoss said the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> seriously consider the matter if it came to power.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano Gómez (1950-1953) {{and former}} Liberal President Alberto Lleras (1945-1946, 1958-1962) issued the [...] "Declaration of Sitges," [...] {{in which they}} {{proposed}} a [...] "National Front," [...] whereby the Liberal and Conservative <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> have parity in all other elective offices.|$|R
5|$|On November 12, 2010 President Yanukovych {{appointed}} Viktor Baloha (United Centre) Minister of Emergencies and Minister of the Protection of the Population {{from the}} Chernobyl disaster. According to Baloha {{this did not}} mean his <b>party</b> <b>would</b> join the coalition. Early 2010 United Centre had rejected any possibility of joining a parliamentary coalition with the Communist Party of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships crewed by Navy {{personnel and}} bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic <b>party)</b> <b>would</b> appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship's guns would become operational and open fire, hopefully destroying the submarine.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her <b>party</b> <b>would</b> be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E

5|$|The Roseberys' house <b>party</b> <b>would</b> leave Dalmeny {{and tour}} {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds {{from the back of}} an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described as something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress <b>party</b> <b>would</b> have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, {{the richness of the}} design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E

5|$|The party opposes {{government}} subsidy of wind turbines and instead proposes {{the increased use}} of clean coal technology and nuclear fusion to address the UK's energy shortage. This would be accompanied by a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hopes will keep consumer costs affordable. The <b>party</b> <b>would</b> also abandon catch quotas set by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and establish 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful stocks.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{important}} {{place in the}} government or private sector not occupied by proven party comrades. Adolf Hitler clearly announced before the seizure of power that the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> be running things. Thus, anywhere {{there might be a}} reaction against the party, a Hitler guard stands ready to quell that reaction.|$|E
5|$|With the Conservatives {{leading in}} the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a new election, hopeful that his <b>party</b> <b>would</b> gain a {{majority}} of seats. It was then Canadian constitutional practice that the Governor General could refuse a dissolution early in a parliament's term, unless the government had been defeated in the House, or was winning divisions by {{only a handful of}} votes. Diefenbaker sought a pretext for a new election.|$|E

5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> be Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance <b>party</b> <b>would</b> give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
