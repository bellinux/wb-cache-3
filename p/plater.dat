5|$|Emilia <b>Plater</b> {{was born}} in Vilnius into a noble Polish–Lithuanian <b>Plater</b> family. Her family, of the <b>Plater</b> coat of arms, traced its roots to Westphalia, but was {{thoroughly}} Polonized. Much of the family relocated to Livonia during the 15th century and later to Lithuania, of which Vilnius is the capital. She is described as either Polish, Polish-Lithuanian or Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|She {{also became}} {{the theme of}} {{paintings}} by several artists of the epoch, among them Hyppolyte Bellange, Achille Deveria, Philipp Veit, Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak. In 1842, J. K. Salomoński published a short biography of <b>Plater</b> in New York, under the title of Emily <b>Plater,</b> The Polish Heroine; Life of the Countess Emily <b>Plater.</b> A lithograph by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, {{became one of the}} most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a delicate and noble female warrior.|$|E
5|$|She was {{depicted}} on the Second Polish Republic's 20 złoty note. During World War II, a Polish female support unit, Emilia <b>Plater</b> 1st Independent Women's Battalion (1 Samodzielny Battalion Kobiecy im. Emilii <b>Plater),</b> {{a part of}} the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division was named in her honor; its former members founded a village of Platerówka in Lower Silesia. Several streets in Poland are named after her, including one in Warsaw. In 1959, the MS Emilia <b>Plater,</b> a Polish Merchant Navy bulk carrier, was named after her.|$|E

5|$|After the Polish {{units were}} {{defeated}} by the Russians at Šiauliai, Gen. Chłapowski decided {{to cross the border}} into Prussia and become interned there. <b>Plater</b> vocally criticized that decision, refused to follow orders and instead decided to try to break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle. However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied by only two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), Cezary <b>Plater,</b> she became seriously ill. She never recovered, and she died in a manor of the Abłamowicz family in Justinavas on 23 December 1831. She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis near Lazdijai. After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Chłapowski advised <b>Plater</b> {{to stand}} down and return home. She {{allegedly}} replied {{that she had}} no intention of taking off her uniform until her fatherland was fully liberated. Her decision was accepted and she was made a commanding officer of the 1st company of the Polish–Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment. She was promoted to the rank of captain, the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time. She spent some time in Kaunas, before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery <b>Plater</b> and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, <b>Plater</b> was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of the icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E

5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. <b>Plater</b> {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de <b>Plater</b> considered its development an educational experience for the studio. In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and the studio were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. The studio considered Rocksteady's games good examples of {{how to handle a}} licensed title.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, one of {{her cousins}} was {{forcibly}} conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army as a punishment for celebrating the Constitution of 3 May; this incident {{is said to be}} one of the key events in her life, and one that galvanized her pro-Polish and anti-Russian attitude. In 1829, <b>Plater</b> began a grand tour throughout the historical Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, visiting Warsaw and Kraków, and the battlefield of Raszyn. Her mother died a year later; her father remarried and refused to even meet his daughter. After the outbreak of the November Uprising against Imperial Russia, she became a vocal supporter of the anti-Tsarist sentiments in the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. She became one of a dozen or so females to join the Uprising, and the most famous of them all.|$|E
5|$|The first upgrade of MD234 was a {{relocation}} at Allens Fresh Run, {{which included}} replacing a dangerous one-way {{bridge over the}} stream, that was completed in 1933. MD237 was reconstructed with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951, a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head-of-the-Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown. Reconstruction of MD234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961. MD234 and MD237 were significantly straightened out, leaving behind many sections of old alignment: Glasva School Road in Allens Fresh; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport; Stines Store Road in Newport; <b>Plater</b> Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico; Stone Corner Lane, which is unsigned MD868G, and Reed Road in Budds Creek; and Horse Shoe Road between Chaptico and Clements. The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run, Chaptico Creek, and Budds Creek. When the project was completed in 1961, MD234 assumed the course of MD237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD238 was extended over the segment of MD234 between Chaptico and Helen.|$|E

25|$|The {{coloration}} of {{the facade}} has been altered several times since {{the completion of}} the new northern row in 1695. Tessin's first coloration was brick-red <b>plater</b> with white-painted sandstone details. Det brick-red color was called Dutch brunroot (brown-red), and came from brown ochre that was bought for painting the walls of the building. Carl Hårleman took over {{as the head of the}} building site when Tessin died in 1728. During the construction, the plaster was left unpainted, while the stone details were paited in white lead.|$|E
25|$|In 1576 George Baker {{published}} {{a translation of}} the Evonymus of Conrad Gessner under the title of The Newe Jewell of Health, wherein is contained the most excellent Secretes of Physicke and Philosophie divided into fower bookes. Amongst his students was Felix <b>Plater,</b> who became a professor of medicine, and accumulated many plant specimens, but also illustrations of animals used in Historiae animalium. A year after his death, his friend Josias Simler {{published a}} biography of Gessner. Gessner and others founded the Physikalische Gesellschaft in Zurich, which later became the Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Zürich (NGZH) in 1746, to promote the study of natural sciences. Today {{it is one of}} the oldest Swiss scientific societies. The society's annual publication, the Neujahrsblatt der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Zürich was devoted to a bioography of Gessner in 1966, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1862, Union troops {{protecting}} coastal colonies began to withdraw to reinforce Union General George B. McClellan who was engaged in the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia, a series of battle between March and July. Hunter withdrew the rest of garrison on Edisto Island on July 11, The last troops to leave were companies of the 55th Pennsylvania, one squadron of Massachusetts troops, and two pieces of field artillery served by detachments of the 3rd Rhode Island Infantry. As a result, the superintendent of the contrabands, Francis E. Barnard, organized the 1,600 former slaves with livestock and personal property and they ferried to St. Helena village, where they spent {{the remainder of the}} war. The island's farmland and crops of cotton and corn were abandoned. Barnard died on October 18, 1862 of malaria, and Edward L. Pierce reported that the exertions to settle the contraband on St. Helena Island had brought on the fever. A very small number of contraband remained on the island, and the Union Blockade included a station off of North Edisto Island. Notably, recently escaped slave Robert Smalls and the <b>Plater</b> were involved in the withdrawal of troops from the island. Smalls would return to the island in 1865 on an inspection with Brigadier General Rufus Saxton, who was quartermaster of the South Carolina Expeditionary Corps during much of Union occupation of the Island.|$|E
