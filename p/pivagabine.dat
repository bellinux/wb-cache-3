50|$|<b>Pivagabine</b> (INN; {{brand name}} Tonerg), {{also known as}} N-pivaloyl-Î³-aminobutyric acid or N-pivaloyl-GABA, is an {{antidepressant}} and anxiolytic drug which was introduced in Italy in 1997 {{for the treatment of}} depressive and maladaptive syndromes. But it was discontinued in Italy (according to Martindale). Originally believed to function as a prodrug to GABA, <b>pivagabine</b> is now believed to act somehow via modulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF).|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{eighteen}} patients with neurasthenia, {{as defined by}} ICD 10 (International Classification of Diseases), participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <b>pivagabine</b> (4 -[(2, 2 -dimethyl- 1 -oxopropyl) amino]butanoic acid, CAS 69542 - 93 - 4, Tonerg). <b>Pivagabine</b> 1800 mg/d was administered orally for four weeks. At {{the end of the}} trial, active medication was significantly superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement of illness scale. In addition, <b>pivagabine</b> treatment reduced the physical and mental fatigability of patients, and increased their sense of well-being...|$|E
40|$|Stress-induced neuroendocrine {{activities}} {{influence the}} regulation of endocrine glands and axes. Weight loss-related hypothalamic amenorrhea is a typical stress-induced physiopathological condition. It is characterized by increased adrenal cortex activation and by reduced GH, LH, FSH and gonadal steroid hormone levels. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of <b>pivagabine,</b> a neurotropic drug (1800 mg/day for 7 days) or placebo administration on ACTH, cortisol, GH, LH, FSH and PRL plasma levels in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea related to weight loss. Hormonal parameters and the pulsatile release of cortisol (6 -hour pulsatility, sampling every 10 minutes) were evaluated before and after 7 days of treatment. <b>Pivagabine</b> administration significantly reduced mean plasma ACTH (from 21. 7 +/- 1. 7 to 15. 4 +/- 1. 2 pg/ml, p< 0. 05) and cortisol levels (from 12. 2 +/- 0. 7 to 9. 7 +/- 0. 7 ng/ml, p< 0. 05) and increased GH levels (from 1. 4 +/- 0. 5 to 3. 0 +/- 0. 9 ng/ml, p< 0. 05). A significant reduction of cortisol pulse amplitude was observed (p< 0. 01) while no change in pulse frequency occurred. No changes were observed in placebo-treated subjects. LH, FSH and PRL levels were not modified by placebo or <b>pivagabine</b> administration. In conclusion, in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea related to weight loss <b>pivagabine</b> induced a significant decrease of cortisol secretion and an increase of GH release by <b>pivagabine</b> administration, suggesting that this drug exerts a specific neuroendocrine modulatory rol...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pivagabine</b> [4 -(2, 2 -dimethyl- 1 -oxopropylamino) butanoic acid] (PVG) is a {{hydrophobic}} 4 -aminobutyric acid derivative with neuromodulatory activity. The {{effects of}} subchronic treatment with PVG on stress-induced changes both on brain concentrations of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and neurosteroids {{and on the}} function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor complex were investigated in male rats. Subchronic treatment with PVG (100 - 200 mg/kg, IP) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the foot shock-induced increase in the binding of t-[S- 35]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to unwashed membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex of rats killed immediately after stress; PVG treatment alone had no effect on this parameter. This antagonistic action of PVG was also shown in adrenalectomized-orchietomized rats. Foot-shock stress decreased by 74 % and increased by 125 % the CRF concentration in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, respectively. PVG prevented these effects of stress on CRF concentration in both brain regions; this drug per se reduced hypothalamic CRF concentration by 52 % but had no effect in the cortex. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of CRF, like stress, induced a dose-dependent increase of [S- 35]TBPS binding to cerebral cortical membranes: an effect not prevented by subchronic treatment of PVG. Finally, PVG did not antagonize the stress-induced increases in the concentrations of neuroactive steroids in brain or plasma. These results suggest that the marked antistress action of PVG is mediated by antagonizing the effects of stress on GABA(A) receptor function and CRF concentrations in the brain, but not by altering the stress-induced increase in neurosteroid concentrations.
