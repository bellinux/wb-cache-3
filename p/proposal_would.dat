5|$|Rise of unemployment: The <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> lead to {{cancellation}} {{of tens of}} thousands of work places in the Czech Republic alone.|$|E
5|$|Threat to {{national}} culture: The <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> lead to permanent deactivation of firearms owned by collectors and museums, including army museums, {{even though there}} is no empirical data supporting need for such a measure.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway. The <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E

50|$|In May 2013 the {{commission}} published its sift criteria against which longer term capacity <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> be assessed. The commission envisaged {{that a small}} number of preferred <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> be short listed for further study during 2014 and 2015 in its Interim Report in December 2013. The outcome of those studies would enable {{the commission}} to recommend a preferred location for additional hub airport capacity.|$|R
5|$|One {{proposal}} considered was {{to merge}} JAL with ANA, which {{would create a}} single larger international airline and replace Japan Airlines International; however, media reports suggested that this <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> be opposed by ANA given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier. The task force also examined possible partnerships with foreign carriers.|$|E
5|$|The City of Windsor also hired New York traffic {{consultant}} Sam Schwartz {{to design}} a parkway to the border. Schwartz's <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> eventually inspire the DRIC's own design, but his route was not chosen, with the DRIC opting instead to take a northern route.|$|E
5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive. The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Congress is {{evaluating}} several {{proposals to}} reform the federal income tax system. Proponents of tax reform want to simplify tax preparation and stimulate economic growth by increasing the incentives for taxpayers to work, save, and invest. > While the primary objective of tax reform is a more productive economy, changing the tax laws would also affect financial markets. Several of the <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> change the way interest expenses are deducted and change the way income from interest, dividends, and capital gains is taxed. These changes would affect interest rates and the prices of stocks. > Golob analyzes the effects of income tax reform on U. S. financial markets. He reaches three conclusions. First, most <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> reduce interest rates in credit markets where interest income is currently taxable, including bank loans, Treasury securities, and corporate securities. Second, all <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> increase interest rates in municipal credit markets where interest income is not currently taxable. And third, most <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> increase stock prices. All three of these effects could be substantial. Financial markets; Taxation; Income tax...|$|R
40|$|Commission {{is proposing}} rules that would modify and advance {{significantly}} the registration, communications, and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. Today’s <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> eliminate unnecessary and outmoded restrictions on offerings. In addition, the <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> provide more timely investment information to investors without mandating {{delays in the}} offering process that we believe would be inconsistent {{with the needs of}} issuers for timely access to capital. The <b>proposals</b> also <b>would</b> continue our longterm efforts toward integrating disclosure and processes under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> accomplish these goals by addressing communications related to registered securities offerings, delivery of information to investors, and procedural restrictions in the offering and capital formation processes.

5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> {{keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling {{only at a}} new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|Blue Line trains share {{a single}} tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, {{creating}} a choke point. A 2001 <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> have rerouted the Blue Line between the Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown. The proposal was later rejected due to cost, but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E

50|$|Mayor of London, Boris Johnson visited Edmonton in November 2008 {{to release}} his Time For Action plan. He claimed his <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> help stop young people {{becoming}} repeat offenders.|$|R
5|$|In March 2007, a {{proposal}} to establish a station at Valby, where the Carlsberg Group is planning an urban redevelopment, was scrapped. The <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> have increased construction costs by DKK900million and was deemed not economical. The increased cost was, in part, due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time. The City Circle Line was passed by parliament on 1 June 2007, with only the Red–Green Alliance voting in disfavor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weekend}} from 4 to 6 February, county {{conventions}} {{were held in}} eleven counties, including Hagen's native Oslo, and Buskerud, Finnmark, Telemark, Vest-Agder, Hordaland, Nordland, Østfold, Troms, Nord-Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal. Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter, but {{the leader of the}} chapter, Peter N. Myhre, stated beforehand that Hagen's <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> probably be rejected. It was speculated that rejections could come from the Buskerud and Finnmark's conventions as well. On 7 February, Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> ultimately be incorporated into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. Examples of these details included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.|$|E
50|$|Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Raymond Tam Chi-yuen {{confirmed}} on 2 June 2015 that reform <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> be tabled to the Legislative Council on 17 June with no modifications.|$|R
40|$|Congress {{continues}} to consider legislative options to address wetlands loss in coastal Louisiana. Some legislative <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> dedicate some federal revenues from offshore {{oil and gas}} development to restoration efforts. Other <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> authorize specific restoration projects or activities, or further examination of the causes and effects of loss. These projects are neutralizing conditions that lead to loss at some sites, and are reestablishing some wetlands. These projects {{are expected to have}} many ecological, economic, and social benefits. A July 2004 U. S. Army Corps of Engineers report, a draft ecosystem restoration study, identifies more than 150 possible remedies...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} farms and other estates that must pay Federal estate taxes has {{increased}} in recent years. Concerns about this increase {{and its effect on}} farms and other small businesses have generated a number of proposals to change Federal estate tax laws. Some <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> affect only farms and small businesses. Other <b>proposals</b> <b>would</b> lower taxes for all estates and reduce the number of estates required to file an estate tax return. Of the current proposals examined here, farm estate taxes would be reduced most by a new exclusion for familyowned businesses, including farms. Agricultural Finance, Public Economics,...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} {{projects have been}} proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple Line has been in planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway. The current <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E
5|$|In {{months prior}} to the settlement, Seattle {{publicly}} released email conversations that took place within Bennett's ownership group alleging they indicated that some members of the group had a desire to move the team to Oklahoma City prior to its purchase in 2006. The city used these conversations to argue that ownership failed to negotiate in good faith and as a result, Schultz filed a lawsuit seeking to rescind the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a court-appointed receiver. The NBA claimed the lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group but also argued that the <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> have violated league ownership rules. Schultz dropped the case {{before the start of the}} 2008–09 NBA season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> undermine public education.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} {{publicly that}} {{the main thrust of}} his legislative <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> be to withhold funds from any local school district which integrated. In response, Gray called a meeting of the Gray Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in the courthouse being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested in massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission <b>proposal</b> <b>would</b> affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E
