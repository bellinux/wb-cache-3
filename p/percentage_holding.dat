The Spartans, led by seventh year coach Mark Dantonio, led the conference in scoring defense (16 touchdowns allowed), rushing defense (64.8 yards per game), total defense (237.7 yards per game) and pass defense (172.9 yard per game) during the regular season. Defensive end Shilique Calhoun {{finished}} second in the Big Ten Conference in sacks (7.5) and finished first in fumbles forced (4) and recovered (4). He was an Associated Press second-team All-American. Cornerback Darqueze Dennard was named a consensus first-team All-American and earned the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back.

The small <b>percentage</b> <b>holding</b> kidney donor cards appears to reflect a failure to inform and motivate the general public. There was no evidence of any widespread objection to the procedures involved in obtaining cadaver kidneys, but there was strong objection to the introduction by law of an "opting out" system.

40|$|We {{investigate}} abnormal returns {{resulting from}} the announcement of a rights issue in Australia and are the first study outside the United States and the United Kingdom to examine the pricing of rights issues and the determinants of that pricing. Rights issues generate a significantly negative abnormal return and, on average, are priced at a discount. The determinants of the announcement effect are analysed using a two-stage approach controlling for the endogeneity of the price discount. We first estimate the predicted discount and then include it as an independent variable in the announcement effect regression. The discount is positively related to the offer size and negatively related to underwriter quality, supporting underwriter certification models. We also include variables {{that have not been}} tested in any market, such as shareholder concentration which is negatively related to the discount implying that firms with higher shareholder concentration do not offer a significant discount as their shareholders wish to maintain their <b>percentage</b> <b>holding</b> in the firm. Further, the abnormal returns have a negative relationship with the predicted price discount, and a positive relationship with the use of proceeds. Finally, announcements made by resource firms generate larger negative reactions than other issuers. ...|$|E

40|$|Price in {{commercial}} gambling is effectively the house {{edge of the}} game. For electronic gaming machines (EGMs), house edge is the <b>hold</b> <b>percentage.</b> The paper tracks changes in <b>hold</b> <b>percentage</b> for club and hotel EGM gambling in Australia. We use real gambling turnover and revenue data to show that hold generally falls over time, save for the State of Victoria between 1993 and 2009. In Victoria, hold fell during the roll-out phase of the sector, before rising steadily. We examine local level data, finding that hold varied considerably by gaming operator across the period, before converging. The unique owner/operator corporate duopoly that existed in Victoria is posed as a potential explanation for aggregate price changes. We then calculate estimates of the monetary value of changes in <b>hold</b> <b>percentage.</b> We find increased hold can lead to substantial monetary redistributions of gamblers' stakes toward the house and away from gamblers. Policy options to protect gamblers from the unfairness of undetectable price rises are discussed, including {{the possibility of a}} more tightly regulated <b>hold</b> <b>percentage,</b> a tax on windfall profits derived from raising hold, and tying game identities to particular <b>hold</b> <b>percentages.</b> © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|The {{position}} of Real Estate within a multi-asset portfolio has received considerable attention recently. Previous research has {{concentrated on the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>holding</b> property would achieve given its risk/return characteristics. Such studies have invariably used Modern Portfolio Theory and these approaches have been criticised for both {{the quality of the}} real estate data and problems with the methodology itself. The first problem is now well understood, and the second can be addressed by the use of realistic constraints on asset holdings. This paper takes a different approach. We determine the level of return that Real Estate needs to achieve to justify an allocation within the multi asset portfolio. In order to test the importance {{of the quality of the}} data we use historic appraisal based and desmoothed returns to examine the sensitivity of the results. Consideration is also given to the Holding period and the im{{position of}} realistic constraints on the asset holdings in order to model portfolios held by pension fund investors. We conclude, using several benchmark levels of portfolio risk and return, that using appraisal based data the required level of return for Real Estate was less than that achieved over the period 1972 - 1993. The use of desmoothed series can reverse this result at the highest levels of desmoothing although within a restricted holding period Real Estate offered returns in excess of those required to enter the portfolio and might have a role to play in the multi-asset portfolio...|$|E

Indeed, it is easy to make an intuitive link between higher slot hold percentages—that ultimately make the slot playing experience either shorter in duration or more costly, or both—and declines in revenue, handle, and visitation. But examining the slot <b>hold</b> <b>percentages</b> and slot denomination mix {{in the context of the}} changes in slot technologies over the years 1992 to 2009, it becomes apparent that there was no sudden arbitrary decision by slot managers to increase <b>hold</b> <b>percentages.</b> Instead, players have chosen, in increasing numbers, to play higher‐hold, lower denomination machines in place of lower‐hold, higher denomination ones. Player choice, not managerial initiative, has been the key determinant of higher slot holds in Nevada, and this pattern likely holds across the national industry...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the effect of}} occupational skills transferability, there is also a strong relationship between pre-displacement work history and subsequent earnings losses. For example, the coefficient of firm tenure at the lost job is negative and statistically significant. This highlights the importance of specialized skills that accumulate over time within a firm and are lost when changing jobs. Specifically, two additional years of tenure at a previous firm, on average, increased earnings losses by 1.60 <b>percentage</b> points, <b>holding</b> other variables fixed. This finding is consistent with other studies of the importance of firm-specific human capital that have found that workers will lose all the skills specific to a particular firm when they change to a new employer (Podgursky and Swaim 1987; Carrington 1990; Topel 1990).|$|R
