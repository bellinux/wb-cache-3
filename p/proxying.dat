In this paper, we propose a novel P 2 P <b>proxy</b> caching scheme using an individual based model.

The aggregate effect of caching actions by individual peer <b>proxies</b> forms a <b>proxy</b> ecology which automatically distributes data to nearest clients and balances workload.

30|$|Note that in {{a secure}} private network, for non-HIP MH, HIP {{communications}} can be terminated at <b>proxy</b> 1 and then exchanged with a MH as IP communications via <b>proxy</b> 2. That is, <b>proxy</b> 1 performs HIP <b>proxy</b> functions while <b>proxy</b> 2 performs mobility support. The advantages of this approach are the following: (1) non-HIP MH can move to any mobility-enabled access router and still preserve its active sessions with HIP CHs and (2) it allows load balancing, for example, if the <b>proxy</b> is heavily loaded, it can assign some of the load to other HIP <b>proxies.</b> However, this approach can result in inefficient routing if the distance between <b>proxy</b> 1 and <b>proxy</b> 2 is large while {{the distance between the}} GW and <b>proxy</b> 2 is small. In the DMHP, all HIP communications are handled in the new <b>proxy,</b> <b>proxy</b> 2.
