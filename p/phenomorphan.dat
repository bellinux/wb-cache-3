50|$|<b>Phenomorphan</b> is {{a highly}} potent drug due to the N-phenethyl group, which boosts {{affinity}} to the μ-opioid receptor, and so <b>phenomorphan</b> is around 10x more potent than levorphanol, which is itself 6-8x the potency of morphine. Other analogues where the N-(2-phenylethyl) group {{has been replaced by}} other aromatic rings. are even more potent, with the N-(2-(2-furyl)ethyl) and the N-(2-(2-thienyl)ethyl) analogues being 60x and 45x stronger than levorphanol, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenomorphan</b> is an opioid analgesic. It is not {{currently}} used in medicine, but has similar side-effects to other opiates, which include itching, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|N-Phenethylnordesomorphine is an opiate {{analgesic}} drug derived from desomorphine by replacing the N-methyl group with β-phenethyl. Since desomorphine is already around eight times more potent than morphine, the additional boost in binding affinity produced {{by using the}} larger phenethyl group makes N-phenethylnordesomorphine a highly potent {{analgesic drug}}, some 85x more potent than morphine, and a similar strength to the closely related morphinan derivative <b>phenomorphan.</b>|$|E
