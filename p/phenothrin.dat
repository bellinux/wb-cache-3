50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, <b>phenothrin,</b> barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E

40|$|Since Varroa mites {{may cause}} devastating losses of honey bees through direct feeding, {{transmitting}} diseases, and increasing pathogen susceptibility, chemical and mechanical practices commonly {{are used to}} reduce mite infestation. While miticide applications are typically the most consistent and efficacious Varroa mite management method, miticide-induced insecticide synergism in honey bees, {{and the evolution of}} resistance in Varroa mites are reasonable concerns. We treated colonies with the miticide amitraz (Apivar®), used IPM practices, or left some colonies untreated, and then measured the effect of different levels of mite infestations on the sensitivity of bees to <b>phenothrin,</b> amitraz, and clothianidin. Sensitivity to all insecticides varied throughout the year among and within treatment groups. Clothianidin sensitivity decreased with increasing mite levels, but no such correlation was seen with <b>phenothrin</b> or amitraz. These results show that insecticide sensitivity is dynamic throughout the 5 months test. In-hive amitraz treatment according to the labeled use did not synergize sensitivity to the pesticides tested and this should alleviate concern over potential synergistic effects. Since IPM practices were largely ineffective at reducing Varroa mite infestation, reliance on chemical methods of Varroa mite management is likely to continue. However, miticides must be used judiciously so the long term effectiveness of these compounds can be maximized. These data demonstrate the complex and dynamic variables that contribute to honey bee colony health. The results underscore the importance of controlling for as many of these variables as possible in order to accurately determine the effects of each of these factors as they act alone or in concert with others...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{regulations}} and bans {{regarding the use}} of traditional toxic chemicals against marine fouling organisms and the practical impediments to the commercialization of natural product antifoulants, there is an urgent need for compounds that are antifouling-active, environmentally friendly, and have a potential for commercial application. In this study, a series of common, commercially available pyrethroid products, which are generally used as environmentally safe insecticides, was evaluated for antifouling activity in the laboratory using an anti-settlement test with cyprids of the barnacle Balanus albicostatus and also in a field experiment. Laboratory assay showed that all eleven pyrethroids (namely, rich d-trans-allethrin, Es-biothrin, rich d-prallethrin, S-prallethrin, tetramethrin, rich d-tetramethrin, <b>phenothrin,</b> cyphenothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, and high active cypermethrin) were able to inhibit barnacle settlement (EC 50 range of 0. 0316 to 87. 00 mu g/ml) without significant toxicity. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggested that the cyano group at the alpha-carbon position had a significant influence on the expression of antifouling activity in pyrethroids. In the field, the antifouling activity of pyrethroids was further confirmed, with the most potent pyrethroids being cypermethrin and high active cypermethrin, which displayed efficiency comparable with that of tributyltin. In summary, our investigation indicated that these pyrethroids have a great and practical commercial potential as antifouling agents.

40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} and environmentally friendly analytical methodology is proposed for extracting and preconcentrating pyrethroids from water samples prior to gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NCI-MS) analysis. Fourteen pyrethroids {{were selected for}} this work: bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, λ-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenvalerate, fenpropathrin, τ-fluvalinate, permethrin, <b>phenothrin,</b> resmethrin, tetramethrin and tralomethrin. The method is based on ultrasound-assisted emulsification-extraction (UAEE) of a water-immiscible solvent in an aqueous medium. Chloroform was used as extraction solvent in the UAEE technique. Target analytes were quantitatively extracted achieving an enrichment factor of 200 when 20 mL aliquot of pure water spiked with pyrethroid standards was extracted. The method was also evaluated with tap water and river water samples. Method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0. 03 to 35. 8 ng L− 1 with RSDs values ≤ 3 – 25 % (n = 5). The coefficients of estimation of the calibration curves obtained following the proposed methodology were ≥ 0. 998. Recovery values were {{in the range of}} 45 – 106 %, showing satisfactory robustness of the method for analyzing pyrethroids in water samples.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 4 {{different}} pyrethroid insecticides on sodium channel gating in internally perfused, cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (N 1 E- 115) were studied using the suction pipette, voltage clamp technique. Pyrethroids increased the amplitude of the sodium current, sometimes {{by more than}} 200 %. Activation of the sodium current occurred at more hyperpolarized potentials than under control conditions. The declining phase of the sodium current during depolarization was markedly slowed down and after repolarization of the membrane a large, slowly decaying sodium tail current developed. Pyrethroids {{did not affect the}} sodium current reversal potential, steady-state sodium inactivation or recovery from sodium channel inactivation. The amplitude of the pyrethroid-induced slow tail current was always proportional to the sodium current {{at the end of the}} preceding depolarizing pulse. The rate of decay of the slow tail current strongly depended on pyrethroid structure and increased in the order deltamethrin, cyphenothrin, fenfluthrin and <b>phenothrin.</b> The rate of decay further depended on membrane potential and temperature. Below − 85 mV the instantaneous current-voltage relationship of the slow tail current showed a negative slope conductance. The tail current decayed more slowly at low temperatures. Arrhenius plots indicated that the relaxation of open sodium channels to a closed state involved a higher energy barrier for pyrethroid-affected than for normal channels. The energy barrier was higher after deltamethrin than after the non-cyano pyrethroid fenfluthrin. It is concluded that in mammalian neuronal membrane pyrethroids selectively reduce the rate of closing of sodium channels both during depolarization and after repolarization of the nerve membrane...|$|E

In this study, the pyrethroid metabolites in workers' urine samples were monitored {{for the first}} time with a novel sample pretreatment process combining hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and in-syringe derivatization (ISD) followed by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) analysis. A micro-syringe pre-filled with derivatizing agents and syringe needle connected to an extracting solvent impregnated hollow fiber segment was used as the LPME probe. Pyrethroid metabolites were extracted and enriched simultaneously from urine samples by HF-LPME sampling and acid hydrolysis at 70 A degrees C for 10 min. After sampling, the ISD was performed by mixing the extracting solution and derivatizing agents through plunger movements, followed by GC-ECD analysis. Parameters influencing the HF-LPME efficiency and ISD were investigated and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the method provided enrichment factors of 69. 8 - 154. 6, repeatability from 5. 0 to 12 % (n = 5), and good linearity (R (2) = 0. 9980 - 0. 9998) for interested analytes spiked in urine samples. The method detection limits ranged from 1. 6 to 17 ng/mL. A comparison was performed between the proposed method and conventional methods. The proposed method was applied to analyze pyrethroid metabolites in the urine samples collected from workers of pesticide formulation plants.

40|$|Five commercially {{available}} insect sprays were applied {{in a model}} room. Spraying was performed {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers' instructions and in an overdosed manner in order to simulate worst-case conditions or an unforeseeable Misuse. In addition, we examined electro-vaporizers. The Respicon (TM) aerosol monitoring system was applied to determine inhalation exposure. During normal spraying (10 seconds) and during the following 2 - 3 minutes, exposure concentrations ranged from 70 to 590 mu g/m(3) for the pyrethroids tetramethrin, d-phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bloallethrin, and the pyrethrins. Calculated inhalable doses were 2 - 16 mu g. A concentration of approximately 850 mu g chlorpyrifos/m(3) (inhalable dose: approximately 20 mu g) was determined when the "Contra insect fly spray" was applied. Highest exposure concentrations (1100 - 2100 mu g/m(3)) were measured for piperonyl butoxide (PBO), corresponding to an inhalation intake of 30 - 60 mu g. When simulating worst-case conditions, exposure concentrations of 200 - 3400 mu g/m(3) and inhalable doses of 10 - 210 mu g were determined for the various active substances. Highest concentrations (4800 - 8000 mu g/m(3)) were measured for PBO (inhalable: 290 - 480 mu g). By applying the electro-vaporizer "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations for d-allethrin were in the range of 5 - 12 mu g/m(3) and 0. 5 - 2 mu g/m(3) for PBO while with the "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations of 0. 4 - 5 mu g/m(3) for pyrethrins and 1 - 7 mu g/m(3) for PBO were measured. Potential dermal exposures were determined using exposure pads. Between 80 and 1000 mu g active substance (tetramethrin, <b>phenothrin,</b> cyfluthrin, bioallethrin, pyrethrins, chlorpyrifos) were deposited on the clothing of the total body surface area of the spray user. Highest levels (up to 3000 mu g) were determined for PBO. Worst-case uses of the sprays led to 5 - 9 times higher concentrations. Also a 2 -hour stay nearby an operating electro-vaporizer led to a contamination of the clothing (total amounts on the whole body were 450 mu g d-allethrin and 50 mu g PBO for "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer and 80 mu g pyrethrins and 190 mu g PBO for "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer). Human blomonitoring data revealed urine concentrations of the metabolite (E) -trans-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid ((E) -trans-CDCA) between 1. 7 mu g/l and 7. 1 mu g/l after 5 minutes of exposure to the different sprays. Also the use of electro-vaporizers led to (E) -trans-CDCA concentrations in the urine in the range of 1. 0 mu g/l to 6. 2 mu g/l (1 - 3 hours exposure period).

The results showed that the tested chemicals were very effective in controlling eggs, larvae and pupae at laboratory. By making use of the preference of F. taiwana, they could be trapped by physical control with a artificial blood membrane added by human blood and lactic acid, black flannelette spread by human perspiration all of which were placed 100 cm above the ground at 39 ℃ water bath. The midge would also approach to CO 2 mixed with human breath and dry ice. Based on these observations, an auto trap for F. taiwana was invented. When comparing the effectiveness of different sources of CO 2 that the trap adopted, CO 2 discharged from a steel tube was better than that from other resources. Heater did not influence the trapping effect of CO 2. As for colors of background of the sucker, black, yellow, blue and green were more effective in attracting the midge than brown, red, dark red and white. Regarding the proper distance of the trap from the ground, it could attracted more adults at 40 - 70 cm above the ground but not at all beyond 230 cm. The best CO 2 discharged rate was 200 and 500 ml/min especially when the discharge exit was placed at 15 - 20 cm from the fan blades. When the wind blowing rate was higher than 2. 2 m/s, no midge could be caught. However, when it was under 0. 5 m/s, the numbers greatly increased. When three sets of traps were placed in areas with high density of the midge for a long time, the mean numbers of the midge they caught were 346. 7, 422. 7 and 327. The investigation of the density of daily population presence by the trap found that the peak appeared from 16 : 00 to 17 : 00, the result being {{similar to that of the}} study by the human body. 化學防治台灣鋏蠓時，利用有機磷劑 Chlorpyrifos，Fenitrothion ，Malathion，Primiphos-methyl、除蟲菊精之 Permethrin、以及 IGR 類之 Pyriproxyfen 和 Diflubenzuron 等作為室內試驗防治台灣鋏蠓卵 、幼蟲及蛹之藥劑，對卵之 LC 50 分別為 0. 04874 ， 0. 00076 ， 0. 21142 ， 0. 01733 ， 0. 22478 ， 0. 08719 及 0. 06333 (% concentration = mg A.

I. / ml) ，結果顯示在室內試驗各種環境衛生用藥，分別對卵、 幼蟲、蛹或成蟲都有極佳的效果。 利用台灣鋏蠓雌蟲嗜吸人血的行為 及偏好性實施物理防治，以水浴 39 ℃模擬人體溫度、人工吸血器加人類 血液及乳酸、黑色絨布加人類汗水在離地面 100 cm 以下可誘集到台灣鋏 蠓；而以人呼吸之氣，乾冰及CO 2 亦可使台灣鋏蠓趨近氣體散發處，綜合 此類各種的因子，而製作發展出間隔式台灣鋏蠓之自動誘集器。以此誘集 器為條件，比較不同來源的CO 2 時，以CO 2 （鋼瓶裝）效果最好；當溫度 與CO 2 協力作用誘集台灣鋏蠓時，蟲數並無顯著差異；比較朝下抽風風扇 板顏色之影響，以黑、黃、藍及綠色較佳，而以土黃、紅、深紅及白色較 差；在不同高度誘集時，以 40 cm 及 70 cm 誘集蟲數較多，超過 230 cm 時則誘集不到蟲；比較CO 2 釋放率時以 200 及 500 ml/min 誘集效果 最佳，並且此CO 2 釋放口以距抽氣板 15 - 20 cm 時誘集效果最好；環境風 速大於 2. 2 m/s 時誘集器誘不到蟲，而小於 0. 5 m/s 則蟲數明顯較多； 當誘集器長時間在高密度地區誘集時，每誘集器 3 hr 平均可分別誘集到 346. 7 、 422. 7 及 327 隻之台灣鋏蠓；在以誘集器調查台灣鋏蠓日週期方 面，發現其活動高峰落在午後四時半至五時間，與人體誘集情況相同...|$|E
