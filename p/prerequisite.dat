40|$|The {{following}} {{provides for}} the establishing, reviewing, and challenging of <b>prerequisites,</b> co-requisites, advisories on recommended preparation, and certain limitations on enrollment {{in a manner consistent}} with law and good practice. If <b>prerequisites,</b> co-requisites, advisories, and limitations are established unnecessarily or inappropriately, they constitute unjustifiable obstacles to student access and success. Therefore, this procedure calls for caution and careful scrutiny in establishing them. Nonetheless, it is as important to have <b>prerequisites</b> in place where they are a vital factor in maintaining academic standards as it is to avoid establishing <b>prerequisites</b> where they are not needed. For these reasons, the El Camino College District has sought to foster the appropriate balance between these two concerns. 1. Information in the Catalog and Schedule of Courses.

40|$|Abstract Continuous {{software}} engineering (CSE) {{is used for}} customer experiments and repetitive integrated processes within and between business planning and software development. First, this paper defines a new framework, called CRUSOE, for analysing CSE <b>prerequisites.</b> The framework allows for a more precise analysis of the interrelations and estimation {{of the changes that}} are <b>prerequisites</b> for moving from traditional product development to CSE. CRUSOE addresses <b>prerequisites</b> associated with and interdependencies among (1) the strategy, (2) architecture and (3) organisation. Second, this paper describes a case study conducted as part of a smartphone platform project to investigate the CSE <b>prerequisites</b> for product-focused software development. The results are synthesised together with recent related studies using the CRUSOE framework. The findings confirm challenges in moving towards CSE in embedded system development. Moreover, context-specific <b>prerequisites</b> should be considered, while it is still unclear as to how CSE can be systematically applied to the non-website development context...|$|R

5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a <b>prerequisite</b> for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

40|$|Canada is {{a leader}} in {{developing}} health promotion con-cepts of providing the <b>prerequisites</b> of health through health-promoting public policy. But Canada is clearly a laggard in implementing these concepts. In contrast, France is seen as a nation in which health promotion con-cepts have failed to gain much traction yet evidence exists that France does far better than Canada in providing these health <b>prerequisites.</b> Such findings suggest that it is the political economy—or form of the welfare state—of a nation rather than its explicit commitments to health pro-motion concepts—that shape provision of the prerequi-sites of health. Part 1 of this article examines how health promotion rhetoric specifically concerned with provision of the <b>prerequisites</b> of health differs among nations identified as being either liberal, social democratic, con-servative or Latin welfare states. Governing authorities of nations that are liberal or social democratic welfare states are more likely to make explicit rhetorical commitments to provision of the <b>prerequisites</b> of health, the conservative and Latin states less so. Part 2 of this article provides evi-dence however, that despite their rhetorical commitments to provision of the <b>prerequisites</b> of health, liberal welfare state nations fall well behind not only the social democrat-ic nations, but also the conservative welfare states in implementing public policies that provide the <b>prerequisites</b> of health. The Latin welfare states express little commit-ment to provision of the <b>prerequisites</b> of health and rather limited public policy activity towards meeting this aim. Key words: government programmes; health policy; public healt...|$|R

5|$|A <b>prerequisite</b> {{for natural}} {{selection}} {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a <b>prerequisite</b> of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent on critical matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E

As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a <b>prerequisite</b> of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a <b>prerequisite</b> to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary <b>prerequisite</b> to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
