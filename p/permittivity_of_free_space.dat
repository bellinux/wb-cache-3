Titration curves (dependence of ζ to the pH) were recorded in 0.001  mol/L biologically relevant media, in particular: sodium chloride saline solution (NaCl, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium chloride saline solution buffered with Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS, Alfa Aesar), phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS, tablets, Sigma-Aldrich), and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, GlutaMAX Supplement, Life Technologies). The influence of the electrolytic concentration on the ζ measurements was verified by systematically varying the molarity of the TRIS-buffered NaCl saline solution from 0.001  mol/L up to 0.1  mol/L.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hexanoyl {{chitosan}} exhibited solubility in tetrahydrofuran (THF) {{was prepared}} by acyl modification of chitosan. Polystyrene with molecular weight 280, 000 g mol- 1 {{was chosen to}} blend with hexanoyl chitosan. LiCF 3 SO 3 was employed as the doping salt. Untreated and H 2 SO 4 treated TiO 2 was added as the filler. Films of hexanoyl chitosan-polystyrene-LiCF 3 SO 3 -TiO 2 polymer electrolyte were obtained by solution casting technique. The ac conductivity {{of the sample was}} calculated from the relation σac = εoεiω, where εo is the <b>permittivity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> the angular frequency, ω= 2 πf, and εi is the dielectric loss. The ac conductivity dispersion observed is analyzed using the Jonsher’s universal power law, σ(ω) = σdc + Aω n where A is a pre-exponential constant and n is the power law exponent with value in the range 0 < n < 1. The temperature dependence of exponent n will then be interpreted using the existing theoretical models...|$|R

Comparing with the nanocrystal {{density of the}} above samples presented in Table 1, {{it is evident that}} the numbers of charges stored per nanocrystal are around 4, 27, 1, and 4 for the samples A- 800, A- 900, F- 800, and F- 900, respectively. For sample F- 900, with average nanocrystal diameter 3.9 nm, the charge stored per nanocrystal is one due to prominent Coulomb blockade effect in small clusters. Whereas for other samples with larger diameter, there are more than one electron per nanocrystal due to reduced Coulomb repulsion. The number of stored charges per cluster is highest for the sample A- 900 with largest size (13 nm). The memory window and stored charge density is found to be significantly enhanced on increasing the annealing temperature (900 °C) for Ge nanocrystals embedded in Al 2 O 3 matrix as compared to that of HfO 2, making it attractive for nanocrystal flash memory applications.|$|R

40|$|The {{new concept}} of quantum wave-impedance (QWI), Z is {{introduced}} {{to answer the}} question whether there is impedance to a Schrodinger wave. Z will be an analogue <b>of</b> Maxwell's <b>free</b> <b>space</b> impedance (376. 7 ohm) for electromagnetic waves. We show, for free particle wave function, the value of Z is in general not zero and purely real (resistive). As in quantum hall (QHE), Z can be expressed in terms of the fine structure constant, the electromagnetic <b>permittivity</b> and permeability <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> Z is a determinant of the partitioning and flow of charge and energy transported by the quantum system. The scale factor of Z is about 12. 9 kilo-ohms (per spin), so the corresponding wave conductance G is (77. 5 micro-mho, per spin) double the unit of Landaur conductance. As functions of the quantum numbers (l,m,n) Z shows, peaks, valleys and plateaus; also as in QHE, both integer and fractional steps may be obtained. In microwave and optical technology, conventional impedance is an essential parameter. The quantum impedance defined here will be no exception in future technology. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Bioenerg. 22 : 289 - 298) have {{described}} a novel design {{for measuring the}} complete dielectrophoretic spectrum of a single cell. From {{the analysis of the}} dielectrophoretic spectrum, the membrane conductivity, sigma membr, and the membrane dielectric <b>permittivity,</b> epsilon membr, <b>of</b> the cell may be determined according to the theory of dielectrophoresis described by Sauer, F. A. (1985. Interactions between Electromagnetic Field and Cells. A. Chiabrera, C. Nicolini, and H. P. Schwan, editors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York. 181 - 202). At Fo, the net force experienced by a single shell sphere in a nonuniform periodic field is zero, and the sphere ceases to move in the field. In other words, at Fo, the effective polarizability, chi eff, of the sphere (the polarizability of sphere minus the polarizability of the medium) is equal to zero. For biological cells in high conductivity medium, e. g., the isotonic saline, sigma membr falls below 2 x 10 (- 6) S m- 1, where Fo becomes insensitive to sigma membr, and the method becomes impractical. In a low conductivity medium, 0. 3 M sucrose, sigma membr of cells is generally higher and the method may be applied. Assuming a membrane thickness of 9 nm, epsilon membr of Neurospora crassa slime cells was determined to be in the range of 8. 3 - 9. 4 epsilon o, and of myeloma Tib 9 to be 9. 4 epsilon o, epsilon o being the dielectric <b>permittivity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> The values for the slime cells were compared with values obtained by the dielectric spectroscopy method which measures average values for cells in suspension...|$|R
40|$|The usual {{definition}} of the fine structure constant (alpha) is written as e^ 2 /(4 pi epsilon 0 hcross c). In actual fact the constant could be represented in many ways depending on which fundamental constants are chosen. Because alpha is an electromagnetic constant, I choose to represent {{it in terms of}} only electromagnetic constants, such as the quantum of electric charge, the quantum of magnetic flux, and the <b>permittivity</b> and permeability <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> In the light of this alternative definition, I discuss recent conjecture that the possible implied drift in the alpha could be due to the drift in the speed of light, or other dimensional constants. I show that the drift in alpha would manifest due to a differential change in the ratio of electric and magnetic quanta of energy. While the change in dimensional constants, c and hcross, depend on a common mode change. The drift could be either due to quantum or classical effects. This work shows that a changing fine structure constant does not directly imply that either c or hcross will also drift. If conservation of electromagnetic energy is invoked, I show that alpha will drift if magnetic energy is converted to electrical energy, or vice versa, with no corresponding drift in hcross*c. Conversely, if the conservation of electromagnetic energy is violated, one would expect a drift in hc, which would cause the energy of the quantum vacuum to drift, causing a drift of the Casimir Force...|$|R
