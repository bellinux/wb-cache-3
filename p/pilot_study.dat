5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E

40|$|Estimating {{population}} {{effect size}} accurately and precisely plays {{a vital role}} in achieving a desired level of statistical power as well as drawing correct conclusions from empirical results. While a number of common practices of effect-size estimation have been documented (e. g., relying on one’s experience and intuition, and conducting <b>pilot</b> <b>studies),</b> their relative advantages and disadvantages have been insufficiently investigated. To establish a practical guideline for researchers in this respect, this project compared the accuracy and precision of effect-size estimation, resulting power, and economic implications across pilot and non-pilot conditions. Furthermore, to model the potential advantages of <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> in finding and correcting flaws before main studies are run, varying amounts of random error variance and varying degrees of success at its removal – often neglected aspects in simulation studies – were introduced in Experiment 2. The main findings include the following. First, <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> with up to 30 subjects were utterly ineffective in achieving the desired power of 0. 80 at a small population effect size even under the best-case scenario. At this effect size intuitive estimation without <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> appears to be the preferred method of achieving the desired power. Second, the <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> performed better at medium and large population effect sizes, achieving comparable or even greater power to that in the non-pilot condition. The relative advantages of <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> were particularly evident when moderate to large error variances were present, and a portion of it had been removed through conducting <b>pilot</b> <b>studies.</b> These broad findings are discussed in the context of flexible design: study design can be modified flexibly in accordance with the researcher’s particular goals.

50|$|Most {{researchers}} {{attempt to}} test the construct validity before the main research. To do this <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> may be utilized. <b>Pilot</b> <b>studies</b> are small scale preliminary studies aimed at testing the feasibility of a full-scale test. These <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> establish {{the strength of their}} research and allow them to make any necessary adjustments. Another method is the known-groups technique, which involves administering the measurement instrument to groups expected to differ due to known characteristics. Hypothesized relationship testing involves logical analysis based on theory or prior research. Intervention studies are yet another method of evaluating construct validity. Intervention studies where a group with low scores in the construct is tested, taught the construct, and then re-measured can demonstrate a tests construct validity. If there is a significant difference pre-test and post-test, which are analyzed by statistical tests, then this may demonstrate good construct validity.|$|R
