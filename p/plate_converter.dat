40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} and successfully tested {{a prototype of}} a new high position resolution hybrid X-ray detector. It contains a thin-wall lead glass capillary <b>plate</b> <b>converter</b> of X-rays combined with a microgap parallel-plate avalanche chamber operating in various gas mixtures at 1 atm. The operation of these converters was studied {{in a wide range}} of X-ray energies (from 6 to 60 keV) at incident angles varying from 0 – 90. The detection efficiency, depending on the geometry, photon’s energy, incident angle and the mode of operation was between 5 – 30 % in single step mode and up to 50 % in a multi-layered combination. Depending on the capillary’s geometry, the position resolution achieved was between 50 – 250 m in digital form and was practically independent of the photon’s energy or gas mixture. The usual lead glass capillary plates operated without noticeable charging up effects at counting rates of 50 Hz/mm 2 and hydrogen treated capillaries—up to 105 Hz/mm 2. The developed detector has several important potential advantages over the exciting X-ray detectors and may open new possibilities for medical imaging, for example in mammography, portal imaging, radiography (including security devices), as well as many other applications.

40|$|The first {{epithermal neutron}} beam at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) was {{installed}} in 1988 and produced a neutron beam that was satisfactory {{for the development of}} NCT with epithermal neutrons. This beam was used routinely until 1992 when the beam was upgraded by rearranging fuel elements in the reactor core to achieve a 50 % increase in usable flux. Next, after computer modeling studies, it was proposed that the Al and Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } moderator material in the shutter that produced the epithermal neutrons could be rearranged to enhance the beam further. However, this modification was not started because a better option appeared, namely to use fission plates to move the source of fission neutrons closer to the moderator and the patient irradiation position to achieve more efficient moderation and production of epithermal neutrons. A fission <b>plate</b> <b>converter</b> (FPC) source has been designed recently and, to test the concept, implementation of this upgrade has started.

The microscope chamber was pumped down to the background pressure of 10 − 6 Pa by cryogenic pumps. Field ion images were formed by using helium atoms under a pressure of 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 Pa. A channel <b>plate</b> image <b>converter</b> [10] was used for FIM image intensification. A continuous set of FIM was recorded by a charge-coupled device camera. The specimens were prepared from 0.15 -mm ultrafine-grained tungsten wires of 99.98 at.% (0.01 at.% Si, 0.002 at.% Fe, 0.005 at.% Mo) with a < 110 >[*]axial texture, which had been manufactured by drawing 10 -cm metal-ceramic rods at 700 – 770  K. The drawn tungsten wire has a nanoscale fiber structure (an average fiber diameter is about 100  nm). Needle-shaped specimens (field emitter tips) with an initial radius of the curvature of about 20  nm at their top were made by electrolytic polishing the wires in 1  N NaOH aqueous solution at alternating voltage of 4 – 10  V.

Results for the fission converter, the neutron filters and the collimator are presented. In the {{analyses of the}} fast neutron filter/moderator and collimator designs, great emphasis was laid on in-phantom figures of merit using a water-filled ellipsoidal head phantom to evaluate beam performance. In addition, various neutronic calculations required for the engineering design (e. g., reactivity insertion due to the fission converter) were performed. This study intensively employed the general purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) for the analyses. In the sensitivity analysis of the fission converter design, the effect of using different fuel configurations (multi-plate reactor type MITR-II fuel vs. single plate type fuel) was examined with the expectation that the reduced volume fraction of coolant in the single <b>plate</b> fuel fission <b>converter</b> might offset the disadvantage of the H 2 0 coolant which overmoderates a useful portion of the neutron spectrum without commensurate reduction of fast contamination...|$|R

40|$|Currently film {{is being}} {{replaced}} by electronic detectors for portal imaging in radiation therapy. This development offers obvious advantages such as on-line quality assurance and digital images that can easily be accessed, processed and communicated. In spite of the improvements, the image quality has not been significantly enhanced, partly since the quantum efficiency compared to film is essentially the same, and the new electronic devices also suffer from sensitivity to the harsh radiation environment. In this thesis we propose a third generation electronic portal imaging device with increased quantum efficiency and potentially higher image quality. Due to the parallel readout capability it is much faster than current devices, providing at least 200 frames per second (fps), and would even allow for a quality assurance and adaptive actions after each accelerator pulse. The new detector is also sensitive over {{a broader range of}} energies (10 keV - 50 MeV) and can be used to obtain diagnostic images immediately prior to the treatment without repositioning the patient. The imaging could be in the form of portal imaging or computed tomography. The new detector is based on a sandwich design containing several layers of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in combination with, or integrated with, perforated <b>converter</b> <b>plates.</b> The charge created by the ionizing radiation is drifted {{to the bottom of the}} assembly where a tailored readout system collects and digitizes the charge. The new readout system is further designed in such a way that no sensitive electronics is placed in the radiation beam and the detector is expected to be radiation resistant since it consists mainly of kapton, copper and gas. A single GEM detector was responding linearly when tested with a 50 MV photon beam at a fluence rate of ~ 1010 photons mm- 2 s- 1 during 3 - 5 μs long pulses, but also with x-ray energies of 10 - 50 keV at a fluence rate of up to ~ 108 photons mm- 2 s- 1. The electron transmission of a 100 μm thick Cu plate with an optical transparency of ~ 46 % was found to be ~ 15. 4 %, i. e. the effective hole transmission for the electrons was about one third of the hole area. A low effective GEM gain is enough to compensate for the losses in converters of this dimension. A prototype for the dedicated electronic readout system was designed with 50 x 100 pixels at a pitch of 1. 27 mm x 1. 27 mm. X-ray images were achieved with a single GEM layer and also in a double GEM setup with a <b>converter</b> <b>plate</b> interleaved. To verify the readout speed a Newton pendulum was imaged at a frame rate of 70 fps and alpha particles were imaged in 188 fps.

Use of approximating neuron nets will allow to definite the deflected mode of constructions elements using noticeably less computing facilities then by using universal methods, finite-element method for instance. Today neuron nets are used for calculation separate elements of building constructions. In this work use of neuron nets for calculation deflected mode of construction which consists of many elements is consider.

40|$|Current γ-ray telescopes {{suffer from}} a gap in {{sensitivity}} in the energy range between 100 keV and 100 MeV, and no polarisation measurement has ever been done on cosmic sources above 1 MeV. Past and present e^+e^- pair telescopes are limited at lower energies by the multiple scattering of electrons in passive tungsten <b>converter</b> <b>plates.</b> This results in low angular resolution, and, consequently, a drop in sensitivity to point sources below 1 GeV. The polarisation information, which is carried by the azimuthal angle of the conversion plane, is lost for the same reasons. HARPO (Hermetic ARgon POlarimeter) is an R&D program to characterise the operation of a gaseous detector (a Time Projection Chamber or TPC) as a high angular-resolution and sensitivity telescope and polarimeter for γ rays from cosmic sources. It represents a first step towards a future space instrument in the MeV-GeV range. We built and characterised a 30 cm cubic demonstrator [SPIE 91441 M], {{and put it in}} a polarised γ-ray beam at the NewSUBARU accelerator in Japan.

40|$|The Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, BMRR, is a 3 MW heterogeneous, tank-type, {{light water}} cooled and moderated, {{graphite}} reflected reactor, {{which was designed}} for biomedical studies. Early BNL work in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) used a beam of thermal neutrons for experimental treatment of brain tumors. Research elsewhere and at BNL indicated that higher energy neutrons {{would be required to}} treat deep seated brain tumors. Epithermal neutrons would be thermalized as they penetrated the brain and peak thermal neutron flux densities would occur at the depth of brain tumors. One of the two BMRR thermal port shutters was modified in 1988 to include plates of aluminum and aluminum oxide to provide an epithermal port. Lithium carbonate in polyethylene was added in 1991 around the bismuth port to reduce the neutron flux density coming from outside the port. To enhance the epithermal neutron flux density, the two vertical thimbles A- 3 (core edge) and E- 3 (in core) were replaced with fuel elements. There are now four fuel elements of 190 grams each and 28 fuel elements of 140 grams each for a total of 4. 68 kg of {sup 235 }U in the core. The authors have proposed replacing the epithermal shutter with a fission <b>converter</b> <b>plate</b> shutter. It is estimated that the new shutter would increase the epithermal neutron flux density by a factor of seven and the epithermal/fast neutron ratio by a factor of two.

Radiation workers are monitored via a TLD badge and a self-reading dosimeter during each experiment.
