25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to answer them personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E
500|$|Garnet {{highlighted}} {{the date of}} his execution, 3 May, the Feast of the Cross, and reaffirmed his innocence. He defended Anne Vaux against claims that their relationship had been inappropriate. He then prayed {{at the base of}} the ladder, disrobed down to his long, sewn-up shirt, [...] "that the wind might not blow it up", and mounted the ladder. He ignored a Protestant minister who came forward, replying to an objectionable member of the audience that he [...] "ever meant to die a true but perfect Catholic". Bishop Overal protested that [...] "we are all Catholics", although Garnet disagreed with this. He once again said his prayers, and was then thrown off the ladder. [...] Before the executioner could cut him down alive, many in the crowd <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> legs, and as a result, Garnet did not suffer the remainder of his grim sentence. There was no applause when the executioner held Garnet's heart aloft and said the traditional words, [...] "Behold the heart of a traitor". His head was set on a pole on London Bridge, but crowds of onlookers fascinated by its pallid appearance eventually forced the government to turn the head upwards, so its face was no longer visible.|$|E
2500|$|Just before Gwyn was hanged {{he turned}} to the crowd and said, [...] "I have been a jesting fellow, and if I have {{offended}} any that way, or by my songs, I beseech them for God's sake to forgive me." [...] The hangman <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> leg irons hoping to put him out of his pain. When he appeared dead they cut him down, but he revived and remained conscious through the disembowelling, until his head was severed. His last words, in Welsh, were reportedly [...] "" [...] ("Jesus, have mercy on me").|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-bye!" [...] said stout John Peerybingle, <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{dreadnought}} coat. [...] "I {{shall be}} back at the old time. Good-bye all!" ...|$|R

60|$|Joe {{had just}} {{time to give}} four <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lines, and then fainted. He was {{instantly}} hauled up, carefully unrobed, and put to bed.|$|R
6000|$|To {{my great}} {{surprise}} no further word was spoken regarding the plan; but Captain Hanaford <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> oiled-coat {{as he said}} curtly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To--om! To--om!" [...] {{cried the}} elderly woman, with a long, unnatural, {{penetrating}} call that chilled {{her son to}} the marrow. He quickly <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots and his coat.|$|E
60|$|Beasley {{spread his}} hands once more over the blaze, <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> gloves and pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode out into the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you won't go, I will," [...] said Hamilton coolly, as he unwound {{the blanket}} from {{his feet and}} began to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> socks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not running}} away," [...] he replied with child-like defiance, {{at the same}} time <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mittens. [...] "I'm only going to get some water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{finish this}} beer,' said Martin, handing him the mug, and <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat with great alacrity; 'and {{let us be}} off {{as soon as you}} like.' ...|$|R
60|$|After dinner, {{faced with}} the {{ultimate}} experience of his own nothingness, he turned aside. He <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots, put on his coat, {{and set out to}} walk in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be switched!" [...] muttered Ike Furner. [...] "Thet's {{the strangest}} thing I ever hear tell on." [...] He <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> rough beard. [...] "Don't {{remember}} me a' tall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Syme with {{a forced}} cheerfulness as he <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> trousers, [...] "I dreamt of that {{alphabet}} of yours. Did {{it take you}} long to make it up?" ...|$|E
60|$|He held back, and her <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm {{could not}} move him. Almost was he tempted to tell her of the other woman beyond the south traverse.|$|R
60|$|Twitter {{was gone}} in a moment, and the old landlady {{returned}} to her lodger's room. There, to her surprise, she found Sammy up and hastily <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] quoth the archer, <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> clothes, [...] "I {{have come}} {{well out of}} the business. I would sooner wrestle with the great bear of Navarre." ...|$|R
6000|$|Smoke {{inserted}} the word [...] "good" [...] in the contract, and Wild Water sullenly signed, received the trial two dozen in a tin pail, <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mittens, {{and opened the}} door.|$|E
60|$|The pause which succeeds this {{outburst}} is {{the effect}} of a spasm of admiration at a pair of high boots, which, by great exertion, he has at last <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet.|$|E
60|$|He turned, {{rubbing his}} hands together, and drying them {{on an old}} cloth. He went into the house, <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat and his cap, {{and picked up the}} things from the table.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{he agreed}} to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots again and was named in Newtown squad for the New Year's Day trip to Welsh Premier League champions The New Saints.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{said the}} young man, rising and <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> overcoat. [...] "You {{have given me}} fresh life and hope. I shall {{certainly}} do as you advise." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{pushed his}} collar and tie into his {{overcoat}} pocket. Then {{he sat down}} and <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots. They were sodden, as were his socks and trouser-bottoms. But he himself was quick and warm.|$|E
60|$|Riggs made no reply, {{and went}} on rolling down his {{trousers}} leg, lapped a fold over {{at the bottom and}} <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boot. Then he strode out toward the promontory. Half-way there he encountered Anson tramping back.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} he had <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> vest and drawers, I came out {{suddenly}} from my ambush and faced him. A fresh shock awaited me. I could hardly believe my eyes. It was NOT Le Geyt--no, nor anything like him! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{got up and}} sat on {{the side}} of his bed. He was weak. He tried to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The {{sunlight}} was queer and cold.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{nothing that}} I knows on,' replied the man, <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> gloves. 'Corn's up a little. I heerd {{talk of a}} murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don't reckon much upon it.' ...|$|R
50|$|He {{has also}} played non-league {{football}} with Leek Town and Witton Albion. Sinclair {{in recent times}} has continued to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> gloves and regularly appears in charity games and alongside former teammates in the Masters series.|$|R
