50|$|There exist {{two main}} passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and {{it leads to}} four stable states with the long axis (axis with {{smallest}} moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet. These purely <b>passive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the optimal trajectories of a {{spacecraft}} subjected to a modulated radial thrust, whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the primary body.

As a result, the sailcraft optimal performance can be studied using an analytical approach. In particular, some compact relationships are drawn and discussed that allow one to find the optimal sailcraft characteristics required to reach a prescribed final orbit...|$|E
