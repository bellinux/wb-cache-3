50|$|The T-15 is a Russian (previously Soviet) {{nuclear fusion}} {{research}} reactor {{located at the}} Kurchatov Institute, {{which is based on}} the (Soviet-invented) tokamak design. It was the first industrial <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> to use superconducting magnets to control the plasma. These enormous superconducting magnets confined the plasma the reactor produced, but failed to sustain it for more than just a few seconds. Despite not being immediately applicable, this new technological advancement proved to the USSR that they were on the right path. In the original (circular cross-section with limiter) shape, a toroidal chamber design, it had a major radius of 2.43m and minor radius 0.7m.|$|E
40|$|DEMO is {{the name}} for the first stage <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> {{considered}} to be the next step after ITER towards realizing fusion. For the realization of fusion energy especially, materials questions pose a significant challenge already today. Heat, particle and neutron loads are a significant problem to material lifetime when extrapolating to DEMO. For many of the issues faced, advanced materials solutions are under discussion or already under development. In particular, components such as the first wall and the divertor of the reactor can benefit from introducing new approaches such as composites or new alloys into the discussion. Cracking, oxidation as well as fuel management are driving issues when deciding for new materials. Here W_f/W composites as well as strengthened CuCrZr components together with oxidation resilient tungsten alloys allow the step towards a fusion reactor. In addition, neutron induced effects such as transmutation, embrittlement and after-heat and activation are essential. Therefore, when designing a component an approach taking into account all aspects is required...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDEMO is {{the name}} for the first stage <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> {{considered}} to be the next step after ITER. For the realization of fusion energy especially materials questions pose a significant challenge already today. Advanced materials solution are under discussion in order to allow operation under reactor conditions [1] and are already under development used in the next step devices. Apart from issues related to material properties such as strength, ductility, resistance against melting and cracking one of the major issues to be tackled is the interaction with the fusion plasma. Advanced tungsten (W) materials as discussed below do not necessarily add additional lifetime issues, they will, however, add concerns related to erosion or surface morphology changes due to preferential sputtering. Retention of fuel and exhaust species are one of the main concerns. Retention of hydrogen {{will be one of the}} major issues to be solved in advanced materials as especially composites and alloys will introduce new hydrogen interactions mechanisms. Initial calculations show these mechanisms. Especially for Helium as the main impurity species material issues arise related to surfaces modification and embrittlement. Solutions are proposed to mitigate effects on material properties and introduce new release mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} step {{in the quest for}} low-cost fusion power is the ability to perform and analyze experiments in <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors.</b> One of the tasks in the analysis is the classification of orbits in Poincaré plots generated by the particles in a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> as they move within the toroidal device. In this paper, we describe the use of graph-based methods to extract features from orbits. These features are then used to classify the orbits into several categories.

50|$|To {{achieve its}} goals, DEMO must have linear {{dimensions}} about15% larger than ITER, and a plasma density about 30% greater than ITER. As a <b>prototype</b> commercial <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor,</b> DEMO could make fusion energy available by 2033. It {{is estimated that}} subsequent commercial <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors</b> could be built for {{about a quarter of}} the cost of DEMO.|$|R
50|$|Ideal MHD instabilities {{driven by}} current or {{pressure}} gradients representthe ultimate operational limit for most configurations. The long-wavelength kink mode and short-wavelengthballooning mode limits are generally well understood and can in principle be avoided.Intermediate-wavelength modes (n ~ 5 - 10 modes encountered in tokamak edge plasmas, forexample) are less well understood {{due to the}} computationally intensive nature of the stabilitycalculations. The extensive beta limit database for tokamaks is consistent with ideal MHD stability limits, yielding agreement to within about 10% in beta for cases where the internal profiles of theplasma are accurately measured. This good agreement provides confidence in ideal stabilitycalculations for other configurations and {{in the design of}} <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thermonuclear {{fusion power}} plants are a {{promising}} option {{to ensure the}} energy supply for future generations, but in many fields of research enormous challenges have to be faced. A major step {{on the way to}} the <b>prototype</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> DEMO will be ITER which is build in Cadarache, southern France. One of the most critical issues is the field of in-vessel materials and components, in particular the plasma facing materials (PFM). PFMs that will be used in a device like ITER have to withstand severe environmental conditions in terms of steady state and transient thermal loads as well as high particle fluxes such as hydrogen, helium and neutrons. Candidate wall materials are beryllium, tungsten and carbon based materials like CFC (carbon fibre composite). Tungsten is the most promising material for an application in the divertor region with very severe loading conditions and it will most probably also be used as PFM for DEMO. Hence, this work focuses on the investigation of the thermal shock response of different tungsten grades in order to understand the damage mechanisms and to identify material parameters which influence this behaviour under ITER and DEMO relevant operation conditions. Therefore the microstructure and the mechanical and thermal properties of five industrially manufactured tungsten grades were characterised. All five tungsten grades were exposed to transient thermal events with very high power densities of up to 1. 27 GW/m² at varying base temperatures between RT and 600 °C in the electron beam device JUDITH 1. The pulse numbers were limited to a maximum of 1000 in order to avoid immoderate workload on the test facility and to have enough time to cover a wide range of loading conditions. The results of this damage mapping enable to define different damage and cracking thresholds for the investigated tungsten grades and to identify certain material parameters which influence the location of these thresholds and the distinction of the induced damages. Furthermore the grain structure and the recrystallisation of the material have a significant influence on the thermal shock damage, especially the cracking pattern and surface roughening. Beside the thermal shock damage mapping tungsten was also successively exposed to steady state high flux hydrogen-plasma and to cyclic thermal shock events simulated with an electron beam. The induced damages were investigated to determine if the exposure to hydrogen-plasma has an influence on the thermal shock response of tungsten. Special attention was paid to the thermal shock crack parameters such as distance, width and depth. The investigations showed that there is a significant influence on the damage behaviour of tungsten, especially if the tungsten targets are pre-loaded with hydrogen plasma. Beside the sequence of the exposure also the surface temperature during the plasma loading shows a clear influence on the thermal shock behaviour. One of the most obvious changes is that due to the pre-exposure with hydrogen the thermal shock cracks are not limited to the electron beam loaded area anymore. They propagate through the only plasma loaded surface and even penetrate into the unexposed area at the edges of the tungsten targets. Additionally, all crack parameters decrease if the targets are pre-loaded with hydrogen plasma. The combination of these results shows that the thermal shock response of tungsten as a PFM is very complex and depends on a wide range of parameters. It can be very well characterised by electron beam tests, but it has to be taken into account that these tests only simulate thermal loads without any influence of particle exposure. The influence of high flux hydrogen-plasma exposure on the thermal shock behaviour of tungsten can be estimated based on the results obtained from successive loading experiments. They give a good overview of the expected damages on tungsten as a PFM. These damages on the surface of the materials which are induced by high power densities and in combination with particle fluxes are detrimental for the operation of next step fusion devices such as ITER and DEMO and will have significant impact on the operational limits for large pulse numbers of 1, 000, 000 or more as expected in ITER...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study on}} a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> core is {{presented}} in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF), including the heavy ion beam (HIB) transport in a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor,</b> a HIB interaction with a background gas, reactor cavity gas dynamics, the reactor gas backflow to the beam lines, and a HIB <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> design. The HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~ 30 - 40 %, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be ~ 50 to operate a HIF <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> with a standard energy output of 1 GW of electricity. In a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> the HIB charge neutralization is needed for a ballistic HIB transport.
