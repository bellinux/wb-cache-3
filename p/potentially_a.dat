5|$|Kepler-10c orbits {{its host}} star every forty-five {{days at a}} quarter of the average {{distance}} between the Sun and Earth. It has a radius more than double that of Earth, but a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5–20% ices by mass. For comparison, the Earth's oceans represent only 0.02% of our planet's mass, with an additional amount <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> few times this stored in the mantle.|$|E

5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though {{it is more likely that}} the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitions}} using two-legged matches, {{each team}} competes at home once, with an aggregate score {{from the two}} matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule {{may be used to}} determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> penalty shootout are required.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites {{have the potential for}} a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish {{and north}} English dialects have {{included}} ka or kae since the 14th century. The Midlands {{form of this}} word was co or coo. Caddow is <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> compound of ka and dow, a variant of daw. Other dialectal or obsolete names include caddesse, cawdaw, caddy, chauk, college-bird, jackerdaw, jacko, ka-wattie, chimney-sweep bird (from their nesting propensities), and sea-crow (from {{the frequency with which}} they are found on coasts). It was also frequently known quasi-nominally as Jack.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus was a hadrosaurid, part of {{a diverse}} family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus {{is known for its}} large, {{elaborate}} cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull. Charonosaurus from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> small slender skull.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E

5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would {{have the responsibility to}} draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and <b>potentially,</b> <b>a</b> form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E

25|$|By {{using the}} canal and east coast ports, <b>potentially</b> <b>a</b> lot of {{shipping}} expense for the rail portion to destinations can be saved. However, keys to shipping via the western versus eastern ports are facilities at the ports, better rail links inland, shipping times, and costs.|$|E
50|$|Cuba has {{a diverse}} and {{multicultural}} society {{and there is}} <b>potentially</b> <b>an</b> available arena for various forms of racial discrimination to grow.
