500|$|In an October 2013 SPIN {{magazine}} article—a reflection at the ten-year {{anniversary of}} Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was [...] "a sick man without his medicine" [...] {{during the last}} 31 days of his life, {{when he was not}} only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E

500|$|Dishonored {{takes place}} in the {{industrial}} city of Dunwall, where technology and otherworldly forces coexist. The city's design is modeled on London and Edinburgh between the late 1800s and the early 1900s. The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall, is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter. The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city. After a philosopher discovered that whale oil—known in the city as trans—can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption. The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as [...] "weepers", cry blood and can become violent. The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as [...] "Walls of Light", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> to cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a cosmetic touch, the hedges have proven to be an effective (though perhaps unintended) measure of crowd control. While not apparent in photos, the hedges are growing around a chain link fence which stops <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> to push through to the field. [...] Even though a major traffic path to exit the stadium from both stands runs directly alongside the hedges, fans have only stormed the field and torn down the goalposts once in the entire history of Sanford Stadium. [...] This occurred after the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on Oct. 7, 2000.|$|E

Horatio believes that [...] "evil is" [...] and lives [...] "between the perpetrators of this evil and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> and come between that evil and the citizen". In his pursuit of justice, he has proven that [...] "he can handle himself {{on the street and}} he's not a person to be messed with" [...] The New York Sun has described Caine as an amalgam of [...] "the spirits of all the laconic American law men who preceded him", while The New York Post describes Caine's partner Detective Calleigh Duquesne (Emily Procter) as [...] "a bilingual Southern beauty with a specialty in ballistics". Together, Horatio and Calleigh head a team of forensic investigators that includes Lieutenant Megan Donner (Kim Delaney), conceived as [...] "a strong woman [...] duplicate the chemistry that Caruso displayed with Marg Helgenberger" [...] during Cross Jurisdictions, Detective Eric Delko (Adam Rodriguez), an underwater recovery expert, Walter Simmons (Omar Miller), a Detective who forces the [...] "CSIs to do more science and research instead of relying on databases", Los Angeles Police-transfer Jesse Cardoza (Eddie Cibrian), former FBI agent Natalia Boa Vista (Eva LaRue), and Ryan Wolfe (Jonathan Togo), a master of genetics recruited following the death of Detective Timothy Speedle (Rory Cochrane).

2500|$|The {{award was}} criticised by some American and European Jewish groups, while other groups offered {{support for the}} award. Parties opposed to the award {{included}} AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, the European Jewish Congress, and John R. Bolton. John R. Bolton, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that those in the administration who recommended her either ignored her anti-Israel history, or missed it entirely. On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organizations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated [...] "as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, {{we do not see}} such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award." [...] In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was “surprised and dismayed” and that [...] "this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,” “I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to be on the side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,” Robinson said. [...] "There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> to address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism," [...] Robinson also said. In an open letter to Robinson, Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticize her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. [...] "You {{may not have been the}} chief culprit of the Durban debacle, but you will always be its preeminent symbol", he added. When asked about the opposition to the award by AIPAC and other Jewish groups, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied [...] "Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland, and she is somebody whom we are honoring as a prominent crusader of women's rights in Ireland and throughout the world." ...|$|E

6000|$|The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>try</b> to help, who {{gather up}} the Ghetto {{children}} {{and send them}} away on a day's outing to the country, believe that not very many children reach the age of ten without having {{had at least one}} day there.

Up to date he has sent out of the country 13,340 boys, most of them to Canada, and not one in fifty has failed.
