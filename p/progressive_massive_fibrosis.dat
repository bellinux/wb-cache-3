40|$|The {{dust content}} and {{composition}} of lesions and hilar lymph nodes from the lungs of British coalworkers have been examined. Samples of macules, fibrotic nodules, and <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (both peripheral and central sites) were dissected from 49 lungs. The highest mean dust concentrations (about 20 %) were found in nodules and <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Overall {{there were no significant}} differences between the selected lesion types and their respective whole lung dust composition, although the central sites of <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> were found to contain on average a higher proportion of coal and a lower proportion of ash and its measured constituents, quartz and kaolin plus mica, than the edge of the lesion (p less than 0. 001 for each component). There were striking differences between recovered lung and lymph node dusts. An examination of 180 specimens showed a mean quartz in lymph node dust of 20. 3 % compared with 6. 1 % in lung dust. As expected the proportion of quartz was greater in lymph nodes and lungs from men who had worked "low" rank (high ash) coal. By contrast with the corresponding figures for lung dusts, however, the mean proportion of quartz in nodes did not increase over the pathological range of pneumoconiotic lung disease. On average the proportions of kaolin and mica in lymph nodes reflect those found in lungs. The lymphotrophic nature of quartz was clearly shown although it was not possible to show an association between this clearance pathway and any particular type of lesion...|$|R

50|$|Continued {{exposure}} to coal dust following {{the development of}} simple CWP may progress to complicated CWP with <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (PMF), wherein large masses of dense fibrosis develop, usually in the upper lung zones, measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, with accompanying decreased lung function.

Pathologically, these consist of fibrosis with haphazardly-arranged collagen and many pigment-laden macrophages and abundant free pigment. Radiographically, CWP can appear strikingly similar to silicosis. In simple CWP, small rounded nodules (see ILO Classification) predominate, tending to first appear in the upper lung zones. The nodules may coalesce and form large opacities (>1 cm), characterizing complicated CWP, or PMF.|$|E
50|$|Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, {{develops}} {{after the}} initial, milder {{form of the}} disease known as anthracosis (anthrac — coal, carbon). This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellers due to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis and complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (or <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking. In nonsmokers (who are less prone to develop bronchitis than smokers), studies of coal miners have shown a 16% to 17% incidence of industrial bronchitis.|$|E

5000|$|TEOM is {{the basis}} for a {{continuous}} personal dust monitor (CPDM) for coal dust in mines, to protect workers from conditions leading to black lung disease and <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Prior to the introduction of CPDMs, dust particles collected on a filter needed to be analyzed in a laboratory, leading to a delay of weeks in obtaining results. Continuous monitoring allows miners to take corrective action such as moving to another area or changing their activities if dust levels exceed exposure limits. In one study this led to a 90% reduction in samples exceeding the dust exposure limit. [...] In February 2016, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mandated the use of CPDMs on working sections of underground coal mines, and for workers who have evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lungs from 123 coalworkers {{coming to}} {{necropsy}} were examined {{to determine the}} association between dust related changes in the central lymph nodes and <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and secondary foci in the lung parenchyma. Increasingly extensive changes of the central nodes were scored macroscopically, the highest scores indicating erosion through the walls of adjacent bronchi or branches of the pulmonary artery or both. In 88 cases (mainly with extensive changes) microscopic assessment was also made. Increasingly extensive changes of central nodes were asso-ciated {{with the presence of}} <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in the lungs (p < 0. 001) and the presence of secondary foci in lungs without <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (p < 0 - 03).

A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is proposed whereby dust, accumulating in central lymph nodes, leads eventually to spread through the capsule and rupture into bronchi or pulmonary vessels, thereby sending dust laden activated cells back into the lungs to produce <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> These preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis but more detailed studies are required.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two stonemasons working {{together}} in an environment with high concentrations of quartz pursued very different clinical courses; one died of rapidly progressive silicosis and the other developed hilar adenopathy and, later, early <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> The exposures to quartz of these two men were investigated to allow comment on the pathogenesis of severe silicosis relative to concentrations of dust. METHODS: Estimates of exposure were based on previously taken personal dust samples, detailed lifetime occupational histories, and semiquantitative exposure modelling. RESULTS: One {{of the men who}} died had a 30 year exposure estimated to have averaged < 0. 1 mg/m 3, leading to hilar node fibrosis and calcification, followed by a five year exposure to about 2 mg/m 3 which proved fatal. Estimates of exposure tallied with postmortem measurement of lung burden, suggesting retention of all dust deposited in the lungs over his final period of work. The younger man, working from the start of his apprenticeship alongside the older one, had a six year exposure to about 1. 5 mg/m 3, which caused hilar node enlargement and subsequent calcification but minimal lung involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to relatively low concentrations of quartz may be capable of causing hilar node fibrosis, impairing the clearance of any quartz inhaled subsequently. The findings support the concept that destruction of the hilar nodes by silicotic fibrosis, impairing lung clearance, has an important pathogenic {{role in the development of}} <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and in men subsequently exposed to very high concentrations of respirable quartz, rapidly progressive silicosis...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Schiller, 1951 c) I put forward {{the view that}} the tissue reaction to silica was not a specific one. It is well known that cells give a common response to different types of injury (cf. Selye, 1951). It is improbable, therefore, that a particular pathogenic agent will produce an entirely new type of reaction. It is more probable that similar reactions will be produced by different agents. It is possible that the <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis</b> found in the late stages of several types of pneumo-coniosis is an example of this. By some authors (Giese, 1931; Wiitjen, 1936; di Biasi, 1951) the process is believed to be due to silica, whereas, principally in South Wales, it is believed to be a modified type of tuberculosis (Husten, 1931; Gough...|$|R

40|$|The human cornea-specific protein cornea-derived {{transcript}} 6 (CDT 6) is {{a member}} of the angiopoietin gene family. We report the structural and functional characterization of CDT 6. We demonstrate that CDT 6 is a secreted protein that folds into disulfide-linked homotetramers by coiled-coil interactions. The finding that CDT 6 is expressed at high levels in the avascular corneal stromal layer suggested that the protein, similar to certain angiopoietins, acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis and to assay the effect of the protein on a growing tissue with high vascular density, CDT 6 was expressed in a mouse xenograft model. Expression of CDT 6 led to a reduction in tumor growth and aberrant blood vessel formation by inducing <b>massive</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Interestingly, expression of CDT 6 also resulted in the deposition of extracellular matrix components typical for the mature corneal stromal layer.
