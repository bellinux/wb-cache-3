The silicon analogue of adamantane, sila-adamantane, was synthesized in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The {{starting}} material for ring B was 3-methyl-4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid 46 which was reacted with butadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction (stannic chloride) to racemic cyclohexene 47. This reaction is stereospecific with the methyl {{group and the}} carboxylic acid group ending up in a cis relationship. [...] Chiral resolution using alpha-phenylethylamine gave optically active 47. Oxidation of the double bond with chromic acid gave the triacid 48 as an intermediate which gave dilactone 49 in two intramolecular esterifications. An Arndt–Eistert reaction elongated the carboxylic acid chain in 50, reaction with ammonia gave lactam 51 and reaction with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulfide</b> give thiolactam 52.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{conditions}} {{can be used}} to carry out these reactions, most of which are mild. [...] The Paal–Knorr Furan synthesis is normally carried out under aqueous acidic conditions with protic acids such as aqueous sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or anhydrous conditions with a Lewis acid or dehydrating agent. [...] Common dehydrating agents include phosphorus pentoxide, anhydrides, or zinc chloride. [...] The pyrrole synthesis requires a primary amine under similar conditions, or ammonia (or ammonia precursors) can be used. [...] Synthesis of a thiophene requires a sulfurizing agent which is typically a sufficient dehydrator, such as <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentasulfide,</b> Lawesson's reagent, or hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
