5|$|Charged leptons {{can combine}} with other {{particles}} to form various composite particles such as atoms and <b>positronium.</b> The electron governs {{nearly all of}} chemistry, as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties. Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with normal matter.|$|E
5|$|When {{electrons}} and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, {{giving rise to}} two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a <b>positronium</b> atom can form before annihilation results {{in two or three}} gamma ray photons totalling 1.022MeV. On the other hand, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only {{in the presence of a}} nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Leptons are an {{important}} part of the Standard Model. Electrons are one of the components of atoms, alongside protons and neutrons. Exotic atoms with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, as well as lepton–antilepton particles such as <b>positronium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The di-positronium is a {{molecule}} {{consisting of two}} atoms of <b>positronium.</b> It was predicted to exist in 1946 by John Archibald Wheeler and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 2007 in an experiment done by David Cassidy and Allen Mills at the University of California, Riverside.|$|E
25|$|For <b>positronium,</b> {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the {{electron}} mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half {{what it would be}} for a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr model gives almost exact results {{only for}} a system where two charged points orbit each other at speeds much {{less than that of}} light. This not only {{involves}} one-electron systems such as the hydrogen atom,singly ionized helium, and doubly ionized lithium, but it includes <b>positronium</b> and Rydberg states of any atom where one electron is far away from everything else. It can be used for K-line X-ray transition calculations if other assumptions are added (see Moseley's law below). In high energy physics, {{it can be used to}} calculate the masses of heavy quark mesons.|$|E
500|$|This {{concept is}} applied in key {{predictions}} of quantum electrodynamics (QED, see above). In that theory, {{the mass of}} electrons (or, more generally, leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a technique known as renormalization. Such [...] "radiative corrections" [...] contribute {{to a number of}} predictions of QED, such as the magnetic dipole moment of leptons, the Lamb shift, and the hyperfine structure of bound lepton pairs, such as muonium and <b>positronium.</b>|$|E
500|$|Current and {{previous}} physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes, four Dirac Medals, and three Wolf Prizes predominantly {{for their contributions}} to subatomic and quantum theory. Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods. MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology. Professor Eric Lander {{was one of the}} principal leaders of the Human Genome Project. <b>Positronium</b> atoms, synthetic penicillin, synthetic self-replicating molecules, and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) [...] and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT. Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper [...] "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain". Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.|$|E
2500|$|A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin (spin [...] ) {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and <b>positronium,</b> while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. [...] The best known of all leptons is the electron.|$|E
2500|$|The TBDE can {{be readily}} applied to two body systems such as <b>positronium,</b> muonium, hydrogen-like atoms, quarkonium, and the two-nucleon system. [...] These {{applications}} involve two particles only and do not involve creation or annihilation of particles beyond the two. [...] They involve only elastic processes. [...] Because {{of the connection between}} the potentials used in the TBDE and the corresponding quantum field theory, any radiative correction to the lowest order interaction can be incorporated into those potentials. [...] To see how this comes about, consider by contrast how one computes scattering amplitudes without quantum field theory. [...] With no quantum field theory one must come upon potentials by classical arguments or phenomenological considerations. [...] Once one has the potential [...] between two particles, then one can compute the scattering amplitude [...] from the Lippmann-Schwinger equation ...|$|E
5000|$|Mohorovičić {{is often}} called [...] "the father of positronium" [...] because his most {{significant}} work is the prediction {{of the existence of}} <b>positronium.</b> <b>Positronium</b> is the bound state of an electron and a positron and therefore the lightest atom. It was experimentally discovered in 1951 by Martin Deutsch and became known as <b>positronium.</b> Mohorovičić in his paper also calculated spectra of <b>positronium</b> and predicted the existence of <b>positronium</b> in stars because of which he suggested the identification of possible spectral lines of <b>positronium</b> in spectra of stars. He was searching for spectra of <b>positronium</b> in the sky, but unsuccessfully. <b>Positronium</b> lines were first identified in lab in 1975 by Canter et al. and in outer space in spectra of Crab Nebula in 1984 by J. E. McClintock.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} possible bound particle pair {{capable of}} exhibiting the singlet state is <b>positronium,</b> {{which consists of}} an electron and positron (antielectron) bound by their opposite electric charges. The electron and positron in <b>positronium</b> can also have identical or parallel spin orientations, which results in an experimentally distinct form of <b>positronium</b> with a spin 1 or triplet state.|$|E
50|$|Mirror matter {{could have}} been diluted to unobservably low densities during the {{inflation}} epoch. Sheldon Glashow has shown that if at some high energy scale particles exist which interact strongly with both ordinary and mirror particles, radiative corrections {{will lead to a}} mixing between photons and mirror photons. This mixing has the effect of giving mirror electric charges a very small ordinary electric charge. Another effect of photon-mirror photon mixing is that it induces oscillations between <b>positronium</b> and mirror <b>positronium.</b> <b>Positronium</b> could then turn into mirror <b>positronium</b> and then decay into mirror photons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Positronium</b> is an [...] "atom" [...] {{consisting}} of an electron and a positron. Whereas {{the calculation of}} the energy levels of ordinary hydrogen is contaminated by theoretical uncertainties from the proton's internal structure, the particles that make up <b>positronium</b> have no internal structure so precise theoretical calculations can be performed. The measurement of the splitting between the 2 3S1 and the 1 3S1 energy levels of <b>positronium</b> yields ...|$|E
50|$|In 1951, Deutsch {{measured}} and confirmed {{the existence of}} <b>positronium,</b> a bound state of electrons and positrons whirling about each other. The properties of <b>positronium</b> were predicted by Carl D. Anderson of Caltech in 1932.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Positronium</b> in the 2S {{state is}} {{metastable}} having {{a lifetime of}} [...] against annihilation. The <b>positronium</b> created in such an excited state will quickly cascade {{down to the ground}} state, where annihilation will occur more quickly.|$|E
5000|$|The name charmonium is {{used for}} the [...] and other charm-anticharm bound states. This is by analogy with <b>positronium,</b> which also {{consists}} of a particle and its antiparticle (an electron and positron in the case of <b>positronium).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Measurements of α {{can also}} be {{extracted}} from the <b>positronium</b> decay rate. <b>Positronium</b> decays through the annihilation of the electron and the positron into two or more gamma-ray photons. The decay rate of the singlet ("para-positronium") 1S0 state yields ...|$|E
50|$|The {{decay of}} <b>positronium</b> is easily {{observed}} by detecting the two 511 keV gamma ray photons emitted in the decay. The {{energy of the}} photons from <b>positronium</b> should differ slightly by the binding energy of the molecule. However this {{has not yet been}} detected.|$|E
50|$|PsH is {{a simple}} exotic compound. Other {{compounds}} of <b>positronium</b> are possible by the reactions e+ + AB →PsA + B+. Other substances that contain <b>positronium</b> are di-positronium and the ion Ps− with two electrons. Molecules of Ps with normal matter include halides and cyanide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Positronium</b> is an onium which {{consists}} of an electron and a positron bound together as a long-lived metastable state. <b>Positronium</b> has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in quantum field theory.

50|$|The mass of <b>positronium</b> is 1.022 MeV, {{which is}} twice the {{electron}} mass minus the binding {{energy of a}} few eV. The ground state of <b>positronium,</b> like that of hydrogen, has two possible configurations depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the electron and the positron.|$|E
5000|$|Di-positronium, or dipositronium, is a {{molecule}} {{consisting of two}} atoms of <b>positronium.</b> It was predicted to exist in 1946 by John Archibald Wheeler, and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 2007 in an experiment performed by David Cassidy and Allen Mills at the University of California, Riverside. The researchers made the <b>positronium</b> molecules by firing intense bursts of positrons into a thin film of porous silicon dioxide. Upon slowing down in the silica, the positrons captured ordinary electrons to form <b>positronium</b> atoms. Within the silica, these were long lived enough to interact, forming molecular di-positronium. [...] Advances in trapping and manipulating positrons, and spectroscopy techniques have enabled studies of Ps-Ps interactions. [...] In 2012, Cassidy et al. were able to produce the excited molecular <b>positronium</b> L = 1 state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Positronium</b> hydride, or {{hydrogen}} positride is {{an exotic}} molecule consisting of an exotic atom of <b>positronium,</b> {{which is a}} positron and electron in combination, and one of hydrogen. Its formula is PsH. It was predicted to exist in 1951 by A Ore, and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 1990. R. Pareja, R. Gonzalez from Madrid trapped <b>positronium</b> in hydrogen laden magnesia crystals. The trap was prepared by Yok Chen from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this experiment the positrons were thermalized so {{that they were not}} traveling at high speed, and they then reacted with H− ions in the crystal. In 1992 it was created in an experiment done by David M. Schrader and F.M. Jacobsen and others at the Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers made the <b>positronium</b> hydride molecules by firing intense bursts of positrons into methane, which has the highest density of hydrogen atoms. Upon slowing down, the positrons were captured by ordinary electrons to form <b>positronium</b> atoms which then reacted with hydrogen atoms from the methane.|$|E
5000|$|While precise {{calculation}} of <b>positronium</b> energy levels uses the Bethe-Salpeter equation or the Breit equation, {{the similarity between}} <b>positronium</b> and hydrogen allows a rough estimate. In this approximation, the energy levels are different because of a different effective mass, m*, in the energy equation (see electron energy levels for a derivation): ...|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{operates on}} the principle that a positron or <b>positronium</b> will annihilate through interaction with electrons. This annihilation releases gamma rays that can be detected; the time between emission of positrons from a radioactive source and detection of gamma rays due to annihilation corresponds to the lifetime of positron or <b>positronium.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pore {{structure}} in insulators {{can be determined}} using the quantum mechanical Tao-Eldrup model and extensions thereof. By changing the temperature at which a sample is analyzed, the pore structure can be fit to a model where <b>positronium</b> is confined in one, two, or three dimensions. However, interconnected pores result in averaged lifetimes that cannot distinguish between smooth channels or channels having smaller, open, peripheral pores due to energetically favored <b>positronium</b> diffusion from small to larger pores.|$|E
50|$|Due to its short {{lifetime}} {{establishing the}} chemistry of <b>positronium</b> hydride poses difficulties. Theoretical calculations can predict what can happen. One method of formation is through alkali metal hydrides reacting with positrons. Molecules with dipole moments greater than 1.625 debye are predicted to attract and hold positrons in a bound state. Crawford's model predicts this positron capture. However {{in the case of}} lithium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride molecules, this adduct decomposes and <b>positronium</b> hydride and the alkali positive ion form.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability of}} <b>positronium</b> to form both singlet and triplet states is {{described}} mathematically {{by saying that}} the product of two doublet representations (meaning the electron and positron, which are both spin 1/2 doublets) can be decomposed into the sum of an adjoint representation (the triplet or spin 1 state) and a trivial representation (the singlet or spin 0 state). While the particle interpretation of the <b>positronium</b> triplet and singlet states is arguably more intuitive, the mathematical description enables precise calculations of quantum states and probabilities.|$|E
