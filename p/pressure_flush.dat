These things, at the <b>pressure,</b> <b>flush</b> together again, interweave their pattern and quite thrust it at me, the absurd little fusion of images, for a history or a picture of the time--the background of which I see after all so much less as the harsh Sixth Avenue corner than as many other matters. Those scant shades claimed us but briefly and superficially, and it comes back to me that oddly enough, in the light of autumn afternoons, our associates, the most animated or at any rate the best [...] "put in" [...] little figures of our landscape, were not our comparatively obscure schoolmates, who seem mostly to have swum out of our ken between any day and its morrow. Our other companions, those we practically knew [...] "at home," [...] ignored our school, having better or worse of their own, but peopled somehow for us the social scene, which, figuring there for me in documentary vividness, bristles with Van Burens, Van Winkles, De Peysters, Costers, Senters, Norcoms, Robinsons (these last composing round a stone-throwing [...] "Eugene,") Wards, Hunts and tutti quanti--to whose ranks I must add our invariable Albert, before-mentioned, and who swarm from up and down and east and west, appearing to me surely to have formed a rich and various society. Our salon, it is true, was mainly the street, loose and rude and crude in those days at best--though with a rapid increase of redeeming features, {{to the extent to which}} the spread of micaceous brown stone could redeem: as exhibited especially in the ample face of the Scotch Presbyterian church promptly rising just opposite our own peculiar row and which it now marks for me somewhat grimly a span of life to have seen laboriously rear itself, continuously flourish and utterly disappear. While in construction it was only less interesting than the dancing-academy of Mr. Edward Ferrero, slightly west of it and forming with it, in their embryonic stage, a large and delightfully dangerous adjunct to our playground, though with the distinction of coming much to surpass it for interest in the final phase. While we clambered about on ladders and toyed with the peril of unfloored abysses, while we trespassed and pried and pervaded, snatching a scant impression from sorry material enough, clearly, the sacred edifice enjoyed a credit beyond that of the profane; but when both were finished and opened we flocked to the sound of the fiddle more freely, it need scarce be said, than to that of the psalm. [...] "Freely" [...] indeed, in our particular case, scarce expresses the latter relation; since our young liberty in respect to church-going was absolute and we might range at will, through the great city, from one place of worship and one form of faith to another, or might on occasion ignore them all equally, which was what we mainly did; whereas we rallied without a break to the halls of Ferrero, a view of the staringly and, as I supposed dazzlingly, frescoed walls, the internal economy, the high amenity, the general æsthetic and social appeal, of which still hangs in its wealth before me. Dr. McElroy, uplifting tight-closed eyes, strange long-drawn accents and gaunt scraggy chin, squirming and swaying and cushion-thumping in his only a shade more chastely adorned temple, is distinct enough too--just as we enjoyed this bleak intensity the more, to my personal vision, through the vague legend (and no legend was too vague for me to cherish) of his being the next pastor in succession to the one under whom our mother, thereto predirected by our good greatgrandfather, Alexander Robertson already named, who was nothing if not Scotch and Presbyterian and authoritative, as his brave old portrait by the elder Jarves attests, had [...] "sat" [...] before her marriage; the marriage so lamentedly diverting her indeed from this tradition that, to mark the rueful rupture, it had invoked, one evening, with the aid of India muslin and a wondrous gold headband, in the maternal, the Washington Square [...] "parlours," [...] but the secular nuptial consecration of the then Mayor of the city--I think Mr. Varick.|$|E

Experiment on tungsten carbide material was carried out using difference <b>pressure</b> <b>flushing</b> machining parameter with copper tungsten electrode.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} technology electrochemical machining (ECM) finds numerous applications in industrial production. Especially for shaping and surface structuring of metals by controlled anodic dissolution {{the process is}} used. The advantages of ECM are mainly the high removal rates, the slight influence on the work piece material structure and the independence of material strength and hardness. Thus ECM is advantage compared to metal cutting manufacturing processes. Precise electrochemical machining (PEM) is an innovative machining technology which results from further development of the electrochemical sinking. PEM works with pulsed low frequency direct current and oscillation of the tool electrode. It enables the manufacturing of tools and machine elements with high precision requirements and reproduction accuracy. [1, 2] With PEM actually the manufacturing of structure sizes < 1 mm and flatness < 5 µm by front surface machining is possible. As {{part of the project}} ‘Electrochemical machining of internal precision and micro-geometries with high aspect ratios by process-state-dependent electrolyte management‘ (ElAs) the aim is to develop a new combination of high <b>pressure</b> <b>flush</b> and a flexible electrode concept. Filigreed electrodes with structure elements smaller than 0. 2 mm are targeted for the aimed manufacturing of big aspect ratios. Moreover inner micro structures are obstacle by them self for the needed electrolyte flush in the working cap. Due to this the manufacturing process has to be qualified to a non-flux of electrolyte at the dissolution process. Interaction between conduction and the geometry of the electrodes should be avoided. Therefore a closed process device has to be developed which is able to admit a defined pressure charge. By concerted modifications the oscillation inducted effect of compression should become accessible as input parameter for the process. Experimental research of model geometries regarding to the electrode shape, the inducted compression, the precision, the surface and the current efficiency are content of the project. Multiphysics simulations are applied to characterise the modified process. For the simulation of the electrolyte flow in the closed device COMSOL MultiphysicsTM is used. To get use of the simulation software a suitable model geometry had to be deducted and initial values were defined. The closed device has a cylindrical shape with connections for the electrolyte supply. Thus the device isn’t rotationally symmetric. The electrolyte flow results from interaction of the transverse flow and the tool electrode oscillation. One challenge is to develop a model which fits the geometric requirements of the closed device and even the requirements for simulation. The numerical simulations of high turbulent flows are really sophisticated and a lot of computing power is needed [3]. Therefore the simulation was designed in a 2 -dimensional environment and the geometric specifications were adjusted accordingly to comply with these claims. By solving a transient model of turbulent flow the field of velocity in the closed device could be shown. It can be recognized that the field of velocity in the closed device is highly turbulent with many random vortexes. This is due to the interaction of oscillating velocity at the upper edge of the model and the transverse flux in the closed device...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preparation and characterization of chemical plugs based on selected Hanford Site waste simulants. Included are the results of chemical plug bench testing conducted in support of the M 1 /M 6 Flow Loop Chemical Plugging/Unplugging Test (TP-RPP-WTP- 495 Rev A). These results support the proposed plug simulants for the chemical plugging/ unplugging tests. Based on the available simulant data, a set of simulants was identified that would likely result in chemical plugs. The three types of chemical plugs that were generated and tested in this task consisted of: 1. Aluminum hydroxide (NAH), 2. Sodium aluminosilicate (NAS), and 3. Sodium aluminum phosphate (NAP). While both solvents, namely 2 molar (2 M) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 60 °C, used in these tests were effective in dissolving the chemical plugs, the 2 M nitric acid was significantly more effective in dissolving the NAH and NAS plugs. The caustic was only slightly more effecting at dissolving the NAP plug. In the bench-scale dissolution tests, hot (60 °C) 2 M nitric acid was the most effective solvent in that it completely dissolved both NAH and NAS chemical plugs much faster (1. 5 – 2 x) than 2 M sodium hydroxide. So unless there are operational benefits for the use of caustic verses nitric acid, 2 M nitric acid heated to 60 °C C should be the solvent of choice for dissolving these chemical plugs. Flow-loop testing was planned to identify a combination of parameters such as <b>pressure,</b> <b>flush</b> solution, composition, and temperature that would effectively dissolve and flush each type of chemical plug from preformed chemical plugs in 3 -inch-diameter and 4 -feet-long pipe sections. However, based on a review {{of the results of the}} bench-top tests and technical discussions, the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Research and Technology (R&T), Engineering and Mechanical Systems (EMS), and Operations concluded that flow-loop testing of the chemically plugged pipe sections would not provide any additional information or useful data. The decision was communicated through a Sub Contract Change Notice (SCN- 070) that included a revised scope as follows: • Photographing the chemical plugs in the pipes before extrusion to compare the morphology of aged gels with that of fresh gels. • Setting up an extrusion apparatus and extruding the chemical plugs. • Documenting the qualitative observations on the efforts to remove the chemical plug materials from the pipe sections. • Performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of extruded gel samples to detect any crystallization of gel during storage. • Disposing of the extruded gel as a waste. • Documenting the analytical results in a test report. There were no significant morphological differences between the fresh and aged plugs except for an overgrowth of small transparent crystals on the surface of the aged NAS gel plug. An initial pressure of 15 KPa for the NAS plug and from ~ 2 to 6 KPa for the NAH plug. Following extrusion, the NAP plug sections were thixotropic. The bulk of all the aged gel plugs consisted of amorphous material with nitratine constituting the crystalline phase.

40|$|Introduction: Currently, large dams in the world, due to {{the high}} amount of sediments in the reservoir, {{especially}} around the intake, have operational problems. One of the solutions for this problem is <b>pressure</b> <b>flushing.</b> In this type of flushing, a mixture of water and sediment is removed from bottom outlets form dam reservoir and a funnel shaped crater is created {{in the vicinity of}} the outlet opening. In laboratory experiments carried out in this study, <b>pressure</b> <b>flushing</b> with the expansion of bottom outlet within the reservoir and its statistical analysis of bursting events were investigated. The structure of the turbulent flow is not fully understood {{due to the}}ir complexity and random nature. Klein et al. Introduced the turbulence bursting in this kind of flow and Nezo and Nakagora suggested that the events resulting from turbulence bursting has a significant effect of transferring the sediment particles. Materials and Methods: For the purposes of this study, the experiments were conducted with a physical model with 7 m length, 1. 4 m width, and 1. 5 m height, consisting of three parts namely the inlet of the model, the main reservoir, and settling basin. The main reservoir of the model was 5 m long and the sediments were placed within this part of the model. The sediment particles were non-cohesive silica with uniform size and with median diameter (d 50) 1. 15 mm and geometrics standard deviation (σg) 1. 37. Experiments carried out with different discharges and water depths above the bottom outlet in different expansion size of outlet channel in constant sediment level of 20 cm above the center of the outlet channel. The model was slowly filled with water until the water surface elevation reached to a desired level. The bottom outlet was manually opened, after a while sedimentwere discharged with the water flow in very high concentrations through the outlet channel (sudden discharge) and a funnel shaped crater was formed in front of it. After the run of each experiment, the bed level of scouring was measured using laser meters, and the volume of flushing cone was calculated by Surfer software. For investigation of turbulence parameters, the measurement of flow velocity in 0. 5 cm from the bed of flushing cone in the central axis of the outlet channel in the flow rate of 3 liters per second and water level of 47. 5 cm for three expansion sizes of the outlet channel (10, 20, and 30 cm) was performed. The flow velocity measurement was done using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. This device is capable of measuring instantaneous velocity in three directions. Results and Discussion: The results indicated that the relative amount of bottom outlet channel expansion for 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 times height of the sediments in the reservoir, leads to increase in flushing cone length for an average of 48, 83 and 113...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – • Percent loss of {{hydraulic}} conductivity (PLC) {{is an important}} measure in plant water relations, but the available methods differ and results have rarely been compared. •We compared PLC measured in Norway spruce (Picea abies) by quantifying conductivity before and after removing emboli, either by flushing with high water pressure or by infiltration under a partial vacuum, with relative water loss and staining conductive xylem to test advantages and possible problems of commonly applied methods. • Infiltration removed nearly all gas from sections of drought-stressed and unstressed twigs, and flushing and infiltration efficiently removed emboli. Infiltration appears less prone to producing clogged xylem elements than high <b>pressure</b> <b>flushing.</b> Relative water loss (RWL) {{and the proportion of}} xylem stained with phloxine B (PSX) was also highly correlated with PLC, the latter can be quantified by image analysis, and also shows the pattern of xylem dysfunction. Loss of conductivity was more common in the inner annual rings, in early wood within an annual ring, and in compression wood, though pattern differed substantially between branches. • Advantages and potential problems of these methods are discussed and it is suggested that RWL or PSX may be used as proxy measures for PLC in species when the correlations have been established. dye staining / percent loss of {{hydraulic conductivity}} / Picea abies / relative water content / xylem embolism Résumé – Comparaison de méthodes de quantification des pertes de conductivité hydraulique chez l’épicéa...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{performed}} on an F- 5 A aircraft to investigate the dynamic buffet pressure distribution on the wing surfaces and the responses during a series of transonic maneuvers called wind-up turns. The conditions under which the tests were conducted are defined. The fluctuating buffet pressure data on {{the right wing of}} the aircraft were acquired by miniaturized semiconductor-type <b>pressure</b> transducers <b>flush</b> mounted on the wing. Processing of the fluctuating pressures and responses included the generation of the auto- and cross-power spectra, and of the spatial correlation functions. An analytical correlation procedure was introduced to compute the aircraft response spectra based on the measured buffet pressures...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{machining}} of EN- 19 {{has been}} carried out using rectangular shaped tungsten copper electrode to study the influences of EDM input parameters on surface roughness. The selected EDM input variables are input current (5 - 45 Amperes), pulse time (10 - 90 sec.), duty cycle (3 - 7), Gap voltage (6 - 18) and <b>Flushing</b> <b>pressure</b> (0. 1 - 0. 5). Regression analysis is carried out to ensure a least squared fitting to error surface in Minitab 15 environment. Regression analysis has been performed to find out the relationship between input factors and surface roughness. A mathematical model was developed using multiple regression method to formulate the gap voltage, pulse on time, pulse off time and <b>flushing</b> <b>pressure</b> to the surface roughness. The developed model showed high prediction accuracy within the experimental region.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the effects of response parameters on the performance characteristics in the Ultrasonic vibration Assisted Electric Discharge Machining (UEDM) Process. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used to investigate the effect of amplitude of vibration, peak current, pulse on-time, machining time and <b>flushing</b> <b>pressure.</b> To study the proposed second order polynomial model for surface roughness (SR), a Central Composite Design (CCD) is used for the estimation of the model coefficients of five factors, which are believed to influence the SR in UEDM process. Experiments are conducted on Aluminum alloy 6063 with copper electrode. The response is modeled on experimental data by using RSM. The separable influence of individual machining parameters and the interaction between these parameters are also investigated by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is found that amplitude of vibration, peak current; pulse-on time, <b>flushing</b> <b>pressure</b> and most of their interactions have significant affect on SR...|$|R
