40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to analyse members' attitudes to the {{principle}} of preference contained in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (1904). In light of this object the primary problem is to explain the significance of the Preference Clause. Part I introduces the main theme, that the significance of the Preference Clause is explained by two circumstances. The first is an explanation <b>of</b> how <b>arbitration</b> became the solution to the pattern of ind. us trial relations which developed, and the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> preference in <b>arbitration.</b> The second circumstance is the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the Preference Clause in the party machinations of the period while observing that these circumstances both determine and affect members' attitudes. Part II (1860 - 1890) describes the pattern of industrial relations up to the point of the industrial crisis of the Mari time Strike. Part III (1891 - 1901) relates the crisis of the strike to the industrial and political developments in this decade. The industrial event <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> and the political event of the formation of Parliamentary Labour Parties form the immediate background to the crisis over preference. The description <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> demonstrates the rationale behind preference while the description of the Labour Party demonstrates the reason why preference should be distasteful to members when advocated by a Labour Party.

Accordingly, in an international commercial arbitration, as per the new law, district court will have no jurisdiction and the parties can expect speedier and efficacious determination of any issue directly by the High court which is better equipped in terms of handling commercial disputes.Amendment of Section 2(2): A proviso to Section 2(2) has been added which envisages that subject to the agreement to the contrary, Section 9 (interim measures), Section 27(taking of evidence), and Section 37(1)(a), 37(3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitrations, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India, meaning thereby that the new law has tried to strike a kind of balance between the situations created by the judgments of Bhatia International and Balco v.

40|$|The {{settlement}} of trade dispute, particular {{in the international}} trade through the Alternative Dispute Resolution such as arbitration in not a new solution {{that can be taken}} by party legally bound to a contract of a trade contract. The {{settlement of}} dispute through arbitration had been known since hundreds years ago either in England or United States of America. The Arbitration has some advantages in settling a trade dispute than the settlement of dispute through the court. The main advantage of arbitration is its confidentiality or known the Right of Privacy, therefore it is expected that it will not damage the reputation of the business actor concerned. In addition to its confidentiality, the advantage of arbitration is a principle of "win-win solution" in its decision that it is considered will bring more to justice for the disputing parties. Practically, the advantages of arbitration in settling a dispute may not be always reached, it means that it will often take more times in settling a dispute through arbitration than through a court due to the difficulty finding a mutual agreement to appoint an arbiter for example, or due to the arbitration clause brings a multi interpretation. In addition, the satisfaction of an arbitration decision of its execution may not be often easy to be implemented that it needs an intervention of the Court (Pengadilan Negeri). Generally those cases coused by the arbitration clause was not comprehensive formulated. However, people still choose arbitration in settling an international trade dispute with the reason that : a. 	There is none of the international court that can investigate an international trade dispute in this world, b. 	A national court is considered as the unsafe court by the developed countries, c. 	Avoiding a 'forum shopping', means the same disputes may be undertaken by the court from different countries. It needs to be considered that even has some advantages, not all disputes or cases can be settled through arbitration. A dispute that cannot be settled by a mutual agreement prevailing to the laws shall not be settled through arbitration. Therefore, arbitration shall only settle a trade disputes and a thing fully delegated to parties concerned prevailing to the laws. Basically, parties concerned are free to choose words used in arbitration clause, however, it needs to consider some certain matters that have been standardized for these formulation and have been in effect internationally. Some norms and rules in arbitration that have been in effect internationally are from UNCITRAL, Arbitration Rules (UAR), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and American Association (AAA), and Badan Arbitrase Nasional Indonesia (BANI) that is in effect in Indonesia. In a formal judicial, the provision of arbitration in Indonesia is governed in Act No. 30 of 1999 on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution.

At the beginning of the study it will be underlined that, when speaking about the consensual nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> one needs to differentiate between consensual as one of the essential criteria for arbitrationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s qualification and consent as a condition for the validity <b>of</b> the <b>arbitration</b> agreement. This differentiation is especially important in sport arbitration where, between the athletes and sport organisations, there is often induced consent rather than bargained consent. By sustaining that the consensual character <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> needs to be differentiated, but not abandoned, the thesis clearly takes a contractual, or better, a consensual approach. It is preferable to speak of a consensual approach, because the agreement to arbitrate does not always take the form <b>of</b> an <b>arbitration</b> agreement in the traditional sense.

However, not only a comparison of national laws and different arbitration rules will be undertaken, but the thesis will also consider the evolution <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> by discussing the implications that evolution has had on the perception of the consensual character <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> Moreover, and above all, {{the main body of the}} thesis will be dedicated to a comparison focused on the consent issues of the three main areas where arbitration is nowadays used in an international context: commercial arbitration, investment arbitration and sport arbitration. It will be stressed that, although already in the classical area <b>of</b> commercial <b>arbitration,</b> the structures <b>of</b> <b>arbitrations</b> may be <b>of</b> different types, ranging from bi-party situations to multiparty scenarios, and might play a role when considering the consensual nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> this becomes even clearer when one analyses the other fields <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The thesis then also takes into account that, in the various phases of the arbitral process, the expectations with regard to the consensual character <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> may be different. In the thesis it will be argued that the reason the consensual nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> evolved over time, and the reason that it is different among the various fields <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> might be seen in the fact that there is an inherent tension between the contractual and the jurisdictional side <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> In this situation of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cinherent tensionâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d consent may be perceived as being more or less present.

It will be stressed that, although already in the classical area <b>of</b> commercial <b>arbitration,</b> the structures <b>of</b> <b>arbitrations</b> may be <b>of</b> different types, ranging from bi-party situations to multiparty scenarios, and might play a role when considering the consensual nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> this becomes even clearer when one analyses the other fields <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The thesis then also takes into account that, in the various phases of the arbitral process, the expectations with regard to the consensual character <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> may be different. In the thesis it will be argued that the reason the consensual nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> evolved over time, and the reason that it is different among the various fields <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> might be seen in the fact that there is an inherent tension between the contractual and the jurisdictional side <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> In this situation of “inherent tension” consent may be perceived as being more or less present. Nevertheless, the “intensity” of consent does not affect the basically consensual character <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> While the four traditional theories (jurisdictional, contractual, mixed/hybrid and autonomous) used to explain the juridical nature <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> focus rather on the relationship between State and arbitration, the thesis attempts to indicate other solutions which seem to be more able to explain the use <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> in the different areas/fields where arbitration is expected to resolve disputes.

40|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> in {{settling}} disputes {{which involves}} national and transnational commercial transactions is steadily growing {{in this era}} of globalisation. International and national rules governing various aspects <b>of</b> commercial <b>arbitration</b> have contributed to the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> as an alternative to litigation. The involvement of national courts is crucial to the overall efficacy <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> both domestic and international. Instances calling for court intervention may appear at all stages of the arbitral proceedings. There is, however, a need to maintain a balance between the level of court involvement and the smooth functioning <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> - which is a contractual alternative to judicial dispute settlement. This article deals with the legal and practical role of Ethiopian courts during the three stages of arbitral proceeding, i. e., at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>arbitration,</b> during the arbitral proceedings, and after the end <b>of</b> the <b>arbitration.</b> And finally, I argue in favour of judicial restraint particularly during the first two stages of arbitral proceedings...|$|R
