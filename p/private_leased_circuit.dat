50|$|The e-network {{is made up}} of a large undersea {{cable network}} and {{satellite}} connectivity provided through C-Band transponders of the INTELSAT-904 or RASCOM satellites. A Hub Earth Station of the project, located in Senegal, is connected to the participant universities and super specialty hospitals, through an International <b>Private</b> <b>Leased</b> <b>Circuit</b> (IPLC) that links it to a submarine cable landing station in India. Each partner nation from Africa has a tele-education terminal, a telemedicine terminal and a VVIP communication node for the head of State linked to the network. The network, designed to have 169 terminals and a central hub that delivers services, uses state of the art technology that is compatible with broadband technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMax. The network can also be scaled up to support increases in user numbers and to cater to different applications. The project is being implemented by the Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) which is responsible for the project's design, operationalisation and maintenance. A data centre at its office in New Delhi acts as a hub for all Indian sites. As a precursor to e-Network project, a pilot project was successfully undertaken in Ethiopia in 2006 that provided education services from IGNOU at New Delhi and telemedicine services from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad.|$|E
50|$|Besides GMPLS, {{the main}} {{competitors}} to MPLS are Shortest Path Bridging (SPB), Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB), and MPLS-TP. These also provide {{services such as}} service provider layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs. L2TPv3 has been suggested as a competitor, but has not reached any wider success. Some internet providers are offering different services to customers along with MPLS. These services mainly include National <b>Private</b> <b>Lease</b> <b>Circuit</b> (NPLC), ILL, IPLC etc.As an example of NPLC, consider City A and City B. An organisation has an office in each city. The organisation requires connectivity between these two offices. The ISP {{will have access to}} a PoP in each city and therefore has a link between the PoPs. To connect the offices to the PoPs, a connection via the local loop will be commissioned for each office. In this way, an NPLC is delivered.|$|R

40|$|Data {{delivery}} in the Deep Space Network (DSN) involves transmission {{of a small}} amount of constant, high-priority traffic and a large amount of bursty, low priority data. The bursty traffic may be initially buffered and then metered back slowly as bandwidth becomes available.

Such an architecture may significantly reduce costs and provide an emergency backup. The architecture presented here may also be applied to any ground station-to-customer network within the range of a common carrier.

40|$|This Comment {{examines}} the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s statement in The Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker that a strict liability clause would be enforceable in <b>private</b> <b>leases.</b> The Court accordingly infers that ex-offenders and suspected offenders would encounter obstacles in {{their attempt to}} receive and maintain housing leases, both public and private. Part II discusses the 2 ̆ 2 One Strike and You 2 ̆ 7 re Out 2 ̆ 2 housing act and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Rucker. The Court upheld the federally mandated public housing strict liability clause in part because the tenant would be treated the same in a <b>private</b> <b>lease.</b> This Comment thus explores the development of both private landlord-tenant law and public housing law. Part III examines a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s procedures for tenant selection in <b>private</b> housing <b>leases.</b> Part III compares the legal boundaries in private tenant selection with the Congressional mandates for tenant screening in public housing leases. Part III also displays legal safeguards for the ex-offender who believes she has been denied private housing based on her past. Part IV discusses the grounds, relating to criminality, upon which a private landlord may evict a tenant. Part IV compares judicial interpretations of state statutes regulating <b>private</b> <b>leases</b> providing for strict liability evictions of tenants for criminal acts of guests or third parties, similar to the 2 ̆ 2 One Strike and You 2 ̆ 7 re Out 2 ̆ 2 policy in public housing.
