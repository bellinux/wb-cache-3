5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog)</b> is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E

50|$|Serpentario de Monteverde (Snake Tour Herpetarium) is {{an urban}} park of {{approximately}} 14 hectares (34 acres), located in southern Monteverde, in the Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. It has an average altitude of 1327 meters and is contiguous to the Monteverde Orchid Garden {{to the north}} and the Butterfly Garden to the south. The site includes reptiles, <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> and over 20 species of snakes. Most species in the serpentarium can be found wild in the surrounding forests.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{reptiles}} {{present in}} the park are the American crocodile and several snake and lizard species. The Tarcoles River, which forms the northern boundary of the park, is inhabited by crocodiles {{throughout most of the}} year.Green and black <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> are among the amphibians present. Mammals include white-tailed deer, red brockets, collared peccaries, agouti, kinkajous, white-faced capuchin monkeys, mantled howler monkeys, Hoffmann's two-toed sloths and brown-throated three-toed sloths. However, mammals can be difficult to see due to the dense tree cover.|$|R
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} successful in the past. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs after almost being hunted to extinction in China. Captive-breeding is employed by modern conservationists, and has saved a wide variety of species from extinction, ranging from birds (e.g., the pink pigeon), mammals (e.g., the pygmy hog), reptiles (e.g., the Round Island boa) and amphibians (e.g., <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs).</b> Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse was also successfully reintroduced in the wild after being bred in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Anthony's <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog</b> is diurnal and terrestrial. Males are territorial. A {{clutch of}} 15 to 40 eggs is {{laid on the}} ground among leaf litter and the male guards them till they hatch in about two weeks. He then carries them on his back to a {{suitable}} water body where the tadpoles develop to metamorphosis in about sixty days.|$|E
50|$|Phantasmidine is a toxic {{substance}} {{derived from the}} Ecuadorian poisonous frog Anthony's <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog</b> (Epipeptobates Anthonyi), more {{commonly known as the}} “phantasmal poison frog”. It is a nicotinic agonist, meaning it binds to nicotinic receptors in the body and mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This causes the stimulation of the body’s parasympathetic nervous system, which induces many inhibitory behaviors in the body such as decreased heart rate.|$|E
50|$|The green-and-black {{poison dart frog}} (Dendrobates auratus), {{also known}} as the green-and-black <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog</b> and with {{numerous}} other names, is a brightly colored member of the order Anura native to Central America and northwestern parts of South America. This species has also been introduced to Hawaii. It {{is one of the most}} variable of all poison dart frogs next to Dendrobates tinctorius and some Oophaga spp. It is considered to be of least concern from a conservation standpoint by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{of other species}} has been successful. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs. After almost being hunted to extinction in China. They demonstrated success {{with a wide variety}} of species in the 1970s ranging from birds (e.g. pink pigeon), mammals (e.g. pygmy hog), reptiles (e.g. Round Island boa) and amphibians (e.g. <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs).</b> Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse has recently been re-introduced to the wild in Mongolia.In 2010, the Oregon Zoo found that Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success.|$|R
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the ARKS and MedARKS systems relies on animals being correctly identified. While it may be easy to identify the male gorilla Ya Kwanza within his family, identifying individual pink pigeons or <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> is more difficult. An ID transponder or microchip, {{the size of a}} grain of rice, is placed under the skin by injection. It emits a ten digit alpha numeric code which is recognised by a scanning device. This also enables the Trust's Research Department to identify animals during studies. Most research involves the observation of animals, without disturbing them, and includes studies on general behaviour, on feeding and on parental care of offspring either in the Trust grounds or overseas.|$|R
40|$|Pitohui birds from New Guinea {{have been}} found to contain a toxin {{otherwise}} only found in neotropical <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs.</b> Pitohuis have been considered to be monophyletic and thus toxicity is thought to have evolved once in birds. Here, we show that Pitohuis, rather than being a tight-knit group, are polyphyletic and represent several lineages among the corvoid families of passerine birds. This finding demonstrates that the ability to be toxic is widespread among corvoid birds and suggests that additional members of this radiation, comprising more than 700 species, could prove to be toxic. It is postulated that toxic birds ingest the toxin through their insect diet and excrete it through the uropygial gland, from where it is applied to the skin and feathers. Thus, the ability to become toxic is most likely an ancestral condition but variation in diet determines the extent to which toxicity is expressed among corvoid birds. Variability in toxicity levels further suggests that the main function of the toxin is that of a deterrent against ectoparasites and bacterial infection rather than being a defence against predators as initially proposed...|$|R
5000|$|The blue {{poison dart frog}} or blue <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog</b> or {{known by}} its native name, okopipi, (Dendrobates tinctorius [...] "azureus") is a poison dart frog found in the forests {{surrounded}} by the Sipaliwini savanna, which is located in southern Suriname and adjacent far northern Brazil. D. tinctorius [...] "azureus" [...] is also known by its Tirio Indian name, okopipi. Its scientific name comes from its azure color. While frequently considered a valid species in the past, recent authorities treat it as a variant of D. tinctorius.|$|E
50|$|The golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), {{also known}} as the golden frog, golden <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog,</b> or golden dart frog, is a poison dart frog endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia. The optimal habitat of P. terribilis is the {{rainforest}} with high rain rates (5 m or more per year), altitudes between 100 and 200 m, temperatures of at least 26 °C, and relative humidity of 80-90%. In the wild, P. terribilis is a social animal, living in groups of up to six individuals; however, captive P. terribilis specimens can live in much larger groups. These frogs are often considered innocuous due to their small size and bright colours, but wild frogs are lethally toxic.|$|E
50|$|Epibatidine was {{discovered}} by John W. Daly in 1974. It was isolated from the skin of Epipdobates anthonyi frogs collected by Daly and colleague, Charles Myers. Between 1974 and 1979, Daly and Myers collected the skins of nearly 3000 frogs from various sites in Ecuador, after finding that a small injection of a preparation from their skin caused analgesic (painkilling) symptoms in mice with symptoms that resembled those of an opioid. Despite its common name - Anthony’s <b>Poison</b> <b>Arrow</b> <b>frog</b> - suggesting that it was used by natives when hunting, a paper written by Daly in 2000 claimed {{that there was no}} local folklore or folk medicine surrounding the frogs and that they were considered largely unimportant by the locals.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{international}} trade in South American <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> (Dendrobatidae) in the period 2004 – 2008, {{and focus on the}} role of Asian countries. All species of dendrobatid frogs are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), regulating all commercial trade in these species. Based on data compiled in the WCMC CITES database, we establish that[63, 000 dendrobatid frogs (of 32 species) were traded internationally. For 21 species the majority of individuals were reported as captive-bred. A quarter to a fifth of the commercial trade in dendrobatid frogs in terms of volume is destined for Asian markets (mainly Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, Province of China). Kazakhstan, the main supplier for the Thai market, is reported as a source country for 16 species, all captivebred. We found large discrepancies between the reported export of dendrobatid frogs from Kazakhstan—none—and imports reported by Thailand as coming from Kazakhstan ([2, 500 individuals). A significant part of the trade flow goes via Lebanon, a non-CITES Party. We urge the CITES Management Authorities of the countries involved to investigate the trade in dendrobatid frogs to ensure it does not violate the rules and intentions of CITES...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases caused by fungal taxa are increasing and are placing a substantial burden on economies and ecosystems worldwide. Of the emerging fungal diseases, chytridomycosis {{caused by the}} fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter Bd) is linked to global amphibian declines. Amphibians have innate immunity, as well as additional resistance through cutaneous microbial communities. Despite the targeting of bacteria as potential probiotics, the role of fungi in the protection against Bd infection in unknown. We used a four-part approach, including high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities, cultivation of fungi, Bd challenge assays, and experimental additions of probiotic to Midwife Toads (Altyes obstetricans), to examine the overlapping roles of bacterial and fungal microbiota in pathogen defense in captive bred <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frogs</b> (Dendrobates sp.). Our results revealed that cutaneous fungal taxa differed from environmental microbiota across three species and a subspecies of Dendrobates spp. frogs. Cultivation of host-associated and environmental fungi realved numerous taxa {{with the ability to}} inhibit or facilitate the growth of Bd. The abundance of cutaneous fungi contributed more to Bd defense (~ 45 % of the fungal community), than did bacteria (~ 10 %) and frog species harbored distinct inhibitory communities that were distinct from the environment. Further, we demonstrated that a fungal probiotic therapy did not induce an endocrine-immune reaction, in contrast to bacterial probiotics that stressed amphibian hosts and suppressed antimicrobial peptide responses, limiting their long-term colonization potential. Our results suggest that probiotic strategies against amphibian fungal pathogens should, in addition to bacterial probiotics, focus on host-associated and environmental fungi such as Penicillium and members of the families Chaetomiaceae and Lasiosphaeriaceae...|$|R

50|$|For {{many species}} the only type of male {{investment}} received {{is that of}} sex cells. In those terms, the female investment greatly exceeds that of male investment as previously mentioned. However, {{there are other ways}} in which males invest in their offspring. For example, the male can find food as in the example of balloon flies. He may find a safe environment for the female to feed or lay her eggs as exemplified in many birds. He may also protect the young and provide them with opportunities to learn as in many young as in wolves. Overall, the main role that males overtake is that of protection of the female and their young. That often can decrease the discrepancy of investment caused by the initial investment of sex cells. And indeed there are some species such as the Mormon cricket, pipefish seahorse and Panamanian <b>poison</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>frog</b> males invest more. What is interesting is that among the species where the male invests more, the male is also the pickier sex placing higher demands on their selected female. For example, the female that they often choose usually contain 60% more eggs than rejected females. This links Parental Investment Theory (PIT) with sexual selection: where parental investment is bigger for a male than a female, it's usually the female who competes for a mate, as shown by Phalaropidae and polyandrous bird species. In these species females are usually more aggressive, brightly coloured, and larger than males, suggesting the more investing sex has more choice while selecting a mate compared to the sex engaged in intra-sexual selection.|$|E
