The tablets were prepared by direct compression method. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) K 30, Pluronic® F 127, and magnesium oxide were used to improve tablet properties. Magnesium stearate, talc, and lactose were used to aid the compression of tablets. The tablets were found to have good appearance, uniform thickness, diameter, weight, pH, and drug content. A 23 full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables viz. levels of carrageenan gum, Pluronic F 127 and PVP K 30, which significantly influenced characteristics like in vitro mucoadhesive strength, in vitro drug release, swelling index, and in vitro residence time. The tablet was coated with an impermeable backing layer of ethyl cellulose to ensure unidirectional drug release. Different penetration enhancers were tried to improve the permeation of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> through buccal mucosa.

40|$|AbstractHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, {{are widely}} used as {{cholesterol-lowering}} agents {{in the treatment of}} dyslipidemias. Statins have also been reported to have pleiotropic effects, independent of their effects on cholesterol synthesis, possibly through inhibition of the monomeric G proteins Ras and Rho, which are able to signal through ERK and Rho kinase activities, respectively. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of ERK activation enhances β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation in the porcine isolated coronary artery. As statins can also inhibit ERK activation, the initial aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether statins have a similar influence on β-adrenoceptor-evoked vasodilatation. Segments of porcine distal coronary artery were mounted in a Mulvany wire myograph and bathed in Krebs–Henseleit buffer gassed with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 and maintained at 37 °C. Tissues were pre-contracted with the thromboxane mimetic U 46619 prior to cumulative concentration–response curves to the β-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol in the absence or presence of simvastatin (1, 5 or 10 μM), pravastatin (10 μM), or lovastatin (10 μM). Simvastatin inhibited the salbutamol-induced relaxation of the coronary artery. Similar effects were seen with lovastatin, but not <b>pravastatin</b> or the <b>sodium</b> salt of simvastatin. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin also inhibited the relaxations to the Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel opener NS 1619 and the KATP channel opener pinacidil. Unexpectedly, these data indicate that, rather than enhancing β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, lipophilic statins impair these responses. This is likely to be due to effects on K+ channels...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the pleiotropic effects to statins, we analyze the {{qualitative and quantitative}} retinal changes in hypercholesterolemic rabbits after a low-dosage statin treatment. For this purpose, New Zealand rabbits were split into three groups: control (G 0; n = 10), fed a standard diet; hypercholesterolemic (G 1; n = 8), fed a 0. 5 % cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months; and statins (G 2; n = 8), fed a 0. 5 % cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months, together with the administration of statin (<b>pravastatin</b> or fluvastatin <b>sodium)</b> at a dose of 2 mg / kg / day each diet. The retinas were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (glial fibrillary acidic protein). The retinal thickness of nuclear and plexiform layers were quantified in semi-thin sections. The results revealed that the low-statin-treated rabbits {{in comparison with the}} hypercholesterolemic group showed: i) a more preserved structure in all retinal layers; ii) a significant reduction in retinal thickness; iii) a decrease in cell death in the nuclear-and ganglion-cell layers; iv) a reduction of hydropic degeneration in the plexiform and nerve-fiber layers; v) a preservation of astrocytes and of the retinal area occupied by them; and vi) a better-preserved retinal vascular structure. Our findings indicate that low doses of statins can prevent retinal degeneration, acting on retinal macroglia, neurons and retinal vessels, despite that hypercholesterolemia remained unchanged. Thus, the pleiotropic effects of the statins may help safeguard the retinal ultrastructure...|$|R

Patients suffering severe dysphagia, {{who do not}} feed independently, receive enteral nutrition through feeding tube and they need alternative oral route also for the administration of pharmacological therapy. This research deals with the development and stability (chemical and microbiological) of an aqueous solution of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt that will be administered orally directly in the feeding tube starting from commercial tablets. Tablets formulation is the only pharmaceutical dosage form available {{on the market for}} this type of drug. Methods <b>Pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt tablets are dissolved in a preserved sodium bicarbonate solution at the final concentration of 4  mg/mL. Samples are stored in two different conditions until 60  days. The samples are prepared for high-performance liquid chromatography analysis coupled to a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), microbiological analysis and pH measurements. Results The chemical stability of the solution performed with HPLC-DAD analysis shows peaks’ overlapping, which are characteristic of pravastatin, and correspondence of the concentration of the active ingredient in the solution. The detected values are analysed by one-way analysis of variance showing no statistically significant differences. Microbiological analyses proved that there is not microbial growth. By considering the dilution factor applied, it was possible to express the result as < 10 CFU/mL in the two different culture media.

Mucoadhesive microparticles were formulated using eudragit S 100 and ethyl cellulose as mucoadhesive polymers. End-step modification of w/o/o double emulsion solvent diffusion method was attempted to improve the purity of the product, that can affect the dose calculations of sustained release formulations and hence bioavailability. Microparticles formed were discrete, free flowing, and exhibited good mucoadhesive properties. DSC and DRS showed stable character of drug in microparticles and absence of drug polymer interaction. The drug to polymer ratio and surfactant concentration had significant effect on mean particle size, drug release, and entrapment efficiency. Microparticles made with drug: eudragit S 100 ratio of 1 : 3 (F 6) exhibited maximum entrapment efficiency of 72. 7 % and ex vivo mucoadhesion time of 4. 15  h. In vitro permeation studies on goat intestinal mucosa demonstrated a flux rate (1, 243  μg/cm 2 /h) that was 169 times higher than the flux of pure drug. The gastric instability problem was overcome by formulating the optimized microparticles as enteric-coated capsules that provided a sustained delivery of the highly water-soluble drug for 12  h beyond the gastric region. The release mechanism was identified as fickian diffusion (n[*]=[*] 0. 4137) for the optimized formulation F 6.

40|$|MastersRed {{blood cells}} (RBCs) {{can provide a}} natural, safe and {{abundant}} carrier to prolong the life span in the bloodstream and thus enhance the efficacy of certain therapeutic agents, while restricting their accessibility to the extravascular compartment and thus reducing side effects. Methods for encapsulation of different drugs into RBCs have been proposed, including endocytosis, osmosis based and erythrocyte membrane perturbation. Drug loaded erythrocytes retain biological activity and circulate in a functionally active form in the bloodstream without hemolysis or elimination by reticuloendothelial system. Therefore, erythrocytes allow prolongation of the functional half-life of therapeutic drugs. Pravastatin {{is one of the}} most potent 3 -hydroxy- 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that are used in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. Recent evidence is now emerging indicating that statins may have beneficial actions apart from its hypolipidaemic effect. The statin drugs are now found also useful in the treatment of several diseases such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer, cardiac diseases, organ transplantation, stroke and diabetes. Pravastatin has low bioavailability (17 %) due to many reasons. The major one is the high destruction by gastric secretions, also, due to incomplete absorption via efflux effect of both CYP 450 and phosphrylated glycoprotein (Pgp). The aim of this study is to enhance drug bioavailability, decreasing its dose and develop a sustained release delivery system of pravastatin by using erythrocytes as drug carriers. In the current study pravastatin was loaded by two methods at different loading conditions to obtain optimum loading parameters. In addition to this, a new analytical method for pravastatin bioassay was developed to quantitate <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in the loaded erythrocytes. Chapter 1 : Literature review: Application and Safety of Erythrocytes as Novel Therapeutic Delivery Systems Carrier erythrocytes are one of biological drug delivery systems investigated in recent years. The erythrocytes are biocompatible, biodegradable as well as they have long half-life. The drugs with high toxicity, such as cardiotoxic and neurotoxic are selected to encapsulate in the erythrocytes because of their potential for delivery for the liver, spleen and lung. Physical methods like endocytosis and osmotic based methods are used for drug loading into erythrocytes, as well chemical methods are used for the same purpose. After loading of therapeutic agent on erythrocytes, the carrier cells are exposed to physical, cellular as well as biological characterizations. The resealed erythrocytes were used either for sustained release or targeted release of therapeutic agents. The targeted resealed erythrocytes are structurally modified either by glutaraldehyde, oxidizing agents or by drug itself. The modified carrier erythrocytes have tendency to be phagocytosed and this accelerates their removal from the circulation and facilitates in their targeting to the organs of reticuloendothelial system. Chapter 2 : Ultra performance liquid chromatography as a new validated method for determination of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in erythrocytes In this part of work, a new method for <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> bioanalysis in erythrocytes was developed using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). UPLC is a relatively new trend giving possibilities in liquid chromatography for, reducing analysis time, solvent consumption and maintaining good efficiency. Also, liquid/liquid extraction method of the drug from erythrocytes was assessed and validated. <b>Pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> was extracted from erythrocytes by addition of equal amounts of distilled water with vigorous shaking for blood hemolysis. After erythrocytes hemolysis, double amount of methanol was added, mixed and vortexed for complete protein precipitation. The final mix was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes, and then the supernatant was aspirated and diluted to known volume to be ready for analysis. The extraction method was validated, and average recovery was found between 108. 18 and 96. 09 % which is acceptable according to FDA guidelines. <b>Pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> extracted from pravastatin loaded erythrocytes was assayed according to the new developed method. The method was performed on AcquityR UPLC system, AcquityR UPLC BEH C 18 column (2. 1 mm x 50 mm, 1. 7 ƒÊm). The mobile phase was a mixture of 0. 25 % formic acid in distilled water and acetonitrile (65 : 35, v/v), with flow rate of 0. 5 ml/min and injection volume was 1 ƒÊl. Photodiode Array (PDA) detector was set to acquire 3 D data from 210 to 280 nm while the 2 D channel was recording at 237 nm, the Column temperature was kept at 50 oC while sample temperature was kept ambient. This method was validated and found to be linear with R 2 (0. 9987 } 0. 0001), LLOD (0. 1 ƒÊg/ml) and LLOQ (0. 5 ƒÊg/ml). Inter and intraday accuracy and precision at LLOQ and range containing low, medium and high concentrations of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in loaded erythrocytes were also within acceptable limits. Intraday and inter-day accuracy range was (97. 93 %- 102. 61 %) and (96. 91 %- 104. 75 %), respectively. Precision (RSD) within days were less than 6. 43 and 0. 31, and found to be less than 0. 29 and 7. 11 between three days. The major advantage of this method is the short retention time (0. 6 minutes) that allows running of large number of sample in shorter time. Chapter 3 : Loading of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in human erythrocytes using endocytosis method In this chapter endocytosis was used to load <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in erythrocytes. In endocytosis, the cell engulfs some of its extracellular fluid (ECF) including material dissolved or suspended. A portion of the plasma membrane is invaginated and pinched off forming a membrane-bounded vesicle called an endosome. Erythrocytes were separated from the whole blood by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes, and then the packed erythrocytes were washed and suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to final hematocrite 45 %. The erythrocytes f suspension was incubated with equal volume of PBS containing the drug and incubated for different times to study the effect of time, concentration and temperature. The drug concentrations selected were 2, 4, 8 and 10 mg/ml. The incubation times were 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes at temperatures 25 oC and 37 oC. Erythrocytes subjected to loading procedure were separated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 5000 rpm. The loaded erythrocytes were washed three times, and then the drug was extracted by liquid/liquid extraction and evaluated using UPLC as described in analysis chapter. (chapter 2). Pravastatin was loaded successfully into human erythrocytes with cell recovery 87 - 93 %, and no significant difference in morphology, hematology and osmotic fragility behavior of the loaded erythrocytes. An elevated loading of pravastatin into erythrocytes was associated with a higher concentration of pravastatin in the incubation medium, in the 2 - 10 mg/ml concentration range. The highest level of loaded pravastatin by endocytosis was attained using 10 mg/ml of pravastatin with a 2 h incubation time at temperature 37 oC. The highest loaded amount at 25 oC was 0. 32 mg/ 100 ƒÊl with loading efficiency 34 %, while at 37 oC, the highest loaded amount was 0. 69 mg/ 100 ƒÊl with loading efficiency 94 %. Chapter 4 : Loading of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> in human erythrocytes using hypotonic dilution method. In this chapter pravastatin loading by hypotonic dilution method is described. Hypotonic dilution technique depending on the fact that erythrocytes volume increases by 40 - 50 %, giving rise to holes on cell membrane ranging from 10 nm up to 500 nm by incubation in hypotonic solution. Water and its contents (dissolved drug) flow into the cell through the holes. Afterward, the erythrocytes were removed to an isotonic solution and gain its normal volume, shape and characters with entrapping dissolved drug. Washed erythrocytes are adjusted by PBS to form RBCs suspension with hematocrite 45 %. One volume of erythrocytes suspension is added to nine volumes of hypotonic PBS containing known concentration of the drug and incubated for different times at 4 oC. PBS was used in 3 different tonicities 0. 7, 0. 6 and 0. 6 %. After incubation period, erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant were removed. The packed erythrocytes are resealed in resealing buffer containing 2. 5 mmol of (ATP), 2. 5 mmol (MgCl 2) and 2. 5 mmol of (CaCl 2). This was done by gently mixing to avoid blood hemolysis and then, incubated for 60 minutes at 37 oC. The erythrocytes f suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and then, the supernatant was discarded and they were washed for 2 times in cold BPS with centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm. In this study the effect of drug concentration and incubation time were studied, in addition to study the effect of degree of hypotonicity by using hypotonic buffers with different salt (NaCl) concentrations (0. 7, 0. 6 and 0. 5 %) for loading. The results revealed that, human erythrocytes have been successfully loaded with pravastatin using hypotonic dilution method at salt concentration 0. 5 %, 0. 6 % and 0. 7 %, with acceptable loading parameters and moderate morphological changes. However, loading at salt concentration 0. 7 % exhibit morphological and hematological parameters as same as normal, but 0. 6 % was selected as optimum condition for drug loading due to combination of both, higher loaded amount with negligible effects on fragility and hematological parameters of erythrocytes. Chapter 5 : From the previous experiments, it was concluded that the <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> can be loaded successfully and efficiently into erythrocytes either by endocytosis or hypotonic dilution method with different loading efficiencies and different effects on morphological, hematological and fragility characters. In this part of work, pravastatin was loaded in erythrocytes and the release of pravastatin was studied to determine the possibility of using carrier erythrocytes as extended release system for pravastatin, and also to measure the release kinetics of the pravastatin from loaded erythrocytes in PBS and plasma as well as loaded erythrocytes treated with glutaraldehyde as across linking agent in PBS. Pravastatin was loaded by endocytosis and hypotonic dilution method to compare between them. Pravastatin release in PBS is rapid process compared to release in plasma and after glutaraldehyde treatment, it reaches 76 % in PBS after 20 hours and 83 % after 23 hours and decreased to 65 % after treat with glutaraldehyde after 20 hours and 72 % after 23 hours while in plasma it reaches only 66 % after 20 hours and 72 % after 23 hours. Erythrocytes loading by hypotonic dilution method produce 66 % release in PBS and 57 % after glutaraldhyde treatment after 20 hours. The releasing pattern of the drug from loaded erythrocytes obeyed first order kinetics. These results suggested that erythrocyte is suitable carrier for retarded released pravastatin. However, the relative impacts of different in vitro findings on the overall in vivo drug delivery efficacy of these cellular carriers remain to be evaluated during the future in vivo studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} kinetic spectrophotometric method for the quantitative analysis of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (PVS) in pure and pharmaceutical formulations has been described. The method {{is based on}} the formation of colored product between PVS and 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (NBD-Cl) in acetone medium at 55 ± 2 °C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 462 nm as a function of time. The initial rate and fixed time methods were adopted for constructing the calibration curves. The linearity ranges were found to be 15. 0 – 50. 0 and 10. 0 – 70. 0 μgmL− 1 for initial rate and fixed time methods, respectively. The limits of detection for initial rate and fixed time methods are 0. 029 and 0. 086 μgmL− 1, respectively.

The tissue RA level is maintained through a cas-cade of metabolic reactions where retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs) catalyze the terminal reaction of RA bio-synthesis from retinal, a rate-limiting step. We showed that dietary supplement of cholesterol enhanced the expression of RALDH 1 and 2 genes and the cellular RA content in vital organs such as brain, kidney, liver and heart. Consistently, the cholesterol-lowering agent (<b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium)</b> downregulated the expression of RALDH 1 and 2 genes in several organs especially the liver and in cultured liver cells. Further, cholesterol metabolites, predominantly the oxysterols, the natural ligands for liver X receptor (LXR), induced these genes via upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein- 1 c (SREBP- 1 c) that bound to the regulatory re-gions of these genes. Knockdown of LXRa/b or SREBP- 1 c downregulated the expression of RALDH genes, which could be rescued by re-expressing SREBP- 1 c, suggesting SREBP- 1 c as a direct positive regulator for these genes.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} hypolipidemic drug use at hospitals in Okinawa. We constructed a drug information database for prescriptions issued by 5 hospitals with over 300 beds in Okinawa (Okinawa Hokubu Hospital, Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Urasoe General Hospital, University of the Ryukyus Hospital and Okinawa Kyodo Hospital). A total of 16, 250 prescriptions was issued by the 5 hospitals from June 1 to 7, 1999 and among them 999 (6. 1 %) were for hypolipidemic drugs. Hypolipidemic drugs comprised the highest proportion of prescriptions in the 65 - 74 years age group and in the 45 - 84 years age group they accounted for 92. 9 % of the total. By chemical structure, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were prescribed the most among hypolipidemic drugs and nicotinic acid derivatives came second, followed by fibrates and probucol. In terms of individual drugs, <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> was most prescribed and then came simvastatin, tocopherol, nicotinate, bezafibrate and probucol in that order. These five drugs {{accounted for more than}} 95 % of all prescriptions. As for prescriptions for combinations of hypolipidemic drugs, the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates accounted for about 25 %. Since such combinations are contraindicated in principle, particular attention should be paid to adverse effects.

40|$|AbstractObjectives {{to elicit}} whether {{pre-treatment}} with pravastatin will prevent or ameliorate the acute lung injury that occurs following lower torso ischaemia–reperfusion (IR) in an experimental animal model. Materials and methods male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomised {{into three groups}} (n= 7 /group). The control group underwent a sham laparotomy and aortic dissection. The second group underwent infrarenal aortic cross clamping for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min. The third group pre-treated with <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (0. 4 mg/kg/day over 5 days) were again subjected to an ischaemia–reperfusion (IR) injury. The parameters used to assess lung injury included: Wet to dry lung weight ratio (W:D), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), protein concentration (BALprot) and neutrophil count (BAL PMN) of bronchoaveolar lavage fluid. Western blotting {{was used to determine}} the expression of constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) within lung tissue. Results IR causes an acute lung injury as indicated by statistically significant differences in W:D lung weight ratios, MPO activity, neutrophil count and BALprotein concentration in the IR group over that of controls. Pre-treatment with pravastatin attenuated this neutrophil infiltration and microvascular leakage. The pravastatin group showed a marked increased expression of ecNOS over that of the IR group and controls. Conclusion this data indicates that pre-treatment with pravastatin protects against ischaemia–reperfusion induced lung injury in an experimental animal model. We believe that its mechanism of action involves an upregulation of ecNOS, which increases basal expression of nitric oxide providing protective effects on the pulmonary circulation against microvascular injury...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} reductions in blood pressure (BP) with statin treatment, particularly in persons with hypertension. Randomized trial evidence is limited. Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with equal allocation to simvastatin, 20 mg; <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 40 mg; or placebo for 6 months. Nine hundred seventy-three men and women without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol screening levels of 115 to 190 mg/dL, had assessment of systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively). Blood pressure values were compared for placebo vs statins by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Additional analyses were performed that (1) were confined to subjects with neither high baseline BP (SBP � 140 mm Hg or DBP � 90 mm Hg) nor receiving BP medications, to exclude groups in whom BP medications or medication changes may have influenced results, and (2) separately evaluated simvastatin and pravastatin (vs placebo). The time course of BP changes after statin initiation {{and the effect of}} stopping statins on BP were examined. Results: Statins modestly but significantly reduced BP relative to placebo, by 2. 2 mm Hg for SBP (P =. 02) and 2. 4 mm Hg for DBP (P �. 001) in ITT analysis. Blood pressure reductions ranged from 2. 4 to 2. 8 mm Hg for both SBP and DBP with both simvastatin and pravastatin, in those subjects with full follow-up, and without potential for influence by BP medications (ie, neither receiving nor meriting BP medications). Conclusions: Reductions in SBP and DBP occurred with hydrophilic and lipophilic statins and extended to normotensive subjects. These modest effects may contribute to the reduced risk of stroke and cardiovascular events reported on statins...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{the use of}} pravastatin reduces the frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia and whether it is related to favorable outcomes in critical care patients. Design: Two-center, two-arm, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. Setting: University Hospital and General Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Patients: Consecutive patients were recruited from the intensive care units of the two hospitals. Patient inclusion criteria included mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay of > 48 hrs. Interventions: The two arms consisted of treatment plus oral <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (40 mg) (n = 71 patients, pravastatin group) and treatment without pravastatin (n = 81 patients, control group). Treatment was started after randomization and ended 30 days later. Measurements and Main Results: Ventilator-associated pneumonia frequency and intensive care unit mortality at 30 days {{and at the end}} of intensive care unit stay were measured. Adverse events related to statin treatment in the intensive care unit were documented. Sixteen patients (22. 5 %) in the pravastatin group and 28 (34. 5 %) in the control group (p =. 11) presented pneumonia during the 30 -day treatment period in the intensive care unit. There was an indication for increased probability of being free from ventilator-associated pneumonia during the 30 -day treatment period in the pravastatin group compared to the control group (p =. 06) and significantly increased probability during the whole intensive care unit period of stay (p =. 04) in the pravastatin group compared to the control group in the subgroup of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores of >= 15. Six patients (8. 45 %) in the pravastatin group and 16 (19. 85 %) in the control group died during the 30 -day treatment period (p =. 06), whereas 10 (14. 1 %) patients in the pravastatin group and 24 (29. 1 %) patients in the control group died during the whole period of intensive care unit stay (p =. 03). Pravastatin group patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores of >= 15 had significantly increased probability of survival compared to controls during the 30 -day treatment period (p =. 04). Creatine kinase and hepatic function enzyme levels during the whole study period were not significantly different between the pravastatin group and control group.

40|$|BackgroundRecent {{studies suggest}} that statins can protect the {{vasculature}} {{in a manner that}} is independent of their lipid-lowering activity through inhibition of the small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, Rho, and Rho-associated kinase. Little information is available on the inhibitory effect of statins on vein graft intimal hyperplasia, the main cause of late graft failure after bypass grafting. We therefore examined the effects of a hydrophilic statin on vein graft intimal hyperplasia in vivo and Rho-kinase activity in vitro. MethodsIn the first experiment, rabbits were randomized to a control group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow or to a pravastatin group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow supplemented with 10 mg/kg <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium.</b> The branches of the jugular vein were ligated and an approximately 3 -cm segment of the jugular vein was taken for an autologous reversed-vein graft. The carotid artery was cut and replaced with the harvested autologous jugular vein. At 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, vein grafts in both groups were harvested, and intimal hyperplasia of the vein grafts was assessed. In the second experiment, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured and then treated with 1 μmol/L and 30 μmol/L pravastatin for 24 hours and harvested. Immunoblotting was performed on the resulting precipitates. Quantitative evaluation of phosphorylated myosin binding subunit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was performed by densitometric analysis. ResultsWe demonstrated that oral administration of the hydrophilic statin pravastatin to normocholesterolemic rabbits inhibited intimal hyperplasia of carotid interposition-reversed jugular vein grafts 4 weeks after implantation (pravastatin group, 39. 5 ± 3. 5 μm vs control group, 64. 0 ± 7. 1 μm; n = 7; P <. 05) and suppressed cell proliferation and apoptosis in the neointima 2 weeks after implantation. In addition, we found that pravastatin inhibited Rho-kinase activity and accelerated endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but did not inhibit Rho-kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells. ConclusionsThese novel findings clearly demonstrate that a hydrophilic statin can suppress intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft in vivo and also show endothelial cell-tropic inhibition of Rho-kinase in vitro. Furthermore, these results strongly support the clinical use of hydrophilic statins to prevent intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft after bypass grafting. Clinical RelevanceLate graft failure caused by neointimal hyperplasia limits the efficacy of vein grafting. Various treatments were examined to reduce neointimal hyperplasia, but a standard clinical treatment has not yet been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that pravastatin showed endothelial cell-tropic benefits through both the inhibition of Rho-kinase activity and acceleration of eNOS expression in vitro. Because the clinical benefits and safety of pravastatin have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, pravastatin may soon become standard treatment after vein bypass grafting...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Pharmaceutics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs), {{which are}} incorporated in different formulations, i. e. creams, gels, foams, etc., {{are applied to}} the skin for a therapeutic effect. This therapeutic effect could either be required in {{the top layer of}} the skin (topical drug delivery) or deeper layers to reach the blood capillaries (transdermal drug delivery). Transdermal delivery avoids oral administration route limitations, such as first pass metabolism which is the rapid clearance of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract and degradation by enzymes. This delivery targets the drugs to skin sites, where there are significant advantages which include: improved patient compliance, a steady drug delivery state, less frequent dosing, adverse effects are minimal, it is less invasive and issues with the gastrointestinal absorption are avoided by eliminating the first pass metabolism (Perrie et al., 2012 : 392). This type of delivery is not free from limitations even though the skin can be employed for targeted drug delivery and is a readily available and large accessible surface area for adsorption of drugs. The most upper layer of the human skin, the stratum corneum, which is a watertight barrier, offers defence against hazardous exterior materials such as fungi, allergens, viruses and other molecules. This indicates the stratum corneum controls the drug penetration of most drugs to permeate the skin barrier (Lam & Gambari, 2014 : 27). Pravastatin is hydrophilic and is a 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor which inhibits cholesterol synthesis, a rate-limiting step, in the liver, thus decreasing the level of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Heath et al., 1998 : 42). It can also slow the progression of atherosclerosis and can lower the incident of coronary events (Haria & McTavish, 1997 : 299). The first aim of the study is to deliver pravastatin transdermally into the blood circulation. Currently, pravastatin is only administered in oral dosages and can cause highly negative adverse effects such as myopathy and increased liver enzymes. This increase in liver enzymes causes hepatotoxicity and therefore would be ideal if pravastatin could be delivered transdermally, as the first pass metabolic effect would be nullified and adverse effects would decrease drastically (Gadi et al., 2013 : 648). Prof JW Wiechers‟ Delivery Gap Principle was designed in attempt to effectively enhance transdermal drug delivery. This Delivery Gap Principle was incorporated in the computer programme he developed known as “Formulating for Efficacy” (FFE™). The transdermal delivery of suggested APIs, which in this case is pravastatin, when incorporated into a formulation, may be optimised transdermally. The FFE™ computer programme suggests that the oil phase can be optimised, which in turn leads to better permeation through the skin to the target site (transdermal). The formula can be manipulated to reach desired polarity. The second aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the implementation of Wiechers‟ Delivery Gap Principle in a semi-solid dosage form, for the transdermal delivery of <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (2 %). Six formulations, of which three were cream and three were emulgel formulations incorporated with <b>pravastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (2 %), were formulated. Each formulation had a different polarity, i. e. hydrophilic cream (HC) and emulgel (HE), lipophilic cream (LC) and emulgel (LE) and optimised cream (OC) and emulgel (OE). A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated to analyse the concentration of pravastatin. Both the octanol-buffer distribution coefficient (log D) and the aqueous solubility of pravastatin were determined. For the API to permeate through the skin into the blood circulation, certain physicochemical properties are important and according to Naik et al (2000 : 321), there are specific ideal limits for the API in the formulations which include log D (1 to 3) and a aqueous solubility of > 1 mg/ml. The aqueous solubility of 197. 5 mg/ml in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7. 4) at a temperature of 32 °C indicated penetration was favourable (Naik et al., 2000 : 321), whilst the log D value of - 0. 703 indicated the API was unfavourable for skin penetration (Naik et al., 2000 : 321). Membrane release studies were conducted using a synthetic membrane to determine whether pravastatin was released from the six formulations each containing 2 % pravastatin prior to diffusion studies with. The OE yielded the highest median flux value (7. 175 μg/cm 2. h), followed the by LE (6. 401 μg/cm 2. h), HE (6. 355 μg/cm 2. h), HC (5. 061 μg/cm 2. h), OC (4. 297 μg/cm 2. h) and lastly, LC (3. 115 μg/cm 2. h). By looking at the aforementioned data values, it was concluded that the emulgels performed better than the cream formulations when median flux values were compared. By using dermatomed excised female Caucasian skin, an execution of Franz cell diffusion studies were performed over a period of 12 h, followed by a tape-stripping experiment to determine which semi-solid formulation delivered pravastatin best on the skin and the results of the different polarity formulations were compared. The median amount per area which permeated through the skin after 12 h was as follows: the OE formulation (2. 578 μg/cm 2) depicted the highest median amount per area, followed by OC (1. 449 μg/cm 2), HC (0. 434 μg/cm 2), LE (0. 121 μg/cm 2), HE (0. 055 μg/cm 2) and lastly LC (0. 000 μg/cm 2). These results validate Wiechers` theory that when the oil phase is optimised, with regard to the same polarity as the skin, permeation will be enhanced (Wiechers, 2011). During both the membrane studies and the skin diffusion studies it was evident the emulgel formulations performed better and pravastatin permeated better than the cream formulations. When skin diffusion and membrane median data values were compared, it was evident in both the membrane release studies and the skin diffusion studies that OE yielded the highest median values and LC the lowest median values. It was clear that all six different formulations released pravastatin, but LC displayed no permeation into the systemic circulation (receptor phase). The data of the different polarity formulations which yielded the best results with regards to median concentrations within the stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis, were identified and are: within the stratum corneum-epidermis, HE (1. 448 μg/ml) yielded the highest median concentration pravastatin, followed by LE (1. 301 μg/ml), LC (0. 676 μg/ml), HC (0. 505 μg/ml), OE (0. 505 μg/ml) and lastly OC (0. 400 μg/ml). As emulgels (hydrophilic) contain more water than creams (lipophilic), the penetration enhancement effect can be explained by hydration, since the water hydrated the skin leading the lipids to open and the stratum corneum to swell (Williams & Barry, 2004 : 606). Therefore more API could permeate into the skin. Within the epidermis-dermis the highest median concentration median was yielded by OE (0. 849 μg/ml), followed by LC (0. 572 μg/ml), HC (0. 524 μg/ml), OC (0. 355 μg/ml), HE (0. 309 μg/ml) and lastly LE (0. 138 μg/ml). Different polarity formulations permeating the viable epidermis could be a result of the solubility characteristics of the formulations. It contained both lipid properties (formulations contained oil content), leading to permeation through the stratum corneum and aqueous properties, which lead to diffusion into the underlying layers of the epidermis (Perrie et al., 2012 : 392). According to Perrie (2012 : 392), formulations that need to be delivered transdermally, must permeate through the lipophilic stratum corneum and thereafter the hydrophilic dermal layers to reach the blood circulation, which means formulations must consist of both lipophilic and aqueous solubility properties. When comparing the stratum corneum-epidermis (lipophilic) with the epidermis-dermis (more hydrophilic) and receptor phase (hydrophilic; systemic circulation), it is evident that all formulations had lipophilic and hydrophilic properties, as the API permeated through the stratum corneum and penetrated the deeper layers of the skin (viable epidermis) When all polarity formulations were compared, i. e. optimised, hydrophilic and lipophilic, it was observed that the optimised formulations depicted the highest median concentration values in the receptor phase (skin diffusion), but lowest median concentration in stratum corneum-epidermis, therefore the optimised formulation permeated best through the stratum corneum-epidermis. The reason for this could be that the optimised formulations had the same polarity as the skin (17, 8, 8), thus permeating through the skin to the receptor fluid more efficiently (Wiechers, 2011). It was observed that LC penetrated both stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis, but did not permeate through the skin to the receptor fluid (systemic circulation), making it a good delivery vehicle for topical delivery. Overall when the emulgel and cream formulations are compared, according to their ability to deliver pravastatin transdermally, it is evident the pravastatin diffused more from the emulgel formulations than the cream formulations. This could be {{due to the fact that}} emulgels are more hydrophilic as they contain more water, resulting in the emulgels diffusing to the deeper layers of the skin (more hydrophilic viable epidermis) (Benson, 2005 : 28). All formulations contained not only aqueous (hydrophilic) but also lipid (lipophilic) solubility properties, therefore making it lipophilic enough to permeate the stratum corneum and hydrophilic enough to penetrate to deeper skin layers (viable epidermis) (Perrie et al., 2012 : 392). All formulations could still permeate the viable epidermis despite different polarities being used and all were appropriate candidates, although some were more suitable than others. The understanding from this study is that: * pravastatin could be delivered topically by all formulations, * the best formulation to reach the systemic formulation is the optimised emulgel, * the best formulation to deliver pravastatin topically is the hydrophilic emulgel.
