50|$|Brown v. Barry, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{determined}} the following: The suspension of a statute for a limited time is not a repeal of it.The intention of the legislature when discovered must prevail, any rule of construction. declared by previous acts, to the contrary notwithstanding.In an action on a bill of exchange, which had not been protested for non-payment, {{it is not necessary to}} aver in the declaration that the bill had been protested for non-acceptance.As to bills of exchange drawn in the United States payable in Europe, the custom of merchants in this country does not ordinarily require, to recover on a protest for non-payment, that a <b>protest</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance</b> shall be produced, though the bills were not accepted.Where the action is for foreign money, and its value is not averred, a verdict cures the defect.The reason that debet for foreign money is ill, is the uncertainty of its value; and this is cured by a verdict.|$|E

40|$|One hundred {{patients}} {{suffering from}} various allergic disorders due to inhalants were advised to u soft nasal filters. They included 46 patients of urticaria, 44 patients of bronchial asthma and 10 patients of allergic rhinitis. The response was excellent in 47 %, good in 32 % and poor in 21 % cases. The acceptance rate was 80 %. The main reasons. <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance,</b> were foreign body sensation, increased nasal secretions and cosmetic problem, The main drawback in soft nasal filters was their short life because these {{did not last}} for more than, six months even when used under standard conditions...|$|R
40|$|From {{a survey}} of the West Midlands and Mersey Regions and the Grampian Health Board, we found that in 1978 and 1979 some 122 {{patients}} with chronic renal failure died in hospital under the age of 50. Of these, 69 had been given dialysis or transplantation, or both, while for many reasons the remainder had been considered unsuitable. While the criteria varied, the reasons given <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance</b> of cases seemed sound, and in no instance during this particular period was a patient denied dialysis because of a shortage of machines. We think that the public should be aware of these findings and not led to think that if only enough dialysis machines were available death from renal failure would be a rarity...|$|R

The Justices assembled in the Town Hall, and the prisoners were brought in, who 'made their prayers secretly to God for a space of time' with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven. The articles were read to them, but even the first proved impossible to accept, that 'after the consecration of the Host, there is present really the natural body and blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the said consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine.' the penalty <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance</b> was prescribed to be 'death by burning, without any abjuration, benefit of the clergy, or sanctuary.' ...|$|R

40|$|With {{an aging}} global population, {{the number of}} people living with a chronic illness is {{expected}} to increase significantly by 2050. If left unmanaged, chronic care leads to serious health complications, resulting in poor patient quality of life and a costly time bomb for care providers. If effectively managed, patients with chronic care tend to live a richer and more healthy life, resulting in a less costly total care solution. This chapter considers literature from the areas of technology acceptance and care self-management, which aims to alleviate symptoms and/or reason <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance</b> of care, and thus minimise the risk of long-term complications, which in turn reduces the chance of spiralling health expenditure. By bringing together these areas, the chapter highlights areas where self-management is failing so that changes can be made in care in advance of health deterioration...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To examine {{likelihood}} of parental acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent girls, together with reasons <b>for</b> acceptance and <b>non-acceptance.</b> The {{ultimate goal of}} this research is to inform policy decisions and educational planning in this area. Methods: A random-digit-dial telephone survey of parents in California households was conducted, yielding 522 parents with an eligible daughter. Cross tabulations and odds ratios were employed to analyze {{likelihood of}} vaccination acceptability. Reasons provided <b>for</b> acceptance or <b>non-acceptance</b> were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Overall, 75 % of the sample reported that they would be likely to vaccinate a daughter before age 13. Hispanic parents were more likely to accept vaccination than were non-Hispanic parents, while African-American and Asian-American parents were less likely. Other subgroups less likely to accept vaccination were identified. Five clusters of reasons by non-accepting parents emerged: pragmatic concerns about effects on sexual behavior, specific HPV vaccine concerns, moral concerns about sexual behavior, general vaccine concerns, and denial of need. A sixth group of interest comprised those who would vaccinate before age 16 but not age 13. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies on this topic, a large majority of California parents endorsed HPV vaccination for daughters by the recommend age. Although important subgroup disparities were found, majorities of all subgroups supported vaccination. This information, together with the identified clusters of cognitive decision factors <b>for</b> <b>non-acceptance,</b> has implications <b>for</b> policy decisions and educational planning in this area. Suggestions for further research on subgroup disparities and on cognitive factors involved in parentsâ€™ decisions arise from these findings...|$|R
