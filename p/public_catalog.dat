The NYPL closed the Rose Main Reading Room and the Bill Blass <b>Public</b> <b>Catalog</b> Room for renovations. The $12 million {{restoration}} project included “recreating and replacing the rosette that fell, reinforcing each rosette with steel cables, and installing LED lighting.” The NYPL commissioned EverGreene Architectural Arts to recreate the mural in the Bill Blass <b>Public</b> <b>Catalog</b> Room, which had “suffered irreparable discoloration, overpainting and water damage” during its 105-year history. The NYPL also installed a $2.6 million book delivery system, using a conveyor belt and 24 book carts that could each carry up to [...] through the library's eleven levels. The restored Rose Main Reading Room and Bill Blass <b>Public</b> <b>Catalog</b> Room reopened October 5, 2016.|$|E
2500|$|The card catalogs {{presented}} {{a problem of}} greater complexity. The 1876 card catalog begun by Brevoort recorded {{a part of the}} accessions received after 1866. There was one set of cards {{for the use of the}} public, and another duplicate set for official use. This was at first mainly a subject or rather a broadly grouped classed catalog. The cards were about 5 inches long by [...] high. For author entries reliance was made upon the interleaved copies of the Cogswell printed catalog and upon a set of author cards — by no means a complete record — for public use. In 1880 when work began upon the new printed catalog this card catalog was closed; its author cards were destroyed when the new catalog was issued, but revision of the subject group continued as occasion offered until after the 1895 consolidation. After 1880, three card catalogs continued until the 1895 consolidation: (1) an official “Bulletin,” on large cards, for works acquired after 1880, mainly an author arrangement; (2) the public “small card” catalog, a dictionary catalog of authors and subjects; (3) the official “small card” catalog, likewise a dictionary arrangement of authors and subjects, but written on thinner cards. [...] The <b>public</b> <b>catalog</b> was severely criticized in the public press for various idiosyncrasies, example articles being “A Library's Buried Treasures” in The New York Times of June 8, 1881, and in September 1881 a critical letter submitted to the Boston Transcript over the signature of “Delta.” The second article was reprinted in the Library Journal of September–October 1881 (pp.259–261, with editorial comment on pp.255–256).|$|E
