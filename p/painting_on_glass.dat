25|$|After {{independence}} in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by {{the dynamics of}} nation building and by artists serving the state. A Ministry of Culture was established, {{under the leadership of}} ministers such as Habib Boularès who oversaw art and education and power. Artists gained international recognition such as Hatem El Mekki or Zoubeir Turki and influenced a generation of new young painters. Sadok Gmech draws his inspiration from national wealth while Moncef Ben Amor turns to fantasy. In another development, Youssef Rekik reused the technique of <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> and founded Nja Mahdaoui calligraphy with its mystical dimension.|$|E

Happily, Mason tells us the result.|$|E

In general, {{the three}} great, or fine, Arts of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, are {{thought of as}} {{distinct}} from the lower and more mechanical formative arts, such as carpentry or pottery. But we cannot, either verbally, or with any practical advantage, admit such classification. How are we to distinguish painting on canvas from painting on china?--or painting on china from painting on glass?--or <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> from infusion of color into any vitreous substance, such as enamel?--or the infusion of color into glass and enamel from the infusion of color into wool or silk, and weaving of pictures in tapestry, or patterns in dress? You will find that although, in ultimately accurate use of the word, painting must be held to mean only the laying of a pigment on a surface with a soft instrument; yet, in broad comparison of the functions of Art, we must conceive of {{one and the same}} great artistic faculty, as governing every mode of disposing colors in a permanent relation on, or in, a solid substance; whether it be by tinting canvas, or dyeing stuffs; inlaying metals with fused flint, or coating walls with colored stone.|$|E

Colonnade rose over colonnade; the {{pediment}} of the western front was lifted into a detached and scenic wall; story above story sprang the multiplied arches of the Campanile, and the eastern pyramidal fire-type, lifted from its foundation, was placed upon the summit. With the superimposed arcades of the principal front arose the necessity, instantly felt by their subtle architects, of a new proportion in the column; the lower wall inclosure, necessarily {{for the purposes of}} Christian worship continuous, and needing no peristyle, rendered the lower columns a mere facial decoration, whose proportions were evidently no more to be regulated by the laws hitherto observed in detached colonnades. The column expanded into the shaft, or into the huge pilaster rising unbanded from tier to tier; shaft and pilaster were associated in ordered groups, and the ideas of singleness and limited elevation once attached to them, swept away for ever; the stilted and variously centered arch existed already: the pure ogive followed--where first exhibited we stay not to inquire;--finally, and chief of all, the great mechanical discovery of the resistance of lateral pressure by the weight of the superimposed flanking pinnacle. Daring concentrations of pressure upon narrow piers were the immediate consequence, and the recognition of the buttress as a feature in itself agreeable and susceptible of decoration. The glorious art of <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> added its temptations; the darkness of northern climes both rendering the typical character of Light more deeply felt than in Italy, and necessitating its admission in larger masses; the Italian, even at the period of his most exquisite art in glass, retaining the small Lombard window, whose expediency will hardly be doubted by anyone who has experienced the transition from the scorching reverberation of the white-hot marble front, to the cool depth of shade within, and whose beauty will not be soon forgotten by those who have seen the narrow lights of the Pisan duomo announce by their redder burning, not like transparent casements, but like characters of fire searing the western wall, the decline of day upon Capraja.|$|E

5000|$|Reverse <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> is an {{art form}} {{consisting}} of applying paint {{to a piece of}} glass and then viewing the image by turning the glass over and looking through the glass at the image. Another term used to refer to the art of cold painting and gilding on the back of glass is verre églomisé, named after the French decorator Jean-Baptiste Glomy (1711-86), who framed prints using glass that had been reverse-painted. In German it is known as Hinterglasmalerei.This art form has been around for many years. It was widely used for sacral paintings since the Middle Ages. The most famous was the art of icons in the Byzantine Empire. Later the <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> spread to Italy, where in Venice it influenced its Renaissance art. Since the middle of the 18th century, <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> became favored by the Church and the nobility throughout Central Europe. A number of clock faces were created using this technique in the early-to-mid-19th century. Throughout the 19th century <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> was widely popular as folk art in Austria, Bavaria, Moravia, Bohemia and Slovakia. Unfortunately, during the inter-war period (1914-1945) this traditional [...] "naive" [...] technique fell nearly to a complete oblivion and its methods of paint composition and structural layout had to be re-invented by combining acrylic and oil paints. Also the style of painting and especially the themes had to be varied and adjusted to new perceptions of the world in modern times. Thus <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> started to become popular again since the 1990s. However, many painters of this genre affirm that abandoning that unique tradition of naivist approach to <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> is rather difficult. Therefore, the <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>glass</b> becomes a natural selection for refurbishing a new house built in a traditional rustic style. For example, the recently erected Catholic church at Radôstka in Northern Slovakia opted for having its Stations of the Cross on 14 large pictures - all painted on glass.|$|E
