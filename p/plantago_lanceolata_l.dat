40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} species structure of vegetation on vineyards. Observation was carried out on two seperate vineyards in one location, and in total at thirteen different points. Vegetation was evaluated via phytocenological images Evaluation took place {{over a period of}} three years (2014, 2015, 2016) during spring, summer and autumn. Observation was statistically evaluated by DCA and CCA analysis. At both vineyards a total of 58 species of plants were found.

40|$|The model {{proposed}} in the first paper in this series predicts that in mixtures of plant species with different rooting depths {{there will be an}} inverse correlation between the relative crowding coefficient of the deep rooting species with respect to the shallow rooting one and the frequency of the deep rooting plants. Two field experiments are reported in which this phenomenon was observed. The first experiment involved <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.</b> and Lolium perenne L. and the second involved <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.</b> and Anthoxanthum odoratum L. In a third competition experiment between <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.</b> and Anthoxanthum odoratum L. it was tested whether this observed phenomenon was indeed caused by the differences between the rooting depths of these species. The experiment was divided into one series where different rooting depths were possible and one series where gauze with a narrow mesh width prevented differences between rooting depths. In the series without gauze the predicted frequency-dependence of the relative crowding coefficient was observed, whereas in the series with gauze the relative crowding coefficient was independent of plant frequency. A comparison between the yields in the series with and without gauze suggests that in mixture Plantago is forced to utilize the nutrients from deeper soil layers, whereas {{this is not the case}} in monoculture. Although such phenomena complicate the description of the process investigated, it is concluded that the model proposed provides an approximate prediction of most results of the experiments which were carried out...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most {{valuable}} dicotyledonous pasture herbs found on meadows and pastures. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> on yields and quality of twice harvested semi-natural meadow swards utilized according to agri-environment programme guidelines (P 10 b variant), as well as on pastures established using mixtures containing <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata.</b> On studied meadows, presence of <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> in amounts exceeding 3 % of the total yield could be seen as an indicator of negative changes in humidity and tropism, causing a reduction in dry mass yields and the deterioration of sward quality after the first harvest. Meanwhile, yields from pastures containing <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> were almost four times higher. Furthermore, <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> ingested by cows contained more protein, sugars and crude ash including calcium and phosphorus while containing less fiber than Dactylis glomerata and Lolium perenne. Furthermore, <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> was more abundant than Trifolium repens, also included in the sowing mixture...|$|R

This paper presents a comparative morphological and qualitative phytochemical investigation of P. media L. leaves with P. major L. and P. lanceolata L. leaves {{in order to}} ensure their proper identification and avoid adulteration. The qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed that P. media leaves, similarly to P. major and P. lanceolata, contain important groups of bioactive constituents as carbohydrates, flavonoids, tannins and alkaloids. These results define P. media leaves as a promising natural source of biologically active compounds and would be beneficial in future pharmacological studies.

These plant extracts {{were subjected to}} screening for their possible effects as analgesic, and anti-inflammatory agents. The plant materials (only leaves were used in this study) were used in 4 solvents (acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform and hexane). <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> hexane leaf extract inhibited cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) activity with an IC 50 value of 0. 41 μg/mL. Quercetin, positive control in this study inhibited COX- 2 with a recorded IC 50 = 8. 39 μg/mL. However, the COX- 1 inhibition by same extract indicated an IC 50 of 68. 99 μg/mL compared to the positive control (quercetin), whose activity was represented with an IC 50 value of 4. 6 μg/mL.

40|$|A {{baseline}} study of leaf stomatal density, stomatal indices, guard cell length and leaf area {{was made in}} three species; a grass, Sesleria caerulea L., a herb, <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.,</b> and a tree, Acer pseudoplatanus L. in relation to environmental parameters. Chlorophyll analysis was also investigated {{to see if a}} relationship existed between density of stomata and chlorophyll content. Multivariate analysis of variance showed: significant variation of the stomatal index (SI) and stomatal density in the three species in situ in the field: generally both parameters increasing with increasing altitude but with some variation across the P. lanceolata L. sites. Leaf area was significantly reduced at higher altitudes in all species. Guard cell length significantly decreased with increasing altitude in 5. caerulea L., and A. pseudoplatanus L. but varied in P. lanceolata L. across sites. Within habitat, P. lanceolata L. appeared to show {{no significant difference in the}} SI compared to between habitat variation at both sites studied. Stomatal density was generally greater on the abaxial leaf surface of P. lanceolata L. Apart from two plant populations, no significant difference was found in the SI between the adaxial and abaxial surface. Regression analysis showed soil depth, moisture and altitude explained a considerable amount of the variation in the data. Transplants of Acer pseudoplatanus L., showed a significant increase in stomatal density and the SI with increasing altitude. Guard Cell length significantiy decreased with increasing altitude. Experimentally water-stressed plants showed variation. Sesleria caerulea L. and <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.,</b> both significantiy increased stomatal density but decreased the SI with increasing stress. The exception was in the adaxial surface of the leaves of <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.</b> from Widdybank Fell which showed no difference in the leaf SI between treatments. Leaf area was significantly reduced except in S. caerulea L. from Widdybank Fell. The SI and stomatal density increased with increasing water stress in Acer pseudoplatanus L. Guard cell length decreased significantly in the three species under water stress. Shading of Acer pseudoplatanus L. significantiy reduced stomatal density and the SI but increased the number of stomata per leaf Leaf area and guard cell size significantly increased under shade. Total chlorophyll (chl) significantly increased with increasing altitude in S. caerulea L. and A. pseudoplatanus L. but varied in P. lanceolata L. across sites. Total Chl decreased with increasing altitude in A. pseudoplatanus L. transplants. Full grown low light leaves of A. pseudoplatanus L. had more total chlorophyll per unit fresh weight than high-light leaves but the content per unit area of leaf surface was lower in low-light leaves. Under a varied watering regime, the two species studied for chlorophyll content (A. pseudoplatanus L. and P. lanceolata L.), showed a differential response, total chl increasing slightly in A. pseudoplatanus L. but with no pattern emerging in P. lanceolata L. Conclusions drawn from this study indicate there is considerable variation both in the density and proportion of stomata produced (Stomatal index) in these three species both in the field and under manipulated environmental conditions which may have both a genetic and plastic base. This suggests care should be taken in interpreting morphological, anatomical and physiological changes in plants which may result from climatic change, in particular increased CO 2 levels...|$|E
40|$|Caged greenheaded leafroller (Planotortrix excessana (Walker)) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyaspostvittana (Walker)) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) {{adults were}} {{provided}} with the leaves of known larval host plants to determine the relative amount of oviposition on the different hosts. Relative to apple leaves, lightbrown apple moth oviposited fewer eggs on narrow-leaved plantain (<b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.),</b> and blackberry (Rubus st~igolosus agg.) and equal numbers on poplar (Populus nigra L.). Greenheaded leafrollers laid more eggs on poplar leaves than on apple leaves. Close examination of the likely factors determining oviposition sites revealed that hairs on the dorsal leaf surface could affect the choice of oviposition sites. Lightbrown apple moths therefore tended to oviposit more frequently on the less hairy mature leaves of apple shoots compared to more hairy, emerging leaves which had a greater density of dorsal surface leaf hairs. Arrangement of host plant leaf clusters may have affected oviposition site preference as lightbrown apple moths tended to lay relatively more eggs on apple fruiting clusters than shoots...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of low chromium concentrations (5 fM CrCI 3) decreased chlorophyll content of iron-deficient plants, {{but did not}} cause visual toxicity symptoms in iron-sufficient plants. No significant plant growth differ-entials were obtained {{in response to the}} various treat-ments. Chromium application to iron-deficient <b>Plantago</b> <b>lanceolata</b> <b>L.</b> roots increased the activity of root-associated Fe(lll) reductase. This effect was evident only with acceptors of the turbo reductase and was not observed in iron-sufficient plants. Chromium accumu-lated in the roots, but was poorly transported to the leaves. In split-root experiments, which allowed only a part of the root system to receive chromium, while the other portion was grown in iron-free medium, roots subjected to either treatment showed an intermediate FeEDTA reductase activity with respect to non-split control plants.
