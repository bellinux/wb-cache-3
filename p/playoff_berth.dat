After 1993, the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs for 21 consecutive seasons, until clinching a <b>playoff</b> <b>berth</b> in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Tiki Barber {{emerged as}} a solid pass–{{catching}} running back, catching 66 passes. Wide receiver Amani Toomer also had a breakout season, accumulating over 1,100 yards receiving and six touchdowns, and Ike Hilliard finished just shy of 1,000 yards receiving. The defense rebounded, ranking 11th in the league, and Armstead and Strahan again were selected to the Pro Bowl. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 and poised for a <b>playoff</b> <b>berth,</b> they lost their final three games to miss the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a massive disparity between the East and West Divisions, it decided {{in the middle of}} the season to grant the fourth place Western team a <b>playoff</b> <b>berth.</b> There was speculation this was done in part to ensure Sacramento remained in playoff contention as long as possible and at the insistence of Ryckman, who preferred the revenue of two playoff games for his first place Stampeders over a first-round bye.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 2010, Sanchez {{underwent}} {{surgery to repair}} the patella ligament in his left knee that he originally injured when he played for USC. The surgery was successful. Sanchez was expected to miss early workouts and return in time for training camp however Sanchez made a quick recovery and participated in team drills during Organized Team Activities (OTA). The Jets opened the 2010 season with a 5–1 record despite the passing game being subpar as Sanchez struggled to accurately throw the football. Sanchez recorded his first career 300-yard passing game in a win over the Detroit Lions on November 7, 2010. At 10–4, the Jets faced the Chicago Bears on December 26, 2010 {{with a chance to}} clinch a <b>playoff</b> <b>berth.</b> Though Sanchez injured his shoulder in a victory over Pittsburgh the previous week, he started the game completing 24 of his 37 passes for a touchdown and an interception. However, the Jets were unable to defend the Bears' offense and subsequently lost the game 38–34 after a comeback drive was halted when Sanchez was intercepted. Due to a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars that same day, the Jets clinched the <b>playoff</b> <b>berth.</b> Sanchez finished the season with 3,291 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.|$|E

McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first <b>playoff</b> <b>berth</b> since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E

Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher Don Black, {{who suffered a}} cerebral hemorrhage the previous month. The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series, winning it four games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered the fire department sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. The sirens did sound, but it was instead for {{a fire in the}} Boston navy yard.|$|E
5|$|After Carter left, Chris Bosh {{emerged as}} the team leader.
