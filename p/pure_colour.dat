5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by Ruskin, Pugin and the Gothic Revival, {{some artists}} sought to {{reproduce}} the style of figures that they saw in ancient glass, illuminated manuscripts and the few remaining English wall paintings of the Gothic period. A major source {{was provided by the}} Biblia Pauperum [...] or so-called [...] "Poor Man's Bible". The resulting figures are elongated, curvilinear and stylised rather than naturalistic. The drapery folds and scrolls are exaggerated and the gestures are expansive. The painted details are highly linear, crisply defined and elegant. The style lent itself to narrative, to <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> and to highly decorative effects. While the figures may seem quaint or even naïve, the quality of design of many of these windows is often highly sophisticated and the detailing exquisite. [...] The masters of Gothic revival were John Hardman and Co. of Birmingham and Clayton and Bell.|$|E

50|$|Van den Broek often uses {{saturated}} and high-key colours. In his work, {{space is}} made by its borders and demarcations, and light is evoked with shadow, without midtones. This lends to his work often a graphic character, with <b>pure</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{lays down}} {{the tenets of}} {{painting}} such as the proper set of colours and the right combinations which leads to stylized balance and rhythm. It is adhered to as principles in South Indian paintings known as Dravidian mural art or Dravidian mural painting.

60|$|Two main facts, then, {{you have}} to study in every flower: the {{symmetry}} or order of it, and the perfection of its substance; first, {{the manner in which}} the leaves are placed for beauty of form; then the spinning and weaving and blanching of their tissue, for the reception of <b>purest</b> <b>colour,</b> or refining to richest surface.|$|R
6000|$|... 174. Now, {{the course}} of our main colour schools is briefly this:--First we have, {{returning}} to our hexagonal scheme, line; then spaces filled with pure colour; and then masses expressed or rounded with <b>pure</b> <b>colour.</b> And during these two stages the masters of colour delight in the purest tints, and endeavour as far as possible to rival those of opals and flowers. In saying [...] "the purest tints," [...] I do not mean the simplest types of red, blue, and yellow, but the most pure tints obtainable by their combinations.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took this}} in with wider eyes: {{he had put}} the matter {{in a way that}} struck her. For a moment, all the same, he was afraid she would reply as on the confessed {{experience}} of so many such tributes, handsome as this one was. But she was too much moved--the <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> that had risen to her face showed it--to have recourse to this particular facility. She was moved even to the glimmer of tears, though she gave him her hand with a smile. [...] "I'm so glad you've said all that, for from you I know what it means. Certainly it's better for you to go away. Of course it's all wrong, isn't it?--but that's the only thing it can be: therefore it's all right, isn't it? Some day when we're both great people we'll talk these things over; then we shall be quiet, we shall be rich, we shall be at peace--let us hope so at least--and better friends than others about us will know." [...] She paused, smiling still, and then said while he held her hand: [...] "Don't, don't come to-morrow night." ...|$|E
60|$|And, first, of materials. Use hard cake colours, not moist colours: grind a {{sufficient}} quantity of each on your palette every morning, keeping a separate plate, large and deep, for colours {{to be used}} in broad washes, and wash both plate and palette every evening, so as to be able always to get good and <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> when you need it; and force yourself into cleanly and orderly habits about your colours. The two best colourists of modern times, Turner and Rossetti,[234] afford us, I am sorry to say, no confirmation of this precept by their practice. Turner was, and Rossetti is, as slovenly in all their procedures as men can well be; but the result of this was, with Turner, that the colours have altered in all his pictures, and in many of his drawings; and the result of it with Rossetti is, that, though his colours are safe, he has sometimes to throw aside work that was half done, and begin over again. William Hunt, of the Old Water-colour, is very neat in his practice; so, I believe, is Mulready; so is John Lewis; and so are the leading Pre-Raphaelites, Rossetti only excepted. And {{there can be no doubt}} about the goodness of the advice, if it were only for this reason, that the more particular you are about your colours the more you will get into a deliberate and methodical habit in using them, and all true speed in colouring comes of this deliberation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885 he met Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, {{both of whom}} {{relied on}} a more [...] "scientific" [...] theory of {{painting}} by using very small patches of <b>pure</b> <b>colours</b> {{to create the illusion}} of blended colours and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as pointillism. The paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son Lucien.|$|R

30|$|Beside {{the use of}} lead chromates as <b>pure</b> <b>colouring</b> pigments, {{these were}} also used {{together}} with SOPs like PY 3 for shades of yellow or PR 3 for pink. The absence of green pigments should is noticeable. The green colours were made by mixing blue and yellow e.g. chrome yellow and PB 15, or PY 3 and PB 15. This is possibly due to financial aspects in fabrication of house paint as low-cost green shades combining PB 15 with yellow pigments are cheaper than e.g. the green copper phthalocyanine complex PG 7 or chromium oxide greens (Cr 2 O 3 or Cr 2 O 3 · 2 H 2 O) [24, 25].|$|R
50|$|His {{paintings}} were increasingly Impressionist, full of ever brighter light and often depicting {{a young woman}} clothed in white. Using short brush strokes, he would make abundant use of blues and greens. Then, in 1912-13, he began to adopt the <b>pure</b> <b>colouring</b> favoured by Monet, Renoir and Pissarro. Around this time, he began to venture out {{along the banks of}} the River Alzette painting scenes of orchards, flower picking and fruit harvesting or of the peasant's houses in the area where he lived.

5000|$|The summers of 1901, 1903 and 1904 {{were spent}} in Poland {{and it was}} here that some of his most {{colourful}} work was produced. The influence of Gauguin was a key role in Bevan's development, helping him to discover the <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> which led him to a premature Fauvism in 1904. His Courtyard [...] of that year has been described as “one of the first exercises in the expressive use of <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> in this century”. Bevan's early experiments in colour can also be seen in his The Mill Pool which recalls the Talisman picture that Sérusier painted to Gauguin's instructions and was described as being “quite different in colour and really rather superior”. However his first one-man exhibition in 1905, which contained probably the most radical paintings by a British artist at that time, was not a commercial success and was hardly noticed by the critics. [...] "Bevan evidently lost confidence in the direction it pointed and never again produced so outstanding a painting of this type. Sir Philip Hendy, in his preface to the 1961 Bevan retrospective exhibition at Colnaghi's, commented that Bevan was perhaps the first Englishman to use <b>pure</b> <b>colour</b> in the 20th Century.

[...] The composition of paintings, bringing the figures to the foreground and eliminating the traditional depth and perspective of 19th-century paintings, and flattening the figures presenting them [...] "like the figures in a deck of cards", were new and startling effects, which were criticized in the 19th century but welcomed by the avant-garde in the 20th century.|$|R
