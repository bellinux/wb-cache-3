25|$|The UK's {{reluctance}} {{to join the}} Schengen Area, through concerns over loss of independent border controls, is usually cited {{as the reason for}} not joining. Britain argued that, for an island, frontier controls are a better and less intrusive way to prevent illegal immigration than other measures, such as identity cards, residence <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> with the police.

50|$|Immigration Act Article 9 {{gives the}} list of {{conditions}} under which an NWOHR may apply for a residence permit in Taiwan, including employment, study, and investment. Article 10 gives NWOHRs holding residence permits under some qualifications the right to apply for household registration after {{a certain period of}} residence. Regulations provide further details. Applications for residence <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> household <b>registration</b> by Hong Kong residents and Macau residents are governed by a separate set of regulations. Applications for residence <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> household <b>registration</b> by Mainland Area persons are controlled much more strictly, due to concerns over population growth, economic development, and social stability. An NWOHR who enters with a foreign passport or stateless travel document may not apply for residence or household registration, according to Article 12, unless that person has NWOHR status by consequence of naturalisation or of being born overseas to a national having Taiwan Area household registration. From 1991 to 2001, 141,660 residence permits were granted to NWOHRs, and 215,825 NWOHRs were given permission to establish household registration (thus ending their status as NWOHRs). Unlike the numbers of entrances for short term visits, these numbers have shown an upward trend since 1991, rising from 1,085 and 4,903 respectively in 1991 to 10,820 and 17,048 by 2010.|$|R

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} and usable visitor counts in backcountry and wilderness settings {{continues to be}} problematic for resource managers because use of these areas is dispersed and costs can be prohibitively high. An overview of the available methods for obtaining reliable data on recreation use levels is provided. Monitoring methods were compared and selection criteria were developed based on units of measure, efficiency and affordability, validity and reliability, and compatibility with agency objectives. Using these selection criteria, some general recommendations of methods for monitoring visitor use in wilderness and backcountry were derived. Permit methods offer the benefit of obtaining extensive and accurate use data, but have high administrative costs and are inconvenient for visitors. Registration techniques provide extensive data and are particularly applicable where rationing use is not a management objective. <b>Permit</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> techniques, however, do require considerable resources to validate for visitor noncompliance. Indirect counts with electronic or mechanical devices in combination with self-report surveys or self-registration meet most management and research needs by providing data on total use and meaningful information about the type of use.

40|$|Informal {{and illegal}} {{construction}} {{has been a}} part of Montenegro’s development since the 1990 s. It is estimated that there are around 100 000 informal/illegal constructions in Montenegro, which is approximately 1 / 3 of the total housing stock in the country (Onsrud 2010). Illegal and informal construction is common on the whole territory of the country and often in concentrated living areas, thus creating a whole informal settlement. A typical feature of such construction is either absence of a licence for construction, or construction differing from the conditions of the licence. Most commonly the illegal/informal construction occurs on the investor’s private land, but such construction also occurs on the municipal land. The informal/illegal construction has a negative effect on the country’s development. There are various reasons for the increase of illegal construction in the country. One of such reasons is insufficient land administration during the past two decades. The procedures for obtaining a building <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> of property are awfully long, time consuming and costly. The system is so complicated that even the local authorities have difficulties understanding all of the procedures. The local authorities are imposed to double-check and even triple-check all the necessary documentation submitted by the investors for obtaining a building permit, which makes the system very little productive and costly. Amongst other reasons for illegal/informal construction are migration, rapid urbanization, establishment of a free market economy in the country and corruption. The lack of sufficient legislation on illegal/informal structures also contributed to the investors’ fearless attitude towards the illegal/informal construction. The main goal of this study is to describe the existing situation and to contribute to the theoretical understanding of the possible reasons for which illegal/informal construction occurs. This thesis includes the discussion of different aspects that are connected to the problem of informal settlements such as property rights, land administration, public regulations, development and negative impact on the environment. This thesis is based on the knowledge gained through the study of available literature about the theme and a fieldwork in the country of concern...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Three {{studies were}} {{performed}} in Oregon wildernesses. The first used wilderness <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> trailhead <b>registration</b> data to evaluate trends in use of Three Sisters, Mt. Jefferson, and Eagle Cap Wildernesses from 1976 to 1994. Recreational visitor days {{were found to}} have declined, but the number of visits increased dramatically, because of large increases in the number of day users. These findings are counter to conclusions drawn in earlier research on national use trends and highlight the importance of the unit of measure to interpretation of trends. Trends implied by permit data differed from trends estimated by Forest Service personnel, and implications for Forest Service reporting are discussed. The second study compared day and overnight visitors to three high-use destinations in terms of their perception of social and ecological impacts of wilderness recreation, evaluation of impacts, and support for management actions. Overnight users were more likely to notice impacts, but predicted differences in reaction to impacts and support for management actions were not found. The only exception was that overnight users were more likely to object to management actions that would target overnight users. Results showed significant differences among study sites. The third study tested four methods of revegetating impacted campsites: scarification, importing organic material, transplanting, and transplanting with watering. These commonly used methods have not been systematically investigated previously. Six campsites in Three Sisters Wilderness were treated in 1991 and reevaluated in 1994. Importing organic material and scarification were found to improve vegetation recovery and species richness very little compared to controls, but both transplanting techniques had significant effects, often {{because of the presence of}} other species or propagules in the transplanted plugs. Watering was found to have no effect on the survival of transplanted mountain hemlock seedlings. Vegetative recovery was very slow with even the most effective treatments, which reinforces recommendations that managers adopt strategies of concentrating use...|$|R
