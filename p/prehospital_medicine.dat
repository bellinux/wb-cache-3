40|$|SUMMARYPrehospital {{emergency}} medical care has many challenges including unpredictable patient profiles, emergency conditions, and administration of care in a non-medical area. Many conflicts occur in a prehospital setting that require ethical decisions to be made. An overview of the some of ethical issues in prehospital emergency care settings is given in this article. Ethical aspects of <b>prehospital</b> emergency <b>medicine</b> are classified into four groups: the process before medical interventions, including justice, stigmatization, dangerous situations, and safe driving; the treatment process, including triage, refusal of treatment or transport, and informed consent; {{the end of life}} and care, including life-sustaining treatments, prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), withholding or withdrawal of CPR, and family presence during resuscitation; and some ambulance perception issues, including ambulance misuse, care of minors, and telling of bad news. <b>Prehospital</b> emergency <b>medicine</b> is quite different from emergency medicine in hospitals, and all patients and situations are unique. Consequently, there are no quick formulas for the right action and emotion. It is important to recognize the ethical conflicts that occur in <b>prehospital</b> emergency <b>medicine</b> and then act to provide the appropriate care that is of optimal value...|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} jugular {{is a large}} vein used in <b>prehospital</b> <b>medicine</b> for venous access {{when the}} EMT is unable to find another peripheral vein. It is commonly used in cardiac arrest or other situations where the patient is unresponsive due to the pain associated with the procedure. In a cardiac arrest using this vein has the advantage that the paramedic can stay at the head and intubate the patient as well. Although many EMTs and paramedics use this vein the American Heart Association still recommends {{the use of the}} cephalic vein.|$|E

40|$|Extraglottic airway devices (EADs) are {{commonly}} used equipment for airway maintenance during elective procedures under general anaesthesia. They may be used also in other indications such as conduit for tracheal intubation or rescue airway device in <b>prehospital</b> <b>medicine.</b> Current classifications of the EADs lack systematic approach and therefore classification according to the sealing sites and sealing mechanisms is suggested in this review article. Modern EADs are disposable, latex-free devices made of plastic materials – most commonly from polyvinylchloride (PVC). The bowl of uncuffed sealers is manufactured from different materials such as thermoplastic elastomers or ethylene-vinyl-acetate co-polymer. EADs create various physical forces exerted on the adjacent tissues which may contribute to different sealing characteristic of particular device or to variable incidence of postoperative complications. Desired features of an ideal EAD involve easy insertion, high insertion success rate even by inexperienced users, protection against aspiration of gastric contents and low incidence of postoperative complications such as sore throat, hoarseness, cough or swallowing difficulties...|$|E

40|$|Emergency medical {{services}} (EMS) has evolved greatly since its inception. The model {{has gone from}} a load-and-go philosophy to one that integrates high-level medical knowledge and techniques. As the practice of <b>prehospital</b> <b>medicine</b> evolves, these models must also evolve to provide good care. This requires efficient utilization of resources and placement of these resources {{in areas that are}} quickly accessible to those in need. A proposed solution has been to dispatch units based on screening by 911 call-takers. EMS response can be grouped into two categories: uniform and tiered. Uniform response means an advanced life support (ALS) unit is always dispatched. A tiered response sends first responders, basic life support (BLS) units, and/or ALS units depending on how the caller answers a series of questions asked by the dispatcher. Persse et al. investigated the difference in survival of patients in the uniform versus tiered response areas within a single, large system. Survival rates for those with out-of-hospital ventricula...|$|E
40|$|During 2009, Critical Care {{published}} nine {{papers on}} {{various aspects of}} resuscitation, <b>prehospital</b> <b>medicine,</b> trauma care and disaster response. One article demonstrated that {{children as young as}} 9 years of age can learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) effectively, although, depending on their size, some may have difficulty performing it. Another paper showed that while there was a trend toward mild therapeutic hypothermia reducing S- 100 levels, there was no statistically significant change. Another predictor study also showed a strong link between acute kidney injury and neurologic outcome while another article described a program in which kidneys were harvested from cardiac arrest patients and showed an 89 % graft survival rate. One experimental investigation indicated that when a pump-less interventional lung assist device is present, leaving the device open (unclamped) while performing CPR has no harmful effects on mean arterial pressures and it may have positive effects on blood oxygenation and CO 2 clearance. One other study, conducted in the prehospital environment, found that end-tidal CO 2 could be useful in diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Three articles addressed disaster medicine, the first of which described a triage system for use during pandemic influenza that demonstrated high reliability in delineating patients with a good chance of survival from those likely to die. The other two studies, both drawn from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake experience, showed success in treating crush injured patients in an on-site tent ICU and, in the second case, how the epidemiology of earthquake injuries and related factors predicted mortality...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{identify}} a scale or components of a scale that optimize detection of older adult TBI patients who require transport to a trauma center, regardless of mechanism. MethodsWe assembled a consensus panel consisting of nine experts in geriatric emergency medicine, <b>prehospital</b> <b>medicine,</b> trauma surgery, geriatric medicine, and TBI, as well as prehospital providers, to evaluate the existing scales used to identify TBI. We reviewed the relevant literature and solicited group feedback to create a list of candidate scales and criteria for evaluation. Using the nominal group technique, scales were evaluated by the expert panel through an iterative process until consensus was achieved. ResultsWe identified 15 scales for evaluation. The panel 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s criteria for rating the scales included: ease of administration, prehospital familiarity with scale components, feasibility of use with older adults, time to administer, and strength of evidence for their performance in the prehospital setting. After review and discussion of aggregated ratings, the panel identified the Simplified Motor Scale, GCS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cMotor Component, and AVPU (alert, voice, pain, unresponsive) as the strongest scales but determined that none meet all EMS provider and patient needs due to poor usability and lack of supportive evidence. The panel proposed that a dichotomized decision scheme that includes domains of the top-rated scales 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d level of alertness (alert vs. not alert) and motor function (obeys commands vs. does not obey) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d {{may be more effective}} in identifying older adult TBI patients who require transport to a trauma center in the prehospital setting. ConclusionsExisting scales to identify TBI are inadequate to detect older adult TBI patients who require transport to a trauma center. A new algorithm, derived from elements of previously established scales, has potential to guide prehospital providers in improving the triage of older adult TBI patients, but needs further evaluation prior to use.
