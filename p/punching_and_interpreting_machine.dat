A good measurement instrument should incorporate technical, humanity, and institutional scales to capture features in diverse but correlated domains that shape machine intelligence. This is only possible through a holistic method such as the multiple perspectives inquiring system (TOP). This paper demonstrates that such distinctive measures correlatively advance machine intelligence quotient (MIQ) by bringing to bear clear scales to measure <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>machine</b> intelligence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{crucial part}} of safety-critical systems {{development}} is identifying how system behaviours lead to accidents. Doing this for complex systems is hard {{because of the need}} to consider the interaction between multiple simultaneous failures and normal system behaviours. Multi-agent simulation provides a way to explore the behaviour that emerges from a model of a system under normal and failure conditions. However, it is easy to generate vast amounts of data from such simulations that can be hard to comprehend <b>and</b> <b>interpret.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning can be applied to help understand the patterns that are implicit in this data. This paper first describes the concept of hazard analysis, and how this can be performed using multi-agent simulation. It then describes how machine learning techniques can be used to extract rules from simulation output. The approach is illustrated using a military system-of-systems case study. ...|$|R

These typical examples make super-resolution a vital technology.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{proof of concept}} that machine {{learning}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now, candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods - sum over bonds, custom descriptors, Coulomb matrices, Bag of Bonds, and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum over bonds (bond counting), and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set, we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosive energy, heat of formation, density, and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with 309 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower, although the convergence with number of molecules is slow. Our work paves the way for future applications of machine learning in this domain, including automated lead generation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> <b>machine</b> learning models to obtain novel chemical insights.

40|$|There is a {{requirement}} for improved three-dimensional surface characterisation and reduced tool wear when modern computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools are operating at high cutting velocities, spindle speeds and feed rates. For large depths of cut and large material removal rates, {{there is a tendency}} for machines to chatter caused by selfexcited vibration in the machine tools leading to precision errors, poor surface finish quality, tool wear and possible machine damage. This study illustrates a method for improving machine tool performance by understanding and adaptively controlling the machine structural vibration. The first step taken is to measure <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>machine</b> tool vibration <b>and</b> produce a structural model. As a consequence, appropriate sensors need to be selected and/or designed and then integrated to measure all self-excited vibrations. The vibrations of the machine under investigation need to be clearly understood by analysis of sensor signals and surface finish measurement. The active vibration control system has been implemented on a CNC machine tool and validated under controlled conditions by compensating for machine tool vibrations on time-varying multi-point cutting operations for a vertical milling machine. The design of the adaptive control system using modelling, filtering, active vibration platform and sensor feedback techniques has been demonstrated to be successful...|$|R

This fact can be easily established showing that there are functions, which are not Turing computable: there are more functions than Turing Machines to compute them.

40|$|Abstract. The {{challenge}} {{of creating a}} real-life computational equivalent {{of the human mind}} is now attracting the attention of many scientific groups from different areas of cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence such as computational neuroscience, cognitive science, biologically inspired cognitive architectures etc. The paper presents a new cognitive architecture based on insertion modeling, one of the paradigms of a general theory of interaction, and a basis for multiagent system development. Insertion cognitive architecture is represented as a multilevel insertion machine which realizes itself as a high level insertion environment. It has a center to evaluate the success of its behavior which is a special type agent that can observe the interaction of a system with external environment. The main goal of a system is achieving maximum success repeated. As an agent this machine is inserted into its external environment and has the means to interact with it. The internal environment of intelligent cognitive agent creates and develops its own model and the model of external environment. If the external environment contains other agents, they can be modeled by internal environment which creates corresponding <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> <b>interprets</b> those <b>machines</b> using corresponding drivers, comparing the behaviors of models and external agents. Insertion architecture is now under development on the base of Insertion modelin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most Web pages contain {{inherent}} {{structured and}} significant data like contact details for various people, dates and addresses of events, descriptive elements for photos {{and a lot}} more. As it is, this data is expressed {{in a way that}} is easily understandable for humans but incredibly hard to detect <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> for <b>machines.</b> Once content publishers gain the ability to express this data more completely and tools are developed that are able to understand the semantics, a whole new set of possibilities on the internet becomes available to the end user. New forms of web content, meaningful to computers, will unleash a revolution of the internet. A true Semantic Web might still lie in the future but that’s no reason not to start using the core ideas from which it is being formed. There are several attempts that try to combine the principles of the Semantic Web, as envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, with currently established technologies such as (X) HTML. This growth of semantics in the existing Web is swiftly advancing the state of the art for all Semantic Web processes. By enhancing existing Web documents with semantics we allow machines to categorise and handle information, so it can be used in a much more practical way, yet keep the principles of the existing web and still code for humans first. This paper reviews, analyzes and compares RDFa and microformats, two of the current technologies for inline metadata in (X) HTML and aims to giv...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{review the}} origins of {{structural}} operational semantics. The main publication `A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics,' {{also known as the}} `Aarhus Notes,' appeared in 1981 [G. D. Plotkin, A structural approach to operational semantics, DAIMI FN- 19, Computer Science Department, Aarhus University, 1981]. The development of the ideas dates back to the early 1970 s, involving many people and building on previous work on programming languages and logic. The former included abstract syntax, the SECD <b>machine,</b> <b>and</b> the abstract <b>interpreting</b> <b>machines</b> of the Vienna school; the latter included the λ-calculus and formal systems. The initial development of structural operational semantics was for simple functional languages, more or less variations of the λ-calculus; after that the ideas were gradually extended to include languages with parallel features, such as Milner's CCS. This experience set the ground for a more systematic exposition, the subject of an invited course of lectures at Aarhus University; some of these appeared in print as the 1981 Notes. We discuss the content of these lectures and some related considerations such as `small state' versus `grand state,' structural versus compositional semantics, the influence of the Scott–Strachey approach to denotational semantics, the treatment of recursion and jumps, and static semantics. We next discuss relations with other work and some immediate further development. We conclude with an account of an old, previously unpublished, idea: an alternative, perhaps more readable, graphical presentation of systems of rules for operational semantics...|$|R
40|$|Web {{services}} are software components that are – in general – distributed over multiple organizations. They provide functionality without showing implementation details {{for the purpose}} of abstracting from implementation as well as {{for the purpose of}} hiding private, i. e. organization-internal, processes. Nevertheless, to use a web service one must know some of its details, i. e. what it does, what it requires, what it assumes, what it achieves and even, to some extent, how it achieves its purpose. The different web service standards, frequently summarized as WS*, allow web services to be specified with descriptions of such details. In this chapter, we argue that one should go beyond WS * and that it is preferable to provide semantic descriptions, i. e. specifications that can be understood <b>and</b> correctly <b>interpreted</b> by <b>machines.</b> Thereby, the particular focus of this contribution lies in analyzing the process of semantic annotation, i. e. the process of deriving semantic descriptions from lower level specifications, implementations and contextual descriptions. Hence, the concern of this chapter is really orthogonal to most other work which equates web service annotation with web service specification. We illustrate here that this is not the case...|$|R
