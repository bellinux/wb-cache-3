5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order <b>Piciformes,</b> the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E
500|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order <b>Piciformes.</b> Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be {{closely related to the}} woodpecker family (woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (woodpeckers, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.|$|E

The <b>Piciformes</b> contain about 71 living genera with a little over 450 species, of which the Picidae (woodpeckers and relatives) make up about half.|$|E

50|$|Picocoraciae is a clade that {{contains}} the order Bucerotiformes (hornbills and hoopoes) and the clade Picodynastornithes (containing birds like kingfishers and rollers, and woodpeckers and toucans) supported by various genetic analysis and morphological studies. While these studies supported a sister grouping of Coraciiformes and <b>Piciformes,</b> a large scale, sparse supermatrix has suggested alternative sister relationship between Bucerotiformes and <b>Piciformes</b> instead.|$|E
5000|$|Pici {{is one of}} the two suborders of {{the order}} <b>Piciformes</b> and {{includes}} two infraorders Ramphastides (toucans and barbets) and Picides (honeyguides and woodpeckers). Members of this suborder are often called [...] "true piciforms" [...] as it was thought the jacamars of Galbulidae and puffbirds of Bucconidae (of the other piciform suborder Galbuli) not closely related to toucans and woodpeckers, but instead to the order Coraciiformes. However, analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group {{to the rest of the}} <b>Piciformes,</b> also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in <b>Piciformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, the <b>Piciformes</b> are insectivorous, {{although}} the barbets and toucans mostly eat fruit and the honeyguides are unique among birds {{in being able}} to digest beeswax (although insects make up the bulk of their diet). Nearly all <b>Piciformes</b> have parrot-like zygodactyl feet—two toes forward and two back, an arrangement that has obvious advantages for birds that spend much of their time on tree trunks. An exception are a few species of three-toed woodpeckers. The jacamars aside, <b>Piciformes</b> do not have down feathers at any age, only true feathers. They range in size from the rufous piculet at 8 centimetres in length, and weighing 7 grams, to the toco toucan, at 63 centimetres long, and weighing 680 grams. All nest in cavities and have altricial young.|$|E

50|$|The precise nesting {{details of}} many African barbets {{are not yet}} known, {{although}} peculiarly among the <b>Piciformes,</b> some sociable species will nest in riverbanks or termite nests. Like many members of their order, <b>Piciformes,</b> their nests are in holes bored into a tree, and they usually lay between 2 and 4 eggs (except for the yellow-breasted barbet which lays up to 6), incubated for 13-15 days. Nesting duties are shared by both parents.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this genus arose in the late Oligocene or early Eocene {{at about the same time}} as <b>Piciformes</b> and Coraciiformes.|$|E

50|$|Picodynastornithes is a clade that {{contains}} the orders Coraciiformes (rollers and kingfishers) and <b>Piciformes</b> (woodpeckers and toucans). This grouping also has current and historical support from the molecular and morphological studies.|$|E
5000|$|Notable orders {{traditionally}} considered [...] "near passerines" [...] but not {{placed in}} the Passerae of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy are Coliiformes, Coraciiformes, <b>Piciformes</b> and Trogoniformes (see below for why this is significant).|$|E
50|$|Galbula is {{the type}} and largest genus of the jacamar family (Galbulidae) of piciform birds, and its {{suborder}} Galbulae. Sometimes, the <b>Piciformes</b> are split in two, with the Galbulae upranked to full order Galbuliformes.|$|E
5000|$|Puffbirds {{get their}} common name from their fluffy plumage. In Spanish, {{they have been}} nicknamed bobo [...] "dummy" [...] from their {{propensity}} to sit motionless waiting for prey. American naturalist Thomas Horsfield defined the Bucconidae in 1821. The family was classified {{as part of the}} <b>Piciformes</b> by Alexander Wetmore in his work A Systematic Classification for the Birds of the World (1930, revised in 1951 and 1960). The placement of the combined puffbird and jacamar lineage was in question, with some bone and muscle features suggesting they may be more closely related to the Coraciiformes. However, analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group {{to the rest of the}} <b>Piciformes,</b> also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet (two toes facing forward and two aft) before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in <b>Piciformes.</b> The lineage is sometimes elevated to order level as Galbuliformes, first proposed by Sibley and Ahlquist in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Analysis of nDNA c-myc and RAG-1 exon {{as well as}} mtDNA {{myoglobin}} intron 2 sequence data {{demonstrates that}} the Coraciiformes {{can be divided into}} a basal group that is not too distantly related to the <b>Piciformes,</b> and a derived suborder containing mainly kingfishers (Johansson & Ericson, 2003). The cuckoo roller's true affinities appear to lie elsewhere. The trogons and hornbills are either very basal lineages, or might be considered distinct own orders; the latter are apparently slightly closer to the rollers than the former. The entire group (possibly excluding the cuckoo roller) and the <b>Piciformes</b> are closely related to the Passeriformes (Johansson & Ericson 2003; see also near passerine).|$|E

50|$|Despite {{having only}} two families, Picides is an {{extremely}} widespread group; the family Picidae is {{the largest and most}} widespread in the order <b>Piciformes,</b> containing about 200 species in four subfamilies and being found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica.|$|E

50|$|Picavus litencicensis is an extinct bird in {{the order}} <b>Piciformes.</b> It existed during the Rupelian (early Oligocene) {{in what is now}} the Czech Republic. It was {{described}} by Gerald Mayr and Růžena Gregorová in 2012, and is the only species in the family Picavidae.|$|E
50|$|Ramphastides is an infraorder of the <b>Piciformes</b> order, that {{includes}} toucans and barbets. Formerly the barbets have been classified {{in a single}} family, Capitonidae. However, this {{has turned out to}} be paraphyletic with regard to toucans which resulted Capitonidae being split up into several families.|$|E
50|$|Fossil New World barbets {{have been}} found dating from the Miocene in Florida. It is widely agreed that the closest {{relatives}} of the barbets are the toucans, and that these two families are also {{closely related to the}} honeyguides and woodpeckers (with which they form the order <b>Piciformes).</b>|$|E
5000|$|They are smallish to mid-sized forest {{birds of}} the Neotropics, with long pointed bills, {{elongated}} tails, and small feet. Colored in metallic iridescent hues [...] - [...] typically greenish [...] - [...] {{at least on}} the upperside, some have a red or brownish belly. Males and females are generally similar in appearance, but in most species differ in minor plumage details. As usual for <b>Piciformes,</b> they nest in burrows they dig out themselves. In the case of this genus, nests are dug in earthen banks along rivers or roads, or in termitaria. As with other jacamars but otherwise unknown among <b>Piciformes,</b> their chicks do not hatch naked. They have a piping song and feed in typical jacamar fashion, by catching flying arthropods, typically larger insects such has butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{eight percent}} of bird species are known to {{regularly}} engage in cooperative breeding, mainly among the Coraciiformes, <b>Piciformes,</b> basal Passeri and Sylvioidea.
