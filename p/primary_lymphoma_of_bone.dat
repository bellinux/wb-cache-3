40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>{{lymphoma}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> {{is a rare}} type of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with {{a relatively}} favourable outcome. Recent scientific interest has focused on elucidating the role of nuclear factor-kappaB pathway in lymphomagenesis and its potential significance as a therapeutic target. In nodal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB appears {{to be involved in}} tumour cell survival, notably in the non-germinal centre type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We investigated nuclear factor-kappaB activation via the classical and alternative pathway in <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> through immunohistochemical staining for nuclear factor-kappaB family members on tumour tissues of 50 patients. Nine cases (18 %) showed nuclear staining for p 50, and one case showed nuclear co-expression of p 52. None of the cases showed nuclear staining for c-Rel. The nuclear staining of p 50 suggests that in a minority of primary lymphomas of bone nuclear factor-kappaB is constitutively activated via the classical pathway. In contrast to other extranodal types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, {{there was a lack of}} nuclear co-expression of p 65, which might suggest activation of a different pathway. Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB through the alternative pathway does not appear to be significantly involved, as only one case showed significant nuclear expression for p 52. Finally, nuclear expression of p 50 was neither preferentially detected in non-germinal centre type or germinal centre type <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> nor related to poor prognosis. Therefore, in contrast to nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway does not appear to be an attractive therapeutic target in <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{clinical}} behaviour and treatment outcome {{of patients with}} localised <b>primary</b> <b>lymphomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b> Patients and Methods: The medical records <b>of</b> patients with <b>primary</b> <b>lymphomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> managed at the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong, from 1994 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Five Chinese patients with this condition were identified. All patients had diffuse large cell lymphomas (New Working Formulation) of B-cell phenotype and were classified as stage IE/IIE by Ann Arbor staging. Four of the 5 patients presented with lytic bone lesions in the long <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the lower limbs and the remaining patient presented with a lytic lesion in the vertebrae. All patients were treated with anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy of 40 to 44 Gy. Results: The median follow up was 60 months (range, 28 to 73 months). All patients achieved complete remission after treatment and remained disease-free {{up to the last}} assessment. One patient had a complication of fracture during chemotherapy but no late adverse effects on bone healing due to radiotherapy were identified. Conclusions: These results suggest that combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for localised <b>primary</b> <b>lymphomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> can provide excellent local and systemic disease control. Radiotherapy following chemotherapy at doses of approximately 40 to 44 Gy appears to be sufficient for local control of the tumour, with no significant adverse effects on bone healing observed.

40|$|Purpose: Accurate {{assessment}} of the lesion after treatment of patients with bone lymphoma is difficult. In this patient who demonstrated complete remission after chemotherapy, the regions of fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FFDG) PET uptake diminished more rapidly following therapy, indicating a complete response at much earlier stage than did Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT based findings. With the conventional methods, such as MRI and CT, {{it was difficult to}} assess whether the residual tumor tissue was viable or not. Decision to complete response is very important in patients with lymphoma to plan the further treatment. We experienced a patient with <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> who revealed complete response to chemotherapy on 18 FFDGPET while CT showed persistent destructive bone lesion. Thus, 18 FFDGPET study after therapy may be superior to CT in the evaluation of response to treatment in <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b> Key Words: primary bone lymphoma, evaluation, FDG-PET 5) 서 론 원발성골림프종(primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of bone) 은 매 우 드 문 질환으 로 primary reticulum cell sarcoma of bone으 로 알려지 기 시작했으며,...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> (PLB) {{is a rare}} disease, {{comprising}} {{a malignant}} lymphoid infiltrate of bone. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify socioeconomic, demographic, and anatomic factors as prognostic indicators of survival for this disease using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Methods: The SEER database was used to identify a study population of 692 patients diagnosed with PLB in the United States from 1989 to 2003. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method, with effects of potential prognostic factors on survival analyzed using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: The overall 5 -year survival rate was 49. 6 %, with a 10 -year survival rate of 30. 2 %. Median overall survival was 4. 9 years (95 % CI: 3. 9, 6. 1). In multivariable analysis, age (p< 0. 0001), marital status (p= 0. 006), and appendicular vs. axial tumor location (p= 0. 004) were found to be independent predictors of survival. Conclusions: This population-based study of PLB identified age, marital status, and tumor location as independent indicators of prognosis. This finding supports the clinical suspicion that an appendicular tumor location confers a better prognosis than an axial tumor location...|$|E
40|$|Primary lymphomas of bone are {{uncommon}} malignancies. The {{vast majority}} of them are non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), whereas primary Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) of bone is extremely rare. Patients with primary NHL of bone commonly present with local bone pain, soft tissue swelling, and a mass or a pathological fracture. There is a slight male preponderance, and most patients are over 45 - 50 years of age. Primary NHL of bone can arise in any part of the skeleton, but long bones (femurs, tibia) are the most common sites of presentation. Comprehensive immunohistochemical studies are required to establish an accurate histological diagnosis of primary NHL of bone. Most cases of primary NHL of bone are classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of hematological malignancies. On full staging evaluation, most patients have disease of stage IE or IIE according to the Ann Arbor system. Several studies indicate that patients with primary NHL of bone have a favorable outcome, especially when treated by combined modality therapy. A number of studies reported that clinical stage is the most important prognostic variable in predicting overall survival. Interestingly, the rare occurrence of <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> is in contrast with the frequency of plasma cell tumors in bone. This could be due to the fact that, during normal B-cell differentiation, the bone marrow is the normal site of homing of plasma cells which are terminally-differentiated, immunoglobulin-secreting post-germinal center B-cells. In this respect, there is circumstancial evidence that primary NHL of bone may represent tumors of post-germinal center B-cells.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> (PLB) {{primarily}} {{arising from}} the medullary cavity is an extremely rare entity, with only retrospective studies and sporadic cases reported in the literature. The current study presents one case of PLB treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and {{a review of the}} literature to elucidate the optimal treatment of PLB. A 73 -year-old female presented with pain in the left hip that had persisted for two months. Plain X-ray and magnetic reso-nance imaging of the left hip showed lytic areas involving the left innominatum. Technetium- 99 m radionuclide imaging showed increased tracer uptake in the ilium, acetabulum and ischium. An 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) scan showed high FDG uptake. A fine‑needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathological and immunohistochemical examination confirmed a diagnosis <b>of</b> B-cell <b>lymphoma.</b> The patient received radiation therapy followed by six cycles of CHOP regimen (1, 000 mg cyclo-phosphamide, 80 mg epirubicine and 2 mg vincristine on day one, and 100 mg prednisone on days one to five, every three weeks) and achieved a complete response, as confirmed by FDG-PET-CT. At present, the patient is in a good condi-tion. This case is noteworthy, as it is a well-documented case in which the patient received successful treatment. This case demonstrates that PLB has an improved prognosis compared with <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> other sites; however, combined therapy may further improve the patient outcome...|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{consecutive}} cases <b>of</b> localized <b>primary</b> non-Hodgkin's <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> (PNHLB) {{were treated}} in a 10 -year period at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli with localized radiation (4 cases) and localized radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy (26 cases). The doses of radiation varied from 3000 - 4500 rad. A variety of staging procedures evolving with new diagnostic techniques over the 10 years were performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy comprised two different regimens of vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Twenty-four of the 26 patients (92 %) have been free of disease with a median follow-up of 75. 5 months (18 - 144 months). Two patients developed meningeal involvement and one patient, treated with radiation therapy only, developed a local recurrence. The results are compared to the management of 68 Ewing's sarcoma patients treated during the same period. Here, higher doses of localized radiation therapy (approximately 5000 rad) and similar adjuvant chemotherapy were administered. The survival was 32 % (22 / 68) with {{a higher incidence of}} local recurrence (21 %). These data indicate that PNHLB should be considered a separate entity from Ewing's sarcoma and can be treated successfully with lower doses of radiation to the primary tumor and adjuvant chemotherapy. The observations are also compared to a variety of other biological characteristics of Ewing's sarcoma. Since only two patients developed meningeal relapse, our experience does not permit a firm recommendation for routine prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system in PNHLB...|$|R

In the literature, there are very few descriptions of PLPNs, most of which are mononeuropathies. The possibility of a neuropathy associated with lymphoma should be considered in patients with poor response to treatment and severe pain symptoms. Muscle Nerve, 2014...|$|R

Lymphoma arising {{within a single}} bone, without visceral or lymph node involvement, is known as <b>primary</b> intraosseous <b>lymphoma.</b> It is a rare condition and constitutes 3. 1 % <b>of</b> malignant <b>bone</b> tumors and 5 % <b>of</b> extranodal <b>lymphomas.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> the jaw is seldom seen and it is often misdiagnosed. Clinically, the manifestations are usually similar to an odontogenic tumor, cyst, or infection. Radiographically it appears as a radiolucent area that may mimic endodontic lesion, periodontal pathology, or odontogenic cyst or tumor. The initial presentation is commonly followed by multiple unnecessary extractions and/or root canal treatments. We present five cases <b>of</b> rare <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> <b>of</b> the maxillofacial complex, four of them intraosseous. 1...|$|R
