25|$|Synchronized {{firing of}} neurons also forms the basis of {{periodic}} motor commands for rhythmic movements. These rhythmic outputs are produced {{by a group of}} interacting neurons that form a network, called a central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that—when activated—can produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. Examples are walking, breathing, and swimming, Most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals, such as the lamprey, but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans.|$|E
2500|$|Non-giant-mediated {{responses}} are initiated after the tail flip, creating cycles of flexion followed by extension. This non-giant system is activated {{parallel to the}} LGI circuit when the hair cells receive input. However, this behavior has a longer delay that allows the onset of swimming to occur {{after the completion of}} the tail flip. The non-giant swimming occurs independently of the [...] LGI response since direct stimulation of the LGI with the electrodes results in a tail flip but not the subsequent non-giant swimming. This swimming response seems to be a fixed action pattern mediated by a central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> since it does not require sensory feedback for physical and temporal maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spinal cord}} executes rhythmical and {{sequential}} activation of [...] muscles in locomotion. The central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> (CPG) provides the basic locomotor rhythm and synergies by integrating commands {{from various sources}} that serve to initiate or modulate its output {{to meet the requirements}} of the environment. CPG within the lumbosacral spinal cord segments represent {{an important component of the}} total circuitry that generates and controls posture and locomotion. This spinal circuitry can function independently in the absence of descending input from the brain to generate stable posture and locomotion and even modulate activity to match changing conditions (e.g., stepping over obstacles). This capability improve with training (spinal plasticity) and therefore it is believed that spinal cord has the capability to learn and memorize.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{stimulus-response}} {{mechanisms are}} {{the easiest to}} understand, the nervous system is also capable of controlling the body in ways {{that do not require}} an external stimulus, by means of internally generated rhythms of activity. Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even in isolation, of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials, or rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses, the resulting networks are capable {{of a wide variety of}} dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics, periodicity, and even chaos. [...] A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally structured output, without requiring a corresponding temporally structured stimulus, is called a central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is a {{piece of}} {{electronic}} test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" [...] and [...] "high state", [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1"). The main purpose of a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards - TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS and LVDS, for instance. Digital pattern generators are sometimes referred to as [...] "pulse generator" [...] or [...] "pulse pattern generator" [...] which may be able to function as digital pattern generators as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called [...] "logic source". A pulse generator is of purpose to generate electrical pulse of different shapes; they are mostly used for tests at an electrical or analog level.Another common name for such equipment is [...] "digital logic source" [...] or [...] "logic source".|$|E
