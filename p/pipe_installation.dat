40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design of {{flexible}} pipes, buried in shallow trenches with dry sand backfill. The thesis reports the comprehensive analysis of twenty-two full-scale load tests conducted between 1989 and 1991 on <b>pipe</b> <b>installations,</b> mainly within a laboratory facility, at the University of South Australia. The pipes were highly flexible, spirally-wound, uPVC pipes, ranging in diameter from 300 to 450 mm. Guidelines were required by industry for safe cover heights for these pipes when subjected to construction traffic. The tests were designed by, and conducted under the supervision of, the author, prior to the author undertaking this thesis. As current design approaches for pipes could not anticipate the large loading settlements and hence, soil plasticity, experienced in these tests, finite element analyses were attempted. Extensive investigations of the materials in the installations were undertaken to permit finite element modelling of the buried <b>pipe</b> <b>installations.</b> In particular, a series of large strain triaxial tests were conducted on the sand backfill in the buried <b>pipe</b> <b>installations,</b> to provide {{an understanding of the}} sand behaviour in terms of critical state theory. Subsequently a constitutive model for the soil was developed. The soil model was validated before implementation in an element of finite element program, AFENA (Carter and Balaam, 1995). Single element modelling of the triaxial tests proved invaluable in obtaining material constants for the soil model. The new element was applied successfully to the analysis of a side-constrained, plate loading test on the sand. The simulation of the buried pipe tests was shown to require three-dimensional finite element analysis to approach the observed pipe-soil behaviour. Non-compliant side boundary conditions were ultimately adjudged chiefly responsible for the difficulty in matching the experimental data. The value of numerical analyses performed in tandem with physical testing was apparent, albeit in hindsight. The research has identified the prediction of vertical soil pressure above the pipe due to external loading as being the major difficulty for designers. Based on the finite element analyses of the field tests, a preliminary simple expression was developed for estimation of these pressures, which could be used with currently available design approaches to reasonably predict pipe deflections...|$|R

50|$|The Royal Navy inquiry {{found that}} the flood {{happened}} while a sea-water strainer was being cleaned, {{in an attempt to}} improve the production of fresh water. The air lines controlling a hull valve were incorrectly reconnected, resulting in the valve opening and an inability to close it. The <b>pipe</b> <b>installation</b> fell below generally accepted standards, which made reconnection of the air lines ambiguous. The inquiry also found that due to manpower constraints the ship did not have a system maintainer, and that clarity of engineering command had been lost, with no-one clearly in charge of risk-management. It was fortunate that, once without propulsion, Endurance drifted over an area shallow enough for anchors to be lowered and to hold. Otherwise, Endurance would probably have been lost by flooding or running aground. The inquiry judged that the ship’s company responded well to control damage in challenging conditions.|$|E

Typically, pipe smaller than 2.0 inch are not pre-fabricated. The pipe spools are usually tagged with a bar code and the ends are capped (plastic) for protection. The pipe and pipe spools are delivered to a warehouse on a large commercial/industrial job and they may be held indoors or in a gridded laydown yard. The pipe or pipe spool is retrieved, staged, rigged, and then lifted into place. On large process jobs the lift is made using cranes and hoist and other material lifts. They are typically temporarily supported in the steel structure using beam clamps, straps, and small hoists until the Pipe Supports are attached or otherwise secured.|$|E

The experimental approach involved monitoring the CP current as a function of time at various set potentials and correlating this data with evidence from visual inspection of the pipe-wall surfaces and small probe specimens. The influences of control potential and seawater flow rate at temperatures of 25 - 35 degreesC were studied.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of orifice plate metering to poor conditioned flow and swirling flow are subjects of concerns to flow meter users and manufacturers.

The development of this comprehensive engineering guidance is based on engineering calculations empirically tuned using a database of actual performance measurements. Field observations of five production installations and a full-scale experiment were conducted to form the performance database employed to understand the mechanics associated with <b>pipe</b> ramming <b>installations,</b> ranging from vertical ground movements, ground vibrations, and installation performance. Settlement prediction was evaluated using the inverted normal probability distribution based models, and these methods over-estimated the observed settlements close {{to the center of}} the pipes and under-estimated settlements at radial distances away from the pipe. A pipe-ramming-specific hyperbolic model was developed for better prediction of the vertical settlement induced by pipe ramming in granular soils. Attenuation of observed pipe ramming-induced vibrations was modeled using a simple semi-empirical approach, and the calibrated model resulted in reasonable predictions of the ground vibrations for granular soils. The static soil resistance to ramming was evaluated using the traditional quasi-static pipe jacking models and the models resulted in inaccurate predictions for instrumented <b>pipe</b> ramming <b>installations.</b> Therefore <b>pipe</b> ramming-specific static soil resistance models were developed for both the face and casing resistance in granular soils. Principles of stress wave theory routinely applied in the drivability analyses for pile foundations were adopted for the evaluation of the dynamic response pipes during ramming. Reliable estimates of the static soil resistance and dynamic soil parameters were obtained through signal matching processes. Data-informed drivability analysis were performed to simulate the magnitude of driving stresses and develop drivability curves which relate the penetration resistance of a given pipe and hammer to the range of static soil resistances. The study culminates in the first comprehensive framework and recommendations for the <b>installation</b> of <b>pipes</b> by ramming, and should help owners, consultants, and contractors to appropriately plan <b>pipe</b> ramming <b>installations...</b>|$|R
30|$|TC and FC were {{significantly}} correlated (P <  0.01). Both TC and FC had positive significant correlation with Pseudomonas. This suggests that increase in coliforms causes a corresponding increase in Pseudomonas. Weak inverse correlation was observed between free chlorine and TC and free chlorine with FC. As free chlorine concentration decreases, microbial count increases. This finding is {{in accordance with}} {{a study conducted by}} Farooq et al. (2008). The presence of coliforms in the water samples collected indicates contamination. One of the sources of coliform occurrence in drinking water has been attributed to biofilms on submerged surfaces of distribution systems (Flemming et al. 2002). Beate et al. (2003) have demonstrated that under certain conditions biofilms can develop on rubber-coated valves in drinking water distribution systems. These biofilms may harbour coliform bacteria where they persist and survive remedial actions such as chlorination. In this study, some levels of coliform bacteria were detected in the water collected. This could be due to inadequate disinfection residual, biofilms or accidental point source contamination by broken <b>pipes,</b> <b>installation</b> and repair works.|$|R
40|$|This {{procedure}} {{is to provide}} clear guidelines for disinfecting water piping. This procedure covers new domestic water <b>pipe</b> <b>installations</b> and maintenance on existing piping. II. GENERAL Heavy particulates generally contain bacteria and prevent even very high chlorine concentrations from contacting and killing such organisms. It is, therefore, essential that the procedures of this section be observed to assure that a water main and its appurtenances are thoroughly clean for the final disinfection by chlorination. Also, any connection of a new water main to the active distribution system prior to receipt of satisfactory bacteriological samples may constitute a cross-connection. Therefore, the new main must be isolated until a bacteriological test is satisfactorily completed. The United States Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for drinking water. To insure our compliance with these standards all work done on domestic water piping will be disinfected according to the following processes.

Assessment of the remaining pipe integrity must account for all loads and can benefit from resolving the multiaxial loads into an equivalent load.

The pressure is 8 MPa and the torsion stresses are limited to 20 % of the material’s flow stress. Flaws are introduced into a 4 inch OD pipe with an R/t of 6. 64 and 9. 36. The incipient plastic collapse moment at a given torsion moment is determined and compared with the plastic collapse moment of the pure bending case. The results show that for flaws with a depth less than 60 % of the nominal pipe wall thickness the bending and torsion moments can be combined into an equivalent moment by vector summation (the Root of the Sum of Squares approach).
