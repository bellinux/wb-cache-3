The spectral and energetic properties of chlorophyll a can, {{at least in}} part, be rationalised {{in terms of the}} solar spectral output and the energetics of oxygen production and carbon dioxide reduction with twophotochemical reactions. The longwavelength limit on in vivo chlorophylla absorption is probably close to the energetic limit: longer wavelengths could not support a high rate and efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis. Retinal, a b-carotene derivative that is the chromophore of rhodopsin, acts not only as a sensory pigment, but also as an ion-pumping photochemical transducer. Both sensory and energy-transforming rhodopsins occur in oxygenic phototrophs, although the extent of expression and the function of the latter are not well understood...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the study of UV-photochemical {{generation}} of volatile compounds (UV-PVG) in connection with atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Selenium (Se(IV)) was selected as a model analyte and many experiments were carried out to expand the current sum of knowledge of the topic. The study was commenced by assembling the UV-PVG apparatus in the continuous flow mode. The detection method used was AAS with externally heated quartz furnace atomizer. The focus of {{the first step of}} the study was on the construction of the volatile compounds generator (UV-photoreactor) with emphasis on the material used; tubes made of teflon or quartz of different diameters were tested. The construction of the apparatus was followed by optimization of the reaction conditions (the type and concentration of the <b>photochemical</b> <b>agent</b> and other agents, which increase the analytical signal; the carrier gas and the auxiliary hydrogen gas flow rate; the sample flow rate). Eventually, the analytical figures of merit of the selenium determination using the proposed method were found. The results showed that teflon reaction tubes are a good competitor to those made of quartz. The accuracy of the method has been successfully verified by analysis of certified reference material and its applicability has been further tested [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Chemical vapor {{generation}} (CVG) is {{a widely}} adopted sample introduction method for analytical atomic spectrometry. Nonvolatile precursors (usually ionic, metallic or organometallic species) can be transferred from the condensed phase to the gas phase, yielding the advantages of efficient matrix separation, high analyte transport efficiency, high selectivity, simple instrumentation, and ease of automation. Hydride generation enjoys the greatest popularity {{as a consequence of}} its ease of implementation, fast reaction and high yield; but photo-CVG, a newly emerging research field in analytical chemistry, may provide a powerful alternative to conventional CVG due to its simplicity, versatility and cost effectiveness. Although photocatalytic pre-reduction has been used for a number of years, the most attractive aspect of this newly emerging area is the direct generation of volatile species using photochemical reactions. Recent studies undertaken with flow through and batch reactors employing low molecular weight organic acids as <b>photochemical</b> <b>agents</b> are highlighted in this study for such systems as mercury and selenium, as well as reaction mechanisms considered for these processes. Discussion is focused on recent advances in photo-CVG, which we believe will become the subject of intensive future research initiatives. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of the glucose-transport systems in rat adipocytes and hepatocytes were compared in cells prepared from the same animals. Hormones and other agents which cause a large stimulation of 3 -O-methylglucose transport in adipocytes were without acute effect in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes displayed a lower affinity for 3 -O-methylglucose (20 mM) and alternative substrates than adipocytes (6 mM), whereas inhibitor affinities were similar in both cell types. The concentration and distribution of glucose transporters were determined by Scatchard analysis of D-glucose-inhibitable [3 H]cytochalasin B binding to subcellular fractions. In liver, most of the transporters were located in the plasma membrane (42 +/- 5 pmol/mg of protein) {{with a small amount}} (4 +/- 3 pmol/mg) in the low-density microsomal fraction ('microsomes'), the reverse of the situation in adipocytes. Glucose transporters were covalently labelled with [3 H]cytochalasin B by using the <b>photochemical</b> cross-linking <b>agent</b> hydroxysuccinimidyl- 4 -azidobenzoate and analysed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. A single D-glucose-inhibitable peak with a molecular mass of 40 - 50 kDa was seen in both plasma membrane and low-density microsomes. This peak was further characterized by isoelectric focusing and revealed a single peak of specific [3 H]cytochalasin B binding at pI 6. 05 in both low-density microsomes and plasma membrane, compared with peaks at pI 6. 4 and 5. 6 in adipocyte membranes. In summary: the glucose-transport system in hepatocytes has a lower affinity and higher capacity than that in adipocytes, and is also not accurately modulated by insulin; the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters in the liver suggests that few intracellular transporters would be available for translocation; the liver transporter has a molecular mass {{similar to that of the}} adipocyte transporter; the liver glucose transporter exists as a single charged form (pI 6. 05), compared with the multiple forms in adipocytes. This difference in charge could reflect a functionally important difference in molecular structure between the two cell types...|$|R
40|$|New photo resists {{for deep}} UV {{lithography}} {{are based on}} poly[p-hydroxistyrene] as alkali soluble matrix instead of novolaks used in commercial resists. Several approaches to efficiently inhibit the solubility of this polymer are described. Besides functionalisation of the polymer by copolymerisation with hydrophobic, photoactive o-nitrobenzylesters or, respectively, partial reaction of the phenolic hydroxyl groups with dihydropyran, low molecular, acid sensitive solubility inhibitors in combination with <b>photochemical</b> acid generating <b>agents</b> as well as sulfonium salts containing the functions of photochemical acid generation and acid labile groups in the same molecule were tested. Copolymers with o-nitrobenzylic esters satisfy all requirements for deep UV resists except that of high light sensitivity; only in combination with novolaks though, the solubility inhibiting effect yields satisfactory results. All other approaches lead to deep UV photoresists with high photosensitivity (< 100 mJ/cm" 2 and high resolution (< 0. 5 mm). In technological testing the resist based on sulfonium salts exhibited good stability against chlorine or fluorine etching processes and - as a side result - its general aptitude for X-ray lithography. Computer aided simulation was used to support the lithographic process steps of exposure and development. The objective was to generate models describing the reaction kinetics during exposure and development {{in order to be}} able to simulate the whole lithographic process. The established models allow describing the light intensity distribution in the resist layer, a working model describing the reaction kinetics. The elucidation of the photochemical reaction mechanism will be used to determine experimental kinetic constants in order to optimise resist and processing propertiesSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1274 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) comprise {{a large number}} of different species, estimated to 104 - 106. They are emitted on the Earth’s surface from a variety of biogenic and anthropogenic sources. VOCs are removed by multiple pathways from the atmosphere, by oxidation and finally by dry or wet deposition. Most primary emitted VOCs are non-polar and therefore have a low solubility in water. Oxidation facilitates efficient VOC removal by wet deposition. In the atmosphere the main <b>photochemical</b> VOC oxidation <b>agent</b> is the OH radical. As a consequence the polarity of the VOCs is increased and they can be removed faster. The oxidation of VOCs proceeds in several steps until the VOCs are deposited or are eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. A downside of the VOCs oxidation process lies in the production of significant amounts ozone if nitrogen oxide is present which is a serious health hazard. Most of the VOC oxidation takes place in lower part of the atmosphere between the altitudes of 100 to 1000 m, which is only sparsely analyzed. Therefore, fast VOCs measurements byGC-MSD on board the Zeppelin NT offered new important insights in the distribution of VOCs. The measurements were performed within the PEAGSOS campaigns in the Netherlands and in Italy in 2012. For the implementation of the GC-MSD system (HCG) on board the Zeppelin it was reconstructed to enhance its performance and to meet aviation requirements. The system was optimized to measure VOCs ranging from C 4 to C 10 as well asoxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) with a detection limit below 10 ppt. The analyzed VOCs for both parts of the campaigns showed low mean concentration below 5 ppb for all VOCs. Especially, the mixing ratios of the primary emitted VOCs were very low with mean values lower than 200 ppt. Higher concentrations could be observed for the OVOCs with mean concentrations up to 5 ppb. The most abundant OVOCs apart fromformaldehyde were methanol, ethanol, acetone and acetaldehyde...|$|R
