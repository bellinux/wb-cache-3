5|$|The {{culture of}} America {{succeeding}} the attacks is noted for heightened security {{and an increased}} demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. <b>Psychologists</b> <b>have</b> also confirmed {{that there has been}} an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> {{questioned}} {{the assumption that}} moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

25|$|Cross-cultural Consistency. Characteristics {{that have}} been {{demonstrated}} to be cross cultural human universals such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations.

25|$|All three Abrahamic {{religions}} {{were founded}} by men, so some scholars and <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> theorized {{that they may}} dramatize important themes around men's relationship with their fathers for the western world.

25|$|Humanistic psychologists {{generally}} {{do not believe that}} we will understand human consciousness and behavior through Cartesian-Newtonian scientific research.

25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{sometimes}} look to chimpanzees, bonobos, {{and other}} great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior. Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá argue that evolutionary <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> overemphasized {{the similarity of}} humans and chimps, which are more violent, while underestimating the similarity of humans and bonobos, which are more peaceful.|$|E
25|$|Linda Chapman {{and fellow}} <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> {{researched}} {{the effectiveness of}} art therapy for reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in children.

25|$|Social <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> studied {{attitude}} formation, {{the structure}} of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, {{and the relationship between}} attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.|$|E

25|$|Introversion is {{the state}} of being {{predominantly}} interested in one's own mental self. Introverts are typically perceived as more reserved or reflective. Some popular <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> characterized introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction. This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy. Few modern conceptions make this distinction.|$|E
25|$|I/O <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> also {{employed}} qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, {{and case}} studies. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods in concert. OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.|$|E

Recent {{research has demonstrated}} that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary <b>psychologists</b> <b>have</b> focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.|$|E
