Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L.

Langer's staff created <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E

Besides the Leges, other works of this type produced at this time were the Quadripartitus, parts of the Leges Edwardi Regis, the Instituta Cnuti, and the Consiliatio Cnuti. It is possible the Leges Willhelmi was also written during this time period. It is the longest of the legal tracts from its time, and made some effort to be comprehensive.|$|E

5|$|The Sumatran rhino is {{a mostly}} solitary animal except for {{courtship}} and offspring-rearing. It {{is the most}} vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, {{in part because of}} a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal <b>procedures</b> <b>that</b> would come into general disrepute.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of finding a set of {{feasible}} or near-feasible systems among a finite number of simulated systems in the presence of stochastic constraints. Andradóttir, Goldsman, and Kim (2005) present a <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> detects feasibility of systems in the presence of one constraint with a pre-specified probability of correctness. We extend their procedure to the case of multiple constraints by the use of the Bonferroni inequality. Unfortunately, the resulting procedure tends to be very conservative when the number of systems or constraints is large. As a remedy, we present a screening <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> uses an aggregated observation, which is a linear combination of the collected observations across stochastic constraints. Then, we present an accelerated <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> combine the extension of Andradóttir, Goldsman, and Kim (2005) with the <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> uses aggregated observations. Some experimental results that compare the performance of the proposed procedures are presented. ...|$|R
