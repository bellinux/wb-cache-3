40|$|Traffic {{patterns}} increasing and {{the degradation}} of existing railway steel bridges has lead to the need of an assessment of their remaining fatigue life, and deciding whether to retrofit or supply structure replacement. This paper deals with the structural assessment of an actual case study, the Adige Bridge, which connects the Rovigo and <b>Padua</b> <b>provinces</b> in northern Italy. The bridge has been in service since 1886 and the overall length is about 161 m through three spans. As a reference the innovative procedures to estimate the remaining fatigue life of bridges outlined in the JRC-ECCS document Assessment of Existing Steel Structures: Recommendations for Estimation of Remaining Fatigue Life, has been applied for the case study, together with other codes and technical instructions. Stress data, obtained by a 3 D finite element model, were used to estimate the remaining fatigue life. Assessment results, obtained by considering different traffic estimations, point out {{that most of the}} identified critical details have an infinite remaining safe life, {{but at the same time}} some members appear critical. Appropriate retrofitting criteria are proposed to support the designer in common damage situations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} 1995 - 1997, in the <b>Padua</b> <b>province</b> of the Veneto region, bark cankers were {{observed}} on 15 - 20 year old walnut trees (Juglans regia L.) and young walnut {{trees in the}} nursery. On the older trees the cankers on the trunks and on the proximal part of the scaffold branches consisted of brownish areas that often produced drops of exudate. On young trees the cankers caused longitudinal grooves, often brownish and severe deformation of the trunks. Gram-negative bacteria iso-lated from both types of canker and purified were iden-tified as Erwinia nigrifluens based on phenotypic traits (including fatty acid profiles) and pathogenicity. The symptoms caused on young trees were unusual for E. nigrifluens. This was the first report of E. nigrifluens i...|$|E
40|$|In the 6 th {{century the}} Adige river, which {{ran through the}} towns of Montagnana, Este, Monselice (Padua) and Brondolo (Chioggia, Venice), moved 20 km southward. Nevertheless, as extant churches and their liturgical {{furniture}} demonstrate, the most important towns survived this change, perhaps thanks to artificial waterways. During an update of the corpus of the early medieval churches in the <b>Padua</b> <b>province,</b> we studied these buildings systematically, using written and archaeological sources, {{as well as the}} detailed descriptions provided by the pastoral visits of the bishop Barozzi (1489). We hypothesize that a great number of recorded churches, as well as their liturgical furniture (see Vedovetto in this volume), can be dated prior the 10 th century, although this could only be confirmed by new archaeological data...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a report}} {{submitted}} by a beekeeper to Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, in <b>Padua</b> <b>province</b> (Borgoricco, Veneto, NE Italy), the authors discovered in April 2011 several specimens of the dusky sap beetle Carpophilus lugubris Murray 1864 (Coleoptera, Nitidulidae) {{on the bottom}} board of some beehives. At a later time (May 2012), an isolated specimen was also collected within a Natural Reserve in Belluno province (Feltre, Veneto, NE Italy). These specimens represent the first known records of this species in Italy or Europe as a whole. This is also the first record of the species associated with beehives. This discovery led us to review the available bionomical and faunistic data for this widespread Nearctic and Neotropical species. C. lugubris is a recognized pest of corn, therefore is very important monitoring its possible dispersal into cornfields, beehives, and other agricultural regions of NE Italy and southern Europe {{over the next few}} years...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} isolated non-ischemic left-ventricular (LV) scar {{as a cause}} of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the young and athlete remains to be established. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) is increasingly used in the clinical work-up of athletes with apparently idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and can reveal LV scar in the form of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). AIMS: we aimed to: 1) evaluate the incidence and causes (with particular reference to non-ischemic LV scar) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in people 1 - 40 year-old in the <b>Padua</b> <b>province</b> in the modern era; 2) assess the clinical profile and outcome of athletes referred to our Institution for non-ischemic LV scar as suggested by LGE at CE-CMR, which was performed for evaluation of apparently idiopathic VA and/or ECG abnormalities; 3) evaluate whether a strategy consisting of 24 -hours 12 -leads ambulatory ECG monitoring as first-line investigation and CE-CMR as second line investigation may improve our ability to identify concealed LV scar in apparently healthy athletes. METHODS: we performed three different studies: 1) we recorded all cases of OHCA which occurred during the period 2011 - 2015. The study population included all residents in the province of Padua 1 - 40 year-old who suffered OHCA, either resuscitated or not, of presumed cardiovascular origin. The cause of OHCA was ascertained clinically in survivors and at postmortem investigation in victims of sudden death; 2) we compared the clinical profile and outcome of 35 athletes with VA and isolated non-ischemic (subepicardial/midmyocardial) LGE on CE-CMR suggesting myocardial scar with 38 athletes with VA and no LGE and 40 healthy control athletes; 3) we offered a 12 -leads 24 -hours ambulatory ECG monitoring to apparently healthy athletes ‚â• 16 year-old, who performed at least 6 hours of physical exercise per week and who have been considered eligible at preparticipation screening within 1 year. Athletes were selected to undergo CE-CMR if they showed > 29 premature ventricular beats (PVBs) of ‚Äúuncommon morphology‚Äù (i. e. excluding those with a morphology suggestive of right ventricular outflow tract or fascicular origin) or repetitive VA (excluding isolated couplets with a morphology suggestive of right ventricular outflow tract origin). RESULTS: the main results for each study were: 1) the incidence of OHCA in the <b>Padua</b> <b>province</b> was 3. 5 / 100. 000 residents/year and was significantly lower among screened athletes than among non-athletes (1. 1 / 100. 000 /year vs. 3. 9 / 100. 000 /year, p< 0, 001). A final diagnosis was reached in 40 (83...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEducational {{interventions}} in school represent a primary way to introduce children {{to public health}} issues. In particular, as foodborne diseases are considered a worldwide significant problem, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), an educational program has been implemented to improve children knowledge about microorganisms‚Äô characteristics and food contamination, and their everyday behaviors concerning personal hygiene. Twelve public schools in <b>Padua</b> <b>province</b> were enrolled, {{for a total of}} 249 children attending the fifth grade of primary school. Health programs are usually targeted to adults and teenagers; a method that take into account children's peculiar learning and communicative skills was adopted. Aim of the study is to determine whether interventions based on practical activities that dynamically involve children with experiments and scientific observations are more efficient that purely theoretical programs. To assess the different effectiveness of the interventions, a between subjects experimental design has been set up, with random assignment of classes to theoretical (N= 120) and practical (N= 123) groups. The evaluation of children knowledge was assessed in two ways: 1) the analysis of a questionnaire collected before and after the intervention; 2) the analysis of a creative drawing about the microorganisms collected before and after the intervention that has been related to a semi-structured interview, to comprehend the meanings of the picture. Results show that although both the programs (theoretical and practical) were effective, the practical work stimulated a qualitatively deeper comprehension of the given information, especially in relation to the causal linkage between protective behaviors and control of contagion risk...|$|E

5000|$|Many of the {{specifics}} of Camilla Erculiani's personal life are unknown. [...] This female apothecary resided in <b>Padua,</b> Italy, a <b>province</b> of Veneto; a community that was particularly active in medical and scientific pursuits in the early modern era. [...] In fact, Galileo taught at the University of Padua during this time. Camilla, daughter to spice merchant, Andrea Greghetti, was twice married and mother of six children. Her first husband, Aloviso Stella, {{was the owner of}} an apothecary's shop called the Tre Stelle, which was located in the town of Sant'Andrea in Padua. Camilla remarried after his death. Her second husband, Giacomo Erculiani, was also an apothecary. He inherited the role of proprietor at the Tre Stelle. The details and date of her death remain a mystery, yet it is likely that she died post-1584.|$|R
40|$|Religious life in {{the later}} middle ages was {{increasingly}} dominated by the mendicant Orders, notably the Franciscans. Their dominance also extended to the artistic life of the day. The initial artistic campaigns of the Franciscans centred on the native province of the founder, most notably in the Upper and Lower churches of S. Francesco in Assisi. With {{the expansion of the}} Order and the death and canonization of the second Franciscan saint, Anthony of <b>Padua,</b> his adopted <b>province,</b> the Veneto, became an important centre for theological and artistic activity. The Basilica del Santo, built to enshrine the new saint's relics, rivalled the mother church at Assisi in both scale and lavishness of decoration. The fourteenth century in particular was marked by a succession of decorative programmes, a large part of which has survived. Soon the other Franciscan churches in the Veneto were similarly patronized. Unlike Umbria and Tuscany, areas where Franciscan churches are ridden with problems of dating and attribution, the Order' churches in the Veneto are probably the best documented of Italy. They provided a unique opportunity to set up a control of Franciscan patronage of the arts during the later middle ages. This thesis touches on all types of Franciscan patronage: conventual, and lay, communal and ecclesiastical. This research relied on a newly published Franciscan archive of over 27, 000 documents, and is the first extensive survey of its kind for the Franciscan Order. It is hoped that this contribution has filled some gaps in our knowledge of artistic patronage. Firstly it has thrown light on the role played by the Order of friars minor in artistic projects, from the initial planning stages to the commissioning, execution and supervision of works. It has been shown that Franciscans were not always involved in artistic projects; at times they cooperated with individuals, or families, and at other times they played no part at all. Whether actively involved or more inactive, the friars were open to all sorts of artistic experiments, which means that the Franciscan church was an ideal environment for creativity...|$|R
