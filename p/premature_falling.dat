Post dormancy beetles appeared in leaf litter following annual leaf shedding, whereas larvae, pupae and teneral adults were present after leaf flush. No stages were recorded from plantations following the summer rains until the annual litter fall in the next season. Parental adults peaked at the time of leaf sprouting and tender leaf fall. Larvae and teneral adults peaked at the time of <b>premature</b> <b>fall</b> of green leaves and flowers. Teneral adults of six age classes were recorded and all entered dormancy irrespective of the feeding time available to each age class. Females outnumbered males in the parent generation, while the sex ratio of new generation adults was not biased towards either sex. The phenological stages of rubber trees included leaf fall in late December and early January, leaf sprouting and new leaf production in January and flowering in February. All feeding stages of L. tristis peaked in abundance when premature leaves are most abundant in the leaf litter. Prediction of the timing of appearance of various developmental stages of L. tristis in plantations, invasion into buildings and intensity of population build up in rubber belts is possible by tracking the phenology of leaf fall in rubber plantations, time of return of post dormancy adults and the onset of summer rainfall.

Winter chill is essential for most of the plants that fall dormant in the winter in order to avoid frost damage and do not resume growth until a certain amount of winter chill has accumulated for fulfilling their chilling requirement. Climate change is likely to affect chilling requirement of temperate fruit crops significantly and therefore, the opportunity to meet this requirement will be reduced as the climate becomes warmer. Increase in average global temperature would move the existing plant species and varieties to new latitudinal belts with favourable climates. It is, therefore, possible that crops that are used to be productive in one area may no longer be so or the other way round. The resultant of these climate changes are clearly apparent in the shifting of apple cultivation from lower elevations to higher altitudes in India. Insufficient chilling greatly influences flower initiation and fruit colouration along with deterioration in fruit texture and taste. Further, the lack of proper chilling is also posing serious problems like scab disease, <b>premature</b> leaf <b>fall</b> and infestation of red spider mite in apple.

In this study, {{the effects of}} different doses of ethephon, applied at preharvest, on harvest anticipation of 'Ubá' mango were evaluated. On the 17 th week after anthesis, 25 mango trees, five per treatment, were sprayed with ethephon at 0, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg L- 1, plus 0. 5 % of mineral oil. Five fruits from each plant were harvested daily until full ripening, and evaluated. Except, for dose 0 mg L- 1, in which six days after ethephon application (DAAE), harvest was carried out weekly up to 41 DAAE The treated fruit presented a more intense flesh color than the non-treated, particularly at the doses of 500 and 750 mg L- 1. Fruit treated with 500, 750 and 1000 mg L- 1 showed abrupt firmness reduction from the 1 st DAAE and TSS higher than 18 °Brix on the 6 th DAAE. Non-treated fruit presented slower firmness reduction and reached 18 °Brix on the 35 th DAAE. The dose of 1000 mg L- 1 of ethephon resulted in <b>premature</b> <b>fall</b> and low fruit quality. Application of 500 or 750 mg L- 1 of ethephon allowed to anticipate and to standardize mango harvesting. These doses also allowed harvesting fruit with the best commercial quality and without the need of climatization after harvest. A aplicação pré-colheita de ethephon, composto que libera etileno quando hidrolisado, pode antecipar e uniformizar a colheita de manga. Neste trabalho foram avaliados os efeitos de diferentes doses de ethephon, aplicadas na pré-colheita, sobre a antecipação da colheita de manga 'Ubá'. Na 17 ª semana após a antese, 25 mangueiras, sendo cinco por tratamento, foram pulverizadas com ethephon nas doses 0, 250, 500, 750 e 1000 L- 1, acrescido de 0, 5 % de óleo mineral. Foram colhidos 10 frutos de cada planta, diariamente, até o completo amadurecimento, com exceção da dose 0 L- 1, em que, a partir de 6 dias após aplicação do ethephon (DAAE), a colheita foi semanal até 42 DAAE. Dos 10 frutos colhidos, cinco foram analisados no dia da colheita e cinco armazenados a 20 ± 080 °C e 90 ± 5 % UR e avaliados após o completo amadurecimento. Frutos tratados apresentaram coloração de polpa mais intensa que os não tratados, especialmente na dose 500 L- 1. Frutos tratados com 500, 750 e 1000 L- 1 apresentaram brusca queda da firmeza a partir do 1 ºDAAE, e SST superiores a 18 °brix no 6 ºDAAE, enquanto nos não tratados, a queda da firmeza foi mais lenta e atingiram 18 °brix aos 35 ºDAAE. A dose de 1000 L- 1 de ethephon resultou em queda prematura e má qualidade final dos frutos. Frutos colhidos no 3 oDAAE e armazenados atingiram o completo amadurecimento com 12, 7, 6, 4 e 6 dias para as doses 0, 250, 500, 750 e 1000 L- 1, respectivamente. A aplicação de 500 ou 750 L- 1 de ethephon, seguida da colheita no 3 oDAAE, permitiu a obtenção de frutos com qualidade comercial, além de dispensar a climatização após a colheita...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom 1962 to 2002, at the Saraoutou {{research}} {{station on the}} island of Santo in Vanuatu, a hybrid creation programme was implemented to improve the productive potential of coconut cultivars. The first stage was to create a collection by introducing around thirty exotic varieties. All those varieties and most of the 60 hybrids created proved to be susceptible to coconut foliar decay, a viral disease transmitted by Myndus taffini and endemic in Vanuatu. Only the Vanuatu Tall populations and two hybrids (Vanuatu Red Dwarf x Vanuatu Tall and Vanuatu Tall x Rennell Island Tall) displayed tolerance enabling their distribution to farmers. The author indicates the origin of the parents and the production characteristics of these two hybrids. The Vanuatu Red Dwarf x Vanuatu Tall hybrid expresses good hybrid vigour with a production potential ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 4 tons per hectare per year. However, it does have several defects: slow germination and a highly irregular final germinated nut rate, susceptibility to cyclones when young, <b>premature</b> nut <b>fall</b> sometimes seen on young palms, and a mediocre copra content (between 135 and 160 g). The Vanuatu Tall x Rennell Island Tall hybrid stands out through its early start to bearing (4 years), its vigour and its good adaptation to cyclones. The copra content of its nuts (between 210 and 245 g) is better than that of the Vanuatu Tall, making copra preparation easier. Its production ranges from 2. 5 to 3 tons per hectare per year, which is around 30 % better than the improved Vanuatu Tall (Elite Vanuatu Tall). However, dissemination of this hybrid, which can only be produced in centralized seed gardens, is limited by the cost of production and of transport throughout the archipelago. Only large-scale Elite Vanuatu Tall production in decentralized seed gardens would enable a significant improvement in coconut productivity in Vanuatu...|$|R
40|$|Cameras {{have become}} common {{in our society}} {{and as a result}} there is more video {{available}} today than ever before. While the video can be used for entertainment or possibly as storage it can also be used as a sensor capturing crucial information, The information captured can be put to all types of uses, but one particular use is to identify a fall. The importance of identifying a fall can be seen especially in the older population that is affected by falls every year. The falls experienced by the elderly are devastating as they can cause apprehension to normal life activities and in some cases <b>premature</b> death. Another <b>fall</b> related issue is the intentional deception in a business with intent of insurance fraud. Classification algorithms based on video can be constructed to detect falls and separate them as either accidental or intentional. This thesis proposes an algorithm based on frame segmentation, and speed components in the x, y, z directions over time t. The speed components are estimated from the video of orthogonally positioned cameras. The algorithm can discern between fall activities and others like sitting on the floor, lying on the floor, or exercising...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that in {{patients}} with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), spontaneous or stimulated atrial <b>premature</b> depolarizations (APD) <b>falling</b> within a specific portion of the relative refractory period of the atrioventricular (A-V) conduction system initiate SVT. The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether the A-V nodal conduction delay these APDs exhibit, or their coupling interval, is essential for the initiation of SVT. Multiple episodes of SVT were initiated and termi-nated by single APDs in four patients with a history of paroxysmal SVT. The atria were then paced at numerous fixed rates in excess of the spontaneous sinus rate. In each patient, at atrial rates where progressive A-V nodal conduction delay occurred from beat to beat (Wenckebach cycles), a specific degree of A-V nodal conduction delay always resulted in atrial reentry or SVT. Although the atrial coupling interval was considerably longer during Wenckebach cycles initiating SVT than for single APDs resulting in the arrhythmia, the prolongation of A-V nodal conduction was identical. Independent of atrial coupling interval, a requisite degree of A-V nodal conduction delay always resulted in atrial echoes or SVT. This supports the con-clusion that SVT results from atrial reentry via the A-V node...|$|R
