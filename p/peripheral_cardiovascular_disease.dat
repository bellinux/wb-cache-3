40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes-related chronic complications in type 2 diabetes, and also the association between HRQoL and the number of chronic complications. Methods: One hundred patients with type 2 diabetes were interviewed. HRQoL was evaluated using the age-adjusted Short-Form 36 dimensions (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Results: The mean age of the study population was 62. 7 ± 8. 7 years; 54. 0 % were male, and 51. 0 % were receiving only oral hypoglycemic agents. Chronic complications were related to worse HRQoL in different dimensions: <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> (all, except bodily pain), retinopathy (physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health), peripheral arterial disease (physical functioning, role-physical, and general health), and nephropathy (general health and vitality). Hypertension was related to worse general health and vitality. An increased number of chronic complications was associated with worse HRQoL in all dimensions of Short-Form 36 except for the bodily pain dimension.

40|$|Abstract Chronic arsenic {{poisoning}} {{is reported}} to be associated with <b>peripheral</b> and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> arteriosclerosis, Raynaud’s syndrome, hypertension, and Blackfoot disease. Monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) is a reactive metabolite of inorganic arsenic and a potent inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Ar-senic is also reported to phosphorylate eNOS in cultured keratinocyte and Human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells, respectively. In the present study, we examined the cyto-toxicity and eNOS phosphorylation by MMAIII exposure in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC).

40|$|Abstract—It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that suboptimal blood glucose control results in adverse effects on large blood vessels, thereby accelerating atherosclerosis and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> manifested as myocardial infarction, stroke, and <b>peripheral</b> vascular <b>disease.</b> <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> is accelerated by both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia generally occurs {{in the absence of}} elevated blood lipid levels, whereas type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with dyslipidemia. In this review article, we discuss hyperglycemia versus hyperlipidemia as culprits in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> with emphasis on studies in mouse models and isolated vascular cells. Recent studies on LDL receptor–deficient mice that are hyperglycemic, but exhibit no marked dyslipidemia compared with nondiabetic controls, show that diabetes in the absence of diabetes-induced hyperlipidemia is associated with an accelerated formation of atherosclerotic lesions, similar to what is seen in fat-fed nondiabetic mice. These effects of diabetes are masked in severely dyslipidemic mice, suggesting that the effects of glucose and lipids on lesion initiation might be mediated by similar mechanisms. Recent evidence from isolated endothelial cells demonstrates that glucose and lipids can induce endothelial dysfunction through similar intracellular mechanisms. Analogous effects of glucose and lipids are also seen in macrophages. Furthermore, glucose exerts many of its cellular effects through lipid mediators. We propose that diabetes without associated dyslipidemia accelerates atherosclerosis by mechanisms that ca...|$|R

40|$|Pathophysiology of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in {{hemodialysis}} patients. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> is {{the principal}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in dialysis patients. The principal alterations responsible are left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial disease characterized by an enlargement and hypertrophy of arteries and the high prevalence of atheromatous plaques. Left ventricular hypertrophy is the consequence of combined effects of chronic hemodynamic overload and nonhemodynamic biochemical and neurohumoral factors characteristic of uremia. The hemodynamic overload is due to flow and pressure overload. The flow overload is tightly related to hyperkinetic circulation caused by anemia, arteriovenous fistula, or overhydration and is characterized by an enlargement of the left ventricular cavity. The pressure overload in these patients is more tightly related to abnormal geometry and function of large conduit arteries, principally the stiffening of arterial tree. The flow overload is also in large part responsible for remodeling of arterial tree, and as the heart and vessels are a coupled interactive physiological system, cardiac and vascular alterations occur in parallel, being induced to a great extent by the same hemodynamic abnormalities. The principal clinical consequences of left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial alterations are heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and <b>peripheral</b> artery <b>disease.</b> <b>Cardiovascular</b> alterations are only partly reversible, and efforts should be directed toward early prevention...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is associated}} with comorbid atherosclerosis of the coronary and carotid arteries and is a significant risk factor for stroke. However, cognitive function in PAD patients before clinically evident stroke remains poorly characterized. Here we hypothesized that, on neuropsychological testing, PAD patients would perform more poorly than healthy control subjects, and persons with mild <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> (essential hypertension), but better than stroke patients, thus reflecting a continuum of cognitive impairment associated with increased severity of vascular disease. Method: The cognitive performance of 38 PAD patients (mean ankle-brachial index 0. 67, Fontaine Class II) was contrasted with that of 23 healthy normotensive controls, 20 essential hypertensives, and 26 anterior ischemic stroke patients on twelve neuropsychological tests. Results: PAD patients performed significantly more poorly than hypertensives and normotensives, but better than stroke patients, on seven tests of nonverbal memory, concentration, executive function, perceptuo-motor speed, and manual dexterity. Hyperten-sives displayed poorer performance than normotensives on tests of nonverbal memory and manual dexterity. These findings were independent of age, education, and depression scores. Higher diastolic blood pressure and plasma glucose levels predicted poorer performance of select cognitive tests by PAD patients. Eight to 67 % of PAD patients displayed impaired performance (5 th percentile of normotensive controls) on the seven aforementioned cognitive tests. Conclusions: PAD patients exhibit diminished performance {{across a variety of}} domains of cognitive function. Findings also suggest a continuum of cognitive impairment associated with increasingly severe manifestations of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> thus emphasizing the need for enhanced preventative measures to avert functional declines.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>peripheral,</b> cerebro- and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> (CVD) {{in patients with}} type 2 dia-betes mellitus is approximately {{twice as high as}} in the non-diabetic population. Conventional cardio-vascular risk factors such as plasma lipids, lipoproteins and hypertension only partially explain this excessive risk of developing atherosclerosis and CVD. Meta-analysis of studies performed in non-diabetic populations indicates that the risk of CVD increases continuously with glucose levels above 4. 2 mmol/l. The glucose hypothesis suggests that treatment which normalizes glucose levels prevents or delays the long-term complications of diabetes mellitus. However, the outcome of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrates that glucose control does not completely prevent CVD. In healthy subjects, serum IGF-I levels peak in early adulthood, after which they gradually decrease with increasing age. Several observations suggest that there is a premature and progressive age-related decline in serum IGF-I bioactivity in type 2 diabetics, which eventually results in a (relative) IGF-I deficiency. In type 2 diabetics, close relationships have been demonstrated between glycaemic control and serum IGF-I levels, with worse control being associated with lower IGF-I levels. Several studies (in non-diabetics) suggest that lowered circulating IGF-I levels account for a poor outcome o...|$|R

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{affects a}} considerable {{percentage of the}} population. The manifestations of this disease are not always clinically overt. As a result, PAD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. PAD {{is not just a}} disease of the peripheral arteries, but also an indication of generalized vascular atherosclerosis. PAD patients also have a high prevalence of other arterial diseases, such as coronary/carotid artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms. PAD is also a predictor of increased risk of lung and other cancers. The most often used examination for the establishment of the diagnosis of PAD, the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), is also a predictor of generalized atherosclerosis, future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Several markers that have been linked with PAD (e. g. C-reactive protein, serum bilirubin levels) may also have predictive value for other conditions besides PAD (e. g. kidney dysfunction). The management of PAD should therefore not be restricted to the peripheral circulation but should include measurements to manage and decrease the systemic atherosclerotic burden of the patient.

40|$|SummaryDiabetes is {{associated}} with a marked increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disorders, including coronary, cerebrovascular, and <b>peripheral</b> artery <b>disease.</b> <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> (CVD) could account for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes. Conventional risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and a positive family history, contribute similarly to macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects. The levels of these factors in diabetic patients are certainly increased, but not enough to explain the exaggerated risk for macrovascular complications in the diabetic population. Furthermore, recently, macrovascular complications of diabetes have been shown to start before the onset of diabetes. Indeed, several clinical studies have confirmed the increased risk of CVD in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Since insulin resistance-related postprandial metabolic derangements are thought to {{play a central role in}} the development and progression of CVD in patients with IGT, amelioration of postprandial metabolic disturbance is a therapeutic target for the prevention of CVD in these high-risk patients. Therefore, in this paper, we review the molecular mechanisms for the increased risk of CVD in recent onset diabetes mellitus, especially focusing on postprandial dysmetabolism. We also discuss here the potential therapeutic strategies that specially target the mechanisms responsible for vascular alterations in diabetes...|$|R

Cross-sectional analyses of AANCC prevalence (including cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, renal, bone, and malignant disease) and risk factors in a prospective cohort study of HIV type 1 -infected individuals and HIV-uninfected controls, who were aged ≥ 45 years and comparable regarding most lifestyle and demographic factors. HIV-infected participants (n = 540) had a significantly higher mean number of AANCCs than controls (n = 524) (1. 3 [SD, 1. 14] vs 1. 0 [SD, 0. 95]; P <. 001), with significantly more HIV-infected participants having ≥ 1 AANCC (69. 4 % vs 61. 8 %; P =. 009). Hypertension, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, and impaired renal function were significantly more prevalent among HIV-infected participants. Risk of AANCC by ordinal logistic regression was independently associated with age, smoking, positive family history for cardiovascular/metabolic disease, and higher waist-to-hip ratio, but also with HIV infection (odds ratio, 1. 58 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 23 - 2. 03]; P <. 001). In those with HIV, longer exposure to CD 4 counts < 200 cells/µL, and, to a lesser extent, higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and soluble CD 14, and longer prior use of high-dose ritonavir (≥ 400 mg/ 24 hours) were each also associated with {{a higher risk of}} AANCCs.

Foremost among those are the long-term adverse effects of treatment, which might only occur decades after the initial disease has been successfully treated, these include among others <b>peripheral</b> neurotoxicity [2], <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> and second malignant neoplasms [3]. For example, already 1 year after radiotherapy, the risk of acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma is increased in patients with solid tumors [4]. So far, comprehensive studies addressing these issues are sadly lacking. In addition, there are rather acute effects of treatment that can severely affect a child's quality of life, and among these can be treatment-induced loss of hearing, fatigue and weakness, increased susceptibility to infection, and growth retardation. Current treatment options often appear harsh and even morbid to young patients and their parents.
