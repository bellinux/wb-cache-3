5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E

5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a <b>pole</b> <b>star.</b> The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pole</b> <b>stars</b> {{of other}} planets are defined analogously: they are stars (brighter than 6th magnitude, i.e., {{visible to the}} naked eye under ideal conditions) that most closely {{coincide}} with the projection of the planet's axis of rotation onto the Celestial sphere. Different planets have different <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> because their axes are oriented differently. (See Poles of astronomical bodies.) ...|$|R

5000|$|Kochab and its {{neighbor}} Pherkad served as twin <b>pole</b> <b>stars,</b> circling the North Pole, from 1500 BC until 500 AD. Ancient Egyptian astronomers {{referred to them}} as [...] "The Indestructibles". Neither star was as proximitous to the celestial north pole as Polaris is now. Today, they are {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Guardians of the Pole." [...] Due to precession of the equinoxes, the previous holder of the title was Thuban, and the next was the present-day Polaris. This succession of <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> is a result of Earth's precessional motion.|$|R
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E

The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a play on the name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.|$|E

Especially intriguing is the fact that palatial and ceremonial structures of these cultures were carefully aligned to the celestial pole and the procession of <b>pole</b> <b>stars.</b> Pankenier notes that the true celestial pole lies in a sky template which is vacant of significant stars, and that the various <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> are those nearest to this vacant apex which is of crucial importance.|$|R

5|$|Intellectual men {{of letters}} like the {{versatile}} Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects {{as diverse as}} mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, art criticism, archaeology, military strategy, and diplomacy, among others. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo was {{the first}} to discern {{magnetic}} declination of true north while experimenting with a compass. Shen theorized that geographical climates gradually shifted over time. He created a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern geomorphology. He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham {{was the first}} to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{wrote that}} it was {{preferable}} to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points — and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death. The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the <b>pole</b> <b>star</b> and true north; however, it could also {{have been inspired by}} geomantic beliefs and practices. The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation. However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the compass might have already been in navigational use. In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> {{are special}} {{because they are}} {{approximately}} {{in line with the}} Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).|$|R
5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as boreal <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> at the time.|$|R

5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north <b>pole</b> <b>star,</b> to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E

2500|$|Written {{records of}} {{navigation}} using stars, or celestial navigation, {{go back to}} Homer’s Odyssey where Calypso tells Odysseus to keep the Bear (Ursa Major) on his left hand side {{and at the same}} time to observe the position of the Pleiades, the late-setting Boötes and the Orion as he sailed eastward from her island Ogygia traversing the Ocean. [...] The Greek poet Aratus wrote in his Phainomena in the third century BC detailed positions of the constellations as written by Eudoxos. The positions described do not match the locations of the stars during Aratus’ or Eudoxos’ time for the Greek mainland, but some argue that they match the sky from Crete during the Bronze Age. This change in the position of the stars is due to the wobble of the Earth on its axis which affects primarily the <b>pole</b> <b>stars.</b> Around 1000 BC the constellation Draco would have been closer to the North Pole than Polaris. The <b>pole</b> <b>stars</b> were used to navigate because they did not disappear below the horizon and could be seen consistently throughout the night.|$|R

25|$|The Serpent Mound {{may have}} been {{designed}} {{in accord with the}} pattern of stars composing the constellation Draco. The star pattern of the constellation Draco fits with fair precision to the Serpent Mound, with the ancient <b>Pole</b> <b>Star,</b> Thuban (α Draconis), at its geographical center within the first of seven coils from the head. The fact that the body of Serpent Mound follows the pattern of Draco may support various theses. Putnam's 1865 refurbishment of the earthwork could have been correctly accomplished in that a comparison of Romain's or Fletcher and Cameron's maps from the 1980s show how the margins of the Serpent align with great accuracy to a large portion of Draco. Some researchers date the earthwork to around 5,000 years ago, based on the position of Draco, through the backward motion of precessionary circle of the ecliptic when Thuban was the <b>Pole</b> <b>Star.</b> Alignment of the effigy to the <b>Pole</b> <b>Star</b> at that position also shows how true north {{may have been}} found.

50|$|Although {{the south}} {{celestial}} pole currently lacks a bright star like Polaris to mark its position, slow changes over time (due {{to the effects of}} precession) mean that other stars will become southern <b>pole</b> <b>stars.</b> For example, in the next 7500 years, the {{south celestial pole}} will pass close to the stars Gamma Chamaeleontis (4200 CE), I Carinae, Omega Carinae (5800 CE), Upsilon Carinae, Iota Carinae (Aspidiske, 8100 CE) and Delta Velorum (9200 CE).|$|R
