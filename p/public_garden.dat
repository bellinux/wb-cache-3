5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. Mallard fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden</b> Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden.</b> However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for McCloskey's illustrations, {{executed}} in charcoal then lithographed on zinc plates. As of 2003, {{the book had}} sold over two million copies. The book's popularity led {{to the construction of}} a statue by Nancy Schön in the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden</b> of the mother duck and her eight ducklings, which is a popular destination for children and adults alike. In 1991, Barbara Bush gave a duplicate of this sculpture to Raisa Gorbachev as part of the START Treaty, and the work is displayed in Moscow's Novodevichy Park.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Mallards molt, {{and would}} not be able to fly until their new wings grew again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden</b> in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a {{warren of}} tunnels: previously, live animals {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's <b>public</b> <b>garden,</b> {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a <b>public</b> <b>garden</b> on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
5|$|Boston Common, {{located near}} the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the {{adjacent}} Boston <b>Public</b> <b>Garden,</b> {{it is part of}} the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city. The Emerald Necklace includes Jamaica Pond, Boston's largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the city's largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo. Another major park is the Esplanade, located along the banks of the Charles River. The Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is located adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with the major parks and beaches located near Castle Island; in Charlestown; and along the Dorchester, South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.|$|E
40|$|Lyons, Robert E. Interpretation can be {{the most}} {{effective}} way for <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> to communicate with their audiences by connecting their interests with the mission and resources of the organization. As the messages that <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> strive to communicate become more complex and the interests and backgrounds of visitors become increasingly diverse, interpretation is more important than ever to fulfilling the mission of many <b>public</b> <b>gardens.</b> However, the importance of interpretation is easily overlooked, and many <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> struggle to understand interpretation, its role in public horticulture, and how to best develop it. This research compares and contrasts a variety of approaches to interpretation development at <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> using surveys, case studies, and expert interviews. Different approaches are analyzed, including the organization???s perceived value of an approach and staff satisfaction with various aspects of their own interpretation and development processes. Staff and volunteer training, interpretive planning documents, professional development organizations, evaluation, staff composition, and barriers faced in the interpretation development process are all factors included in this analysis. Survey results revealed many interpretive development practices that are yielding significant benefits for <b>public</b> <b>gardens.</b> The data also revealed that the majority of <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> have significant room for improvement with regard to interpretation planning and development. For instance, organizations {{were more likely to be}} satisfied with the interpretive media that they routinely evaluated, but few organizations routinely conducted evaluation of interpretive media or messages. This research led to the development of a set of recommendations for <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> that will help guide decision-making related to interpretation development practices.

40|$|Lyons, Robert E. Wetlands {{have been}} {{neglected}} and threatened, and have dwindled {{to only a}} half of their original size in the United States. Today, the loss and degradation of wetland ecosystems is still continuing rapidly. Lack of connections among wetland science, public awareness, and government regulations contribute to complex wetland issues. <b>Public</b> <b>gardens</b> have extraordinary potential to strengthen the connection between people and nature. They can {{play a significant role}} in moving the trend away from destroying wetlands and wildlife species through aesthetic displays, educational programs and conveying conservation messages. Although wetland ecosystems have great value, few studies have demonstrated the impacts of wetlands in <b>public</b> <b>gardens.</b> The objective of this study was to examine how wetlands in <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> are used differently according to their respective missions, especially for aesthetics, education, and conservation. In particular, this study emphasized the differences in wetland utilization between <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> with or without conservation missions. A survey was sent to 69 <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> in North America representing 28 states and 51 completed the survey. The survey results were utilized to analyze overall wetlands practices in <b>public</b> <b>gardens,</b> as well as to verify the differences between conservation mission-based institutions and those that are non-conservation mission-based. From those, three institutions were chosen for case studies to focus on more specific aspects. The survey and case study data indicated significant differences between both groups in terms of perception of wetland conservation, collaborations, and aesthetic viewpoint of biodiversity. Wetlands are sufficiently complex that <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> need to explore the best ways to connect them with their missions. Results from this study can be used by <b>public</b> <b>gardens</b> to manage or create their wetlands sustainably, as well from aesthetic and educational perspectives. M. S.

5|$|In {{response}} to the public concern about the mosque's size, the mosque's trustees did not choose Mangera's design for the final plan, deciding instead on a scaled-down structure. Abdul Sattar Shahid, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Tablighi Jamaat trustees, announced that the firm of Allies and Morrison was retained to design the mosque. In November 2011, it was reported that Allies & Morrison had been replaced by NRAP Architects. An outline planning application was submitted in May 2012. The scheme prepared by NRAP Architects included a prayer hall for over 9000, a refectory for 2000 and an Islamic library set within a <b>public</b> <b>garden.</b> A needs analysis and viability assessment submitted with the planning application seek to demonstrate that the proposals represent a justifiable departure from planning policy.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden</b> feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the <b>public</b> <b>garden</b> known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a <b>public</b> <b>garden</b> in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the <b>Public</b> <b>Garden</b> for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E
