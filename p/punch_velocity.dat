This influence is considerably induced by the velocity dependent friction behavior between sample and tool. A further influence is the strain rate dependent forming behavior of the material. In micro range, the influence of <b>punch</b> <b>velocity</b> on the deep drawing process could, due to the size effects, be different from that in macro range, for example the spring back behavior. In this article the influence of <b>punch</b> <b>velocity</b> on the spring back behavior in micro deep drawing is investigated using strip drawing test with two different widths (1 mm and 2 mm). Experiments with aluminum strips with a thickness of 50 µm were performed with punch velocities ranged from 1 mm/s to 1000 mm/s. The strain behavior, which occurs with different punch velocities are investigated on the basis of microsections. The spring back of all samples was measured by an optical measurement system and compared with each other. From the reported work it can be concluded, that with increasing <b>punch</b> <b>velocity</b> the spring back of the complete system is increasing, while the spring back at cup wall stays constant.

Such alloys show anomalous mechanical properties such as deformation anisotropy and asymmetry in tension-compression originating from their specific crystallographic structure, which is hexagonal closed packed (hcp). One of the basic metal forming process for semi-finished products is extrusion. Since extrusion involves complex thermo-mechanical and multiaxial loading conditions resulting in large strains, high strain rates {{and an increase in}} temperature due to deformation, a proper yield criterion and hardening law is an important issue. A phenomenological model based on the Cazacu-Barlat yield potential has been proposed that takes strain, strain rate and temperature dependency on flow behaviour into consideration. A hybrid methodology of experiment and finite element simulation has been adopted in order to obtain necessary model parameters. Compression tests were executed at different <b>punch</b> <b>velocities</b> and test temperatures in order to describe the temperature and rate dependency on deformation. Simulations of compression tests were performed to fit model parameters by comparing with the corresponding experimental results.

Laboratory manufactured polyester laminates were produced with different resins, filler sizes and forms of glass fibre re-inforcement. These experimental boards were punched and analysed in respect to specific punching criteria and laminate punched quality. The punch quality (PQ) was assessed by a quanti tative technique using a magnified image of the punched contour and a graticule; the punch contour used was of a special design to incorporate the PQ requirements and provide the extreme crack propagation geometry. The surface density of the glass fibre re-inforcement was found to' be a primary factor influencing the main punch load and shear energy criteria used. The ladder stripping load required to remove the ladder from the punch was also investigated by means of a strain-gauged stripper-pad, and showed an important sensitivity to punching temperature, which could be utilized in industry when ladder stripping is a problem.

40|$|In {{this modern}} era {{the demand for}} {{reducing}} the vehicle weight for improved the fuel efficiency and structure stiffness for safety is high. Therefore, {{it will lead to}} the use of the advanced high strength steel (AHSS). It has been a trend in automotive and aircraft industry. Thus, sheet metal from various thicknesses are selected to be use in many auto parts. The purpose of this project is to determine the influence of sheet from various thicknesses to their formability by determining the forming limit diagram (FLD) of the sheet metal. The method that are used to perform the analysis is the finite element simulation in the Hyperform module of Altair’s Hyperwork. The incremental radioss analysis is used with single action draw and shell element is selected. Several parameters such as blank holder force and <b>punch</b> <b>velocity</b> have been controlled. The punch size and press force is constant for all the conducted simulation. After the simulations, the FLD and percentage of thinning are studied in Hyperview module. After result and data are produced several conclusion can be made in order to improve the quality and for better performance of the project...|$|E
40|$|In {{an ongoing}} quest to realize lighter {{vehicles}} with improved fuel efficiency, deformation {{characteristics of the}} material AA 6016 is investigated. In {{the first part of}} this study, material behavior of Al–Mg–Si sheet alloy is investigated under different process (temperature and strain rate) and loading (uniaxial and biaxial) conditions experimentally. Later, warm cylindrical cup deep drawing experiments were performed to study the effect of various parameters on warm forming processes, such as the effect of <b>punch</b> <b>velocity,</b> holding time, temper and temperature on force-displacement response. The plastic anisotropy of the material which can be directly reflected by the earing behavior of the drawn cups has also been studied. Finite element simulations can be a powerful tool for the design of warm forming processes and tooling. Their accuracy will depend on the availability of material models that are capable of describing the influence of temperature and strain rate on the flow stresses. The physically based Nes model is used to describe the influence of temperature and strain rate and the Vegter yield criterion is used to describe the plastic anisotropy of the sheet. Experimental drawing test data are used to validate the modeling approaches...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{successful}} {{development of}} the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) process in metals provides a feasible solution to produce ultra-fine or nano-grained bulk: materials with tailored material properties. However, ECAP is difficult to scale up commercially due to excessive load requirements. In this paper, a new Multi-ECAP process with die rotation is considered to obtain ultra-fine grain structured materials under a moderate deformation force. It is shown that an addition of torsion results in {{a reduction in the}} pressing force and an increase in severity of plastic deformation. An analysis using the upper bound method is found to be useful in predicting the pressing load and flow pattern of ECAP with and without rotational dies. Solutions are obtained for different inclined channel angles under different angular velocities of dies. Relative pressures are presented and some computed solutions are compared with those found by FEM simulation. The theoretical predictions of the pressing load are in good agreement with the simulation results. The amount of plastic deformation is determined by the inclined angle between the two intersecting channels, and the velocity ratio between the angular velocity of dies and the normal component of the <b>punch</b> <b>velocity.</b> <br /...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{trend in}} the cell phone {{component}} industry to use aluminium and magnesium alloys {{has resulted in the}} advanced processing technologies. Semi-solid forming process that is advantageous for the mass production of thin parts with complex shapes have been of interest as a promising tool for near net-shape manufacturing. This study describes a semi-solid forming process {{for the development of a}} 1 [*]mm-thick cell phone case by using the rheological material prepared by electromagnetic stirring equipment. Thus, a new type of die design for indirect rheoforging was proposed to efficiently control the primary α-Al phase particles in the thin part under rheological conditions. Their microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated and compared to parts produced without electromagnetic stirring. Those products fabricated by electromagnetic stirring had better mechanical properties and globular microstructures than those fabricated without electromagnetic stirring. Several processing parameters such as <b>punch</b> <b>velocity</b> (30 [*]mm/s), punch pressure (75 – 250 [*]MPa), stirring time (10 [*]s), and solid fraction (0 – 20 %) were used. The optimal condition that resulted in a defect-free component with the improved mechanical properties was explained and discussed...|$|E
