5|$|Despite these raids, the war's outcome {{had become}} apparent. Defections of ZNDH {{personnel}} and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery {{took place on}} 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs, {{one of which was}} confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogožarski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and shot on the spot.|$|E
5|$|The nine Fiat G.50bis fighters {{took off}} from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before {{crossing}} the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft {{had to wait until}} 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 gull wing fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogožarski R-100 <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> fighter-trainers.|$|E

50|$|Thomas-Morse {{did manage}} to win a {{contract}} for 12 MB-3s for the US Marine Corps in May 1921, with the order later being changed to substitute two MB-7 racing aircraft, a MB-3 with the biplane <b>wings</b> replaced by <b>parasol</b> <b>wings,</b> for two MB-3s, with a further MB-3 purchased {{when one of the}} MB-7s crashed. Additionally, the Army ordered three MB-6, another racing version of the MB-3 with shorter span wings and a more powerful engine in May 1921.|$|R
50|$|The Falcon was {{constructed}} from plans {{supplied by the}} Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (the controlling body for gliding in Germany). Originally designed by Alexander Lippisch, the T.1 was a single-seat sport glider of moderate performance for its day. The fuselage was primarily of wooden construction with six longerons, built-up frames, plywood skinning forward of the central pylon and fabric covering aft. The <b>parasol</b> <b>wings</b> were conventional in design and construction with built-up ribs and spars, plywood covering forward of the main spars and fabric aft. They were swept at 12.5o but carried ailerons with unswept hinges and rounded trailing edges. The wings were built in two parts joined at the centre, supported by a pylon {{and a total of}} eight struts, four vertical from the top longerons and four in vee pairs from the bottom longerons to approx 1/3-span. The tail surfaces were constructed in a similar fashion also braced with struts.|$|R

5000|$|The A.33 was a four-engined flying-boat with a <b>parasol</b> {{monospar}} <b>wing,</b> {{the wing}} {{was supported by}} two angled N-struts which connected the wing to hull-mounted sponsons. The hull-mounted sponsons were used rather than wingtip floats and were also used as fuel tanks. A Saro Cloud was modified with a monospar wing and sponsons to test the design concepts. The A.33 serial number K4773 first flew on 14 October 1938. However, the A33 prototype was written off after structural failure sustained during high-speed taxi trials on 25 October 1938 and development was abandoned.

The flying boat glider had a boat shaped hull, <b>parasol</b> mounted swept <b>wings,</b> open cockpit and a prominent fin, with wooden construction throughout. The Mü1 Vogel Roch was launched from a slipway on the Ammersee and towed into the air by a speedboat for flight testing.|$|R
25|$|The <b>parasol</b> <b>wing,</b> {{single engine}} Udet U 8, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Limousine, was a three seat commercial passenger transport designed and built in Germany in 1924. Five were produced and were used by German airlines until about 1928.|$|E
25|$|The CASA III was a <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> {{monoplane}} with a fabric-covered {{steel tube}} fuselage.

25|$|The ProFe D-8 Moby Dick is {{a family}} of Czech pusher configuration, <b>parasol</b> <b>wing,</b> strut-braced, V-tailed, motor gliders that was {{designed}} and produced by ProFe. The aircraft is named for the great white whale of Herman Melville's novel {{of the same name}} and was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.|$|E
50|$|The Wibault 260 was an {{all-metal}} monoplane with a <b>parasol,</b> cantilever <b>wing.</b> In {{plan the}} wing was largely trapezoidal out to blunt tips, {{with most of}} the sweep on the trailing edges, though it had a short span centre-section with an unswept leading edge and a deep cut-out in the trailing edge to improve the field of view from the cockpit. The thickness/chord ratio of the outer panels decreased progressively towards the tips. There was no dihedral. High aspect ratio ailerons filled the entire trailing edges. Wing and fuselage were joined by a pair of outward leaning, approximately N-form cabane struts between the outer ends of the centre-section and the upper fuselage. The wings were built around two spars and dural skinned.|$|R
25|$|The Gipsy powered P-1 and P-2 {{were also}} known as the Pander-Gipsy and the Pander Supersport. The two almost {{identical}} aircraft were <b>parasol</b> monoplanes. The <b>wing</b> was slightly tapered with rounded wing tips, mounted over the fuselage by a pair of parallel struts on each side from the forward and aft wing spars to the lower fuselage longerons. Centrally, over the fuselage, wing support was provided by four forward and two aft cabane struts.|$|R
50|$|The Phi-Phi was an all wood <b>parasol</b> monoplane. Its <b>wing</b> {{section was}} {{thick enough to}} allow for {{semi-cantilever}} construction, supported centrally by two pairs of cabane struts and two steeply rising lift struts from the lower fuselage longerons, though there were a pair of drag wires from nose to wing tip. The wing plan was unusual compared with the straight edges of most of its competitors, with a gently curving leading edge, elliptical tips and straight trailing edge. It had the highest aspect ratio (13.6) of all the Itford gliders. The tip-mounted ailerons were horn balanced, again unusual.|$|R
25|$|The {{company has}} {{produced}} {{a wide range of}} aircraft, including the high-wing GR 532 GR 582, GR912, Pocket Rocket, ALW Sport and Tapis, the low-wing two-seat SP-2000 Speed, four seat SP-4000 Speed and the low or high-wing SP-6000. There is also a biplane design the PR BiPe and the PR Breeze <b>parasol</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The O-2 is a <b>parasol</b> <b>wing,</b> {{conventional}} landing gear, strut-braced, tandem-seat, open cockpit, sport aircraft. The fuselage {{is constructed}} of welded steel tubing with an aluminum turtledeck and belly covers, covered with fabric. The wing uses wooden spars and ribs with the fuel tanks the wing roots. A small door provided {{access to the}} front seat.|$|E
25|$|The Driggs-Johnson DJ-1 Bumblebee was {{a single}} engine, low power, single seat, <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> sports {{monoplane}} built in the US in 1924. It and its immediate development the Driggs Dart 1 had some competition successes; the design was further developed into two seat sesquiplanes known as the Driggs Dart 2 and Skylark. In all, about twenty were built.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} assist side access for the patient, both the Guillemin and the Lorraine-Hanriot had high-set wings, the latter's in <b>parasol</b> configuration. The <b>wing</b> was in two parts, {{each with a}} {{rectangular}} plan inner section occupying about 40% of the span and a straight-tapered outer part which ended in rounded tips. The outer regions also tapered in thickness from below, providing mild dihedral, and their trailing edges were almost entirely filled by narrow chord, unbalanced ailerons. The wing was a wholly wooden structure built around two box spars and covered with plywood. The upper fuselage {{was attached to the}} wing by pairs of N-form struts to the wing spars at about 30% span. Two lighter, transverse, inverted-V cabane struts, which shared fuselage attachment points with the main struts, supported the wing centre.|$|R
25|$|The {{company also}} {{developed}} the XeWing, a fixed wing light aircraft using the fuselage and {{engine of the}} Xenon 2, but mounting a folding strut-braced <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> {{in place of the}} autogyro's main rotor. The design was shown at AERO Friedrichshafen in 2009, but was never offered for sale and it is unlikely it was ever developed beyond a single prototype.|$|E
25|$|It is a single-seat <b>parasol</b> <b>wing</b> {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} taildragger configuration. Individual examples have been configured with tricycle landing gear. The fuselage is of fabric-covered tubular construction and the wings are wood. The first example flew with a Heath-Henderson B-4 modified motorcycle engine. A variety of aircraft powerplants may be used, typically in the 65-100hp (50-75kW) range. Examples {{have been built}} using 70hp Chevrolet Corvair engines.|$|E
