Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong.

The content and technology industries affected by copyright and its exceptions, and in some cases balancing the two, have become increasingly important as sources of economic growth, relatively high-paying jobs, and exports. Since the expansion of digital technology in the mid- 1990 s, they have undergone a technological revolution that has disrupted long-established modes of creating, distributing, and using works ranging from literature and news to film and music to scientific publications and computer software. In the United States and internationally, these disruptive changes have given rise to a strident debate over copyright 2 ̆ 7 s proper scope and terms and means of its enforcement [...] a debate between those who believe the digital revolution is progressively undermining the copyright protection essential to encourage the funding, creation, and distribution of new works and those who believe that enhancements to copyright are inhibiting technological innovation and free expression.

40|$|Members of an employer’s {{family are}} {{exempted}} from the Swedish Employment <b>Protection</b> Act. This <b>exception,</b> {{which may be}} seen {{in the light of the}} ban on discrimination on the grounds of family status of EC law, strengthens the prerogative of the employer. It may result in the working party having no employment contract, pay, or other benefits and also no union membership or other connection to the labour market. It also typically increases the dependence of an employer’s spouse, counteracting the aim of mutual autonomy between spouses in Swedish family law. This dependence in turn may acquire a new meaning in a context of an international labour market, a growing income gap, and an increasing dependence on the family for survival. This paper explores these contradictions, posing questions such as the following: How has this exception changed with the development of society?
