In normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), EPSCs of several nanoamperes in amplitude were evoked at a relatively constant latency with no failure, whereas in low [Ca 2 +]o-high [Mg 2 +]o solutions, EPSCs fluctuated both in amplitude and latency, and stochastic failures of transmitter release were observed in response to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> After blocking <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> with tetrodotoxin (TTX), direct depolarization of the calyceal preterminal elicited asynchronous release of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). When the magnitude of depolarization was increased, mEPSCs increased in frequency.

The amplitude distribution of mEPSCs was slightly skewed (skewness = 1. 06), with a mean conductance of 0. 45 nS and a coefficient of variation (c. v.) of 0. 43. Single-channel conductance underlying mEPSCs was estimated using non-stationary fluctuation analysis. The weighted mean single channel conductance was 20. 4 pS, suggesting that a single quantum opens 22 postsynaptic glutamate receptor channels on average.

40|$|Synaptic latency at {{cortical}} synapses {{is determined}} by the presynaptic release probability (Pr). Short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity is associated with modulation of synaptic delay. We show here that the duration and amplitude of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> also determine synaptic latency at neocortical and hippocampal excitatory synapses. Blockade of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels with 4 -aminopyridine or dendrotoxin-I, but not tetraethylammonium, induced a 1 – 2 ms shift in latency at excitatory synaptic connections formed by pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons. 4 -Aminopyridine or dendrotoxin-I, but not tetraethylammonium, increased the duration of the action potential recorded in the axon, suggesting that presynaptic spike duration is controlled by axonal Kv 1 potassium channels. Spike width-dependent changes in latency have been identified at the mossy fibre–CA 3 cell synapses and contribute to stabilization of synaptic timing during repetitive stimulation. The effects of presynaptic spike amplitude on synaptic latency were also examined. Decreasing the amplitude of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> with 15 – 30 nm TTX reduced synaptic latency by ∼ 0. 5 ms. The regulation of synaptic timing by potassium and sodium channel blockers could not be attributed to modulation of axonal conduction.

On the other hand increase in Mg concentration decreased the amplitude of the synaptic current. In these cases no appreciable change in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> was observed. Extracellularly recorded potential changes of the presynaptic axon showed mainly a positive deflexion at the synaptic region and a negative deflexion in the more proximal part of the presynaptic axon. Mechanism of synaptic transmission is discussed. At synapses where chemical transmission occurs, the arrival of a nerve impulse at the presynaptic terminal is considered to cause release of the transmitter which, in turn, produces a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Several investigators have attempted to correlate electrical changes in the presynaptic structures with those occurring in the postsynaptic structures during transmission. Thus, del Castillo and Katz (1954 d) observed that hyperpolarizing current applied to the presynaptic nerve fiber at the neuromuscular junction augmented the amplitude of the end-plate potential. Also, during post-tetanic potentiation of the monosynaptic reflex of spinal motoneurons, hyperpolarization of primary afferent fibers was observed (Eccles and Krnjevid, 1959).

This injection was preceded by intracellular tetraethylammonium administration, which prolonged the duration of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> After this procedure light emission was evoked by single presynaptic spikes capable of releasing synaptic transmitter. In a second set of experiments, presynaptic tetraethylammonium injection was followed by the administration of tetrodotoxin extracellularly, which abolished the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> Under these conditions artificial depolarization of the presynaptic terminal triggered the release of synaptic transmitter, in a graded manner. However, as previously reported by other authors, membrane potential steps to an internal positive value of approximately plus 90 mV (the suppression potential) produced a blockage of transmitter release {{for the duration of the}} imposed potential. Synaptic transmission recurred, nevertheless, as the current injection was terminated. A similar set of experiments, performed after the intracellular injection of aequorin in the presynaptic fiber, demonstrated that the aequorin light response was evoked by membrane potential steps capable of releasing synaptic transmitter. If the membrane potential was made positive to the "suppression" level, no light response was evoked but the light emission appeared, as did transmitter release, at the end of the current pulse. These experiments demonstrate that release of transmitter is directly correlated with intracellular calcium concentration and that the suppression potential is compatible with the existence of a calcium equilibrium potential at the presynaptic terminal...|$|E

For simple synapses, which presumably arise at single release sites, these histograms could be fitted to a single Gaussian (5 cases). In four additional cases a small amplitude component (< 50 pA) was superimposed to a single Gaussian peak. The small events had slow rise times and widely distributed amplitudes. Finally eleven histograms showed two or more Gaussian components and were classified as complex connections. Failure rates ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 85 for unitary connections (n= 20) and from 0. 59 to 0. 78 for simple synapses (n= 5). Coefficient of variation values derived from Gaussian fits to simple synapse histograms ranged between 0. 20 and 0. 38 (n= 5). In simple synapses peak current amplitudes were positively correlated to both current rise time and decay half-width.

During stationary periods there was no correlation between interspike interval and amplitude size, success rate or latency.

The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different pre-postsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties.

Tetanus-induced potentiation of extracellularly evoked EPSPs lasting > 4 min could only be obtained if the EPSP was > 4 mV.

Asynchronous pairing of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> with postsynaptic depolarizing current pulses (preceding each EPSP by 800 ms) depressed both naive and previously potentiated unitary EPSPs. Likewise, homosynaptic LTD of unitary EPSPs was induced when the presynaptic cell was tetanized at 3 Hz for 3 min, regardless of their amplitude (0. 3 - 3. 2 mV). Homosynaptic LTD of extracellularly evoked Schaffer collateral EPSPs < 4 mV could be induced if no inhibitory postsynaptic potential was apparent, but was prevented by eliciting a large inhibitory postsynaptic potential or by injection of hyperpolarizing current in the postsynaptic cell.

Despite the change in release mode, intense and steady inhibitory transmission was virtually maintained. Experimental analyses and modeling studies indicated that this “desynchronization” process was dependent on presynaptic Ca 2 + accumulation, facilitation of vesicle release, and short-term depletion of available vesicles.

40|$|Post-tetanic {{potentiation}} (PTP) was elicited at {{the frog}} sartorius and cutaneous pectorts neuromuscular junctions. A 30 -set, 30 -Hz tetanus produced a 2 - to 3 -fold post-tetanic increase in endplate potential (EPP). In surface-recorded responses this PTP decayed {{in a double}} exponential way with time constants of 12. 7 set 2 2. 4 (SEM) and 146. 6 set + 36. 6. In acute experiments 0. 2 to 0. 6 mM phenytoin (5, 5 -diphenylhydantoin, DPH) dramatically and reversibly reduced the early component. The late component was also reduced, although {{to a lesser extent}} and often not reversibly. DPH reduced PTP even when there was no failure of the EPP during the tetanus. Thus, the DPH effect did not require a complete block of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> At longer exposures and higher DPH concentrations EPP failures di...|$|E
40|$|Synaptic {{depression}} {{modeled after}} that seen in cortical slices removes correlations from realistic spike sequences. If not removed, such correlations {{can lead to}} inefficient and redundant neural codes. We suggest that this redundancy reduction at individual synapses enables a neuron to better process information from multiple inputs. Key words: correlation, short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, cortical network 1 Introduction Many hippocampal and neocortical synapses appear to be surprisingly unreliable, with {{only a small fraction}} of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> successfully triggering vesicle release [1]. Despite this high failure rate, a neuron's ability to process information about its inputs may not be severely compromised. We suggest that the activity dependence of synaptic transmission enhances a neuron's information-processing capability by increasing the amount of information carried per vesicle release and by allowing the neuron to temporally filter individual inputs be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCa 2 + influx into {{presynaptic}} terminals via voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels triggers fast neurotransmitter release as well {{as different}} forms of synaptic plasticity. Using electrophysiological and genetic techniques we demonstrate that presynaptic Ca 2 + entry through Cav 2. 3 subunits contributes to the induction of mossy fiber LTP and posttetanic potentiation by brief trains of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> while they do not {{play a role in}} fast synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, or frequency facilitation. This functional specialization is most likely achieved by a localization remote from the release machinery and by a Cav 2. 3 channel-dependent facilitation of presynaptic Ca 2 + influx. Thus, the presence of Cav 2. 3 channels boosts the accumulation of presynaptic Ca 2 + triggering presynaptic LTP and posttetanic potentiation without affecting the low release probability that is a prerequisite for the enormous plasticity displayed by mossy fiber synapses...|$|R
40|$|SummarySignal {{transfer}} in neural circuits is dynamically modified {{by the recent}} history of neuronal activity. Short-term plasticity endows synapses with nonlinear transmission properties, yet synapses in sensory and motor circuits are capable of signaling linearly over a wide range of presynaptic firing rates. How do such synapses achieve rate-invariant transmission despite history-dependent nonlinearities? Here, ultrastructural, biophysical, and computational analyses demonstrate that concerted molecular, anatomical, and physiological refinements are required for central vestibular nerve synapses to linearly transmit rate-coded sensory signals. Vestibular synapses operate in a physiological regime of steady-state depression imposed by tonic firing. Rate-invariant transmission relies on brief <b>presynaptic</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> that delimit calcium influx, large pools of rapidly mobilized vesicles, multiple low-probability release sites, robust postsynaptic receptor sensitivity, and efficient transmitter clearance. Broadband linear synaptic filtering of head motion signals is thus achieved by coordinately tuned synaptic machinery that maintains physiological operation within inherent cell biological limitations...|$|R
