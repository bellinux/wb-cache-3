50|$|Some systems {{polarize}} or key the <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> {{connection with}} something that fills and blocks one of {{the holes in the}} sockets.One pin of the wrong <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> (or the correct <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> rotated in the wrong orientation) hits that obstruction and prevents an incorrect connection. The correct <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> has one or more pins in the header removed or clipped to indicate a key for correct orientation.|$|E

50|$|In the past, a <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> {{was known}} as a Berg connector, but the term fell out of favor because pin headers are {{manufactured}} by many companies.|$|E
50|$|Normally <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> are <b>pin</b> {{through hole}} (PTH) devices, but surface-mount {{technology}} (SMT) versions {{of one and}} two row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> also exist. In the latter case the solder sides of the pins are simply bent on a 90 degree angle {{so as to be}} soldered to a solder plane. On single row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> the <b>pins</b> are bent alternating to one side or the other, on dual row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> the <b>pins</b> are simply bent outwards. If <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> are optional, the PTH variant is often chosen for ease of manual assembly. <b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> can be either straight or angled. The latter form is often used to connect two boards together.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with ribbon cable connectors, <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> often also function as recipients for jumpers. The most common jumper spacing is 2.54 mm, though 2.0 mm is sometimes used in smaller products.|$|R

5000|$|The SoundscapeDB is an Ensoniq-designed and {{produced}} MIDI daughtercard designed {{to interface with}} the [...] "Waveblaster" [...] <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> available on many older sound cards. It was released in 1994.|$|E
50|$|For all of {{the above}} connectors, the {{computer}} manufacturer typically attaches a female IDC connector onto one end of a ribbon cable, and later slides that connector onto a matching male box header or <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the computer motherboard.|$|E
50|$|Communication ports These {{included}} two 25-pin RS-232 serial ports (including one intended for a Xerox 620 or 630 printer or compatible, and one intended for a modem), and two optional parallel ports {{which could be}} added via an internal <b>pin</b> <b>header,</b> usable with a Xerox-supplied or other cable.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>header</b> {{connectors}} {{are thus}} [...] "male" [...] connectors ("female" [...] counterparts do exist, {{but these are}} normally just called female header (FH) or header connector, without [...] "pin") and are mostly used inside equipment, rather than {{being used as a}} connector {{on the outside of the}} device.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> (often {{abbreviated}} as PH, {{or simply}} header) {{is a form}} of electrical connector. It consists of one or more rows of male pins typically spaced 2.54 mm apart, but 5.08 mm, 5.00 mm, 3.96 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.27 mm or 1.00 mm are common as well. [...] The distance between pins is commonly referred as pitch in the electronic community.|$|E

Another jumper cable ending in a USB micro male connector mates to the right side of the USB2Serial board. Red and black tinned jump wires can be seen on the breadboard.|$|E
5000|$|This board {{includes}} an integrated ST-LINK/V2 debugger via Mini-B USB connector, accelerometer/compass (LSM303DLHC), gyroscope (L3GD20), 8 user LEDs, user button, reset button, Full-Speed USB to second Mini-B USB connector, and two 25x2 male <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> are {{cost-effective}} due {{to their}} simplicity. Headers are often sold as long strips (typically 40 or 50 pins for the dual row versions) which can easily be broken {{off to the right}} number of pins.|$|R
5000|$|This board {{includes}} an integrated ST-LINK/V2 debugger via Mini-B USB connector, accelerometer (LIS302DL), microphone (MP45DT02), audio codec (CS43L22), 3.5 mm audio jack, 4 user LEDs, user button, reset button, Full-Speed USB OTG to second Micro-AB USB connector, and two 25x2 male <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The STK600 allows {{in-system}} programming {{from the}} PC via USB, leaving the RS-232 port {{available for the}} target microcontroller. A 4 <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the STK600 labeled 'RS-232 spare' can connect any TTL level USART port on the chip to an onboard MAX232 chip to translate the signals to RS-232 levels. The RS-232 signals {{are connected to the}} RX, TX, CTS, and RTS pins on the DB-9 connector.|$|E
50|$|Many {{personal}} computer motherboards still {{have at least}} one serial port, even if accessible only through a <b>pin</b> <b>header.</b> Small-form-factor systems and laptops may omit RS-232 connector ports to conserve space, but the electronics are still there. RS-232 has been standard for so long that the circuits needed to control a serial port became very cheap and often exist on a single chip, sometimes also with circuitry for a parallel port.|$|E
50|$|One {{edge of the}} {{expansion}} card holds the contacts (the edge connector or <b>pin</b> <b>header)</b> that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these were located in the support bracket {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins.|$|E
5000|$|This board {{includes}} an integrated ST-LINK/V2 debugger via Mini-B USB connector, 8 MB SDRAM (IS42S16400J), 2.4-inch 320x200 TFT LCD color display (SF-TC240T), touchscreen controller (STMPE811), gyroscope (L3GD20), 2 user LEDs, user button, reset button, Full-Speed USB OTG to second Micro-AB USB connector, and two 32x2 male <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b>|$|R
50|$|For multi-row <b>pin</b> <b>headers,</b> the <b>pin</b> {{number is}} more complex, because knowing the {{location}} of pin 1 doesn't automatically ensure how the remaining pins are numbered. Typically for headers attached to ribbon cables, the pins are numbered so they go linearly across the cable. Because {{of the way the}} connector attaches to the cable, this means in a two-row <b>header,</b> <b>pins</b> in one row have odd numbers and pins in the other row have even numbers.|$|R
50|$|Arduino and Arduino-compatible boards use {{printed circuit}} {{expansion}} boards called shields, which plug into the normally supplied Arduino <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b> Shields can provide motor controls for 3D printing and other applications, Global Positioning System (GPS), Ethernet, {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD), or breadboarding (prototyping). Several shields can also be made do it yourself (DIY).|$|R
50|$|Since {{executable}} code on the Xbox 360 is digitally signed, and runs underneath a hypervisor, an exploit or hack {{is necessary in}} order to execute homebrew code. On the Xbox 360, one such exploit exists, relying on and utilizing a modified DVD-ROM drive firmware, a modified burnt disc of the game King Kong (for Xbox 360), and the target console having either one of two vulnerable Kernel revisions. Optionally, a home-made serial cable may be used where attached to the appropriate <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the motherboard of the console.|$|E
50|$|Novation also {{released}} a full-duplex Bell 212-compatible expansion {{known as the}} Novation 212 Expansion Card, which plugged into the Apple II motherboard {{as well as an}} existing APPLE-CAT II via a ribbon cable. The card was very expensive, and rarely seen. Novation also created an 'Expansion Pack' or external breakout box that would connect to the large <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the top middle of the card. This item allowed easy external access to the built in serial port, phone line and hand set connections. Due to its cost at the time, the item is very rare.|$|E
50|$|Most ICEs {{consist of}} an adaptor unit that sits between the ICE host {{computer}} and the system to be tested. A <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> and cable assembly connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or background debug mode interface (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish {{the fact that they}} do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special 'probe mode' is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.|$|E

DVI and LVDS video-out, USB 2.0, COM, PS/2 Mouse & Keyboard, and HD 5.1 channel audio (supplied by a VIA VT1708A chip) are {{supported}} through {{the usage of}} I/O <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> and add-on modules/daughter cards.|$|R
50|$|The {{motherboard}} is Dell P/N P270J {{and uses}} the Intel X58 chipset. It is a standard full ATX motherboard size and design and operates like any other ATX motherboard in regard to using a standard 24-pin and 8-pin power connectors. It has a standard PWM 4-pin CPU header and several 3-pin chassis <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> with {{a plastic}} guide box around them are known as box headers (BH) or {{shrouded}} headers and are normally only used in combination with insulation-displacement connectors (IDC) for ribbon cables. A notch (key) in the guide box normally prevents placing the connector (polarised by a [...] "bump" [...] on one side) the wrong way around.|$|R

40|$|Model 104 -DA 12 - 8 is a PC/ 104 Bus {{board with}} eight DACs, 128 K SRAM for {{waveform}} data storage, eight 4 - 20 mA current sinks and three 16 -bit counter/timers. The DACs can be updated individually or simultaneously. An automatic circuit sets the analog outputs to zero at power-on or reset. Each output is buffered by a short-circuit protected op-amp sourcing up to 5 mA. Data for updating each DAC {{may come from}} either the card's onboard RAM or from the PC/ 104 bus. The on-board 64 K sample RAM and onboard intelligent circuitry provides flexible allocation of between one and eight FIFO buffers/waveforms. Counter/Timers Three 16 -bit down-counters, in a type 8254 IC, are included. These are configured as two frequency sources derived from an on-board 2 MHz crystal-controlled oscillator. Counter/Timers 1 and 2 are concatenated by the card to form a single 32 -bit counter.

50|$|EPIC (Embedded Platform for Industrial Computing) is {{a single}} board {{computer}} form factor which, like EBX, supports PC/104 peripheral boards but is smaller than EBX at 6.5 xx 4.5 in. It allows I/O connections to be implemented as either <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> or PC-style ("real world") connectors. The standard provides specific I/O zones to implement functions such as Ethernet, serial ports, digital and analog I/O, video, wireless, and various application-specific interfaces. EPIC Express adds PCI Express expandability.|$|R
