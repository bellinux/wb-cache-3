40|$|Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is {{a crucial}} {{intermediate}} process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. As the average IC feature size decreases each year, scratches produced on wafers from polishing pads during CMP have become a prominent issue. These scratches can be much larger than features on the circuits, which results in an increase of damaged and discarded wafers after CMP. To determine the mechanisms of CMP pad scratching, an analytical model based in thermomechanics was constructed. This model accounted for potential sources of energy dissipation, which are important in properly understanding and accounting for processes which produce damage on the wafer. Multiple forms of energy dissipation were investigated through experimental analyses that include strain energies, energy flux through material removal, and internal energy dissipation. Mechanical characterization of CMP <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> and planarization experiments were performed. ^ Porous polyurethane polishing <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was mechanically characterized in compression and in tension to properly model its constitutive behavior during CMP. Stress relaxation experiments of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> in compression were performed to construct a stress relaxation model. The results showed that viscoelastic strain energy is significant in CMP processes. Additionally, the polishing pad relaxation behavior varied {{depending on whether the}} pad was loaded in tension or compression. The viscoelastic relaxation rate of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> increased after being soaked in distilled water and CMP slurry. This result suggests pad scratching can be reduced with proper soaking of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Measurements of <b>pad</b> compressibility were also performed by optically tracking pad samples which were under compressive stresses. This analysis quantified the significance of the <b>pad</b> <b>material’s</b> compressibility with regard to its internal stresses. ^ Planarization experiments were performed to gather experimental information on mechanical and topographical changes of the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>materials</b> through the CMP process. Generally, the coefficient of friction between the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>material</b> decreased with increasing polishing time. From the constructed contact stress analysis, a smaller coefficient of friction resulted in the reduction of von Mises stress in the wafer material. The surface of a polishing pad became smoother with increasing polishing time. Experimental planarization results showed that roughness of the pad surface may have an influence on the coefficient of friction, while both of these variables relate to the scratching ability of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Plastic smoothing of the pad surface also indicated that the plastic strain energy dissipated into the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> is important for the CMP thermomechanical model. ^ Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of worn <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was conducted to observe potential energy dissipation into the pad’s polymer structure during planarization. Polishing pad calorimetry results showed a measurable increase in the computed enthalpies of reaction of pad samples with {{an increase in the number}} of wafers polished. These results suggest energy is dissipated into the <b>pad’s</b> <b>material</b> structure during CMP and may have an influence on scratch production. ...|$|R

30|$|Managements {{of sweat}} and heat {{generated}} by sports activity are critical criteria for the sportswear to be competitive in the market. During hot summer, the sportswear is mostly open design but still the material property is very important. To maximize the sweat evaporation, air permeable or quick drying fabric is widely used. At cold weather, as the thermal insulation is important, openness is limited and wind proof material and/or <b>padding</b> <b>material</b> are often used. As a result, material {{is not sufficient to}} remove the sweat and body heat. If there is limited air permeability or no open space in the garment, the sweat by the sports activity will be accumulated and brings about the discomfort such as chilly feeling. In extreme case, at subzero temperature and prolonged exposure, severe damage such as frostbite and hypothermia can be resulted. When the wind proof and/or <b>padding</b> <b>material</b> are used, an effective way to remove body heat and sweat is to incorporate the slits in the garment. Recently, outdoor sports wears are designed to have the slits in the jackets and trousers but their slit locations, length etc. are rather design oriented and not much function oriented.|$|E

Nanoscale loads were applied in the proximad direction on the distal joint region simulating the natural stimulus situation. The force curves obtained indicate {{the presence of a}} soft, liquid-like epicuticular layer (20 – 40  nm thick) above the <b>pad</b> <b>material,</b> which has much higher stiffness.

The strong frequency dependence of the elastic modulus indicates the viscoelastic nature of the <b>pad</b> <b>material,</b> its glass transition temperature being close to room temperature (25 ± 2  °C) and, therefore, to its maximized energy absorption from low-frequency mechanical stimuli.

40|$|There is no {{standard}} test {{to assess the}} ability of soft headgear to prevent the likelihood of head injuries in the Australian football codes. Therefore the impact energy attenuation of protective football headgear was assessed using a yielding artificial headform and impact surface to characterise the impact scenario. Seven soft football headgear of varying mass, materials and thickness were dropped from a height to generate impact energy of 56 J. The headgear were tested {{for a number of}} different impact locations. Accelerometers within the headform monitored the impact mechanics. A Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of 1000 was selected as the injury threshold. Reliability data, collected one week apart, revealed that the results were highly reproducible. Although several of the headgear generated HIC values about 1000 for the various impact locations, only one of the headgear, that with the greatest thickness (15 mm) generated a HIC score below 1000 for impacts to the side and front of the headgear. There was a significant correlation between headgear thickness and HIC scores.

40|$|Coral reefs {{are being}} {{negatively}} impacted by various causes worldwide, and direct intervention is often warranted following disturbance to restore or replace lost ecosystem structure and function. An experimental coral reef restoration study involving standardized artificial reef modules (ReefballsTM) {{was conducted in}} Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula in the towns of Puerto Morelos and Akumal. The purpose was to explore the use of artificial structure for restoration and mitigation applications in a highly diverse and dynamic Caribbean coral reef environment by applying and evaluating the performance of select experimental treatments hypothesized to accelerate development of the associated biota. The first treatment consisted of invertebrate enhancing artificial substrate <b>padding</b> <b>material,</b> which provided structurally complex refuge space for mobile epifaunal/infaunal invertebrates and other benthic organisms. The second treatment consisted of coral transplants, intended to provide additional structural complexity and kick-start development of stony coral populations. The third treatment consisted of settlement plates which were intended to provide data on coral recruitment and survival rates. Multiple hypotheses relating to the interactions between experimental treatments and the resulting macroalgal, non-coral invertebrate, stony coral, and coral reef fish assemblages were examined, and comparisons were made between natural and artificial substrates. In Puerto Morelos there were 40 modules; 10 controls and 10 of each of 3 treatments: substrate pads, coral transplants, and settlement plates. In Akumal there were 12 modules; 6 controls and 3 of each of 2 treatments: substrate pads and settlement plates. Following module deployment, 6 biannual monitoring trips were made {{over the course of}} three years to assess the development of the biota, with a final 7 th trip made six years post-deployment. Divers conducted non-destructive visual surveys to evaluate total abundance, species richness, size class distribution, and assemblage structure of coral reef fishes. Other monitoring work included coral recruit surveys, mobile epifaunal invertebrate collections from substrate pads, and digital imaging of coral transplants, natural reef reference corals, and benthic quadrat areas. Hurricane Dean compromised the Akumal study site {{during the first year of}} the study, but Puerto Morelos was unaffected. There the modules developed biotic assemblages that differed from what was found on the natural reef, and the data suggests that the substrate pads may have had an effect on the development of faunal assemblages. Lobophora variegata macroaglae and Desmapsamma anchorata sponge were the major contributors to benthic community composition, and both had significantly greater coverage on the substrate pads treatment modules. Lobophora grew rapidly and peaked within the first year, while sponges increased steadily throughout the first three years of the study, surpassing the coverage of macroalgae before the end of the second year, much to the detriment of coral transplants and many coral recruits. By the end of the study, over 75 % of the transplants were overgrown by D. anchorata, and density of new coral recruits on the Pads treatment modules was lower than the other treatments and controls. Coral recruitment was dominated by Porites astreoides on all treatments and controls, and the number of corals increased steadily throughout the study. The controls had consistently greater numbers of corals than the treatments, as well as lower percent coverage of macroalgae and sponges. Total abundance and species richness of reef fishes was generally unaffected by the treatments. However, at the family and species level, several differences were detected, particularly for the substrate pads treatment and to a lesser extent for the coral transplants treatment. For future restoration or mitigation efforts utilizing similar or identical treatments to artificial substrates, this study suggests that, in the absence of routine maintenance, greater success may be achieved after waiting several years post-deployment for the initial wave of unchecked growth by benthic organisms (i. e., macroalgae and sponges) to reach a balance point before a large investment of resources is devoted to coral transplanting. Further recommendations include routine monthly or quarterly on-site maintenance to enhance transplant survival, as well as a longer monitoring window to assess community development in response to experimental treatments. The results of this study suggest that the experimental treatments did indeed have an effect on the biota, but whether or not the effect was beneficial largely depends upon perspective. The Pads treatment in particular had the greatest effect on both reef fish and benthic community development, however, it was not beneficial for stony coral recruitment. Additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term performance and effects of the <b>padding</b> <b>material</b> on biotic assemblage development for future restoration or mitigation projects...|$|E
