5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of morphological characteristics and gene sequences {{has supported the}} basal position within the genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further analysis in 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, <b>plastid</b> DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>plastid</b> creates {{multiple}} {{copies of}} a circular 75â€“250 kilobase plastome. The number of genome copies per <b>plastid</b> is variable, ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly dividing cells, which, in general, contain few plastids, to 100 or fewer in mature cells, where <b>plastid</b> divisions {{have given rise to}} a large number of plastids. The plastome contains about 100 genes encoding ribosomal and transfer ribonucleic acids (rRNAs and tRNAs) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and <b>plastid</b> gene transcription and translation. However, these proteins only represent {{a small fraction of the}} total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of <b>plastid.</b> Plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of <b>plastid</b> proteins, and the expression of <b>plastid</b> genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plastid</b> DNA {{exists as}} large protein-DNA {{complexes}} {{associated with the}} inner envelope membrane and called 'plastid nucleoids'. Each nucleoid particle may contain more than 10 copies of the <b>plastid</b> DNA. The proplastid contains a single nucleoid located in {{the centre of the}} <b>plastid.</b> The developing <b>plastid</b> has many nucleoids, localized at the periphery of the <b>plastid,</b> bound to the inner envelope membrane. During the development of proplastids to chloroplasts, and when plastids convert from one type to another, nucleoids change in morphology, size and location within the organelle. The remodelling of nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the composition and abundance of nucleoid proteins.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Verlag via [URL] most angiosperms, wheat (Triticum aestivum) shows maternal inheritance of <b>plastids.</b> It is thought that this takes place by cytoplasmic stripping at fertilisation rather than the absence of <b>plastids</b> in sperm cells. To determine the fate of <b>plastids</b> during sperm cell development, plastid-targeted green fluorescent protein was used to visualise these organelles in nuclear transgenic wheat lines. Fewer than thirty small 1 - 2 -?m <b>plastids</b> were visible in early uninucleate pollen cells. These dramatically increased to several hundred larger (4 ?m) <b>plastids</b> during pollen maturation and went through distinct morphological changes. Only small <b>plastids</b> were visible in generative cells (n?=? 25) and young sperm cells (n?=? 9). In mature sperm cells, these green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged <b>plastids</b> were absent. This is consistent with maternal inheritance of <b>plastids</b> resulting from their degradation in mature sperm cells in wheat. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Root graviresponsiveness {{in normal}} and carotenoid-deficient mutant {{seedlings}} of Zea mays {{was not significantly}} different. Columella cells in roots of mutant seedlings were characterized by fewer, smaller, and a reduced relative volume of <b>plastids</b> as compared to columella cells of normal seedlings. <b>Plastids</b> in columella cells of mutant seedlings possessed reduced amounts of starch. Although approximately 10 per cent of the columella cells in mutant seedlings lacked starch, their <b>plastids</b> were located {{at the bottom of}} the cell. These results suggest that (i) carotenoids are not necessary for root gravitropism, (ii) graviresponsiveness is not necessarily proportional to the size, number, or relative volume of <b>plastids</b> in columella cells, and (iii) sedimentation of <b>plastids</b> in columella cells may not result directly from their increased density due to starch content. <b>Plastids</b> in columella cells of normal and mutant seedlings were associated with bands of microtubule-like structures, suggesting that these structures may be involved in 'positioning' <b>plastids</b> in the cell...|$|R

25|$|Plants {{deficient}} in the IMMUTANS gene that encodes the oxidase are especially susceptible to photooxidative stress during early <b>plastid</b> development. The knockout plants exhibit a phenotype of variegated leaves with white patches that indicate {{a lack of}} pigmentation or photodamage. This effect is enhanced with increased light and temperature during plant development. The lack of <b>plastid</b> terminal oxidase indirectly causes photodamage during <b>plastid</b> development because protective carotenoids are not synthesized without the oxidase.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{evidence}} of possible <b>plastid</b> genome loss {{was found in}} Rafflesia lagascae, a non-photosynthetic parasitic flowering plant, and in Polytomella, a genus of non-photosynthetic green algae. Extensive searches for <b>plastid</b> genes in both Rafflesia and Polytomella yielded no results, however the conclusion that their plastomes are entirely missing is still controversial. Some scientists argue that <b>plastid</b> genome loss is unlikely since even non-photosynthetic plastids contain genes necessary to complete various biosynthetic pathways, such as heme biosynthesis.|$|E

40|$|Subcellular {{monoterpene}} biosynthesis capacity {{based on}} local geranyl diphosphate (GDP) availability or locally boosted GDP production was determined for <b>plastids,</b> cytosol and mitochondria. A geraniol synthase (GES) was targeted to <b>plastids,</b> cytosol, or mitochondria. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana indicated local GDP availability for each compartment but resulted in different product levels. A GDP synthase from Picea abies (PaGDPS 1) {{was shown to}} boost GDP production. PaGDPS 1 was also targeted to <b>plastids,</b> cytosol or mitochondria and PaGDPS 1 and GES were coexpressed in all possible combinations. Geraniol and geraniol-derived products were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively. GES product levels were highest for plastid-targeted GES, followed by mitochondrial- and then cytosolic-targeted GES. For each compartment local boosting of GDP biosynthesis increased GES product levels. GDP exchange between compartments is not equal: while no GDP is exchanged from the cytosol to the <b>plastids,</b> 100 % of GDP in mitochondria can be exchanged to <b>plastids,</b> while only 7 % of GDP from <b>plastids</b> is available for mitochondria. This suggests a direct exchange mechanism for GDP between <b>plastids</b> and mitochondria. Cytosolic PaGDPS 1 competes with plastidial GES activity, suggesting an effective drain of isopentenyl diphosphate from the <b>plastids</b> to the cytosol...|$|R

25|$|The enzyme {{is present}} in organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, which {{includes}} plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. <b>Plastid</b> terminal oxidase and alternative oxidase {{are thought to have}} originated from a common ancestral di-iron carboxylate protein. Oxygen reductase activity was likely an ancient mechanism to scavenge oxygen in the early transition from an anaerobic to aerobic world. The <b>plastid</b> oxidase first evolved in ancient cyanobacteria and the alternative oxidase in proteobacteria before eukaryotic evolution and endosymbiosis events. Through endosymbiosis, the <b>plastid</b> oxidase was vertically inherited by eukaryotes that evolved into plants and algae. Sequenced genomes of various plant and algae species shows that the amino acid sequence is more than 25% conserved, which is a significant amount of conservation for an oxidase. This sequence conservation further supports the theory that both the alternative and <b>plastid</b> oxidases evolved before endosymbiosis and did not significantly change through eukaryote evolution.|$|E

40|$|In the liverwort Sphaerocarpus donnellii Aust., the {{behavior}} of the cell constituents, especially of mitochondria and <b>plastids,</b> was studied by electron microscopy during the development of the egg and its preceding ceils. A degeneration and elimination of mitochondria and <b>plastids</b> was not found in any of the developmental stages. In all growth phases of the archegonium, the <b>plastids</b> may deposit starch which becomes especially frequent in the maturing egg cell. No indications have been observed that new mitochondria or <b>plastids</b> generate from the nuclear evaginations, which often penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm of the maturing and fully developed eggs. A quantitative investigation based on general micrographs elucidates the numerical aspects of the cell constituents during o 6 genesis. With the increase of cell volume, the numbers of dictyosomes, mitochondria, <b>plastids,</b> and lipid bodies increase. From the stages of the mother cell of the axial row up to that of the mature egg, the cell volume enlarges about 8 times and the nucleus volume about 15 times. Simultaneously, the numbers of mitochondria and <b>plastids</b> increase up to 8 to 15 times.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{generally}} accepted that the <b>plastids</b> arose from a cyanobacterial ancestor, but the exact phylogenetic relationships between cyanobacteria and <b>plastids</b> are still controversial. Most studies based on partial 16 S rRNA sequences suggested a relatively late origin of <b>plastids</b> within the cyanobacterial divergence. In order {{to clarify the}} exact relationship and divergence order of cyanobacteria and <b>plastids,</b> we studied their phylogeny {{on the basis of}} nearly complete 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The data set comprised 15 strains of cyanobacteria from different morphological groups, 1 prochlorophyte, and <b>plastids</b> belonging to 8 species of plants and 12 species of diverse algae. This set included three cyanobacterial sequences determined in this study. This is the most comprehensive set of complete cyanobacterial and plastidial 16 S rRNA sequences used so far. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor joining and maximum parsimony, and the reliability of the tree topologies was tested by different methods. Our results suggest an early origin of <b>plastids</b> within the cyanobacterial divergence, preceded only by the divergence of two cyanobacterial genera, Gloeobacter and Pseudanabaena...|$|R

Within this clade, the latter two formed a sister clade to A.resiliens. <b>Plastid</b> markers indicated that the A.resiliens clade was divided into two separate groups, while nuclear markers from two distinct groups were distributed among the samples, with five specimens carrying markers from both groups, and one specimen each carrying markers from {{only one of the}} groups. This suggests that A.resiliens developed by reticulate evolution, i.e., as the descendant of a hybrid between two taxa, each parental taxon carrying the one of the two groups of <b>plastid</b> and nuclear makers. In addition, of two specimens, one morphologically identified as A.resiliens, and one as A.palmeri, both were found to contain a nuclear marker from the A.resiliens clade and another from the A.palmeri clade. While apogamous specimens of A.palmeri are known, it is typically a sexually reproducing species, and the implication of these specimens is unclear.|$|E
