25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|E
500|$|Mandy Patinkin played Che for the American premiere {{production}} and recording, and sings the song. Author William A. Everett {{wrote in his}} book, The A to Z of the Broadway Musical that Patinkin's singing and portrayal of Che [...] "interracted on a psychological level with the title character (played by Patti LuPone), challenging her actions and motivations." [...] In the 1996 film Evita, the song is sung by actor Antonio Banderas and singer Madonna. In the film, Che muses while in an empty bar following the lavish funeral procession for Eva Perón, {{and then on the}} streets of Buenos Aires as the community mourns and later riots. Eva's lyrics come during a <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> her funeral casket and is not sung directly by Eva. It begins with Spanish guitars as Banderas takes the lead vocals, with a changing choir throughout.|$|E

500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E

It eventually <b>pans</b> <b>over</b> the two as they begin singing into their microphones. Every so often, an outside scene of love will show up. Examples are of a mother loving her son, a man giving a homeless man food, and a couple holding hands and rollerblading down a sidewalk. In between these scenes, the camera <b>pans</b> <b>over</b> the stage, as well as the people in the crowd and the musicians. At the end, the camera shows a sunset and pans away.|$|R

6000|$|The {{servants}} are all {{versed in}} the common modes of trying luck, and the charms to insure constancy. They read their fortunes by drawing strokes in the ashes, or by repeating a form of words, and looking in a pail of water. St. Mark's Eve, I am told, was a busy time with them; being an appointed night for certain mystic ceremonies. Several of them sowed hemp-seed to be reaped by their true lovers; and they even ventured upon the solemn and fearful preparation of the dumb-cake. This must be done fasting, and in silence. The ingredients are handed down in traditional form: [...] "An eggshell full of salt, an eggshell full of malt, and an eggshell full of barley-meal." [...] When the cake is ready, it is put upon a <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> the fire, and the future husband will appear, turn the cake, and retire; but if a word is spoken or a fast is broken during this awful ceremony, there is no knowing what horrible consequences would ensue! ...|$|E
