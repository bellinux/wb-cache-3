5|$|A {{botanical garden}} or botanic garden is a garden {{dedicated}} to the collection, cultivation and display {{of a wide range}} of <b>plants</b> labelled with their botanical names. It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent <b>plants,</b> herb gardens, <b>plants</b> from particular parts of the world, and so on; there may be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical <b>plants,</b> alpine <b>plants,</b> or other exotic <b>plants.</b> Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat <b>plants,</b> but <b>plants</b> {{can defend}} {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with <b>plants.</b> For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide <b>plants</b> with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant <b>plants</b> to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of populations and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 <b>plants</b> in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 <b>plants.</b> In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 <b>plants</b> were found; surprisingly, only fifty <b>plants</b> could be found in the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead <b>plants,</b> and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports {{of the total number of}} <b>plants</b> have ranged from 340 to 580.|$|E

5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In <b>plants,</b> it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some <b>plants</b> may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other <b>plants,</b> such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering <b>plants.</b> Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between <b>plants</b> and insects. As insects gather nectar from different <b>plants</b> of the same species, they also spread pollen from <b>plants</b> on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of <b>plants.</b> This helps to spread the <b>plants,</b> which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native <b>plants</b> to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the most suitable <b>planting</b> date for maximum production of seed tuber yield in potato cultivars, this experiment performed with four potato cultivars (Agria, Marfona, Savalan and Ceaser) at four <b>planting</b> dates (April 9 th, April 30 th, May 20 th and June 10 th) by using split plot experiment based on randomized complete block design in three replications at Ardabil Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Station during 2009. During growth stage, the traits were like <b>plant</b> height, main stem number per <b>plant,</b> tuber number and weight per <b>plant</b> and total and marketable tuber yield were measured. Analysis of variance from measured traits showed that <b>planting</b> dates and cultivars in traits like <b>plant</b> height, main stem number per <b>plant,</b> tuber number and weight per <b>plant</b> and total and marketable tuber yield and interaction of between cultivar × <b>planting</b> date <b>plant</b> height, main stem number per <b>plant</b> and tuber number per <b>plant</b> were significantly different. The highest total and marketable tuber yield, tuber number and weight per <b>plant,</b> <b>plant</b> height and main stem number per <b>plant</b> were obtained from second <b>planting</b> date (April 30 th) and the lowest from latest <b>planting</b> date (June 10 th). The difference between total and marketable tuber yield in the second <b>planting</b> date (April 30 th) as compared with the latest <b>planting</b> date (June 10 th) was 13. 35 ton ha- 1. Savalan had the highest <b>plant</b> height, main stem number per <b>plant,</b> tuber number and weight per <b>plant</b> and total and marketable tuber yield. Relationship of total tuber yield with <b>plant</b> height, main stem number per <b>plant,</b> tuber number and weight per <b>plant</b> and marketable tuber yield were positive and significant.

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, <b>plants</b> are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes <b>plants</b> much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal <b>plants</b> are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous <b>plants</b> generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling.

Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between <b>plants</b> and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible <b>plants</b> from inedible <b>plants.</b> This relationship the indigenous people had with <b>plants</b> was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental <b>plants</b> {{from the}} time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare <b>plants</b> were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain <b>plants</b> from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
