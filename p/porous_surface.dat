5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

500|$|Fruitbodies of Leccinum holopus have convex to {{flattened}} caps measuring [...] in diameter, with {{a narrow}} band of sterile tissue surrounding the margin. The caps are initially whitish, but can develop gray, buff, tan, or pinkish tints during maturity; the color may also darken and become greenish with age. The cap surface is initially covered with very fine hairs, but later becomes more or less smooth, often with a sticky texture in age or in moist conditions. The flesh is white and lacks any distinct odor or taste; it can have either little or no bruising color reaction with injury, or may become light pink in variety americanum. On the cap underside is a <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> comprising pores numbering 2 to 3 per millimeter, {{each of which is}} the end of a tube that extends to [...] deep. The color of the pore surface ranges from whitish to grayish to dingy brown, and has little color reaction to injury, although it may discolor yellowish or brownish. There is a depression where the pores meet the stipe. The stipe measures [...] long by [...] wide. Its whitish surface is covered with scabers that darken in age to tan or darker. The stipe base often stains bluish.|$|E
40|$|Unique micro/nano-scale <b>porous</b> <b>surfaces</b> were {{fabricated}} on {{the surfaces}} of steam condensers to promote dropwise condensation which can exhibit higher heat transfer rate than that of filmwise condensation. Steam condensation tests were conducted to evaluate heat transfer performance of the fabricated micro/nano-scale <b>porous</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The micro/nano-scale <b>porous</b> <b>surfaces</b> were prepared using a self-assembly technique, polymer based thin coatings, and a surface etchings technique. The resulting surface morphologies and the wetting characteristics were investigated using SEM and the liquid contact angle measurements to quantify important parameters for enhancing the dropwise condensation. From visual observations, it was deduced that the micro/nano-scale <b>porous</b> <b>surfaces</b> can effectively initiate dropwise condensation by generating smaller condensates and limiting the growth of ‘large’ condensate drops and by improving surface renewal rate...|$|R

2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of aquarium filter consists only of filter {{wool and}} activated carbon. The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the activated carbon adsorbs smaller impurities. These {{should be changed}} regularly at suitable intervals. [...] This is particularly important {{in the case of}} activated carbon filters, which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate. Activated carbon adsorbs toxins on the extended <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of activated carbon can be restored by thermal regeneration at temperatures of 500–900°C (932–1,652°F), electrochemical regeneration, ultrasound, or other industrial processes. For the aquarist, replacing the activated carbon with fresh material is simple and inexpensive.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have {{a history}} {{beginning}} in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning. Patient-matched implants were {{a natural extension of}} this work, leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual. Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed, personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success. One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia [...] developed at the University of Michigan. The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants (metals) is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> structures that facilitate osseointegration. The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom 3D printing technology. In March 2014, surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident. , 3D bio-printing technology has been studied by biotechnology firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet techniques. In this process, layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems. Recently, a heart-on-chip has been created which matches properties of cells.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse swing {{occurs in}} exactly the same manner as {{conventional}} swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so [...] "conventional" [...] swing weakens over time; the separation point moves {{toward the front of the}} ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.|$|E
60|$|We find a {{characteristic}} {{picture of this}} volcanic region of mountains and streams, furnished by the journal of Mr. Wyeth, which lies before us; who ascended a peak in the neighborhood we are describing. From this summit, the country, he says, appears an indescribable chaos; {{the tops of the}} hills exhibit the same strata {{as far as the eye}} can reach; and appear to have once formed the level of the country; and the valleys to be formed by the sinking of the earth, rather than the rising of the hills. Through the deep cracks and chasms thus formed, the rivers and brooks make their way, which renders it difficult to follow them. All these basaltic channels are called cut rocks by the trappers. Many of the mountain streams disappear in the plains; either absorbed by their thirsty soil, and by the <b>porous</b> <b>surface</b> of the lava, or swallowed up in gulfs and chasms.|$|E
