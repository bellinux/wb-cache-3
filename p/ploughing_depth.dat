[...] It is also an effective method of weed control. [...] <b>Ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> in Britain varies between 5–6inches in some limestone regions to up to 18inches in deep stoneless silt land. [...] Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16inches are common. [...] Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), harrows (to level the surface of ploughed land), rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|E

During the whole experimental period, fertilizing, crop residue management and other treatments had been equal for all ploughing depths. Deep ploughing had resulted in a few percent higher accumulated yields than shallow ploughing, probably because of higher weed infestation (Elymus repens, (L.) Gould) for shallow ploughing.

Intercropping peas and cereals is one option to manage weed problems. However, little evidence exists on the weed suppressive ability of pea-cereal intercrops after differing ploughing depths. The effect of crop stand (pea sole crop, pea-oat intercrop and oat sole crop) and <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> (10 – 12 vs. 25 – 27 cm) on the annual weed infestation, PAR transmission and weed nitrogen as well as water supply was investigated in field experiments in Northern Germany. In order to determine causes for the differing weed suppressive ability in pea and oat sole or intercrops, a pot experiment and a bioassay were conducted complementary to the field experiments. Crop stand and <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> did not interact with regard to weed infestation. The weed suppressive ability increased from pea sole crops to oat sole crops, whereas shallow ploughing resulted in a significantly higher weed infestation than deep ploughing. While cropweed competition for light was not essential for the differing weed suppressive ability, competition for water and nitrogen were detected to be key factors. As root exudates of the examined oat cultivar showed a growth inhibiting potential, allelopathy may {{also contribute to the}} weed suppression in oat sole and pea-oat intercrops. Results from this study indicate that pea-oat intercropping is not able to compensate for the higher annual weed infestation after shallow ploughing.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of SOC stock over time {{is difficult to}} assess at a regional scale due to the small magnitude of the changes, to the important spatial variability of SOC {{and the lack of}} detailed information on present and past management practices. This paper aimed to detect changes in SOC stocks of agricultural soils of southern Belgium over a long time period (1955 - 2005), and to determine the driving forces of SOC evolution. The stratification of the study area into homogeneous units (based on land use, soil type, climate and agricultural region) and the re-sampling of soil profiles from the 1950 s allowed detection of significant changes in SOC stocks. The use of equivalent masses for SOC stock comparisons based on the <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> of 2005 allowed excluding dilution effect from changes in <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> or in bulk density. For units under cropland, an average decrease of 5. 8 t C ha(- 1) was measured in the plough layer (from an initial equivalent SOC stock of 46. 4 t C ha(- 1)), while for units under grassland, an average increase of 21. 9 t C ha(- 1) was observed in the 0 - 30 cm depth (from an initial equivalent SOC stock of 61. 2 t C ha(- 1)). Explanatory factors include human driving forces (land management) and inherent soil properties. The decrease in mass of farmyard manure and slurry applied on cropland along with the change in the types of crops cultivated (progressive replacement of cereals by root crops and fodder) could explain the decrease in SOC stocks observed for cropland, while the increase in livestock density per grazing area has lead to an increase in the SOC stocks of grassland. The increase in <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> for cropland (+ 1. 5 cm) was slightly correlated to the silt content (r=- 0. 14) but not to the decrease in SOC content. The impact of erosion or climate on SOC changes remained uncertain. Soil texture was not highlighted as a driving force in the SOC changes, while a strong negative relationship existed between the initial SOC content and the change in SOC content. Therefore, any attempt to increase SOC content in agricultural soils should mainly focus on farming practices through adapted regulations and policies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the soil in the arable layer is controlled by tillage, soil biota activities and weathering, whereas the structure below this layer is mainly {{the result of the}} activities of soil biota. Organic farmers tend to minimise the depth of the main tillage operation to encourage soil biota to create a soil structure with continuous biopores and a well crumbled topsoil. The best main tillage operation for preventive weed control, especially important in organic farming, is mouldboard ploughing. The shallow ploughing experiments described in this paper were conducted to ascertain the minimum <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> for an ecologically accountable, sustainable tillage system with good weed control, good land qualities (in terms of workable days, aeration and soil moisture conditions) and finally with good yields. The "ecoplough" used for shallow ploughing was developed by Rumptstad Industries to meet the requirements of relatively shallow ploughing with good soil inversion for weed control. The plough has seven or eight bottoms for ploughing depths of 0. 12 – 0. 20 m, a working width of 2. 1 m and a working speed of 1. 7 m s- 1. Its width is such that the tractor with wide low-pressure tyres runs on top of the land.

The two ploughing depths were short-term shallow ploughing to a soil depth of 7 – 10 cm and deep ploughing to 25 – 30 cm. Wheel loads of 26 and 45 kN, which correspond to typical rear wheel loads of field machinery used during sowing operations, were compared to an uncompacted control. Shallow ploughing resulted in a greater penetration resistance in the 14 – 28 cm soil layer compared to deep ploughing. An increase in mechanical soil loading intensity increased the bulk density and decreased the air capacity in the 10 – 15 cm soil layer, whereas the penetration resistance was not affected. The annual weed infestation in pea sole crops was higher after shallow than after deep ploughing at both sites. Pea–oat intercrops compensated for the higher weed infestation after shallow ploughing at one site due to their excellent weed suppressive ability. Dependent on oat productivity, pea–oat intercrops produced comparable or higher grain and protein yields than pea sole crops. Intercropped pea yield components and grain protein yields were significantly lower than those of sole cropped peas. The <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> did not affect pea grain yields in either year and oat yields in 2009.

In the final opinion {{by a group}} of experts about the Dutch derogation, recommendations on ploughing of grasslands were included dealing with the depth of ploughing of permanent grassland, the age of temporary grassland, and the nitrogen demand of the subsequent crop of temporary grassland. A literature study was carried out in order to provide scientific information on these three issues. No studies were found in literature in which the effects of cultivation depth on nitrogen mineralization and losses in reseeded grassland were assessed. The results of transformation of grassland into arable land show no clear effects of <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> on nitrogen mineralization. Differences in nitrogen mineralization after five and three years of temporary grassland are small. Italian and perennial ryegrass, potato, silage maize, winter wheat, and several vegetables have a high nitrogen demand (i. e. > 250 kg N per ha) ...|$|E
40|$|Application {{of organic}} {{residues}} to soil is generally assumed to improve soil tilth. Only {{few studies have}} reported on the long-term effects on the more subtle aspects of soil porosity and no reports have considered the potential effects of organic amendments on the pore system in the subsoil. We sampled undisturbed soil cores (100 cm 3 and 6280 cm 3) in metal cylinders in differently fertilized plots in the long-term field experiments at Askov Experimental Station, Denmark. We selected the 0 - 60 cm soil layer of plots dressed for a century with either mineral fertilizers (labelled NPK) or animal manure (labelled AM). Both fertilization treatments were studied at two levels of nutrient application: 'normal' (labelled ' 1 ') and 1. 5 times 'normal' (labelled ' 11 / 2 '). Plots unfertilized for a century (labelled UNF) were included as a reference {{for some of the}} studies. Water retention, air permeability and air diffusivity were measured on the small cores, and we used the large cores for measuring near-saturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity. In the plough layer, the AM and NPK soils displayed identical pore volumes in size fractions larger as well as smaller than 30 micrometer, while the UNF soil had a significantly smaller volume of pores < 30 micrometer. No clear trends were found in treatment effects on pore organization calculated from air diffusivity and air permeability measurements. No significant differences in hydraulic conductivity were found for plough layer soil. For the soil below <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth,</b> significantly larger macropore volumes and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities were found for soil receiving the higher (' 11 / 2 ') amount of nutrients compared with the 'normally' dressed soil. This effect was independent of fertilization system (AM or NPK). We attribute the larger volume of macropores to the improved root growth conditions in the soil with the larger nutrient level. We conclude that addition of animal manure in rates realistic in agriculture has only a modest effect on soil pore characteristics of the plough layer soil compared with the use of mineral fertilizers. For the soil below <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth,</b> a high level of nutrient application rather than the use of animal manure may increase soil macroporosity and near-saturated hydraulic conductivity. ...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceBased on {{the field}} double-ring {{infiltration}} experiment under {{the condition of the}} same soil and with the different inbuilt-ring depths, the changes of soil cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate with inbuilt-ring depths were analyzed and a reasonable inbuilt-ring depth of the filtration test in field was confirmed. The results indicate that the measured precision of soil infiltration parameters is influenced by the inbuilt-ring depths. Namely, within a certain inbuilt-ring depth range, infiltration rate shows a trend of decreasing with the increasing of inbuilt-ring depth. nevertheless, when the inbuilt-ring depth reaches 19 cm to 22 cm the Infiltration rate curves are basically coincident. Therefore, the reasonable inbuilt-ring depth of the infiltration experiment in field should be between 19 cm and 22 cm. Through comprehensive consideration of the measurement accuracy, test instrument cost and test labor intensity, the reasonable inbuilt-ring depth of infiltration experiment in field can be targeted for 19 cm if <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> is less than 20 cm; otherwise, the inbuilt-ring depth can be 20 cm to 22 cm...|$|R
40|$|Government-funded {{research}} on weeds in Scotland {{is part of}} a broad approach to optimise several functions of the arable ecosystem, including those of food security and resilience to economic and environmental change. Weeds are both an economic burden and the base of an essential food web. The approximately 300 species of infield weed that persist in field soils provide ecological and aesthetic functions that include habitat for essential arthropods such as pollinators the natural enemies of insect pests. Though only a small number weed species are pernicious to crop yield, species-indiscriminate herbicides, widespread winter cropping and high inputs of nitrogenous fertiliser have significantly reduced the numbers of most weed species while sometimes increasing the prevalence of the most noxious. Weed seedbanks of around 10, 000 m- 2 to <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> in the 1950 s have been reduced to typically 1000 m- 2 in intense cereal rotations today. The declines have reached the point in much commodity-driven agriculture where most farmland plant species are uncommon and their dependent food webs are impoverished and of little value.

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> and the dosage of organic fertilizer on the growth and spear production of asparagus. The research {{was conducted}} in Bengkulu using PMK soil which is predominant in the province. Two kind of treatment, ie. The <b>depth</b> of <b>plough</b> (range from 20 to 50 cm depth) was treated in split plot design as the main plot and the dosage of organic fertilizer (range from 0 to 7 tons per hectare) as the sub plot. Asparagus cultivar UC 157, originated from California, {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of treatment on the growth and production [...] The preliminary result shows that the growth of aparagus in term of shoot height and number of shoot were not effectively affected by the various dept of plough. Regular measurement for 16 weeks also confirm that the dept of plough alone did not affect the early growth of asparagus plant. In contrast, organic fertilizer (sheep feces) significantly affected the growth of asparagus, either its height of number of shoot. This finding suggests that the improvement in physical properties of the soil due to the organic fertilizer incorporation occurred and directly affected the growth of asparagu...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} change in soil organic carbon (SOC) since it was {{recorded}} during the Belgian National Soil Survey some 40 years ago, we recently revisited 939 locations still under use as arable land. The study area comprised almost the entire province of West Flanders (about 3000 km(2)) characterized by profound changes in its arable land management. Taking the increased <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> (by 9. 8 cm on average) into account, a significant (P = 0. 001) increase of the SOC content by 0. 2 % on average was found, Expressed as an amount, the SOC in the topsoil rose by 9. 3 t/ha on average, representing an increase of 25 %. This is comparable with the conversion of arable land into grassland for 2 to 3 decades. Geostatistical tools were used to map the SOC at the two times of observation. These showed {{that most of the}} spatial variation occurred within about 4 km. Since the community level is the smallest spatial resolution on which agricultural statistics are gathered officially, a detailed modelling of {{the change in}} SOC was;as impossible. However, by selecting communities with extreme changes in SOC, we found indications that the major source of increase in SOC was due to the large increase in pig breeding...|$|E
40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} were tested against autumn mouldboard ploughing {{for differences in}} physical properties of soil, surface runoff, subsurface drainflow and soil erosion. The study (1991 - 2001) was performed on a gently (2 %) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0. 5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842 % for <b>ploughing</b> (<b>depth</b> 2023 cm), 3666 % for shallow autumn stubble cultivation (depth 58 cm) and 3682 % for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and {{in line with the}} values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. Shallow autumn tillage produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha 1 yr 1), but 48 % and 12 % lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794 % of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage. ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{knowledge}} of root morphology and architecture {{is essential in}} order to improve crop productivity, it is greatly hampered by the poor accessibility of plant roots and the lack of suitable methods of investigation. The first international handbook on root methods goes back to the late 1970 s (Bhom, 1979) and mainly proposed destructive procedures. In the last few decades, significant progress has been made with the setting up and improvement of conservative methods. Among these, the use of minirhizotrons – transparent tubes inserted into the soil which allow micro-video cameras to observe individual roots or specific soil areas periodically – has received great attention in open field studies, especially those on root turnover. Although of interest, the use of non-destructive root electrical capacitance or NMR imaging is restricted to single plants or pots, although 3 D soil resistivity imaging has recently been found to correlate well with root distributions at field scale. New methods are being developed, but destructive soil coring and auger sampling still remain as reference methods for measuring root length, diameter and deepening. At the University of Padova (Italy), the roots of several crop species have been studied since the early 1990 s by means of soil coring, minirhizotrons, rhyzoboxes and electrical capacitance, and we have actively contributed to improve root image analysis (Vamerali et al., 2003). Prominent results include the feasibility of reducing <b>ploughing</b> <b>depth</b> in maize without modifying root profiles; the importance of fast root deepening in sugar beet through correct nitrogen dosage, in order to exploit deep water reserves (water-table); and more suitable choices of maize hybrids in semi-arid environments, guided by the frequency distribution of roots in 2 -D maps arranged by means of geostatistic procedures...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{elaborate}} analysis of cultivation of cereal crops and spring barley in the Czech Republic, EU and worldwide, and to evaluate the impact of different methods of tillage on yields and economics of cultivation of spring barley. The effect of different soil tillage intensity on yields and economics of cultivation of spring barley was observed in the long [...] term experiment. This experiment was conducted on loamy chernozem soil in sugar-beet producing region in Ivanovice na Hané. Yields obtained between years 1990 [...] 2014 were evaluated. Spring barley was grown in three crop rotations. The forecrop of the spring barley was always sugar beet grown after maize for silage, winter wheat and spring barley. Four variants of tillage were evaluated: <b>ploughing</b> to the <b>depth</b> of 0, 22 m, <b>ploughing</b> to the <b>depth</b> of 0, 15 m, straight sowing into non-tilled soil and shallow loosening soil to the depth of 0, 10 m. In all three crop rotations, the highest average yield was obtained in variant - <b>ploughing</b> to the <b>depth</b> of 0, 15 m and the lowest average yield was obtained in variant - <b>ploughing</b> to the <b>depth</b> of 0, 22 m. For the economic evaluation {{of the impact of}} different soil tillage intensities were determined variable costs, revenues and gross margins. In all three crop rotations the lowest gross margins were achieved in variant with <b>ploughing</b> to the <b>depth</b> of 0, 22 m. In the crop rotation of maize for silage [...] sugar beet [...] spring barley and in the crop rotation of spring barley [...] sugar beet [...] spring barley were the highest gross margins determined in variant with direct sowing into non-tilled soil. In the crop station of winter wheat [...] sugar beet [...] spring barley were the highest gross margins determined in variant shallow loosening soil to the depth of 0, 10 m. The results indicate that in these soil and climatic conditions, the reduction of intensity of tillage for spring barley grown after sugar beet is sustainable alternative to the traditional method of tillage...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{its global}} significance, soil-atmosphere carbon (C) {{exchange}} under {{the impact of}} soil redistribution remains an unquantified component of the global C budget. Here we use radionuclide and soil organic carbon (SOC) data for two agricultural fields in Europe to undertake a spatial analysis of sediment and SOC fate during erosion and deposition in agricultural uplands. C fluxes induced by soil redistribution are quantified by incorporating C dynamics in a spatially distributed model including both water- and tillage-induced soil redistribution (SPEROS-C). The SOC patterns predicted by SPEROS- C are in good agreement with field observations and show that in upland areas, tillage erosion and deposition exerts a large influence on SOC redistribution and soil profile evolution at a timescale of a few decades. The formation of new SOC at eroding sites and the burial of eroded SOC below <b>plough</b> <b>depth</b> provide an important mechanism for C sequestration on sloping arable land {{in the order of}} 3 – 10 g C m 2 yr 1. Any attempt to manage agricultural land to maximize sequestration must fully account for erosion, burial and fate of eroded and buried SOC across the landscape and must also account for the correlation between tillage and erosion...|$|R

In this research study, disc ploughing on an experimental plot at twenty different soil moisture levels in {{loamy sand soil}} was carried out using trace tractor techniques. The independent variables: drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, speed, width of <b>plough,</b> <b>depth</b> of <b>plough,</b> and dependent variable (Tractive force) were measured and compared to computed values. High coefficients of determination R 2 = 0. 9492, 0. 9555 and 0. 9447 for ploughing at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were obtained respectively. Standard errors of 0. 3672552, 0. 8628 and 0. 8047 and the percentage (%) errors of - 2. 272608059 and 2. 45655144,- 2. 304946155 and 2. 523126085,- 1. 424947801 and 2. 020155232 at minimum and maximum values, were obtained.
