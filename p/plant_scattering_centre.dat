40|$|Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} experiments, along with positron lifetime measurements and {{transmission electron microscopy}} observations, were performed on samples of an oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) Fe 12 Cr alloy and its non-ODS counterpart in order to characterize their nano-sized features. The nuclear and magnetic scattering data were analysed using the maximum entropy approach for obtaining the size distribution of the <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> in these materials. The positron annihilation results and the TEM information have made possible {{an interpretation of the}} volume distribution of the <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> having sizes below ~ 16 nm and their proper quantitative analyses. The smaller <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> in the ODS alloy exhibit distributions with modal values at ~ 6 – 7 and 12 – 14 nm. The peak at ~ 6 – 7 nm appears to be due to the overlapping of more than one type of <b>scattering</b> <b>centres,</b> while the one at ~ 12 – 14 nm can be exclusively attributed to the Y-rich centres.

40|$|Inverse {{synthetic}} aperture radar (ISAR) imaging systems produce electromagnetic images of targets in the range-Doppler domain. In order to rescale the image in a homogeneous range-cross range domain (meters by meters), the modulus of the target effective rotation vector must be known. Although {{in some cases it}} can be retrieved by means of ancillary data, in most cases the modulus of the target effective rotation vector must be estimated. A blind technique is proposed for estimating the modulus of the target effective rotation vector that exploits information carried by the chirp rate of <b>scattering</b> <b>centres.</b> A technique based on image segmentation, local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT), and image contrast (IC) maximisation is used in order to extract the <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> and estimate their chirp rate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the principles of polarimetric radar interferometry (polinsar). This new mode of radar imaging provides three-dimensional information on {{the thickness of the}} forestry layer by gathering full-polarisation imagery at either end of a coherent interferometer, and solving an interferometric coherence maximisation problem, yielding the dominant scattering modes and fixing the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> for these modes. When several effective <b>scattering</b> <b>centres</b> are isolated the interferometric phase difference is related to the height difference between the top of the forest canopy and the ground. We demonstrate successful inversion of the polinsar polarisation-coherence relations, using test data of Baikal, Russia, from the 1994 SIR-C mission. The solution process was made more complicated by the non-reciprocal nature of the SIR-C test data. The forest height estimates are numerically sensitive to the precise implementation of the inversion methodology. Despite the numerical complexity, polinsar yields information that is difficult to achieve by other means...|$|R

In this paper, we present a straightforward method for characterising unstained human metaphase chromosomes.

The result is independent of the chromosome preparation and structure size.
