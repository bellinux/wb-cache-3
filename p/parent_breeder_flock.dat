5000|$|P. multocida {{causes a}} range of {{diseases}} in wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans. The bacterium {{can be found in}} birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, cattle, and pigs. In birds, P. multocida causes avian or fowl cholera disease; a significant disease present in commercial and domestic poultry flocks worldwide, particularly layer <b>flocks</b> and <b>parent</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> P. multocida strains that cause fowl cholera in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3, and 4. In the wild, fowl cholera has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time. [...] P. multocida causes atrophic rhinitis in pigs; it also can cause pneumonia or bovine respiratory disease in cattle. [...] In humans, P. multocida is {{the most common cause of}} infection from wound infections after dog or cat bites. The infection usually shows as soft tissue inflammation within 24 hours. High leukocyte and neutrophil counts are typically observed, leading to an inflammatory reaction at the infection site (generally a diffuse, localized cellulitis). [...] It can also infect other locales, such as the respiratory tract, and is known to cause regional lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes). In more serious cases, a bacteremia can result, causing an osteomyelitis or endocarditis. The bacteria may also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis.|$|R
40|$|In {{the broiler}} it is {{recognized}} that chick viability {{is related to}} <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age. Young flocks produce eggs with a lower hatchability and chick survival than flocks beyond peak production. Field observations indicate that problems occur when chicks originating from younger flocks are mixed with chicks from older flocks and reared together, perhaps because of a difference in thermoregulation. In this experiment, heat production, rectal temperature after heat or cold stress, and T- 3 of chicks originating from two different aged parent stocks were determined. Chickens originating from older <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> showed a remarkably better body weight and better thermoregulation after cold treatment than chickens originating from young <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> In contrast, chicks from young <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> {{seem to be more}} resistant to heat at an older age. This implies that age of <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> alone can cause {{a significant difference in the}} thermoregulatory ability of broiler chickens. Thus <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age should be considered as an additional factor in thermoregulatory experiments. It also may have practical husbandry implications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT One-day-old chicks used in {{this study}} were from <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> vaccinated with live (B, and LaSota) or inactivated oil {{emulsion}} Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine. Chicks were vac-cinated against ND by various procedures. The vaccination response was evaluated by hemag-glutination-inhibition antibody titers and by challenge. Chicks from <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> vaccinated with live virus vaccine had a geometric mean hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer (GMT) for Newcastle of 7 (low maternal antibody titer) at 1 day of age, whereas those chickens derived from <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> vaccinated with inactivated oil emulsion ND vaccine had a GMT of 84 (high mater-nal antibody titer). One-day-old chicks injected with live B, vaccine were not immunized against ND regardless of <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> source. However, chickens with low maternal antibody titers were effectively im-munized against ND when injected at 1 day of age with an inactivated or inactivated plus live ND vaccine.

40|$|Contents: Age {{negatively}} affects {{reproductive success}} of broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> One {{of the main}} hormones involved in the change of fertility with the age is testosterone (TT). The introduction of young males at later production stages of broiler flocks is known as spiking {{and is expected to}} reduce the fertility decline with age. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of injection of different levels of TT and the effect of spiking on reproductive fitness of broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> Two experiments were conducted on Ross 308 <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> for 10 weeks (41 - 50 weeks of age). The experiment 1 included a control and three treatments corresponding to three doses of TT (0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 cc), while the experiment 2 included a control and one treatment corresponding to spiking. The lower dose of TT (0. 1 cc) and the spiking clearly slowed down the decline in hatchability. Therefore, either the external administration of TT to the males when the natural concentration of TT starts to decline or spiking the <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> with young roosters could contribute to improve reproductive success in later stages of the production cycle in broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> Financial support by Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, grant number 4. 5830 is gratefully acknowledged.

However by increasing the age of broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flock,</b> the quality of eggs and consequently the quality of their chick products would be changed. In order to study the effect of broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age on the various aspects of chick products, 300 fertilizable eggs were selected randomly, from 3 broiler breeder farms. Selected eggs were collected from broilers that were 30 (young), 36 (peak), 43 (after peak), 53 (old), 60 (very old) and 82 (molted) weeks old. Collected eggs were stored during 3 to 4 days in the ambient temperature. Qualitive and quantitive aspects of eggs including egg weight, albumen height yolk, height thickness of egg shell, yolk color, Albumen and yolk PH and Hugh unit were studied. Trait Analysis was done by ANOVA procedure of SAS statistical software. To compare the means, Duncan test was used. The effects of age and breeder farms on the egg weight, yolk color, yolk and albumen PH, yolk and albumen height, shell egg thickness and Hugh unit were significant (p< 0. 05). The lowest difference was seen between the age of 53, 60 and 82 week old (p< 0. 05). Albumen PH and alkaline is increased by increase of age, but yolk PH is the variance.

Despite being free range, no newly colonizing STs were detected over a 6 -week period in autumn and a 10 -week period in winter, towards the end of the study. There was limited evidence that those STs identified among broiler chicken flocks on the same farm site were likely to colonize the <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> earlier (R 2 0. 16, P 0. 01).

In 1991 a previously unidentified bacterium associated with respiratory disease and cranial cellulitis was isolated from broilers in the then Transvaal Province (van Beek, van Empel, van den Bosch, Storm, Bongers, du Preez, 1994.). In 1994 the organism was named Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (Vandamme, Segers, Vancanneyt, van Hove, Mutters, Hommez, Dewhirst, Paster, Kersters, Falsen, Devriese, Bisgaard, Hinz, Mannheim, 1994.). Since then Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale has been isolated worldwide from chickens and turkeys showing respiratory signs and has become well established as contributing to the respiratory disease complex in both species (van Empel, Hafez, 1999). In South Africa respiratory disease and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale in particular is routinely controlled by the inclusion of antibiotics such as Oxtetracycline into the feed of broilers during rearing. Concerns about antibiotic residues in poultry meat for human consumption as well as evidence that suggests that Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale readily develops resistance to antibiotics (Devriese, Hommez, Vandamme, Kersters, Haesebrouck, 1995), make this strategy unsustainable. It was with a view to reducing producersâ€™ dependence on long term prophylactic antibiotic therapy that this study to determine the safety and efficacy of an OR bacterin vaccine was carried out. Injection of the bacterin into broilers was deemed impractical on a commercial scale, so it was applied to broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>parent</b> stock in order that they could protect their progeny through vertically transmitted immunity developed as a result of vaccination. <b>Breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> were vaccinated intramuscularly at nine and 18 weeks with a monovalent bacterin based on OR serotype A with oil adjuvant. Vaccine safety was evaluated by palpation of vaccination sites and clinical observation of breeders for two weeks after vaccination. The serological response of breeders to vaccination was monitored using an ELISA test for Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale optimised for use under South African conditions. Vaccine efficacy was determined by monitoring of broiler progeny of vaccinated breeders raised under commercial conditions as well as through controlled challenge studies with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale under laboratory conditions. In order to determine the financial consequences of using the test vaccine, a partial farm budget was drawn up from available broiler data and possible outcomes were modelled using a stochastic model. The vaccine proved to be safe for use in commercial broiler breeders and vaccinated birds developed a good humoral response to vaccination. As a result of cross-contamination of isolators with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale the results of the challenge studies were inconclusive. No evidence of protection of broiler progeny of vaccinated <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> could be detected through the challenge trials. In the absence of in-feed medication, broilers hatched from vaccinated breeders did, however, performed better under commercial conditions than those hatched from unvaccinated <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks.</b> The partial farm budget showed that broilers raised from OR vaccinated <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> were more profitable than the negative control flocks. The quantitative risk analysis showed that the probability of making a relative profit from broilers as a result of OR vaccination of parent stock was 74 %, from the use of in-feed medication in broilers from unvaccinated parents was 70 % and from a combination of the interventions was 99 %. It can be concluded that the last of these options was most profitable. Copyright 2003, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved. The copyright in this work vests in the University of Pretoria.

40|$|The Dutch broiler {{supply chain}} {{involves}} several interdependent {{firms such as}} breeding and feed companies, rearing farms, breeder farms, broiler hatcheries and broiler farms. To stay competitive and sustain continuity, evaluation of production at each level of the chain is crucial. Good quality data {{and the use of}} management information systems (MIS) can facilitate this process. Firms in the Dutch broiler supply chain collect data as a routine practice. However, the data are not often analysed and not fully used to support management decisions. The focus of this thesis is on the broiler breeder farms, because eggs are the origin of broiler production. Thus, improving the management at broiler breeder farms could contribute to the improvement of the performance of subsequent firms and the whole supply chain. The objective of this research is, therefore, to develop MIS based on available data in the broiler supply chain to support management decisions at breeder farms. The thesis is composed of three parts. In the first part, management factors at breeder farms that are related to the performance indicators at the subsequent levels of the broiler production chain are explored. For this, field data from three Dutch hatcheries of 2004, 2005 and 2006 were analysed. Hatchability and first week mortality (FWM) of chicks are considered as performance indicators as these are related to the performance at the breeder farms, hatcheries and broiler farms. A significant difference in hatchability and FWM among eggs from different <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> was found. Furthermore FWM differ significantly between broiler farms. Hatchability and FWM are significantly related with <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age, egg storage length, strain, feed company of the breeder farm, season, year, as well as hatchery. It is concluded that breeder farm management factors are related to the performance in the subsequent levels of the chain next to hatchery and broiler farm factors. In the second part of this thesis, the availability and quality of data in the Dutch broiler supply chain was assessed. The data quality of the hatchery dataset (from part one) was assessed based on the intuitive approach whereby the quality attitudes are selected by the researcher intuitively. Results showed that the datasets had some fields with inaccurate, incorrect, inconsistent, non-uniform, incomprehensible, and/or incomplete data. In addition, a protocol was proposed and validated for standardization of data {{to improve the quality of}} data in the chain. In the third part of this thesis, two management information systems were developed aiming to support decisions at broiler breeder farms. The first management information system evaluates the tactical management at broiler breeder farms using individual farm analysis combined with a deterministic simulation model (IFAS). With IFAS, the performance of a breeder farm is compared with an average of similar farms or other standards, and relevant deviations are determined based on economic and statistical importance. According to the relevance of the identified deviations the strong and weak management practices are indicated. The second management information system determines the economic optimal replacement age of the broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> using the marginal net revenue approach. A well informed replacement decision for <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> improves profitability, not only at the breeder farms but also at hatcheries and broiler farms. Â ...|$|R
