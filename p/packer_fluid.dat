5000|$|These inhibitors {{chemically}} retard {{the formation}} of clathrate hydrates. Dosage of such inhibitors in the fluid is usually [...]3% to [...]5% by weight of the fluid, compared to 10% to 50% by weight for thermodynamic inhibitors for prevention of clathrate formation. Due to this and other factors, kinetic inhibitors are more cost effective than thermodynamic inhibitors. However, if the fluid is in a static environment (i.e. <b>packer</b> <b>fluid),</b> kinetic inhibitors will have limited effect as hydrates will still form over sufficient time. At this point the only viable option is thermodynamic inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Packer</b> <b>fluid</b> whose {{function}} is to prevent or tremendously reduce the heat transfer rate which would occur from the production tubing area to the production casing region is being studied in recent decades because of its wide applications in Oil & Gas Industry. Reduction of heat transfer rate {{can lead to the}} minimization of trapped annular pressures and reduction of contents of hydrates resolvable in production fluids. This paper utilizing ANSYS Fluent gives numerical solution for the combined convection problem of this <b>packer</b> <b>fluid.</b> Because of the geometry of the tubing-to-casing annulus, it is modeled as vertical and long parallel plates in ANSYS Fluent geometry part where the width of the duct is small comparable to the length of the duct. The flow is assumed to lie in laminar region and ANSYS Fluent laminar flow model is utilized. How different parameters including aspect ratio, temperature difference and inlet velocity will have effects on the convective heat transfer rate are analyzed respectively by measuring and calculating dimensionless parameters including Nusselt number, Reynolds number, Prandtl number, Grashof number and Rayleigh number. Numerical results characterize the convective heat transfer performance of the <b>packer</b> <b>fluid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Carbon steel, {{the most}} widely used {{engineering}} material, accounts for approximately 85 %, of the annual steel production worldwide. Despite its relatively limited corrosion resistance, carbon steel is used in large tonnages in marine applications, nuclear power and fossil fuel power plants, transportation, chemical processing, petroleum production and refining, pipelines, mining, construction and metal-processing equipment. This paper Investigate Carbon steel corrosion in water. The corrosion rate in production and casing pipes in water base drilling mud (<b>packer</b> <b>fluid),</b> different salt concentration (100 gm/L, 150 gm/L, 200 gm/L) have been used and different temperature (30 co, 50 co, 70 co) have been investigated. Weight loss and polarization methods were applied. The results indicate that the corrosion rates decrease with the increasing of salt concentration while the corrosion rates increase with increasing of temperatur...|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic-set <b>packers</b> use <b>fluid</b> {{pressure}} {{to drive the}} cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set {{by the use of}} either entrapped pressure or a mechanical lock. They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or crooked holes where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension.|$|R
40|$|The {{scarcity}} of land based oil reserves has necessitated {{the exploration of}} off shore oil. This exploration is often carried out in pristine waters {{and the use of}} green chemicals is essential to reduce environmental degradation. In the recovery of oil and gas from rocky formations, well bore <b>fluids</b> such as <b>packer</b> <b>fluids,</b> fracturing fluids, conformance and permeability control fluids are extensively employed. Potassium oleate as viscoelastic surfactants gives a low partition coefficient when in contact with hydrocarbon. Bromination of the oleate chain has been shown in this work to increase the partition coefficient and still maintaining its viscoelasticity. The partition coefficient increased to ca 8 % compared to negligible for potassium oleate. A gel was formed when a 20 % solution of potasssium 9 -bromo stearate was mixed with 8 % KCl. Contacting this gel with hydrocarbon resulted in a loss of viscosity due to the improved solubility of the brominated compound in hydrocarbon. This facilitates the removal of the surfactants after its use as a fracturing fluid. The viscoelastic properties were demonstrated using a Bohlin rheometer. The graph of viscosity vs shear rate shows at first a shear rate independence up to a shear rate of 0. 2 s- 1 and then falling with shear rate typical of a viscoelastic fluid. The zero shear viscosity ηo varied from 18 Pa s to 220 Pa s whilst the shear viscosity at 100 s- 1 ranged from 0. 16 Pa s to 1. 5 Pa s for surfactant concentration from 20 % to 5 %...|$|R
50|$|Inflatable <b>packers</b> - use <b>fluid</b> {{pressure}} to inflate a long cylindrical tube of reinforced rubber {{to set the}} packer. Frequently used for open hole testing in exploration wells and for cement assurance in production wells. Also used in wells where the packer must pass through a restriction and then set at a much larger diameter in casing or open holes. Many variations for specific applications are available including those capable of withstanding high pressure differentials.|$|R
5000|$|This mud type {{can be used}} as a {{completion}} and workover fluid, a spotting fluid to relieve a stuck pipe and as <b>packer</b> or casing <b>fluid.</b> They are very good for [...] "Gumbo" [...] shales. The mud weight can be controlled from 7-22 lbs/gal. It is sensitive to temperature but does not dehydrate as in the case of water based mud as mentioned before. It has no limit on the drilled solids concentration. The water phase should be maintained above a pH of 7. Stability of the emulsion depends on the alkaline value.|$|R
40|$|The {{studies at}} the Grimsel Rock Laboratory were {{focussed}} mainly on the excavation disturbed zone (EDZ) in the tunnel driven by blasting and on the tunnel far-field. The analysis of in-situ-tests shows that {{the changes in the}} EDZ in the granite strongly depend on the local conditions. The permeability of the rock depends on the local properties of the rock and the presence of natural joints. The width of the EDZ is influenced by the excavation method. The width of the EDZ can be minimized by taking important factors into consideration during planning and construction. Permeability in the EDZ was examined using newly developed surface and short interval <b>packers.</b> The <b>fluid</b> flow in the zone occurs almost only in the fractures with permeability between k= 10 "-" 1 " 7 m" 2 and k= 10 "-" 1 " 0 m" 2. Although the permeability of individual fractures is relatively high, the permeability of the EDZ as a whole is low because the fractures have different permeabilities and lengths. The EDZ in the GRL is 30 - 50 cm wide. For simulation of the tests, computer programs based on the DURST programme system have been developed for two-phase flow and for 3 -D gas-transport. (orig.)

40|$|In {{order to}} make the {{generation}} of geothermal electricity in a sedimentary reservoir rocks possible a deep former gas exploration well was reopened and deepened in 2000 to 4294 m depth. An in-situ downhole laboratory was established in this well with the purpose of developing appropriate stimulation methods to increase permeability of deep aquifers by enhancing or creating secondary porosity and flow paths. The goal is to learn how to enhance the inflow performance of a well from a variety of rock types in low permeability geothermal reservoirs. Proppant-gel-frac techniques as well as waterfrac techniques were used in several different experiments. During the proppant-gel-frac two intervals of Rotliegend sandstones were hydraulically stimulated in January 2002. The experiment design comprised isolating the bottom boundary of the interval of interest by filling the bottom of the well with sand. The top of the interval was sealed with a mechanical <b>packer.</b> High-viscosity <b>fluid</b> with proppant was employed for stimulation. Flow rates were increased significantly, and a fracture with a length of 150 m was generated due to this operation. However, the productivity observed was insufficient for power production. Further stimulation of the reservoir rocks in this well was performed in two experiments in winter and fall 2003 using the waterfrac technique. More than 15000 m water was injected in different pressure steps with flow rates up to 80 ls- 1. Mechanical reacting reservoir properties were observed at injection flow rates above 9 ls- 1. Recent data of a production test show a productivity of 14 mh- 1 MPa- 1...|$|R
30|$|Tight {{reservoir}} exploration in Barmer basin has huge potential with possible in place volumes of multi billion barrels in reservoirs across the Mesozoic to Cenozoic stratigraphic levels. These tight reservoirs (permeability {{in the range}} of 0.01 – 10  mD) are ideal fraccing candidates for commercial production. One of the critical challenges in tight {{reservoir exploration}} is early assessment of permeability and reservoir fluid type identification through wireline formation testing (WFT) to determine flow behavior, frac optimization and expected deliverability after fraccing. The most prospective Barmer Hill (BH) and Fatehgarh (FAT) tight formations from the basin have been tested with new 3 D radial probe WFT tool providing significant time and cost optimization opportunities. Good quality fluid samples with very low contamination levels were extracted with less rig time and operational costs from very low permeable BH formation (0.18  mD/cP mobility) and FAT formation (0.35  mD/cP mobility) in 150 and 200  min respectively. 3 D radial probe and dual packer module based WFT job were compared for their efficiencies in similar environment. The results show that 3 D radial probe has less inflation time (~ 1 / 5 th), quick fluid detection (~ 1 / 10 th time), quick and reliable <b>packer</b> deployment, focused <b>fluid</b> flow regime to address the formation heterogeneity and minimum hole sticking issues due to mechanical arms around the probe. In short, 3 D radial probe can address both the uncertainties of WFT in tight reservoirs and optimized well testing and frac design for cost effective field development.|$|R
