5|$|The {{church has}} five retablos (reredos). The central retablo (or retablo mayor) {{at the altar}} houses images of Saint Peter, the <b>patron,</b> paired with Saint Paul on the {{uppermost}} niche. On the lowest level are images of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a secondary <b>patron,</b> in the center. Also on the lowest level were statues of Saint Lucy, <b>patron</b> against typhoons and Saint Francis Xavier, <b>patron</b> against floods and alligators. Both Saint Lucy and Saint Francis were elected patrons in 1697. Behind {{the walls of the}} retablo mayor are the remains of the former Jesuit altarpiece, a bas-relief of Saint Ignatius Loyola and St Francis Xavier dressed as a pilgrim.|$|E

40|$|Cooperatives {{differ from}} other {{businesses}} {{in that they}} are owned by their <b>patrons</b> and net margins are distributed to <b>patrons</b> on the basis of use instead of capital investment. For financing, cooperatives often rely on allocated equities from retained patronage refunds. Retained patronage refunds are noncash allocations of net margins reinvested in a cooperative by <b>patrons.</b> Under an ideal program of equity formation, equity is held by <b>patrons</b> in proportion to patronage. Each patron’s share of financing the cooperative is equal to the share of benefits received. Equities of former <b>patrons</b> are retired as active <b>patrons</b> take on more of the responsibility of financing the organization...|$|R
40|$|The phrase “difficult patron” {{is often}} {{associated}} with troubles and habitually abnormal behavior from <b>patrons.</b> From the viewpoint of organization, the existence of difficult <b>patrons</b> might signal dissatisfaction with services, collections, facilities, or with specific individual librarians. But difficult patron’s complaints may also be regarded as valuable opportunities to improve customer service and satisfaction. Hence, for the circulation librarians, learning how to interact with difficult <b>patrons</b> is quite important. This article reports findings from a qualitative study which investigated types and behavioral characteristics of difficult <b>patrons</b> in university libraries in Taiwan. Semi-structured interviewing method was used to investigate 23 circulation librarians’ experiences with difficult <b>patrons.</b> Based on the findings, this article discusses why some <b>patrons</b> are difficult as well as service strategies for dealing with difficult <b>patrons</b> in university libraries...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} venue type, gambling behaviour and servicescape features. A national telephone survey of Australians adults (N = 175) who had nominated that their most frequented gaming venue was either a casino, club or hotel was undertaken. The results for the gambling behaviour variables indicated that casino <b>patrons</b> were less frequent in their gambling, but spent more money gambling per visit than either club or hotel <b>patrons.</b> For the 12 servicescape variables tested, a 3 x 2 MANOVA revealed that when choosing where to gamble casino <b>patrons</b> placed significantly greater importance on the venue having a lively atmosphere compared to hotel <b>patrons.</b> However, when rating the presence of servicescape features in their most frequented venue, club <b>patrons</b> rated their most frequented venue significantly higher as {{a good place to}} socialise than did hotel <b>patrons.</b> Also, club <b>patrons</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} endorse their venue as being not too crowded than casino <b>patrons.</b> The study also identified ten servicescape features that were rated as important by gamblers, but not present in their most frequented venue. The implication of these results for the management and marketing of venues is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In early 1895, Braithwaite {{travelled}} to Toronto to {{help create}} the platform of a national <b>Patrons</b> party, which advocated agrarian reform, prohibition and woman's suffrage. Soon after this, however, the Manitoba <b>Patrons</b> became divided by a local issue, the Manitoba Schools Question. Catholic <b>Patrons</b> became alienated from the party when it supported the government of Thomas Greenway in opposing denominational schools. The controversy also caused many Protestant farmers to rally around Greenway's Liberals, further marginalizing the <b>Patrons.</b> Only seven <b>Patrons</b> candidates contested the 1896 provincial election in Manitoba, and of these only two were elected. Braithwaite had already declared himself a candidate for federal office, and did not run provincially.|$|R
5|$|Although Alexander {{was known}} for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of {{religious}} houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary <b>patron.</b> He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the <b>patron</b> of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical <b>patron</b> of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.|$|E
