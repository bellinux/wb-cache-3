50|$|Once ignited, rocket {{chambers}} are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if {{they are}} restarted after being shut down for a few seconds. However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{components}} of a rocket engine are therefore the combustion chamber (thrust chamber), <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniter,</b> propellant feed system, valves, regulators, the propellant tanks, and the rocket engine nozzle. In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirements}} for an inexpensive, highly reliable, disposable engine are met by using dual 510 kN (sea level) gas generator engines {{on a single}} mounting frame. Each engine has dual turbopumps with separate gas exhaust. Both turbines are fed by a single fuel rich gas generator. The combustion chambers and throat are regeneratively cooled, while the nozzle, of welded pipe construction, uses dump cooling. The turbopumps use solid propellant cartridges for start-up, while the gas generator and combustion chamber use <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniters.</b> The valves and prevalves are helium-actuated ball valves. The thrust and mixture ratio are calibrated with venturis and a propellant utilization valve on ground tests. The engine also has dual heat exchanger to supply hot gaseous hydrogen and oxygen for tank pressurization.|$|R
40|$|Closed {{chamber and}} gun firing tests on various liquid monopropellants were {{performed}} at the Fraunhofer-Institute (EMI-AFB) and the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL). The objectives {{of the study were}} twofold: (1) to investigate the ignition requirements of the propellants in both a closed chamber and a gun and (2) to investigate the combustion characteristics of the propellants, also in both a closed chamber and a gun. <b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniters</b> were used in both the closed chamber and gun tests. The propellants tested at EMI-AFB were isopropyl nitrate, nitro-methane, and three hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) based liquid monopropellants, NOS- 365, LGP 1845, and LGP 1846, a variation of LGP 1845. The gun tests at EMI-AFB were performed in a 28 -mm regenerative liquid propellant gun (RLPG). The propellants tested at the BRL were NOS- 365, LGP 1845, and LGP 1846. The gun tests at the BRL were performed in a 30 -mm RLPG. Instrumentation used to evaluate the ignition and combustion properties of the propellants included pressure and temperature sensors.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{exploring}} explosion characteristics of methane-air explosive mixtures in a ducted vessel, a 20 l spherical vessel connected with a 2813 mm long duct was employed. The experimental setup was comprised of a wafer check valve, which kept the methane-air mixture initially confined and opened {{at the time of}} explosion. The system introduced turbulence to the gas mixture during operation and <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniters</b> were employed in the investigation. This approach assisted to obtain data that can be correlated with real world ducted explosion accidents where the explosion initiates in the presence of strong ignition energies and in turbulent states of methane-air mixtures. This study shows that the explosion severity can be very high in the turbulent field of methane-air mixture and in the presence of strong ignition energies. The pressure rise in the vessel and the flame speed {{along the length of the}} duct were found to be higher in the present study when compared to data obtained with quiescent methane-air mixtures and low ignition energies. The impact of the duct length and pyrotechnic igniters&# 039; energy on reduced peak explosion pressure was characterised. The rate of pressure rise, a parameter linked to the burning rate, increased from the ducted to the vented configurations of the explosion test units...|$|R

These actuators use high pressure hydrogen as hydraulic fluid. The oxygen supply system has a propellant utilization valve before the main LOX valve to regulate its flow and thus variate the mixture ratio. This enables optimization of the propellant reserves and improves performance.|$|E

50|$|The {{successful}} {{launch of}} Mariner 2 on August 22 momentarily blunted criticism of NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory and {{also seemed to}} verify the soundness of the Ranger design. Meanwhile, JPL engineers were {{still trying to figure}} out what had caused the computer failure on Ranger 4, which had occurred during a period when the probe was out of range of ground tracking. The malfunction was especially puzzling because the probe had been given very thorough ground testing without any anomalies occurring. Examination of telemetry records seemed to suggest that the failure had occurred during separation of Ranger 4 from the Agena, at the point where the electrical interface between the two was disconnected and Ranger 4 would have switched to internal power. The behavior of the probe indicated a transformer or inverter malfunction, probably a short circuit caused by loose metal coatings contacting the pins on the power umbilical attaching the probe to the Agena. Modifications to Ranger 5 included a backup timer to ensure continued operation of the telemetry system if the main computer failed, an additional nitrogen bottle to the attitude control system to reduce gas pressure, and an additional <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniter</b> for the midcourse correction engine. Most importantly, extra diodes and fuses were added to the electrical lines to prevent another short from occurring.|$|E
40|$|Green" {{propellants}} {{based on}} Ionic-liquids (ILs) like Ammonium DiNitramide and Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate {{have recently been}} developed as reduced-hazard replacements for hydrazine. Compared to hydrazine, ILs offer up to a 50 % improvement in available density-specific impulse. These materials present minimal vapor hazard at room temperature, and this property makes IL's potentially advantageous for "ride-share" launch opportunities where hazards introduced by hydrazine servicing are cost-prohibitive. Even though ILs present a reduced hazard compared to hydrazine, in crystalline form they are potentially explosive and are mixed in aqueous solutions to buffer against explosion. Unfortunately, the high water content makes IL-propellants difficult to ignite and currently a reliable "coldstart" capability does not exist. For reliable ignition, IL-propellants catalyst beds must be pre-heated to greater than 350 C before firing. The required preheat power source is substantial and presents a significant disadvantage for SmallSats where power budgets are extremely limited. Design and development of a "micro-hybrid" igniter designed {{to act as a}} "drop-in" replacement for existing IL catalyst beds is presented. The design requires significantly lower input energy and offers a smaller overall form factor. Unlike single-use "squib" <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniters,</b> the system allows the gas generation cycle to be terminated and reinitiated on demand...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with the RS 18 rocket engine using liquid oxygen (LO 2) and liquid methane (LCH 4) propellants under simulated altitude conditions at NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This project is part of NASA s Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project. "Green" propellants, such as LO 2 /LCH 4, offer savings in both performance and safety over equivalently sized hypergolic propellant systems in spacecraft applications such as ascent engines or service module engines. Altitude simulation was achieved using the WSTF Large Altitude Simulation System, which provided altitude conditions equivalent up to approx. 120, 000 ft (approx. 37 km). For specific impulse calculations, engine thrust and propellant mass flow rates were measured. Propellant flow rate was measured using a coriolis-style mass-flow meter and compared with a serial turbine-style flow meter. Results showed a significant performance measurement difference during ignition startup. LO 2 flow ranged from 5. 9 - 9. 5 lbm/sec (2. 7 - 4. 3 kg/sec), and LCH 4 flow varied from 3. 0 - 4. 4 lbm/sec (1. 4 - 2. 0 kg/sec) during the RS- 18 hot-fire test series. Thrust was measured using three load cells in parallel. Ignition was demonstrated using a gaseous oxygen/methane spark torch igniter. Data was obtained at multiple chamber pressures, and calculations were performed for specific impulse, C* combustion efficiency, and thrust vector alignment. Test objectives for the RS- 18 project are 1) conduct a shakedown of the test stand for LO 2 /methane lunar ascent engines, 2) obtain vacuum ignition data for the torch and <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniters,</b> and 3) obtain nozzle kinetics data to anchor two-dimensional kinetics codes...|$|R

It is a bipropellant design, using LH2 and LOX. Primary design and production work was carried out by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In terms of liquid rockets, it is a fairly small engine, both in size and thrust output, being in the 89 kN (20,000 lbf) and the more recent models the 130 kN (30,000 lbf) thrust class. The motor is capable of multiple restarts, due to a spark ignition system as opposed to the single use <b>pyrotechnic</b> or hypergolic <b>igniters</b> commonly used on some contemporary engines. Though rated for up to 16 starts and 40+ minutes of firing time, on the H-II the engine is considered expendable, being used for one flight and jettisoned.

Small amounts of selected additives {{play an important role}} in solving some of the problems presented by composite propellants that include {{ammonium nitrate}} (AN). Iron(III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3), for example, can be used as a burning-rate modifier in PSAN/HTPB propellants and although its effect on the burning rate is well known, its mechanism of action is not well understood. Thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) have been applied to study the slow thermal decomposition of selected compositions to investigate the mechanism of action of Fe 2 O 3 as a burning-rate modifier of PSAN/HTPB propellants. The compositions evaluated include PSAN, Fe 2 O 3 and HTPB cross-linked with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) as ingredients. No effect of Fe 2 O 3 on PSAN decomposition is found. Fe 2 O 3 shows an effect on the kinetics of the first stage of HTPBIPDI decomposition and increases the exothermicity of HTPBIPDI decomposition. In the decomposition of PSAN HTPBIPDI Fe 2 O 3 propellants, the effect of Fe 2 O 3 is also observed and a synergetic interaction between PSAN and HTPBIPDI is found, for which a physical-chemical explanation is given. © 1995...|$|E

A spectral {{analysis of this}} emission allows deep insight into the reaction process by the non-intrusive determination of the reaction temperatures and observation of the main reaction species and their concentrations. In the presentation various pyrometric and spectroscopic measurement techniques and data analysis and interpretation procedures are introduced using the spectral range form the ultraviolet, visible and near to medium infrared in combination with image processing of video and IR-camera signals. The available scan rate of several hundred spectra per second is sufficient to investigate: flame structure of high pressure strand burners from rocket propellants, gun powders and gas generators reaction processes in bulk <b>pyrotechnic</b> mixtures like <b>igniter</b> mixtures, flares, incendiary compositions, etc. moving and burning of single particles ignition processes of gun powders propagation of gas explosions in-situ observations of reactions in closed burning chambers via fiber optics The quantitative intensity calibration of the recorded spectra series is carried out by relation to reference spectra of a black body radiator in units of power per wavelength, area and steradian. The evaluation uses the BAM code of ICT to model bands of reaction products. The code calculates NIR/IR-spectra (1 - 10 mu m) of non homogenous gas mixtures of H 2 O (with bands around 1. 3, 1. 8, 2. 7 and 6. 2 mu m), CO 2 (with bands near 2. 7 and 4. 3 mu m), CO (4. 65 mu m), NO (5. 3 mu m) and HCl (3. 5 mu m) taking into consideration also emission of soot particles. It {{is based on the}} single line group model and makes also use of tabulated data of H 2 O and CO 2. Rotationally resolved emission spectra of diatomic flame radicals in UV/Vis-range like OH, CH, C- 2, NH correlate directly to the energies regarding electronic, vibrational and rotational energy transitions and therefore enable the estimation of flame temperatures. Taking into account that there are many unknown parameters influencing the emission spectrum of an inhomogenous gas mixture, only a simplified model can be applied. Therefore, it was assumed that the flame consists only of one hot emitting layer of undefined thickness, constant temperature, constant concentration of the various gases and soot particles in thermal equilibrium. These assumptions lead to a reasonable number of parameters, which can be determined by a least squares fit procedure fitting calculated spectra to experimental data. With this restriction, temperature and concentration length of major combustion products can be determined. Additionally, it is found that many pyrotechnic reactions emit a nearly grey continuum in the NIR spectral range {{that can be used for}} temperature determination. For spatial allocation of the spectroscopic emission signals the intensity distribution of simultaneously recorded video or IR-camera frames were used...|$|R

DARE {{is a student}} society based at Delft University of Technology {{with the goal of}} being the first student group in the world to launch a rocket into space. After the launch of the hybrid engine powered Stratos II+ sounding rocket in October 2015, DARE decided to investigate highly efficient liquid rocket engine technology. In this context DARE initiated the cryogenic project with the goal of developing a liquid rocket engine using liquid oxygen and liquid methane as propellants with a nominal thrust in the order of 10 kN. Eventually this engine shall power a future sounding rocket into space. As an intermediate step, a 3 kN class engine is being developed. Subsystem development tests and possibly a hot-fire test campaign on this engine are planned for 2016 and its development intends to provide DARE with the required experience and knowledge to develop large scale liquid rocket engines. The engine is developed in cooperation with Heliaq Advanced Engineering and is designed to meet the requirements of the second stage engine of the ALV reusable launch vehicle. The design is a pressure-fed engine, regeneratively cooled using the liquid methane fuel.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the hybrid {{propulsion}} has been considering as a viable alternative of chemical energy conversion stored in propellants into kinetic energy. This energy is applied in propulsive systems of manned platforms, maneuvering procedures {{and even in the}} repositioning process of micro satellites. It presents attractive features and good balance between performance and environmental impact. Paraffin based grains are the hybrid solid fuels appointed as polymeric fuel substitute. The liquid layer formed on the burning surface ensures high regression rate when driven into the flame front. Paraffin grains allow raw material recovery and reduce the risk of explosion in the presence of erosive burning. The structure of the grain and the control of the liquefying burning surface layer depend on the additives concentration, such as carbon black, which are added to the fuel matrix during the production process. In the solid propellant paraffin based grain a cylindrical center port developed during the centrifugation tends to concentrate carbon black in the outer region of the grain. The influence of carbon black distribution and hardness gradient in paraffin based grain were evaluated in this work. Despite being a well-known material, scarce data on the relation of activation energy (Ea) of paraffin is available. In this work, the kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) of microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin have been raised through Thermo Gravimetric Analysis in conjunction with the Arrhenius kinetic mechanism, according to ASTM-E 1461. The analysis indicated that the microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin presents activation energy of 242 kJ. mol- 1 and pre-exponential factor from 1. 42 x 1020 min- 1 to 2. 90 x 1025 min- 1. Ignition was achieved with a 50 W <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>igniter.</b> Firing tests with 140 / 1450 F paraffin as solid fuel and gaseous oxygen (GOX) as oxidizer were carry on at pressure above 3. 8 MPa.

In this work combustion instability presented by rocket engine was calculated applying the frequency and boundary layer delay time relationship as proposed by Karabeyoglu.
