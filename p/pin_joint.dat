50|$|A truss {{arch bridge}} {{combines}} {{the elements of}} the truss bridge and the arch bridge. The actual resolution of forces will depend upon the design. If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss, essentially a bent beam - see moon bridge for an example. If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a <b>pin</b> <b>joint,</b> this is termed a three-hinged arch - see The Iron Bridge for an example. If no hinge exists at the apex, it will normally be a two-hinged arch.In the Iron Bridge shown below, the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood. Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together, so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another, as they are in a pin-jointed truss structure that allows rotation at the <b>pin</b> <b>joint.</b> Such rigid structures (which impose bending stresses upon the elements) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss.|$|E

40|$|There are an innumerable {{number of}} {{precision}} automotive assemblies which use <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> for alignment. Many of these suffer from poor performance and cost/quality issues because <b>pinned</b> <b>joints</b> are inherently over-constrained. This paper introduces the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC) {{as a solution}} for precision (better than 10 microns) automotive assemblies. For these applications, QKCs require fewer parts, have a lower total cost, and provide sub-micron repeatability. This paper covers design and manufacturing considerations for automotive QKCs. Proof of concept is demonstrated via a case study on the block-main bearing assembly of a Ford six cylinder engine. Repeatability tests yield average QKC bearing center line repeatability of 0. 65 microns at the outer journal bearings as compared to 4. 85 microns for <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> This QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, costs 36 % less, and allows feature size and placement tolerance ranges which are twice as wide {{as those of the}} previous <b>pinned</b> <b>joints.</b> NOMENCLATURE Gmax Maximum gap between block and bedplate Gmin Minimum gap between block and bedplate Ka Stiffness in axial direction Kc Stiffness perpendicular to bearing center line Ra Repeatability in axial direction Rc Repeatability perpendicular to bearing center line δa Alignment error in axial direction δc Alignment error perpendicular to bearing center line δGMS Gap margin of safety δv Controllable gap variatio...|$|R

40|$|Layer-based rapid {{fabrication}} {{technologies have}} two distinct advantages: (1) build parts without geometry restriction; (2) build sub-systems (static or mobile) {{without the need}} for assembly. Many previous papers have reported various applications that could benefit from the first advantage. Yet, very limited researches have investigated the applications that can benefit from the second advantage. One of the major reasons is the limited accuracy of current layer-based fabrication technologies that can only make mechanism joint with large clearance. This limitation has prohibited the fabrication of sensible joints in mobile sub-systems such as mechanisms, because large clearance at joints is the major source for excessive impact force, resulting in wear and tear of the joints, and consequently the malfunction/degradation of a mechanism's performance. Thus, how to reduce the joint clearance is a major research issue for layer-based rapid fabrication of non-assembly mechanisms. In this paper, different <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> designs are analysed. It was found that drum shaped <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> design gives the minimum joint clearance in layer-based fabrication, and at the same time, without weakening the joint strength compared to the traditional cylindrical <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> design. A number of sample joints and mechanisms have been made by a layer-based fabrication machine Objet Eden 350 V to test the effectiveness of the proposed drum shaped joint design. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{intelligent}} {{structural system}} equipped with smart structural members that are controllable in real-time is one effective solution to prevent structural damage and failure during hostile dynamic loadings, thereby leading to effective protection of structures and their occupants. The {{primary purpose of}} this study is to design, fabricate and characterise a prototype smart member, namely a semi-active magnetorheological (MR) <b>pin</b> <b>joint,</b> through theoretical modelling and experimental investigation. Design of prototype smart pin joints includes theoretical analysis relating to the rotary plate radius, the property of MR fluids and the gap between the rotary plate and the casing based on the requirements of the dynamics of MR pin joints. It is veri-fied that an MR <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> with a diameter of 180 mm can produce a torque of up to 30 Nm, which is deemed adequate for realisation of the semi-active control for multi-storey building models in the next stage of re-search. ...|$|E
40|$|Pin joints {{are found}} in many large {{articulating}} structures. They tend to be under high load and articulate slowly; so, the joints typically operate in the boundary or mixed lubrication regimes. This means that the operating torque depends on the respective proportions of liquid and solid contact between the joint mating faces. In this article, a mixed lubrication model of a grease-lubricated landing gear joint is established to determine a theoretical Stribeck curve, frictional torque and lubricant film thickness under different loads. Parameters describing <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> working conditions, geometry, lubricant properties and pin/bush texture are used. The model can also predict {{the proportion of the}} load that is supported by contacting asperities and lubricant film. The changing proportions of these two parts indicate transformations between different lubrication regimes. Experiments on an instrumented <b>pin</b> <b>joint</b> have been carried out to compare with the predicted friction and torque performance. Theoretical calculation results show good consistency with experimental plots at high load. But under low load, the real friction between pin and bush is significantly lower than theoretical predictions. ...|$|E
