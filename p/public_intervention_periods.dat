The principal aim is to evaluate {{the development of the}} economic legislation related to the promotion of the spanish production through the budget expenditure. This anlysis gets two quite clear results. Firstly, the policy of direct promotion was desinged in Spain in a similar way than in the more important countries of Europe. After several frustated tries, this policy becomes a reality in the legislation from 1909. Secondly, this legislation did not have enough support in the Budget due to penury and rigidity of the Finance. Classification-JEL :...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on sleep disturbance in elderly individuals with dementia. In 19 subjects, normal sleep was observed for a 20 -day control period, inhalation aromatherapy was then applied for a 20 -day <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and the control and <b>intervention</b> <b>periods</b> were compared. During the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> essential oils were placed nightly on towels around the subjects’ pillows. The measured sleep conditions were sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficacy, duration of the longest sustained sleep period, wake time after sleep onset, early morning awakening, total daytime sleep, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Total sleep time was significantly longer in the <b>intervention</b> <b>period</b> than in the control period (p< 0. 05). The duration of the longest sustained sleep period was significantly longer in the <b>intervention</b> <b>period</b> than in the control period (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effects of}} 52 weeks of soccer or {{resistance}} training were investigated in untrained elderly men. The subjects aged 68. 1 ± 2. 1 yrs were randomised into a soccer (SG; n = 9), a resistance (RG; n = 9) and {{a control group}} (CG; n = 8). The subjects in SG and RG, respectively, trained 1. 7 ± 0. 3 and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 times weekly on average during the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> Muscle function and body composition were determined before and after 16 and 52 weeks of the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> In SG, BMI was reduced by 1. 5 % and 3. 0 % (p< 0. 05) after 16 and 52 weeks, respectively, unchanged in RG and 2 % higher (p< 0. 05) in CG after 52 weeks of the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> In SG, the response to a glucose tolerance test was 16 % lower (p< 0. 05) after 16 wks, but not after 52 wks, compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in RG and CG. In SG, superoxide dismutase- 2 expression was 59 % higher (p< 0. 05) after 52 wks compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in RG and CG. In RG, upper body lean mass was 3 and 2 % higher (p< 0. 05) after 16 and 52 wks, respectively, compared to before the <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and unchanged in SG and CG. In RG, Akt- 2 expression increased by 28 % (p< 0. 01) and follistatin expression decreased by 38 % (p< 0. 05) during the 52 -wk <b>intervention</b> <b>period,</b> and was unchanged in SG and CG. Thus, long-term soccer training reduces BMI and improves anti-oxidative capacity, while long-term resistance training impacts muscle protein enzyme expression and increases lean body mass in elderly men.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{the banking}} sector takes three main forms: {{prudential}} regulation, especially with the Basel II ratio for adequacy of a bank's own funds for their exposure to risk; insuring deposits, the goal {{of which is to}} ensure a minimum level of protection for depositors and savers in order to avoid a run on banks; and control and supervision of banks by public authorities, which ensures that the rules are applied properly. Intervention by central banks, through their monetary policy and as lenders of last resort, constitutes the fourth means of regulating the banking system, and the main form of intervention in financial markets. Central banks intervene in order to ensure the stability of financial systems. The financial crisis has shown that traditional modes of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the financial system are ineffective and insufficient.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effect of a {{replacement}} diet with organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged 18 – 59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during the <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end of each respective <b>intervention</b> <b>period.</b> During the <b>intervention</b> <b>period</b> with ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P, 0 · 0001), bloating (P 0 · 004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P, 0 · 001) and tiredness (P, 0 · 0001).

40|$|Spatial {{concentration}} of economic activities {{is one of}} the most salient features of economic development. The almost parallel urge by policymakers to counteract such a trend through public polices is also striking. This is not only reserved to those countries, especially in Europe, which have a long tradition of <b>public</b> <b>intervention.</b> To a lesser extent, the United States has (for example during the New Deal period) put into place policies aimed at correcting uneven patterns of regional development. <b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> is usually defended on either efficiency or equity grounds. In the case of economic geography, a justification in terms of efficiency implies identifying the various market failures, specific to the issue of space, that make the optimal economic geography differ from the one induced solely by market forces. Although one also needs to show that <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> will make a better job than market forces, the identification of market failures is a necessary first step to justify <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> on efficiency grounds. Whereas this type of analysis has been standard for <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the fields of education, technology, pollution, etc., the counterpart for regional policies is much less developed. There are two ways forward: the first is to analyse how some 'standard' market failures are modified by the introduction of space and distance and how in turn, this should affect the definition of public policies; the second is to understand how space and distance themselves can be at the origin of market failures...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} {{increased}} {{focus on the}} methods in which <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> stabilize agricultural markets.

40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} {{the definition of}} the optimal long-run <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in a two-period OLG model where the probability of surviving the first period and the length of the second period can be influenced by distinct policies. While the optimal size of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> is shown to depend on the natural influence of economic development on longevity and on the extra-productivity of public spendings in terms of longevity, its optimal structure is determined by (1) differences in the productivity of each public policy; (2) how economic expansion would influence each aspect of longevity without public in-tervention; (3) the dependence of each longevity aspect on past achievements. In the presence of various competing effects, it is concluded that the optimal long-run <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> cannot, given the complementarity of different policies under standard additive expected lifetime utility, be strongly unbalanced...|$|R

These findings call for a more careful consideration of distribution of societal resources and effectiveness of public programs and policies.

We performed a clinical trial between July 2014 and December 2014 for hospitalized bacteremia patients. During the <b>intervention</b> <b>period</b> (N =  88), Verigene BC-GP and BC-GN was used along with conventional microbiological diagnostic methods, while comparing the clinical data and outcomes with those during the control period (N =  147) (UMIN registration ID: UMIN 000014399). The median duration between the initiation of blood culture incubation and the reporting time of the Verigene system results was 21. 7  h (IQR 18. 2 – 26. 8) {{and the results were}} found in 88 % of the cases by the next day after blood cultures were obtained without discordance.
