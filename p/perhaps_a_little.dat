All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland {{developed}} slowly {{in this period}} and a population of <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under a million {{by the middle of}} the 14th century began to decline after the arrival of the Black Death, falling to perhaps half a million by the beginning of the 16th century. Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions of the country as Gaelic remained the most common language north of the Tay and Middle Scots dominated in the south, where it became the language of the ruling elite, government and a new national literature. There were significant changes in religion which saw mendicant friars and new devotions expand, particularly in the developing burghs.|$|E
25|$|She {{is about}} the medium height, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> below it. Her {{forehead}} is an unusually fine one nose of a slightly Roman curve; eyes dark and piercing; mouth well-formed and remarkably pleasant in its expression. The portrait in Graham's Magazine {{is by no means}} a likeness, and, although the hair is represented as curled, (Miss Sedgwick at present wears a cap—at least, most usually,) gives her the air of being much older than she is.|$|E

25|$|In 1996–97 {{after having}} a poor time in the List A Shell/Sandals Trophy where he took only four wickets at 57.50, he was <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lucky to be chosen for the Australian tour, and he proved very {{expensive}} in the pre-Test first-class games, with aggregate figures of 4–291 in four matches. He also conceded 110 in 19 overs against Pakistan in two ODIs at Perth and Sydney. Nevertheless, he was picked against the Australians for the fourth Test at Adelaide.|$|E
25|$|The car {{was much}} lighter than its predecessor, the F2001. Powered by a 3.0 litre V10 engine {{which had a}} very low centre of gravity, the F2002 had {{excellent}} handling. The new 051 engine was not the strongest engine of 2002, but it was lighter, more compact, very fuel efficient and very driveable. Bridgestone developed special tyres, suited specifically for the car. Aerodynamically, the Ferrari was well ahead of the contemporary Williams-BMW but <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> down on power, and on a par with, or slightly ahead of the 2002 season's McLaren car.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the Ephemeris {{attributed}} to Dictys of Crete, {{who claims to}} have been present at the Trojan War, was probably written in the 1st century CE or <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> earlier. It falls into a tradition of anti-Homeric literature, based on the supposition that Homer got most things about the Trojan War wrong by making virtuous people look like villains, and vice versa. It is important because later historians took Dictys as a historical record, including Sisyphus of Cos, John Malalas, George Cedrenus, John of Antioch, and others. Many Western mediaeval writers also accepted Dictys (in the Latin summary by Lucius Septimius) as the definitive account of the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} more formal selection process {{seems to have}} been followed than for the 1900 tour but the team was still selected by representatives from Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad. The team was <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger than that of 1900 but two tours to the West Indies in 1901-02 and 1904-05 had shown again that the combined West Indies team was of quite a modest standard compared to English first-class counties. Despite this the same mistake was made as in 1900 and an overly ambitious tour programme was arranged. This included 19 matches, mostly against first-class counties. As in 1900 they suffered a series of heavy defeats early on but later in the tour had some success, particularly in heavily defeating Yorkshire. The first-class teams fielded somewhat weakened sides to make the matches more competitive but the early defeats had again limited public interest.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the road}} is still in use today, apart from a few {{sections}} {{where it has been}} diverted. The A2 road between Dover and London runs over or parallel to the old path. A section of Watling Street still exists in the City of London close to Mansion House underground station on the route of the original Roman road which traversed the River Thames via the first London Bridge and ran through the City in a straight line from London Bridge to Newgate. The sections {{of the road}} in Central London possess a variety of names, including Edgware Road and Maida Vale. At Blackheath, the Roman road ran along Old Dover Road, turning and running through the area of present-day Greenwich Park to a location <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> north of the current Deptford Bridge. The stretch between London and Shrewsbury (continuing to Holyhead) is known as the A5. Through Milton Keynes, the A5 is diverted onto a new dual carriageway; Watling Street proper remains and forms part of the Milton Keynes grid road system.|$|E

25|$|M Special Unit {{was used}} {{primarily}} to provide intelligence on Japanese naval and troop movements around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with personnel being inserted {{along the coast}} behind enemy lines where they would observe enemy movements and report back to the AIB via radio. This was invisible, unglamorous work, but there were considerable dangers involved for those involved {{and a number of}} M Special Unit members were captured by the Japanese and executed. Z Special Unit's role was <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more glamorous and certainly since the war it has received a considerable amount of publicity. Members of the unit distinguished themselves in a number of daring clandestine raiding operations often using Australian built Folding kayaks (Folboats) to penetrate enemy areas. Some of these met with limited success or failed completely. During Operation Jaywick, members of the unit posed as an Asian fishing boat crew in order to infiltrate Singapore Harbour, where it successfully mined and destroyed seven Japanese ships, amounting to 35,000 tons, in September 1943. However, in 1944 the similar but larger Operation Rimau, which also targeted shipping at Singapore Harbour, resulted in the loss of all 23 personnel involved.|$|E

500|$|In June 1890, Harrison's Postmaster General John Wanamaker {{and several}} Philadelphia friends {{purchased}} a large new cottage at Cape May Point for Harrison's wife Caroline. Many believed the cottage gift {{appeared to be}} improper and amounted to a bribe for a cabinet position. [...] Harrison made no comment on the matter until after two weeks {{when he said he}} had always intended to purchase the cottage once Caroline gave approval. On July 2, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tardily to avoid suspicion, Harrison gave Wanamaker a check for $10,000 to pay for the cottage.|$|E
500|$|Karina Longworth of The Village Voice {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, calling it [...] " [...] hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D". Peter Debruge of Variety said, [...] "Captain America: The First Avenger plays like a by-the-numbers prequel for Marvel Studios' forthcoming The Avengers movie". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter had {{mixed feelings about}} the film, writing, [...] "As the last Marvel prequel that includes two Iron Man and Incredible Hulk movies before next summer's The Avengers, this one feels <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too simplistic and routine".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Johnston of Time Out New York wrote: [...] "Like Malick's {{previous}} efforts - Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978) - Line {{is a film}} {{of incredible}} beauty. However, the atmosphere created by John Toll's breathtaking cinematography and Hans Zimmer's powerful score is occasionally compromised. The parade of cameos (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack briefly appear) is somewhat distracting, {{and the fact that}} Bell and Witt both have Appalachian accents sometimes makes the characters hard to differentiate. Yet, even though it's confusing at times (and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> long), Line is still a film of rare substance and power." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{central theme}} of The Portage {{is the nature of}} language. Rosenbaum says that Steiner's [...] "fascination and... {{distrust}} of speech, the love and hate for the power and terror of language, has been {{at the very heart of}} [...] remarkable career as literary prodigy and prodigal." [...] Steiner told Rosenbaum that [...] "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way that is <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way". Hitler's genius lay [...] "not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as [...] "mesmeric". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as [...] "a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself" [...] and that his language is [...] "like 'antimatter' to ordinary language".|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} positive. A film {{critic for the}} Los Angeles Examiner said that [...] "not since I {{reviewed}} the first Chaplin comedies {{way back in the}} two-reel days has Charlie given us such an orgy of laughs." [...] The New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall considered it [...] "a film worked out with admirable artistry". Variety declared it was [...] "not Chaplin's best picture" [...] but that certain sequences were [...] "hilarious." [...] The New Yorker wrote that it was [...] "on the order of his other , <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better than any of them" [...] and that it gave an impression [...] "not often - oh, very seldom - found in the movies; an indefinable impression perhaps best described as a quality of charm." [...] On the other hand, Alexander Bakshy of The Nation was highly critical of City Lights, objecting to the silent format and over-sentimentality and describing it as [...] "Chaplin's feeblest".|$|E
500|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in about}} 872 Harald Fairhair became King {{of a united}} Norway {{and many of his}} opponents fled to the islands of Scotland {{including}} the Hebrides of the west coast, and the Northern Isles. Harald pursued his enemies and incorporated the Northern Isles into his kingdom in 875 and then, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over a decade later, the Hebrides as well. The following year the local Viking chieftains of the Hebrides rebelled. Harald then sent Ketill Flatnose to subdue them, which he did quickly, but then he declared himself an independent [...] "King of the Isles", a title he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. Ketill [...] is also sometimes equated with Caittil Find, a reported leader of the Gallgáedil fighting in Ireland in 857, although this connection is far from definite. Ketill left no successors and there is little record of the succeeding four decades. However, Woolf (2007) suggests that his appearance in the sagas [...] "looks very much like a story created in later days to legitimise Norwegian claims to sovereignty in the region." ...|$|E
