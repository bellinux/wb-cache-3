40|$|<b>Paramethoxymethamphetamine</b> (PMMA) is a ring-substituted amphetamine, {{similar in}} {{structure}} to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) but substantially more toxic (Figure 1). 1 With nearly 50  documented deaths in Europe, Asia, Australia and Israel, PMMA {{has earned the}} street names “Death ” and “Dr. Death. ” 2 Although the drug {{has been found in}} a small fraction of ecstasy pills confiscated during drug seizures, it is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths. 3 Clin ical features include hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. 2, 4 – 8 Prior information on PMMA exposures has been limited to case reports or case series that focused on either the clinical or the postmortem features. Furthermore, descriptions of strate-gies adopted in response to outbreaks of PMMA-associated deaths are limited. Over an 11 -month period from June 2011 to April 2012, there were 27  confirmed deaths from exposure to ecstasy containing PMMA in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. We describe the clin ical features observed with fatal PMMA exposures in Alberta and BC. We also describe the public health interventions that were imple-mented in response to the deaths, to provide an overview of the different services and organizations involved.

40|$|PMA (Paramethoxyamphetamine) and PMMA (<b>Paramethoxymethamphetamine)</b> are stimulants with hallucinogenic effects {{similar to}} MDMA. However, they are toxic at lower doses than MDMA {{and can also}} take longer to take effect. After the intake of {{a small amount of}} PMA/PMMA, blood {{pressure}} and body temperature rise steeply. The effects can feel similar to MDMA, although less euphoric. Larger doses can lead to coma and death. Why should I know about PMA / PMMA? It’s always safest not to take drugs, but {{if you are going to}} take, or are planning to take ecstasy, you should know about PMA/PMMA. A number of pills recently sold as ecstasy were tested and found to contain PMA/PMMA. PMA/PMMA is similar to MDMA (the active substance in ecstasy) but can kill at lower doses as it is more poisonous. These drugs have been implicated in a number of hospitalisations and deaths. A number of people have died and their symptoms included one or more of the following: extremely high body temperature; very rapid heart rate; difficulties breathing or stopping breathing; and convulsions (fitting). Each of them thought that they were taking ecstasy and consumed several PMA/PMMA pills, assuming it to be poor quality MDMA...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{recreational}} use of psychoactive substances is common {{there is only}} limited systematic collection of data on acute drug toxicity or hospital presentations, in particular regarding novel psychoactive substances (NPS) that have emerged on the illicit market in the last years.; We included all cases presenting at the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, between October 2014 and September 2015 with acute toxicity due to self-reported recreational drug use or with symptoms/signs consistent with acute toxicity. Intoxications were confirmed using immunoassays and LC-MS/MS, detecting also novel psychoactive substances.; Among the 50 ' 624 attendances at the ED, 210 were directly related to acute toxicity of recreational drugs. The mean patient age was 33  years and 73  % were male. Analytical drug confirmation was available in 136 cases. Most presentations were reportedly related to cocaine (33  %), cannabis (32  %), and heroin (14  %). The most commonly analytically detected substances were cannabis (33  %), cocaine (27  %), and opioids excluding methadone (19  %). There were only two NPS cases; a severe intoxication with <b>paramethoxymethamphetamine</b> (PMMA) {{in combination with other}} substances and an intoxication of minor severity with 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -propylphenethylamine (2 C-P). The most frequent symptoms were tachycardia (28  %), anxiety (23  %), nausea or vomiting (18  %), and agitation (17  %). Severe complications included two fatalities, two acute myocardial infarctions, seizures (13 cases), and psychosis (six cases). Most patients (76  %) were discharged home, 10  % were admitted to intensive care, and 2  % were referred to psychiatric care.; Most medical problems related to illicit drugs concerned cocaine and cannabis and mainly included sympathomimetic toxicity and/or psychiatric disorders confirming data from the prior year. Importantly, despite the dramatic increase in various NPS being detected in the last years, these substances were infrequently associated with ED presentations compared with classic recreational drugs...|$|E
40|$|The Health Service Executive {{has issued}} a warning to drug users about a brown powder form of ecstasy, {{which may have been}} a factor in the death of two men in Kinsale, Co Cork. The HSE has cautioned about the {{substance}} in the Cork area known to contain Methylamphetamine, better known as MDMA or ecstasy, and <b>Paramethoxymethamphetamine</b> or PMMA. It said gardaí have confirmed the product may have been a factor in the deaths of Michael Coleman and Liam Coffey at the weekend. Medical professionals in the Cork area have been alerted to be vigilant, and the public is advised that the drugs carry serious health risks, particularly when combined with other drugs including alcohol. The HSE said if someone does get into difficulty after taking the substance, it is important to get help immediately. Symptoms associated with the powder include high fever, rapid heart rate and agitation. The HSE is liaising with community and voluntary groups working with drugs users in the area, and also with the gardaí. David Lane, co-ordinator of addiction services for HSE South, said the biggest concern is that anyone who uses the powder with other drugs and/or alcohol is at a higher risk of overdose. Mr Lane said the HSE first became aware of the powder when emergency services received a call on Sunday morning. He said gardaí were making good progress in tracing its origins and that tests carried out at the HSE's National Laboratory confirmed the powder contained MDMA and PMMA. A leading emergency medicine consultant has warned that frontline workers sometimes do not know what illegal substances patients have taken as they try to treat them. Dr Chris Luke said that 20 years ago there were only about six or eight different drugs available, but now there is a myriad, including those made artificially or genetically modified, which are then sold online...|$|E
