5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} emit emissions {{at different}} rates than <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles.</b> They may behave differently on the road as well, yet they are often treated similarly to <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> in emissions modeling. Although not frequently considered in calculating emission rates, differences in the operating speeds of <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> and heavy trucks may influence emissions. The main goal of this research project was to evaluate whether heavy trucks typically travel at significantly different operating speeds than <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> and what impact differences in on-road speeds would have on emissions. Average speeds and spot speeds were collected for heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> for four arterial segments and spot speeds were collected for two freeway segments in Des Moines, Iowa. Average and spot speeds were collected for four arterial segments and three freeway segments in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. The results of this research show that heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> operate differently on the road. Average and spot speeds were compared for heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> by facility. Average and spot speeds for heavy-duty trucks were lower than for <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> for all locations. Differences could have consequences for project level and regional emissions modeling particularly since the ability to demonstrate conformity {{is based on the}} ability to correctly estimate and model vehicle activity...|$|R
