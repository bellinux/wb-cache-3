40|$|Dust of {{blast furnace}} gas {{deposits}} easily {{on the bottom of}} seat sealing surface of the tri-eccentric butterfly valve, which causes serious stuck and damage of the valve plate, thereby affects blast furnace product and brings great economic loss. To reduce the dust deposition, a kind of automatic dust removal system is designed and its efficacy is simulated. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, as well as standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of the influence of 3 inlet pressures (0. 25, 0. 30, 0. 35) of working medium (N 2) in dust removal system and 2 different valve <b>plate</b> <b>jaw</b> openings (45 °, 90 °) on the dust deposition trajectory in butterfly valve region are conducted, and the influence mechanism of inlet pressure on the dust deposition is analyzed. The results show that the dust removal system can reduce the dust deposition under five combined conditions except under the condition of a valve <b>plate</b> <b>jaw</b> opening of 45 °and an inlet pressure of 0. 25 MPa. The dust removal system has much better effect under the following conditions: valve <b>plate</b> <b>jaw</b> opening of 45 ° and inlet pressure of 0. 30 MPa, or valve <b>plate</b> <b>jaw</b> opening of 90 ° and inlet pressure of 0. 25 MPa...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{stiffness}} of swing plates {{has not been}} varied with changes in rock strength. Rock strength has only been of interest {{because of the need}} to know the maximum force exerted by the toggle for energy considerations. Thus a swing plate, stiff enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (q_u) of up to 308 MPa, may be overdesigned (and, most importantly, overweight) for crushing a softer fragmental limestone, amphibolites. Design of lighter weight jaw crushers will require a more precise accounting of the stresses and deflections in the crushing plates than is available with traditional techniques. Efforts to decrease energy consumed in crushing have lead to consideration of decreasing the weight of the swing <b>plate</b> of <b>jaw</b> crushers for easily crushed material. In the present work the design of the swing <b>jaw</b> <b>plate</b> using point-load deformation failure (PDF) relationships along with interactive failure of rock particles as a model for such a weight reduction.

40|$|Many {{lungfish}} of {{the tooth}} plated lineage, both fossil and living, {{are affected by}} dental and skeletal pathologies including dental caries, abscesses and cysts within the bone or tooth plate, osteopenia, bone hypertrophy, and malocclusion. These conditions, while influenced in part by structural relationships of soft and hard tissues in the tooth <b>plates,</b> <b>jaw</b> bones and surrounding oral tissues, {{can also be used}} as indicators of the kind of environment inhabited by the fish. The disease processes have specific structural consequences, related either to the pathology or to attempts to heal the damage, and usually alter the form and function of the tooth plate or bone. Consequently they can be distinguished from postmortem diagenetic or taphonomic effects, which alter the structure in less specific ways and show no sign of healing. Dental caries, the most common pathological condition in dipnoan dentitions, is recognisable in lungfish from the Devonian of Western Australia, the Tertiary of South Australia and the Northern Territory and from living lungfish in south east Queensland.

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving <b>jaw</b> <b>plate</b> at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle <b>jaw</b> crusher. <b>Jaw</b> <b>plate</b> wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws.
