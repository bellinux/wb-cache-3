40|$|Increased {{growth rate}} and carcass lean meat yield % are key profit drivers for the lamb industry, however redistributing lean tissue to more highly priced <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carcase</b> will also {{increase}} its value. Faster growing lambs {{are known to}} be leaner and less mature at slaughter. Therefore we hypothesised that selection for growth using the Australian Sheep Breeding Value (ASBV) for greater post weaning weight (PWWT) would increase whole carcase lean weight, when animals are compared at the same carcase weight. Lamb carcases (n= 1, 218) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus were scanned in sections (fore, saddle, and hind) using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the log-linearised allometric equation logy = log a + b. logx. Fixed effects were site-year, sex sire type, birth-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. For the same carcass weight PWWT caused no composition differences, except in female lambs which had 3. 3 % more carcase lean (P< 0. 01) across the 25 unis PWWT range. Alternatively for the same fat, lean or bone weight these tissues were all proportionately heavier in the saddle region of the high PWWT lambs by 3 %, 7 %, and 16 % across the PWWT range. Aligning with our hypothesis, PWWT was associated with increased total carcase lean, although only in females. Unexpectedly, PWWT caused a redistribution of carcass tissues to the saddle region, particularly for bone and lean, implying an altered conformation in these high growth lambs. Conflicting with the premise of our hypothesis, these effects appear to be independent of maturity as there was no whole body increase in bone weight. Furthermore loin muscle myoglobin concentration in the high PWWT lambs was increased (by 0. 03 ± 0. 018 mg/g tissue) rather than decreased as would be expected in a less mature animal, In conclusion, PWWT redistributes carcase weight to the saddle region of lambs...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{lean meat}} yield % and {{redistribution}} of lean tissue to more highly priced <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carcase</b> will increase its value.

We hypothesised that selection using the PEMD-ASBV would increase saddle lean weight, without altering whole carcase lean weight when animals were compared at the same carcase weight Lamb carcases (ie 1218) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus were scanned in ‘quarters’ (fore, saddle, and hind) using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the allometric equation y=axb, fitted in its log-Iinearised form logy = log a +b. logx. Fixed effects were site-yeast sex, sire type, bulb-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. At a given carcase weight the lean tissue was 4. 2 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and fat 8. 7 % lighter in the whole carcase (P< 0. 05) across the 7 unit PEMD range. When compared at the same lean weight, the lean tissue in the saddle was 4. 9 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and lean in the forequarter was 4. 8 % lighter (P< 0. 01) across the PEMD range. Aligning with our hypothesis, there was more lean tissue in the saddle, although unexpectedly this was {{at the expense of the}} forequarter only. The mechanistic reason for this redistribution is not clear, and will be investigated with more extensive sampling from tissues across the carcase. In contrast to our hypothesis, PEMD was associated with increased total carcase lean, and reduced fat. The leaner and more muscular composition appears to be independent of maturity as there was not a corresponding increase in bone weight. These impacts on lean weight and distribution to the loin will increase carcass value...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The NSW poultry {{processing}} industry {{has gone through}} an evolution of regulatory change over the past 100 years from an inspection system through to a HACCP-based food safety system audited by the NSW Food Safety Authority (FSA). This required the restructuring of legislation {{and an understanding of}} the appropriate microbiological standards by which the FSA could judge the effectiveness of the operator’s processing operation. This microbiological standard was developed following two surveys of the vast majority of registered poultry processors in NSW. These surveys demonstrated the microbiological outcomes that could be achieved by the processors. From this knowledge, a new standard for the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on product were established that were to be used by the operator and the regulator to judge the effectiveness of the operator’s program. Studies into the carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry in the plant and on the reliability of the microbiological tests being used within the survey and by industry were carried out. They found {{that there had been a}} significant reduction in carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry from 48. 6 % to 34. 2 % over two years. The test method utilised in the survey and one utilised by the Australian industry were shown to be able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium at 1 - 3 CFU per ml <b>of</b> <b>carcase</b> rinse fluid. An examination of E. coli by PCR to determine the likelihood that E. coli carried by NSW poultry were capable of inducing Haemorrhagic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) found no evidence of shigatoxin producing genes (stx 1 or stx 2) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli specific plasmid (ehxA). The attachment factor, intimin (eaeA) was found in E. coli from 93 <b>of</b> 430 <b>carcases</b> (21. 6 %). Campylobacter species were found on 94 % <b>of</b> all <b>carcases</b> in the first survey. A count of Campylobacter species on a series <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> from one plant found an average of 163 CFU per cm 2 on the broiler chickens tested. Because raw poultry carry pathogens from the processing plant into the wider community, the use of two post-chill sanitisers was examined. This study found that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of pathogens being carried by raw poultry. The use of post-chill sanitisers provides a potential means of reducing the risk of foodborne illness arising from the handling of raw poultry and eating undercooked poultry meat...|$|R

We investigated the relationship between EUROP class and eating quality. Six cuts (the Striploin, Outside, Rump, Tenderloin, Oyster blade and the Topside) from 18 French cattle were grilled, medium or rare. In total, 540 untrained French consumers rated the steaks for Tenderness, Flavour, Juiciness and Overall Liking, according to MSA protocols, and these scores were combined on a weighted basis (0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 1, 0. 3 respectively) to make a fifth term called Meat Quality score (MQ 4). During processing the cattle were graded using the European ‘EUROP’ and ‘Carcase Fatness’ systems. The sensory scores were analysed using a mixed linear model with cut, age and EUROP score included as fixed effects, and animal ID as a random term. Due to the low numbers <b>of</b> animals, <b>Carcase</b> Fatness scores were selected from the limited range of 3 -, 3 = and 3 + and hence do not significantly influence eating quality. In all cases, the sensory scores differed between the EUROP classes. However, these differences followed no clear linear trend across EIJROP classes within any of the cuts tested.
