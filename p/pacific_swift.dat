5|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> feeds {{exclusively}} on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand, {{and it is a}} very rare vagrant in Europe, where it has been recorded in Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift,</b> has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift,</b> but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E
5|$|The calls {{given by}} flocks near the {{breeding}} areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled tsiririri or harsher spee-eer. They resemble {{the cries of}} the common swift, but are softer and less wheezy. <b>Pacific</b> <b>swifts</b> are less vocal on the wintering grounds, but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes.|$|R

60|$|Of all {{craft of}} the canoe order, the flying-proa of the <b>Pacific</b> is the <b>swiftest.</b> It carries a sail almost {{triangular}} in shape, and a straight yard. It has an outrigger; and outrigger, mast, and yard are of bamboo. Strong matting composes the sail, which is stretched very flat upon the yard. When the crew wish {{to put their}} boat about they have merely to shift the sail, when what was before the prow of the proa becomes the stern. These boats are usually manned by a crew of about half-a-dozen. One man sits {{at either end of}} the vessel and takes his turn of steering according to whatever tack the canoe is on. The duty of the rest is to bail out the boat and to keep the sail properly trimmed.|$|R
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus pacificus) is a bird which breeds {{in eastern}} Asia. This swift is {{strongly}} migratory, spending the northern hemisphere's winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative, the common swift, {{from which it}} is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts. The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift's main call is a screech typical of its family. It {{is one of a}} group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E
5|$|As a {{powerful}} long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds {{have been recorded}} from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and Macquarie Island, {{and there have been}} multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands; a claimed 2010 sighting from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed countries had a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn, East Yorkshire and may refer to one returning individual.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E
500|$|The swifts {{form the}} bird family Apodidae, which {{is divided into}} several genera. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> is in the Old World genus Apus, which is characterised by dark, glossy plumage, a forked tail and sharply pointed wings. Until recently, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> was {{considered}} to have five subspecies, but three have now been elevated to full species status {{as part of a}} [...] "fork-tailed swift" [...] superspecies. The proposed name of the superspecies was formerly a synonym for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift.</b>|$|E
500|$|A mainly aerial species, this swift is {{not limited}} to {{particular}} land habitats or climatic zones; it breeds from the Arctic to sub-tropical China, and from sea level to at least [...] in Japan. It is often found around human habitation. It tends to winter in lowlands, and in Australia it is found in arid areas as well as in towns and on the coast. Flocks of thousands may appear when there are hot strong winds. Pacific swifts often travel and feed with white-throated needletails. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> probably sleeps in flight when not nesting, behaviour known to occur in the common swift and suspected in other Apus species, but there is an Australian record of these swifts roosting in a tree, and they are occasionally seen to land briefly on the ground or on vertical surfaces.|$|E
500|$|At [...] in length, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>swift</b> is {{the largest}} of the Apus swifts. It has a 43–54-cm (17–21-in) wingspan. Females are {{slightly}} heavier than males, averaging [...] against [...] It is similar in general shape to the common swift, although slightly longer-winged and with a more protruding head. The fork of the tail is deeper, and the rump is broader. The upperparts are black, apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head. The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown. The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black. The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the wings. The southern subspecies, A. p. kurodae, has a narrower white rump (15mm/0.6in against the nominate form's 20mm/0.8in), a grey throat and blacker underparts. Juveniles of migratory Apus swifts have a partial moult prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.|$|E
