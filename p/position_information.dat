25|$|To {{perform a}} study, {{the person is}} {{positioned}} within an MRI scanner that forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged. In most medical applications, protons (hydrogen atoms) in tissues containing water molecules create a signal that is processed to form {{an image of the}} body. First, energy from an oscillating magnetic field temporarily is applied to the patient at the appropriate resonance frequency. The excited hydrogen atoms emit a radio frequency signal, which is measured by a receiving coil. The radio signal may be made to encode <b>position</b> <b>information</b> by varying the main magnetic field using gradient coils. As these coils are rapidly switched on and off they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. Exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally, or intra-articularly.|$|E
25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate <b>position</b> <b>information</b> service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E
500|$|For a {{traditionally}} trained navigator, these inputs include physical {{signals from the}} sea, skies, and stars, memory signals from his knowledge of star, swell, and wind compasses; and cultural knowledge recorded in chants, dances, and stories. Examples of physical signals include the color, temperature, and taste (salinity) of seawater; floating plant debris; sightings of land-based seabirds flying out to fish; cloud type, color, and movement; wind direction, speed, and temperature; the direction and nature of ocean swells and waves; the position of stars in the sky, and his estimation of the speed, current set, and leeway of his sailing craft. The [...] "compass" [...] he carried was not magnetic but a mental model of where islands are located and the star points that one could use to navigate between them. This mental model would have taken years of study to build; dances, chants (rong), and stories help him to recall complex relationships of geography and location. The stars give him highly reliable <b>position</b> <b>information</b> when visible, but navigators such as Mau managed to keep their position and tracks in mind even when blocked by clouds, using other references such as wind and swell as proxies.|$|E

The {{goal of a}} claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three-dimensional shapes. However, the vast number of catoms in this distributed network increases complexity of micro-management of each individual catom. So, each catom must perceive accurate <b>position</b> <b>information</b> and command of cooperation with its neighbors. In this environment, software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high-level commands {{in order to be}} universally distributed. [...] Languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as C++ and Java.|$|E

2500|$|Further to this {{evidence}} that the UK stock market is weak-form efficient, other studies of capital markets have pointed toward their being semi-strong-form efficient. [...] A study by Khan of the grain futures market indicated semi-strong form efficiency following the release of large trader <b>position</b> <b>information</b> (Khan, 1986). Studies by Firth (1976, 1979, and 1980) in the United Kingdom have compared the share prices existing after a takeover announcement with the bid offer. [...] Firth found that the share prices were fully and instantaneously adjusted to their correct levels, thus concluding that the UK stock market was semi-strong-form efficient. [...] However, the market's ability to efficiently respond to a short term, widely publicized event such as a takeover announcement does not necessarily prove market efficiency related to other more long term, amorphous factors. David Dreman has criticized the evidence provided by this instant [...] "efficient" [...] response, pointing out that an immediate response is not necessarily efficient, and that the long-term performance of the stock in response to certain movements are better indications.|$|E

40|$|The {{positioning}} of vehicles in rail traffic plays {{a significant role}} in the system safety, since the <b>positioning</b> <b>information</b> is used for the train separation and train control. The basis for giving a route to a train is the safe track-vacancy proving. This again needs an integrity check and safe train end identification on board of the train. Therefore, the generation of <b>positioning</b> <b>information</b> is a safety relevant function. Safety critical requirements arising from the criticality of the information are accuracy, reliability, integrity and availability of the <b>positioning</b> <b>information</b> that are to be demonstrated according to the new CENELEC standards EN 50126 and 50129 with the safety integrity level 3 or 4, which are the highest levels used in the area of railways.

In order to make the railway transport competitive in comparison to other transport modes cost efficiency is a necessity, both in acquisition and maintenance, but also in operation. Therefore a future oriented positioning system should operate in a vehicle autonomous mode. There are several approaches to...|$|R
