5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 <b>pounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of pizza cheese is consumed annually.

5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 <b>pounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{distribution}} of black carbon (BC) and its correlation with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (I PAH) <b>pound</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surface sediments of China's marginal seas. BC content ranges from < 0. 10 to 2. 45 mg/g dw (grams dry weight) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediments studied, and varied among the different coastal regions. The Bohai Bay sediments had the highest BC contents (average 2. 18 mg/g dw), which comprises a significant fraction (27 %- 41 %) of the total organic carbon (TOC) preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediments. <b>In</b> comparison, BC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surface sediments of the North Yellow Sea, Jiaozhou Bay, East China Sea and the South China Sea is less abundant and accounted {{for an average of}} 6 %, 8 %, 14 % and 5 %, respectively, of the sedimentary organic carbon pool. The concentration of I PAH <b>pound</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surface sediments ranges from 41 to 3 667 ng/g dw and showed large spatial variations among the sampling sites of different costal regions. The Bohai Bay has the highest I PAH pound values, ranging from 79 to 3 667 ng/g dw. This reflects the high anthropogenically contaminated nature of <b>the</b> sediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay.

25|$|The Canon de 4 Gribeauval or 4-pounder was a French cannon {{and part}} of the {{artillery}} system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The Old French pound (French: livre) was 1.079 English pounds, making the weight of shot about 4.3 English <b>pounds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Gribeauval era, the 4-pounder was the lightest weight cannon of the French field artillery; the others were the medium Canon de 8 Gribeauval and the heavy Canon de 12 Gribeauval. The Gribeauval system was introduced in 1765 and the guns were first employed during the American Revolutionary War. The most large-scale use of Gribeauval guns occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At first a pair of 4-pounders were assigned to each infantry battalion and were often called battalion pieces. Later, Emperor Napoleon took the guns away from the infantry units and began to replace the 4-pounder with the 6-pounder, using captured guns as well as newly cast French cannons. However, as the French infantry declined in quality after 1809, the 4-pounders were reintroduced in order to provide direct support for formations of foot soldiers. All Gribeauval cannons were capable of firing canister shot at close-range and round shot at long-range targets. The Gribeauval system supplanted the older Vallière system, was partly replaced by the Year XI system in 1803 and completely superseded by the Valée system in 1829.|$|E
