It {{was found that}} about half of the samples show a strong dichroic effect and another 20 % have a weak dichroism. Both regular (80 %) and inversed dichroic effects (20 %) occur. The dichroic characteristics of pigmented fibres can be compared to these of sheet polarizers. It is suggested that the dichroic behaviour of pigmented fibres depends strongly on the crystal structure (shape of the pigment grains) and the draw ratio (orientation of the polymer chains).

40|$|Naturally {{coloured}} cotton {{is naturally}} <b>pigmented</b> <b>fibre</b> that grows {{in shades of}} brown and green. Because the colour {{is present in the}} fibres, fabrics made of them {{do not have to be}} dyed. The elimination of the dyeing process can save up to one half of the cost of preparing textiles and also lowers disposal costs for toxic dye waste dangerous to human health and the environment. In spite of the economic and ecological benefits resulting from the elimi-nation of the dying process, the application of the naturally coloured cotton in the world textile industry is still limited. The low quality of fibres is considered as the most important reason for the limitation of naturally coloured cotton application. The aim of the work pre-sented was to investigate the quality of naturally coloured cotton of different origin as well as to show the potential of the naturally coloured cotton as an excellent raw material for manufacturing ecological textiles of good quality and attractive design.

40|$|Considerable {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} by the Australian wool industry regarding the contamination of the clip with coloured or kempy fibres from imported breeds of sheep. As part of the evaluation of imported sheep meat breeds in western Queensland, a study is examining fibre growth and transfer of fibres and the potential to cause physical contamination of Merino fleeces. The breeds of concern {{in this study are}} the Damara, a fat-tailed breed with a hairy, coloured fleece and the Dorper which has both <b>pigmented</b> <b>fibres</b> and a kempy fleece which is shed cyclically. Three groups of Merino 27 ewes were mated to Merino, Damara and Dorper rams respectively and fibre transfer to the Merino ewes during mating, from lambing to weaning and during grazing, assessed. Both a direct field method and a laboratory method (Hatcher 1995) are being used. Those measured by direct count were measured immediately after joining and 2, 4 and 8 weeks subsequently. and the other ewes were shorn and sampled and measured in the laboratory using the dark fibre detector. This paper presents preliminary findings of those ewes monitored by the direct field method.

Our objective was to assess alternative models for genetic analysis of presence (BINBS) and number (NUMBS) of black spots in Corriedale sheep. During 2002 - 08, 5624 records from 2839 animals in two flocks, aged 1 through 6 years, were taken at shearing. Four models were considered: linear and probit for BINBS and linear and Poisson for NUMBS. All models included flock-year and age as fixed effects and animal and permanent environmental as random effects. Models were fitted to the whole data set and were also compared based on their predictive ability in cross-validation. Estimates of heritability ranged from 0. 154 to 0. 230 for BINBS and 0. 269 to 0. 474 for NUMBS. For BINBS, the probit model fitted slightly better to the data than the linear model. Predictions of random effects from these models were highly correlated, and both models exhibited similar predictive ability. For NUMBS, the Poisson model, with a residual term to account for overdispersion, performed better than the linear model in goodness of fit and predictive ability. Predictions of random effects from the Poisson model were more strongly correlated with those from BINBS models than those from the linear model. Overall, the use of probit or linear models for BINBS and of a Poisson model with a residual for NUMBS seems a reasonable choice for genetic selection purposes in Corriedale sheep...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{to provide}} wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) with colouration and UV-protection, pigments are added {{in powder form}} or pre-dispersed in a polymer matrix (masterbatch) during compounding. Usually, the wood particles are not coloured prior to compounding, although this may improve the colour stability of the WPC. In this research project, two types of pigments were used to pre-colour thermo-mechanical pulp: an aqueous inorganic pigment preparation based on iron oxide and a water-based preparation of organic and inorganic <b>pigments.</b> Pre-coloured <b>fibres</b> were mixed with high-density polyethylene and maleic-anhydride grafted-PE in a kneading mixer and injection-moulded. As a reference, uncoloured fibres were mixed with pigments. Colour stability of the WPC was determined as DeltaE* after 400 h of Xenon weathering. Pre-treatment of the fibres alone was not sufficient to improve colour stability of WPC. However, the use of fibres pre-treated with inorganic iron oxide pigments in combination with a pigment masterbatch to colour the polymer matrix resulted in a significant reduction of DeltaE* compared to when either pre-coloured fibres only or uncoloured <b>fibres</b> plus <b>pigment</b> were used. The mixture of organic and inorganic pigments was less effective in improving colour stability than the application of inorganic pigments only. Flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of WPC with coloured fibres were slightly reduced compared to WPC with uncoloured fibres. Water uptake was higher for WPC with organic pigments than for WPC with inorganic <b>pigments</b> only. <b>Fibre</b> pre-colouration appears useful to obtain WPC with low colour change {{as a result of}} weathering...|$|R

Isolated fibre necrosis or vacuolar degeneration {{was found in}} 3 biopsies and increased numbers of internal nuclei in 5 biopsies. A high glycogen content was demonstrated in many fibres in each biopsy by the PAS method and by electron microscopy. Routine enzyme histochemical techniques showed hypertrophy of type I and type II fibres in 2 subjects, hypertrophy of type I fibres only in 2 subjects, atrophy of both fibre types in 2 subjects and atrophy of type II fibres only in 4 subjects. Electron microscopy showed large amounts of lipfuscin <b>pigment</b> in many <b>fibres</b> while some fibres had large sarcolemmal nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and a prominent Golgi apparatus.

A textile conservator, technical art historian and paintings conservator, and materials scientist have joined forces to develop {{a greater understanding of}} the potential of analytical findings in the identification of materials. Results: Visual examination using low level magnification and microscopy proved to be a crucial starting point and for identification of areas for further analysis. High magnification microscopy of cross sections was invaluable to gather information regarding the build-up of the layers, their interaction and condition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of ion-milled samples showed that different areas of the banner had been prepared in different ways.

Presence of materials such as silk and lead white dominated some analysis making interpretation of other materials more difficult. Conclusions: Sample preparation had a significant bearing on the effectiveness of the analysis. Ion-milling provided high quality surface on the cross section samples that enabled material interfaces to be clearly seen. The challenges of finding effective wavelengths for analysis of samples using Raman were clearly evident in this study. Microscopy showed fibres blends, easily missed using FTIR, whereas FTIR was particularly effective in the identification of man-made fibres. While portable instrumentation may be useful, for in-depth understanding of the heterogeneous layered materials sample taking still remains crucial. Commercial makers used many typical grounds and pigments but these were used sparingly, in thin layers, in order to produce a flexible object and also perhaps to reduce costs. The textile was however of high quality, in this case silk. Unexpectedly, the preparation layers {{do not appear to be}} consistent across the banner; the reasons for this need further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of defined polymers with polyethylene oxide backbone. The basic monomer is glycidol and its protected derivatives. Protected glycidols such as allyl glycidyl ether, tert. butyl glycidyl ether and especially ethoxyethyl glycidyl ether give linear polymers which can me modified chemically in a second step. The first area of research {{with this kind of}} polymers was dying of keratine fibres and cotton with pigments. In industry, dye molecules are incorporated into a fibre, while the coloring is established by permanent linking of these. If covered to a surface, the dye may be rinsed too easily; to avoid this problem, a statistical copolymer made of allyl glycidyl ether and ethoxyethyl glycidyl ether is taken and modified to a cationic polymer by appropriate methods; the final polymer works as an adhesive between <b>pigment</b> and <b>fibre.</b> The general adhesion to human hair, wool and cotton is investigated, results show that adhesion decreases in the order cotton - wool - hair. The second area of research deals with synthesis and chemophycial behaviour of block copolymers. The used blockcopolymers are synthesized of ethoxyethyl glycidyl ether and phenyl glycidyl ether, with total chain lengths in a range of 10 to 20 repeat units. Short blockcopolymers are easy to dissolve and may be used as surfactants for stabilizing of emulsions. The solubility was increased by modification of free alcohol groups to carboxymethyl groups. Stabilization of carbon black in aqueous medium was shown on semi-industrial scale. Witzh longer blocks and increased concentrations, more and more interactions occur, and self-assembly is expected. This is used in the third area of research, to obtain a defined structure on surfaces. Therefor, block copolymers of ethoxyethyl glycidyl ether and aliphatic epoxides are synthesized (with subsequent hydrolysis). The aliphatic side chains constist of 10, 12, 14 and 16 carbon atoms. Thsi gives a sufficient difference in polarity of the blocks, and the longer side chains are able to crystallize. The found structures in this work are cylinders, which are orientated parallel to the substrate surface (silicium wafers). In the last area, it is investigated if an incorporation of aldehyd groups to a linear polyglycidol is possible. The aim is the linkage of polypeptides to polymers. With the used copolymers (block and random) made of allyl glycidol ether and ethoxyethyl glycidyl ether or tert. butyl glycidyl ether it was tried if as many aldehyd groups as possibel may be generated, to end up with high degree of crosslinking even at low conversions. Synthetically, allyl groups of the polymers were treated with ozon to obtain aldehyde groups, as well as etherification of free OH groups of polyglycidol wit 2 -bromomethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane to yield a protected aldehyde group. It was found, that both reations are not very successful...|$|R
40|$|Human hair {{profiling}} is {{an integral}} part of a forensic investigation but it is one of the most technically difficult subjects in forensic science. This thesis describes the research and development of a novel approach for the rapid identification of unknown human and other related keratin fibres found at a crime scene. The work presented here is developed systematically and considers sample collection, sample preparation, analysis and interpretation of spectral data for the profiling of hair fibres encountered in criminal cases. Spectral comparison of fibres was facilitated with the use of chemometrics methods such as PCA, SIMCA and Fuzzy Clustering, and the less common approach of multi-criteria decision making methodology (MCDM). The aim of the thesis was to investigate the potential of some vibrational spectroscopy techniques for matching and discrimination of single keratin hair fibres in the context of forensic evidence. The first objective (chapter 3) of the thesis was to evaluate the use of Raman and FT-IR micro-spectroscopy techniques for the forensic sampling of hair fibres and to propose the preferred technique for future forensic hair comparisons. The selection of the preferred technique was based on criteria such as spectral quality, ease of use, rapid analysis and universal application to different hair samples. FT-IR micro-spectroscopy was found to be the most appropriate technique for hair analysis because it enabled the rapid collection of spectra from a wide variety of hair fibres. Raman micro-spectroscopy, on the other hand, was hindered with fluorescence problems and did not allow the collection of spectra from <b>pigmented</b> <b>fibres.</b> This objective has therefore shown that FT-IR micro-spectroscopy is the preferable spectroscopic technique for forensic analysis of hair fibres, whilst Raman spectroscopy is the least preferred. The second objective (chapter 3) was to investigate, through a series of experiments, the effect of chemical treatment on the micro-environment of human hair fibres. The effect of bleaching agents on the hair fibres was studied with some detail at different treatment times and the results indicate a significant change in the chemical environment of the secondary structure of the hair fibre along with changes in the C-C backbone structure. One of the most important outcomes of this research was the behaviour of the fÃ‘-helix during chemical treatment. The hydrogen bonding in the fÃ‘-helix provides for the stable structure of the fibre and therefore any disruption to the fÃ‘-helix will inevitably damage the molecular structure of the fibre. The results highlighted the behaviour of the fÃ‘-helix, which undergoes a significant decrease in content during oxidation, and is partly converted to a random-coil structure, whilst the fÃ’-sheet component of the secondary structure remains unaffected. The reported investigations show that the combination of FT-IR and Raman micro-spectroscopy can provide an insight and understanding into the complex chemical properties and reactions within a treated hair fibre. Importantly, this work demonstrates that with the aid of chemometrics, it is possible to investigate simultaneously FT-IR and Raman micro-spectroscopic information from oxidised hair fibres collected from one subject and treated at different times. The discrimination and matching of hair fibres on the basis of treatment has potential forensic applications. The third objective (chapter 4) attempted to expand the forensic application of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy to other keratin fibres. Animal fibres are commonly encountered in crime scenes and it thus becomes important to establish the origin of those fibres. The aim of this work was to establish the forensic applications of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy to animal fibres and to investigate any fundamental molecular differences between these fibres. The results established a discrimination between fibres consisting predominantly of fÃ‘-helix and those containing mainly a fÃ’-sheet structure. More importantly, it was demonstrated through curve-fitting and chemometrics, that each keratin fibre contains a characteristic secondary structure arrangement. The work presented here is the first detailed FT-IR micro-spectroscopic study, utilising chemometrics as well as MCDM methods, for a wide range of keratin fibres, which are commonly, found as forensic evidence. Furthermore, it was demonstrated with the aid of the rank ordering MCDM methods PROMETHEE and GAIA, that it is possible to rank and discriminate keratin fibres according to their molecular characteristics obtained from direct measurements together with information sourced from the literature. The final objective (chapter 5) of the thesis was to propose an alternative method for the discrimination and matching of single scalp human hair fibres through the use of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy and chemometrics. The work successfully demonstrated, through a number of case scenarios, the application of the technique for the identification of variables such as gender and race for an unknown single hair fibre. In addition, it was also illustrated that known hair fibres (from the suspect or victim) can be readily matched to the unknown hair fibres found at the crime scene. This is the first time that a substantial, systematic FT-IR study of forensic hair identification has been presented. The research has shown that it is possible to model and correlate individualÂ¡Â¦s characteristics with hair properties at molecular level with the use of chemometrics methods. A number of different, important forensic variables of immediate use to police in a crime scene investigation such as gender, race, treatment, black and white hair fibres were investigated. Blind samples were successfully applied both to validate available experimental data and extend the current database of experimental determinations. Protocols were posed for the application of this methodology in the future. The proposed FT-IR methodology presented in this thesis has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of single scalp human hair fibres. The technique enables the rapid collection of spectra, followed by the objective analytical capabilities of chemometrics to successfully discriminate animal fibres, human hair fibres from different sources, treated from untreated hair fibres, as well as black and white hair fibres, on the basis of their molecular structure. The results can be readily produced and explained in the courts of law. Although the proposed relatively fast FT-IR technique is not aimed at displacing the two slower existing methods of hair analysis, namely comparative optical microscopy and DNA analysis, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of hair fibres at a molecular level, providing a powerful tool for forensic investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} forest products, such as paper, {{packaging and}} viscose products, have their well-established place, but further efforts urgently {{need to be}} made to meet growing ecological demands, increasing economic pressure and to develop new technologies for utilisation of high performance materials. Nanocellulose applied in paper making suspensions and as water retention control aids may introduce additional strength properties in traditional products, and when considered for coatings may deliver oil and gas barrier properties as well as targeted liquid interactions based on surface energy criteria and designed pore and gel network structures. The properties increase the potential for their use in a broad range of novel products. The processes, firstly by which nanocellulose is both created, as part of cellulose structures in nature, and subsequently produced determine their aqueous suspension rheology and dewatering behaviour, and thus, by using knowledge of their rheological behaviour when utilised in complex suspensions, will support the creation of new controls in water-based production processes. The use of rheology for the characterisation of nanocellulose suspensions and their applications in a range of industries as diverse as the oil and papermaking industries {{has been the subject of}} numerous studies in recent years. Although many studies have been conducted relating to papermaking furnishes and their water suspensions while including nanocellulose containing materials, these rheological investigations were conducted independently from conditions of dynamic dewatering. For the first time, this work sets out to observe and try to overcome experimental difficulties related to rheometry and dynamic dewatering of high consistency viscoelastic gel-like nanocellulose suspensions using a variety of experimental techniques and methods. Once reliable rheological measurements were designed and the methodology established, the work goes on to analyse the possible structures attained by nanocellulose containing suspensions in combination with macroscopic <b>fibres,</b> <b>pigments</b> and fibril dispersing polymers, which traditionally are used as pigment flocculant water retention aids. These analyses are used to support and challenge the basic hypotheses of the thesis in relation to the impact these structures will have on properties such as process applicability, phase separation, substrate coverage, coating and material uniformity. ...|$|R
