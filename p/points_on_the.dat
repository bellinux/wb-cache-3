That particular defeat stunned him so much, he considered retiring Inter County football.|$|E
5|$|A 45-goal {{season in}} 1989–90 {{was enough for}} Nieuwendyk to lead the team in goal scoring for the third {{consecutive}} season. He missed he first 11 games of the 1991–92 NHL season after suffering a knee injury during a summer evaluation camp for the 1991 Canada Cup. Nieuwendyk began the season as the 12th captain in the Flames franchise history. He was limited to 22 goals and 56 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> season, but scored his 200th career goal on December 3, 1991, against the Detroit Red Wings. His 230th career goal, scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning on November 13, 1992, established a Flames franchise record for career goals (since broken).|$|E

5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Borneo, {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic <b>points</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo. This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E
5|$|Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell {{completed}} 11 of 16 {{passes for}} 189yards, one touchdown, and one interception, {{and was named}} the game's most valuable player. Despite his performance, he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game. Auburn kicker John Vaughn was successful on all three of his field goal attempts and also succeeded on his sole extra point kick in the game, resulting in 10Auburn <b>points.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite side of the}} ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38passes for 299yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Virginia Tech kicker Branden Pace missed his sole field goal attempt of the game, a 23-yard kick.|$|E
5|$|Burrows had a forgettable 2013–14 season, scoring only 5 {{goals and}} 10 assists. In 49 games played, {{he did not}} score until game 36, where he potted two goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His 15 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> year were the third-lowest of his career and his lowest since 2006–07.

In the NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament, Engen scored two goals and recorded an assist against High Point University in the first round. In addition, she had goals in matches against Ohio State, Duke, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in the second round.

5|$|Gélinas {{chose to}} decline his {{contract}} option for 2002–03 and left Carolina {{as a free}} agent. He {{signed a contract with}} the Calgary Flames on July 2, 2002. A 52-point season was fourth best on the Flames and included his 500th career point, a game-winning goal against the Detroit Red Wings on January 25, 2003. Gélinas reached another career milestone during the 2003–04 season as he played in his 1,000th NHL game on December 9 against the Minnesota Wild.

5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced.

More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all <b>points</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production-possibilities curve.
