40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{differences in the}} continuing development of National Board Certified Science Teachers' (NBCSTs) conceptions of inquiry across the disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. The central research question of the study was, "How does a NBCST's science discipline (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics) influence their conceptions, enactment, and goals for inquiry-based teaching and learning?" A mixed methods approach was used that included {{an analysis of the}} National Board <b>portfolio</b> <b>entry,</b> Active Scientific Inquiry, for participants (n= 48) achieving certification in the 2007 cohort. The <b>portfolio</b> <b>entry</b> provided detailed documentation of teachers' goals and enactment of an inquiry lesson taught in their classroom. Based on the results from portfolio analysis, participant interviews were conducted with science teachers (n= 12) from the 2008 NBCST cohort who represented the science disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. The interviews provided a broader range of contexts to explore teachers' conceptions, enactment, and goals of inquiry. Other factors studied were disciplinary differences in NBCSTs' views of the nature of science, the relation between their science content knowledge and use of inquiry, and changes in their conceptions of inquiry as result of the NB certification process. Findings, based on a situated cognitive framework, suggested that differences exist between biology, chemistry, and earth science teachers' conceptions, enactment, and goals for inquiry. Further, individuals teaching in more than one discipline often held different conceptions of inquiry depending on the discipline in which they were teaching. Implications for the research community include being aware of disciplinary differences in studies on inquiry and exercising caution in generalizing findings across disciplines. In addition, teachers who teach in more than one discipline can highlight the contextual and culturally based nature of teachers' conceptions of inquiry. For the education community, disciplinary differences should be considered in the development of curriculum and professional development. An understanding of disciplinary trends can allow for more targeted and relevant representations of inquiry...|$|E

40|$|Consolidation in {{the banking}} {{industry}} of many countries has {{reduced the number of}} small banks and led to significant shifts in market shares; deregulation has fostered entry in local credit markets and branch expansion, which in turn have increased competition.

In this paper we investigate the consequences of consolidation and entry for these borrowers compared with those for large firms. We employ a data set for Italy, which provides information on volumes of loans and bad loans by size of borrower with a detailed geographical partition.

Aim of the project: In a newly developed elective medical students work on physician-patient conversations dealing with drug prescription. Essential aspects related to an effective and safe drug treatment are combined with steps of shared decision-making. Together with a tutor, students develop a (model) conversation guide that might be tailored according to individual needs and views.

This study seeks to {{investigate}} portfolio implementation at Turkish university preparatory schools and the reported aims of portfolio use as targeted by these schools. The study further examines teachers‟ perceptions of portfolio use, specifically, the problems they experience with portfolio use, possible sources of these problems and their suggestions on how portfolio use can be improved. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases. In the first phase, data on portfolio use and aims of its use were collected through a questionnaire administered at seven university preparatory schools. In the second phase, data on teachers‟ perceptions were gathered through a second questionnaire administered to 126 teachers at five of the seven preparatory schools. The results reached in {{the first phase of the}} study revealed that portfolios are mainly used for the writing component of the preparatory programs. The analyses of the data also revealed that certain key features of portfolios, such as student participation in the selection of portfolio content, self assessment, and student reflection, are not generally included in portfolios at preparatory programs. Regarding the aims of portfolio use targeted by schools, the results indicate that in order to achieve the intended aims, the missing key elements of portfolios should be included. The results reached in the second phase of the study indicate that teachers perceive portfolios as an appropriate tool for assessment purposes. When the results regarding teachers‟ experiences with portfolio use are examined, the outcomes indicate that the problems experienced with portfolio use are in large part felt to be related to students‟ attitudes towards portfolios, which are themselves caused by students‟ study habits and previous educational backgrounds. It was also revealed that problems related to <b>portfolio</b> <b>entries</b> and institutional practices create some challenges in portfolio implementation at schools. Kılıç, EmineM. S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the era of}} {{globalisation}} {{with the}} rapid development of science and technology, the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for language learning {{has become one of}} the prominent challenges in language teaching, including in the Indonesian context (Kariman 2005). This study aims to investigate how online portfolios as part of ICT tools could be used to facilitate the learning of EFL writing in an Indonesian EFL writing class. This study is concerned with my own teaching experiences due to the growing demand for teachers’ competence to integrate technology for the purpose of facilitating students’ learning. The implementation of the online portfolio over one semester was examined through action research. Students’ experiences in learning EFL writing using the online portfolio were explored with regards to their writing skills development, learner autonomy and motivation. In addition to the action research, the study drew on case study and ethnographic approaches. As for methods for generating data, this study involved questionnaires, interviews, teacher’s reflective journals, and an analysis of online <b>portfolio</b> <b>entries.</b> The findings of the study show that the online portfolios have been beneficial in developing students’ EFL writing skills. Concerning learner autonomy, the online portfolios have facilitated students’ to develop their metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive strategies, social strategies, and critical thinking. As for students’ motivation, the findings of the current study suggest that the use of a blog as the online portfolio platform and the online portfolio elements comprising self-revising, feedback activities and reflection enhanced students’ motivation to learn how to write. They achieved this by raising students’ expectation of success in their learning, making students feel comfortable in working with their writing tasks, and challenging students to write to a higher standard as their writings were published online, read and commented on by others. Moreover, the study suggests that the success of the online portfolio implementation in facilitating students’ learning of EFL writing requires teachers’ understandings of their own roles as well as their willingness to undertake and develop their roles as facilitators in an e-learning environment. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{frontline}} clinicians, junior doctors (trainees) {{are being}} increasingly recognised as powerful agents {{for change in}} improving patient safety. However, routine postgraduate medical education (PGME) offers little opportunity for trainees to develop the requisite knowledge and skills to advance safety improvement efforts. This thesis aims {{to build on the}} evidence base for patient safety education by developing and evaluating educational interventions informed by users, the existing literature, and educational theory. Section One (Chapters 1 to 3) sets the context for the thesis, providing an introduction to patient safety, relevant educational theory, and the role of education and engagement in improving patient safety. Subsequently, Section Two reports exploratory research to inform the development of a patient safety course for Foundation trainees – junior doctors at the very start of their careers. A systematic review reveals how the UK lags behind international efforts to deliver patient safety education for trainees, and highlights the need to address barriers to its sustainable integration into medical curricula (Chapter 4). An analysis of Foundation trainees’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>entries</b> demonstrates the feasibility of using patient safety incidents (PSIs) experienced by trainees as the basis for learning about patient safety (Chapter 5). Drawing on these findings, Section Three reports the development and evaluation of ‘Lessons Learnt: Building a Safer Foundation’. This is a novel patient safety programme designed to formalise the opportunity for all 1000 + trainees across a Foundation School to learn from PSIs in a structured, facilitated forum. The development and delivery of the programme is first described (Chapter 6), followed by empirical studies to develop senior faculty (Chapter 7), and to evaluate the impact of the programme on trainees’ learning both qualitatively (Chapter 8) and quantitatively (Chapter 9). In Section Four, a different approach is taken to explore non-technical skills (NTS) training for more senior trainees. A tri-continental interview study of 33 surgical team members underlines the need to improve debriefing as a core NTS in Surgery and explores the user perspective on effective debriefing in surgical training (Chapter 10). These findings are used to inform the development of the ‘SHARP 5 -Step Feedback Tool for Surgery’ and to evaluate its impact through observation of 100 surgical cases (Chapter 11). A number of conclusions are drawn from the research. Patient safety education is well accepted by trainees and trainers alike, and results in improved safety competencies across knowledge, skill and behavioural domains. It is feasible to embed a large-scale patient safety programme into PGME and to engage senior doctors to support its delivery. Overall, these findings suggest that patient safety education not only improves ‘safety skills’ at an individual level, but may also promote the safety of the wider healthcare system through enhancing medical engagement in patient safety and fostering cultural change. The concluding Section (Chapter 12) summarises the findings in detail. Strengths and limitations of the research are discussed, and recommendations are drawn for accelerating the integration of patient safety education into PGME. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} selecting a <b>portfolio</b> of <b>entries</b> of fixed cardinality for a winner take all contest such that the probability {{of at least one}} entry winning is maximized. This framework is very general and can be used to model a variety of problems, such as movie studios selecting movies to produce, drug companies choosing drugs to develop, or venture capital firms picking start-up companies in which to invest. We model this as a combinatorial optimization problem with a submodular objective function, which is the probability of winning. We then show that the objective function can be approximated using only pairwise marginal probabilities of the entries winning when there is a certain structure on their joint distribution. We consider a model where the entries are jointly Gaussian random variables and present a closed form approximation to the objective function. We then consider a model where the entries are given by sums of constrained resources and present a greedy integer programming formulation to construct the entries. Our formulation uses three principles to construct entries: maximize the expected score of an entry, lower bound its variance, and upper bound its correlation with previously constructed entries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our greedy integer programming formulation, we apply it to daily fantasy sports contests that have top heavy payoff structures (i. e. most of the winnings go to the top ranked entries). We find that the entries produced by our approach perform well in practice and are even able to come in first place in contests with thousands of entries. Our approach can easily be extended to other problems with a winner take all type of payoff structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how {{children}} in a third grade classroom came to understand the processes that helped them revalue themselves as learners. In addition, they identified the types of support structures that helped them revalue themselves as learners in an inquiry based curriculum. Qualitative research was determined to be the most suitable methodology for this study, given the research questions and their relationship to the engagements and the learning experiences in this classroom. The curricular framework dictated that the research design needed to include data that reflected the ongoing nature of learning as a process of inquiry. Data analysis was based on open coding and a method of constant comparison. Multiple data sources included daily field notes with anecdotal notes on significant events; a teacher journal of reflections; collected student responses, Sketch to Stretches, picture reflections, <b>portfolios,</b> and journal <b>entries.</b> Children described, defined, and redefined themselves as learners through the continuous building of reciprocal relationships with their peers and teacher, encouraging them to find their voice through action and reflection. Children identified the roles of their class participants, the connection they made in and across the curriculum, their personal and social inquiries, and the expectation of change, as the multiple structures that supported them in their learning. My purpose was to contribute insights into how students and teachers might better address the issue of curriculum for the purpose of allowing learners to be more self-reflective learners. Findings suggest that reflective thinking is a tool for growth as a learner and needs to be a continuous part of the curriculum. Sign systems need to be tools for expanding learning potentials so classrooms can be critical thinking communities. Learning is enhanced when relationships are reciprocal. A curriculum that emphasizes a problem-posing approach motivates students and encourages both students and teachers to engage in curricular decisions making curriculum dynamic...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} use of portfolios by teachers of English (L 2) to assist non-native speakers in Hong Kong universities to complete their studies in English. Portfolios as an English learning tool have yet to win converts {{from the ranks of}} language teachers in Hong Kong chiefly because of concerns about reliability and fairness. Two recent initiatives in Hong Kong have, however, prompted a reappraisal of the place of portfolios in English language learning. They include {{the use of}} learning portfolios in secondary school and ePortfolios by university students for learning and employment purposes. As an English (L 2) teacher of many years, I initiated my research to investigate the experiences of seven university students in Hong Kong in using reflective portfolios for English learning. Three research questions framed my research: 1) in what ways can reflective portfolios impact on L 2 learning strategies? 2) what are the effects of reflective portfolios on progress in L 2 acquisition as perceived by students? 3) what are the perceptions of university students towards reflective portfolios as a method of L 2 learning? To gain a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena under scrutiny, a case study methodology and grounded theory were utilised, the former to organise and generate qualitative data, and the latter to analyse data from three sources provided by the seven participating students: semi-structured interviews, portfolio artefacts, and weekly learning diaries. There were two levels of data analysis. For the first level, analysis focused on coded data from <b>portfolio</b> artefacts, diary <b>entries</b> and interview transcripts as reported by students. The second level involved analysis from the Confucian and sociocultural perspectives. I pursued interpretation and continuous refinement of the data by using techniques drawn from grounded theory. The findings revealed that students generally employed a wide spread of L 2 learning strategies in the cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-affective domain, reported increased awareness of effective language strategies, and considered portfolios a means of supporting time management and record-keeping, and a site for extended writing practice through reflection. The findings suggest that students display a cyclical, context-specific shift in learning conception from quantitative to qualitative. Connected to this is students’ apparent ability to formulate strategic responses to externally imposed demands. It is found that such responses are culturally triggered, underpinned by Confucian beliefs. Although the Confucian tradition emphasises respect for established authority, the findings point to students’ creative re-configuration of mental schemata to engender change in role enactment and power relations, with the portfolio as a mediating tool of their experiences. Based on the findings, I argue that my research has addressed the three research questions and contributed to two crucial aspects of L 2 learning. The first pertains to the need for a balanced view of individual effort and social context in second language acquisition, corroborating the significant link between context and learner engagement. Another contribution centres on an enhanced understanding of the relationship between portfolios, reflection and L 2, where students’ diaries in English and portfolio artefacts enable them to engage in critical reflection and to identify strategies for L 2 improvement. <br /...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) {{identifies}} seven {{core values}} {{important to the}} profession of physical therapy: Accountability, altruism, compassion/caring, excellence, integrity, professional duty, and social responsibility. One of the student learning outcomes of our entry level Doctor of Physical Therapy (D. P. T.) program was that students would demonstrate self reflection and growth in these seven areas. Although the APTA developed a self-assessment instrument to self assess skills in the seven areas, this tool asks individuals to rate how often they engage in specific behaviors. The problem underlying this project was that the Outcomes Committee wanted to investigate how students changed in these seven core values over time during the three-year D. P. T. curriculum. In addition, {{we were interested in}} learning what type of educational experiences influenced value development. PURPOSE: To develop an authentic assessment process related to the seven core values described by the APTA. METHODOLOGY: The Outcomes Committee chair, in conjunction with the faculty and program director, developed a Values and Documentation Portfolio requirement in 2009. The following decisions were made: “The portfolio would be required for graduation but would not be graded. The portfolio would be submitted in the summer of year three, immediately preceding nine months of clinical rotations. The values section of the portfolio would require students to self-assess in each of the seven core value areas. Students would include both self reflection and artifacts (evidence) to support each value category, emphasizing change over time and personal growth. ” Faculty would review the portfolios in order to assess whether the outcomes were being met and also to determine what experiences facilitated growth and change in these areas. The first class to complete the portfolio was the 2010 graduating cohort. RESULTS: Based on the assessment of a sample of Values portfolios, NSU students demonstrate growth in all of the seven areas {{over the course of the}} three-year curriculum. The areas with the most growth included accountability, altruism, caring/compassion, and social responsibility. Students had more difficulty showing evidence in the areas of excellence, integrity, and professional duty. Activities identified by the students as enhancing these values included: a) service learning experiences; b) clinical education experiences; c) the program requirement to attend local and national APTA functions; and d) opportunities to teach other students. Excerpts of student submissions will be provided in the presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The American Association of Higher Education advocated that one of the 9 principles of good practice in assessing student learning is to pay attention to not only student outcomes but also the experiences that lead to those outcomes. The analysis of the Value <b>Portfolios</b> in the <b>entry</b> level DPT Program demonstrated that experiences OUTSIDE the classroom such as service learning activities and attendance to APTA meetings were those that enhanced the development of values across the curriculum. Furthermore, the portfolio itself appeared to enhance reflective skills of the entry level students. In the future, the DPT Program will analyze how core values change between the first and third years of the program. The area of values development in entry level professional education needs additional attention and research, including: a) whether feedback on the values portfolio would enhance value development; b) if discussion with faculty prior to submission can enhance value development...|$|R
