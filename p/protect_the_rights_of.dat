5|$|Along {{with the}} International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs {{are paid for by the}} UN's primary budget.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Santoso {{returned}} to Batavia {{and took a}} teaching job at the Muhammadiyah-run teacher's college there, refusing {{a position in the}} colonial government to do so. While teaching, she continued to be active in the nationalist movement, helping Adam Malik to establish the news agency Antara. On February 1938 she married R. Santoso Wirodihardjo. That same year, she led a congress dealing with marriage reform, to better <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> women; the reforms passed in 1941. Santoso also worked to promote women's literacy through sewing groups; women who came to study sewing would be invited to learn to read and about marriage rights and child-rearing.|$|E
5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the people, rather it listed {{the powers of the}} government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E

5|$|The {{voters of}} Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, {{and none of the}} main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E

5|$|The Cultural and Educational rights, {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by {{enabling them to}} conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
