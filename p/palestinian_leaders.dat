5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E

25|$|On 2 June, {{an attempt}} by rebels to derail a train {{bringing}} the 2nd Battalion Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment from Egypt led to the railways being put under guard, placing a great strain on the security forces. In response to this situation on 4 June the government rounded up {{a large number of}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> and sent them to a detention camp at Auja al-Hafir in the Negev desert.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, Bush began a new {{approach}} to the peace process, the so-called Annapolis process, which attempts to encourage Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> to agree on the outlines of a peace accord. Although both sides cite some success in these discussions, critics believe the talks have unduly ignored Hamas, which has been labeled as a terrorist organization, {{despite the fact that it}} holds an enormous amount of political power in the region.|$|E
25|$|Robinson, a {{self-described}} socialist, is commonly regarded as {{being one of}} the most left-wing figures in Canadian politics.

25|$|According to Khalidi {{before the}} mid-1930s the notables {{from both the}} al-Husayni and the al-Nashashibi factions acted as though by simply {{continuing}} {{to negotiate with the}} British they could convince them to grant the Palestinians their political rights. The Arab population considered both factions as ineffective in their national struggle, and linked to and dependent on the British administration. Khalidi ascribes the failure of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> to enroll mass support to their experience during the Ottoman period, when {{they were part of the}} ruling elite and were accustomed to command. The idea of mobilising the masses was thoroughly alien to them.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a lively}} debate around the shape that a lasting peace {{settlement}} would take (see {{for example the}} One-state solution and Two-state solution). Authors like Cook {{have argued that the}} one-state solution is opposed by Israel because the very nature of Zionism and Jewish nationalism calls for a Jewish majority state, whilst the two-state solution would require the difficult relocation of half a million Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> such as Salam Fayyad have rejected calls for a binational state or unilateral declaration of statehood. As of 2010, only a minority of Palestinians and Israelis support the one-state solution. Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, {{triggering}} the Gulf War between Iraq {{and a large}} allied force, led by the United States. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 Scud missiles. Israel did not retaliate at {{request of}} the U.S., fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed Patriot defense batteries in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were secretly airlifted to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the U.S. President, George H.W. Bush, and Soviet Union Premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, jointly convened a historic meeting in Madrid of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders.</b> Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

25|$|During his governorship, Patrick {{oversaw the}} {{implementation}} of the state's 2006 health care reform program which had been enacted under Mitt Romney; increased funding to education and life sciences; won a federal Race to the Top education grant; passed an overhaul of governance of the state transportation function, signing a law to create the Massachusetts Department of Transportation; increased the state sales tax from 5% to 6.25%; and raised the state's minimum wage from $8 per hour to $11 per hour by 2017. Under Patrick, Massachusetts joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the planned introduction of casinos in Massachusetts. Patrick's second term began on January 6, 2011, and in an interview with The Boston Globe, Patrick declared he would not seek re-election in 2014. He is a managing director at Bain Capital and currently serves as {{the chairman of the board}} for Our Generation Speaks, a fellowship program and startup іnсubаtor whose mіѕѕіоn іѕ to bring together young Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> through entrepreneurship.

25|$|The {{sentiments of}} Jews {{who fled the}} 1929 Hebron {{massacre}} and their descendants are mixed. Some advocate the continued settlement of Hebron {{as a way to}} continue the Jewish heritage in the city, while others suggest that settlers should try to live in peace with the Arabs there, with some even recommending the complete pullout of all settlers in Hebron. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> in Hebron. The two most public examples of the descendants' views are the 1997 statement made by an association of some descendants dissociating themselves from the then-current Jewish settlers in Hebron and calling them an obstacle to peace, and the May 15, 2006 letter sent to the Israeli government by other descendants urging the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement in Hebron in their names, and urged it to allow the return of eight Jewish families evacuated the previous January from the homes they set up in empty shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, was established in 2007. One of the purchasers is a descendant of Jews who fled Hebron during Arab massacres.|$|E
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas has provided evidence for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists on the Palestinian side who claim that there are still some positive signs on the Palestinian side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E

25|$|Siege of Beirut {{had begun}} on 14 June: Israeli forces had {{completed}} the encirclement of the city the previous day. The Israelis chose to keep the city under siege rather than forcibly capturing it, as they were unwilling to accept the heavy casualties that the heavy street fighting required to capture the city would have resulted in. Israeli forces bombarded targets within Beirut from land, sea, and air, and attempted to asssassinate <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> through airstrikes. The siege lasted until August, when an agreement was reached in August 1982. More than 14,000 PLO combatants evacuated the country in August and September, supervised by the Multinational Force in Lebanon, an international peacekeeping force with troops from the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Italy. About 6,500 Fatah fighters relocated from Beirut to Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, both North and South Yemen, Greece, and Tunisia—the latter of which became the new PLO headquarters. Philip Habib, Ronald Reagan's envoy to Lebanon, provided an understanding (i.e., assurance) to the PLO that the Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps would not be harmed. However, increased hostilities against the US resulted in the April 1983 United States Embassy bombing. In response, the US brokered the May 17 Agreement, {{in an attempt to}} stall hostilities between Israel and Lebanon. However, this agreement eventually failed to take shape, and hostilities continued. On October 23, 1983, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings against the US Marine and French paratrooper barracks in Beirut. These attacks were attributed to Iranian-backed Islamist guerrillas. Following this incident, international peacekeeping forces were withdrawn from Lebanon.|$|E
500|$|The Israeli Air Force (IAF) first {{received}} AH-64As in 1990, {{for a total}} {{fleet of}} 42. There was some controversy over the Air Force's choice to purchase Apaches over upgrading existing AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. In 2000, Israel was interested in acquiring up to 48 AH-64Ds, but U.S. reluctance to share the software source code complicated the prospect. In April 2005, Boeing delivered the first AH-64D to the IAF. In 2001, the U.S. government was allegedly investigating misuse of the Apache and other US-supplied military equipment against <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> and facilities. In 2009, an arranged sale of six AH-64Ds was reportedly blocked by the Obama Administration, pending interagency review, over concerns the helicopters may {{pose a threat to}} civilian Palestinians in Gaza. In IAF service, the AH-64A was named as the Peten ( [...] , for Cobra), while the AH-64D was named Saraph ( [...] , also as [...] "Seraph", Hebrew for venomous/fiery winged serpent).|$|E
500|$|Blair {{recorded}} {{a series of}} promotional interviews for radio and television for, among others, the Arabic television network Al Jazeera, the ITV1 daytime magazine programme This Morning, and BBC Two, which aired an hour-long interview with the journalist and political commentator Andrew Marr. He was in Washington, D.C. {{on the day of}} the UK launch to participate in peace talks with Middle East leaders and attend a White House dinner with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders.</b> The British newspaper The Independent reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt to be out of the United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on O'Connell Street, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a citizen's arrest of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with Irish police and tried to push over a security barrier outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and Irish republicans opposed to the peace process—called queuing customers [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "West Brits". Four people were arrested during the incident.|$|E

500|$|The reconstructed Hurva {{was officially}} opened on March 15, 2010 in the {{presence}} of Israeli politicians and chief rabbis. A day earlier, hundreds of people had accompanied a new Torah scroll into the synagogue. Several <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> claimed that the rededication signaled Israel's intent to destroy the Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount and replace it with the Third Temple. Fatah official Khatem Abd el-Khader called the renovation of the Hurva a [...] "provocation", warned Israel that it was [...] "playing with fire" [...] and called on Palestinians to [...] "converge on Al-Aksa to save it". Khaled Mashal of Hamas described the synagogue's opening as [...] "a declaration of war" [...] and called it a [...] "falsification of history and Jerusalem's religious and historic monuments". Fearing riots by Arab protestors, over 3,000 policemen were deployed ahead of the dedication ceremony. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference said that the reopening risked [...] "dragging the region into a religious war" [...] and claimed the building was historically on a waqf (Islamic trust) land. The Jordanian government also condemned the move stating that it [...] "categorically rejects the rededication of Hurva synagogue and all other unilateral Israeli measures in occupied East Jerusalem because they run counter to international legitimacy". Iran urged the international community to respond to the reopening and a Foreign Ministry spokesman called the move a [...] "catastrophe that has distressed the Islamic world". Israeli officials countered that Arab fears of a takeover of the Temple Mount were based on rumors and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a message of coexistence.
