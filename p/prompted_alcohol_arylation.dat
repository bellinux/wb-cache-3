40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} factors that inhibit and facilitate discussion about alcohol between general practitioners (GPs) and patients. Design: Data analysis from a cross-sectional survey. Setting and participants: 894 GP delegates {{of a national}} health seminar series held in five capital cities of Australia in 2014. Main outcome measures: Likelihood of routine alcohol enquiry; self-assessed confidence in assessing and managing alcohol issues in primary healthcare. Results: Most GPs (87 %) {{reported that they were}} likely to routinely ask patients about their alcohol consumption and had sufficient skills to manage alcohol issues (74 %). Potential barriers to enquiring about alcohol included perceptions that patients are not always honest about alcohol intake (84 %) and communication difficulties (44 %). ‘I usually ask about alcohol’ was ranked by 36 % as the number one presentation likely to <b>prompt</b> <b>alcohol</b> discussion. Altered liver function test results followed by suspected clinical depression were most frequently ranked in the top three presentations. Suspicious or frequent injuries, frequent requests for sickness certificates and long-term unemployment were ranked in the top three presentations by 20 % or less. Confidence in managing alcohol issues independently predicted likelihood to ‘routinely ask’ about alcohol consumption. Lack of time emerged as the single most important barrier to routinely asking about alcohol. Lack of time was predicted by perceptions of competing health issues in patients, fear of eliciting negative responses and lower confidence in ability to manage alcohol-related issues. Conclusions: Improving GPs' confidence and ability to identify, assess and manage at-risk drinking through relevant education may facilitate greater uptake of alcohol-related enquiries in general practice settings. Routine establishment of brief alcohol assessments might improve confidence in managing alcohol issues, reduce the time burden in risk assessment, decrease potential stigma associated with raising alcohol issues and reduce the potential for negative responses from patients.

40|$|Aims: People {{tend to have}} poor {{knowledge}} of government guidelines for alcohol use, and lack the motivation and skills required {{to use them to}} monitor their drinking. The study aim was to determine whether using glasses marked with such guidelines would improve knowledge and attitudes, increase frequency of counting units, and lower alcohol intake. Methods: 450 adults participated in an intervention-control study with 1 -month follow-up. The intervention group was encouraged to use glasses supplied by the researchers that indicated the unit content of drinks of different strengths and volumes, and stated the intake guidelines. Interviews with 13 intervention group participants focused on their experiences of using the glasses and recommendations for their use. Results: Analyses adjusted for baseline variables showed that the intervention improved: {{knowledge of}} unit-based guidelines; ability to estimate the unit content of drinks; attitudes toward the guidelines; and frequency of counting unit intake. However, there was no significant change in alcohol consumption. Interview data confirmed that the glasses provided useful information that encouraged people to think about their drinking and to discuss alcohol with other people. However, their design was not appealing to all, and their initial impact did not always persist. Conclusions: Use of unit-marked glasses led to changes in people’s use of unit-based guidelines to monitor their drinking.

40|$|Abstract Background Though {{screening}} and intervention for {{alcohol and tobacco}} misuse are effective, primary care {{screening and}} intervention rates remain low. Previous studies have increased intervention rates using vital signs screening for tobacco misuse and clinician prompts for screen-positive patients for both alcohol and tobacco misuse. This pilot study's aims were: (1) To determine the feasibility of combined vital signs screening for tobacco and alcohol misuse, (2) To {{assess the impact of}} vital signs screening on alcohol and tobacco screening and intervention rates, and (3) To assess the additional impact of tobacco assessment prompts on intervention rates. Methods In five outpatient practices, nurses measuring vital signs were trained to routinely ask a single tobacco question, a prescreening question that identified current drinkers, and the single alcohol screening question for current drinkers. After 4 - 8 weeks, clinicians were trained in tobacco intervention and nurses were trained to give tobacco abusers a tobacco questionnaire which also served as a clinician intervention prompt. Screening and intervention rates were measured using patient exit interviews (n = 622) at baseline, during the "screening only" period, and during the tobacco prompting phase. Changes in screening and intervention rates were compared using chi square analyses and test of linear trends. Clinic staff were interviewed regarding patient and staff acceptability. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of nurse screening on clinician intervention, the impact of alcohol intervention on concurrent tobacco intervention, and the impact of tobacco intervention on concurrent alcohol intervention. Results Alcohol and tobacco screening rates and alcohol intervention rates increased after implementing vital signs screening (p Conclusions Vital signs screening can be incorporated in primary care and increases alcohol screening and intervention rates.

5000|$|In February 2006, rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} that the 7-year-old Colby would be aged significantly. According to reports, Colby would be aged to 16 upon her return. However, the character's return would {{be anything but}} subtle. A [...] "rebellious" [...] Colby would cause trouble for her father Adam. Colby re-introduction mirrored that of her half-sister Hayley Vaughan (Kelly Ripa)'s debut in November 1990. In the summer of 2007, Colby develops a crush on the much older Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), despite his interest in her ex sister-in-law, Babe Carey (Alexa Havins). At the time when Babe interferes with Colby their [...] "relationship," [...] Colby is very emotional; [...] "Her emotions are really being played with, {{and she has a}} lot on her plate right now with her family, with everything," [...] Childers said in an interview. Colby is being pulled in so many different directions and it is [...] "a lot for a young girl of the age of 16 to handle." [...] Despite her own issues, Colby must act as a parent to her chaotic family. [...] "I'm giving my own parents advice on what to do" [...] the actress explained of Colby maturity while the adults in her life seemed to be acting like children. Upon Childers's departure, an executive was quoted in saying that [...] "storyline dictated the change." [...] Another source implied that age played a factor in the casting decision. Other sources revealed that Moncrief was hired so that the writers could age Colby making her the appropriate age for a romantic pairing with the 25-year-old Frankie Hubbard portrayed by Cornelius Smith, Jr. Colby had recently developed a crush on Frankie, and the two even shared a kiss. The potential pairing would also create drama based due to Adam's history as a schemer and Frankie's father Jesse Hubbard as the new chief of police.The writers' plans to capitalize on the chemistry between the two characters is abandoned as Moncrief's Colby does not share the same chemistry with Smith's Frankie. In the summer of 2008, Colby and her friends mistakenly believe that they are behind the death of Richie Novak (Billy Miller). Colby turns to <b>alcohol</b> <b>prompting</b> her brother, JR Chandler (Jacob Young) to point out that she may have a problem like many others in their family. However, the storyline fails to progress any further. When Natalie Hall stepped into the role, Hall said she believed that the writers wanted Colby to be more like her mother. Colby is meant to be [...] "a person who is sweet, who is kind, and who will fight for what she wants." [...] Colby is far from [...] "weak" [...] and according to Hall, [...] "very complex." [...] With Hall's debut, Colby becomes very manipulative. However, Hall stated that Colby would start to show a sweeter side when she starts to grow closer to bad boy, Damon Miller (Finn Wittrock). The character of Damon is the illegitimate son of Liza's high school boyfriend, Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight). In 2013, a press release described Newton's Colby as Adam's [...] "spoiled and entitled." [...] Jillian Bowe wondered if Newton's Colby would cause problems for Rob Wilson's Pete Cortlandt and his new love Celia Fitzgerald (Jordan Lane Price) due to Pete's past crush on Colby.|$|R
40|$|Holiday Heart Syndrome (HHS) is cardiac {{arrhythmia}} induced by binge alcohol consumption, a drinking pattern affects 38 million adults in our society. Atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is the most}} frequently diagnosed arrhythmia in HHS and causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the intensive prevention effort nationwide, the binge drinking population keeps rising. However, no effective treatment strategies are available for binge drinking induced AF due to the unknown underlying mechanisms. In this thesis, I aim to elucidate the mechanisms of binge alcohol-promoted atrial arrhythmogenicity by using a mouse model of repeated binge alcohol exposure established in the Ai Lab. The Ai Lab has recently discovered that the activation of stress-response kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays {{an essential role in}} atrial arrhythmogenicity. Interestingly, previous research also documented that alcohol promotes JNK activation in non-atrial tissue. However, it is unknown whether JNK plays a role in binge alcohol-induced atrial arrhythmogenicity. In this thesis, I found increased JNK activation in repeated binge alcohol-exposed mouse/rabbit atria. In addition, abolishing JNK pathway with dominant negative JNK overexpression in the heart (JNK 1 / 2 dn mice) successfully suppressed binge alcohol-promoted atrial arrhythmia. Aberrant Ca 2 + activities, especially Ca 2 + waves, play a pivotal role in arrhythmogenicity. Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a well-established arrhythmogenic molecule that regulates multiple cardiac Ca 2 + handling proteins. Previous research has shown that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor (RyR), the main Ca 2 + release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), results in enhanced SR Ca 2 + leak and the rise of Ca 2 + waves. SR Ca 2 + overload has also been shown to sensitize RyR and promote diastolic SR Ca 2 + leak. However, it is unknown whether Ca 2 + mishandling plays a vital role in binge drinking-induced atrial arrhythmia. In this thesis, I found an increased frequency of Ca 2 + waves in atrial tissue from binge alcoho- exposed mice, while abolishing the JNK pathway in JNK 1 / 2 dn mice precluded the Ca 2 + wave occurrence. CaMKII activation and CaMKII-dependent RyR phosphorylation were both enhanced after alcohol exposure. On the other hand, a single dose of CaMKII inhibitor (KN 93) treatment after binge alcohol exposure reversed the atrial Ca 2 + waves and atrial arrhythmogenicity in WT mice. Alcohol-treated atrial myocytes (HL- 1 cells) revealed enhanced diastolic SR Ca 2 + leak, while suppressing JNK or CaMKII both alleviated the SR Ca 2 + leak, further indicating alcohol induced JNK/CaMKII contributes to arrhythmogenic Ca 2 + mishandling. Further studies showed alcohol exposure promotes CaMKII activation in a JNK-dependent manner, but not via direct oxidation of redox-sensitive amino acid sites (Met 280 / 281) on CaMKII. Besides CaMKII-dependent RyR phosphorylation, enhanced SR Ca 2 + load can also promote SR Ca 2 + leak via sensitizing the SR luminal Ca 2 + sensor of RyR. I found increased SR Ca 2 + load in alcohol-treated atrial myocytes via a JNK-dependent yet CaMKII-independent mechanism. Ablating SR Ca 2 + luminal sensor with RyR E 4872 Q+/- mutation alleviated the binge alcohol or JNK activation-induced increase in Ca 2 + waves and atrial arrhythmogenicity. In conclusion, the key findings of this thesis work are: 1) repeated binge alcohol leads to enhanced activation of stress-response kinase; 2) JNK 2 phosphorylates CaMKII, a pro-arrhythmic molecule, and promotes CaMKII-dependent diastolic SR Ca leak via increased RyR channel activity; 3) JNK 2 elevates SR Ca load via JNK-enhanced SERCA uptake. Findings in this work suggest that JNK inhibition could be a therapeutic strategy for binge <b>alcohol</b> <b>prompted</b> atrial arrhythmias...|$|R
