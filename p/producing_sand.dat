40|$|Sand {{production}} {{is a complex}} problem that has plagued {{the oil and gas}} industry for decades, leading to reduced productivity, wellbore instability, equipment failure and expensive sand control and management techniques. Therefore, a reliable prediction of the potential of a formation to <b>produce</b> <b>sand</b> as well as the mass and volume of the <b>sand</b> <b>produced</b> is required for an appropriate and economically effective sand management. In this thesis a novel approach (yield energy model) to predict the potential of formation to <b>produce</b> <b>sand</b> and to quantify the mass of <b>sand</b> <b>produced</b> around yielded wellbore region based on energy dissipation is presented. During drilling and hydrocarbon production, yield and fragmentation of rock around a wellbore may occur when the rock is exposed to stresses which exceed its failure criterion, creating yield zone and hence the potential for instability and sand production. Generally, in brittle rocks, grains are deformed elastically with increasing stress, storing strain energy in the process. The stored strain energy is dissipated during failure, some of which is available for the fragmentation of the rock along failure surfaces. It is argued that the major source of sand production in competent rock is associated with the debris created by slippage along shear fractures in the yielded zone along perforation wall. The potential for sand production and the mass or volume of the sand created around the yield zone is predicted by quantifying the reduction in strain energy stored in the rock as its yields around a completion on removal of completion fluid and the imposition of drawdown. The resultant sand then becomes available as a source for sand production. The yield energy model has been applied to assess the potential of several reservoir samples to <b>produce</b> <b>sand</b> and also quantify the mass of the <b>sand</b> <b>produced</b> as a result of formation instability caused by drilling and hydrocarbon production in a field specific manner. Results from laboratory testing of representative samples and field data has been utilised as input parameters. The extent of the failed zone, the sand production potential and the mass of debris have been analysed as a function of mud weights, drawdown pressures and production rates. The impact of unique production performance of different horizons on formation stability has been accounted for by employing deliverability expressions. The results have been assessed with regards to field observations and were found to be consistent...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{production}} of calcium carbonate {{in the oceans}} is an important process. Although carbonate is produced in the open ocean (pelagic, see Chapter 5), this chapter concentrates on production in coastal waters (neritic) because this contributes sediment to the coast through skeletal breakdown <b>producing</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel deposits on beaches, across continental shelves, and within reefs. Marine organisms with hard body parts precipitate calcium carbonate as the minerals calcite or aragonite. Corals, molluscs, foraminifera, bryozoans, red algae (for example the algal rims that characterize reef crests on Indo-Pacific reefs) are particularly productive, {{as well as some}} species of green algae (especially Halimeda). Upon death, these calcareous organisms break down by physical, chemical, and biological erosion processes through a series of discrete sediment sizes (Perry et al., 2011). Neritic carbonate production has been estimated to be approximately 2. 5 Gt year- 1 (Milliman and Droxler, 1995; Heap et al., 2009). The greatest contributors are coral reefs that form complex structures covering a total area of more than 250, 000 km 2 (Spalding and Grenfell, 1997; Vecsei, 2004), but other organisms, such as oysters, may also form smaller reef structures...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{case studies}} of metal casting {{applications}} using sand moulds and cores produced by additive manufacturing (AM) processes have been widely reported in the literature. The layered- based manufacturing process has revolutionised traditional sand moulding methods. This is essentially due to the numerous advantages of AM, including the reduction of design lead time {{and the ability to}} manufacture objects with complex geometry in a rapid turnaround time. Locally-available AM processes that are capable of <b>producing</b> <b>sand</b> moulds and cores include laser sintering (LS) and three-dimensional printing (3 DP), with the latter AM process growing in dominance over the former.

Crucial characteristics of 3 DP sand parts related to strength, dimensional accuracy, and hardness are not well- known in terms of their magnitude and in comparison with conventionally-moulded sand parts. In this investigation, the physical properties of test specimens produced under standard manufacturing conditions, using a Voxeljet VX 1000 machine, were assessed for bend and tensile strength, hardness, friability, and surface finish. The physical properties of the 3 DP test specimens were then compared with the properties of laboratory hand- rammed test specimens.

40|$|Abstract only - The {{existing}} {{construction waste}} recycling technologies and standards have been long applied in construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling, mainly {{focused on the}} production and use of coarse recycled aggregates. Very few papers and process focus on the production of recycled sand although some previous results show that fine aggregates fraction (below 4. 8 mm) represents around 40 to 60 % (in mass) of the Brazilian waste and it is usually down cycled as road sub-base or disposed in landfills. The quality of the recycled aggregate is strictly related {{to the content of}} porous and low strength phases, as the patches of cement attached to the recycled aggregate. Despite being the crucial factor for aggregate performance, the removal of adhered cement paste is not a simple task. Some technologies have already been described in the literature, even though, to the moment none of these technologies has clearly succeeded in reaching the large market available. This paper presents a summary of the main properties of the sand produced from C&D waste by tertiary crushing at vertical shaft impactor crusher (attrition and abrasion comminution). Additionally mineral processing technologies were applied on the attained product, such as density concentration by shaking table and spirals and magnetic separation at rare earth roll separator. The main properties of recycled sand are discussed and compared to the previous C&D waste, respectively: apparent density, water absorption, chemical composition, porosity, particle shape and cement paste content. The results demonstrated that the comminution by vertical shaft impact crusher allowed producing a VSI-sand with low porosity and water absorption. The concentration by shaking table at narrow sieve fractions led to a product with low porosity and reduced content of cement paste, although products from spiral concentrator for the bulk sample had only the effect of classification instead of concentration. The non-magnetic products presented similar characteristics of the heavy product from the shaking table plus separation of micaceous minerals.

40|$|The {{majority}} of aggregates extracted in the UK are transported from the quarry {{to the point}} of sale by construction trucks of either rigid chassis or articulated vehicle design. These vehicles have a unique set of requirements for haulage logistics as many of them must be capable of driving on unmade surfaces and constructed dirt roads not only within the quarry but more importantly at the goods destination. Such vehicles have to balance the on-road requirements of minimum energy consumption, low capital cost, low maintenance and low noise with the off road requirements of maintaining overall mobility whilst minimising their impact on the environment. This project investigates the environmental impacts of these vehicles and evaluates their design and use from an environmental perspective to establish whether changes to vehicle design or the layout of the quarries could lessen the impacts. The project considered current practices used for aggregate transport by road including operational methods vehicle choice and logistics. A structured survey technique was used to gather data from quarries <b>producing</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel, limestone and igneous metamorphic rock, located throughout the UK. The predominant findings were: 85 % of road going aggregate transport trucks were required to travel on unsealed surfaces within the quarry. Trucks may be required to travel on unsealed surfaces at the point of delivery. 7 % of the quarries surveyed had no means of cleaning debris from trucks before they left the quarry. All quarries covered loads when travelling on the highway. The major environmental impacts were: Aggregate transport trucks generate a significant amount of noise especially when unladen. Aggregate transport trucks can contaminate the public highway, with quarry and/or delivery point acquired debris, both near to, and at some distance from the quarry depending on prevailing weather conditions. To corroborate these findings using the general public's perspective, a small public survey was conducted using a face to face structured interview technique in three villages near to quarry operations. The results of this survey confirmed that noise from unladen trucks and debris deposited on the highway were the most significant impacts. To further investigate these issues an experiment was conducted to determine how the noise level from construction trucks compared to other road vehicles on the public highway. The results highlight the potential for empty trucks to generate significantly high impulse noise when travelling over uneven surfaces including potholes, manhole covers and drains. The predominant source of this noise is from the relative movement between the body and chassis. To control this movement the design of body damping systems should be investigated as a low cost solution. The major source of material transfer into the environment was via the trucks tyres. Experimental results showed that halving the tyre's recommended inflation pressure had a significant effect on the material collected within the tyre tread on a sandy loam soil. However, the relationship between soil-tyre adhesion, axle load and the soil's initial bulk density remains unclear and requires a further detailed investigation. A chassis sheeting/enclosure system has been suggested as a low cost method of preventing material being transferred to the chassis which would otherwise fall off on the road. Considering the design of construction trucks three areas were investigated namely; the tyre choice and use, the drive train and the body design along with the vehicles use within the quarry. Tyre choice is predominantly dictated by the aggregate's destination, which is often off-road and hence an off road biased tyre is chosen. Although in reality the {{majority of}} sites will not challenge the vehicles mobility, for those that might, the risk of getting a vehicle stuck was too great to justify the use of a more road biased tyre. However, the results from a tread cleaning experiment showed that inflation pressure could be used to reduce tread clogging. It is well reported in the literature that manipulating inflation pressure can improve the tractive capability of a tyre and maintaining the correct road inflation pressure can contribute to reduced fuel consumption. Central tyre inflation systems that are commercially available, allow inflation pressure to be controlled and monitored, however, further research is required to determine the optimum tyre pressure to be used for a given set of operating conditions. Alternative methods of powering truck ancillary equipment, including load bed tipping, have been investigated to reduce the need to run the engine at high speed under low load when tipping the body. A kinetic energy recovery system has the potential to reduce the overall environmental impact of the transport operation by reducing fuel use and engine emissions, and this could be employed to power auxiliary systems, but would be far better utilised to assist with vehicle propulsion during the drive cycle. Considering quarry design three options were highlighted that reduce the environmental impact of road going trucks: 1. Upgrade roads within quarries to enable low rolling resistance on-road tyres to be used on road going trucks without sacrificing mobility. 2. Adopt a demountable body system 3. Employ a flexible conveyor system from excavation face to quarry exitEach option reduces the distance a truck must move within the quarry on un-sealed surfaces. The use of a demountable system would permit a clear segregation between on-road and off road vehicle use within the quarry, but the practical issues associated with the system such as reduced payload and container storage would prevent its widespread adoption where off road capability remains a requirement at the delivery point. The ultimate solution could be considered to be a flexible conveyor system, and low carbon goods transit thereafter. This could be achieved by an advance in conveyor design to allow it to follow the excavator's movements, and transfer the material {{to the edge of the}} quarry for onward movement by low carbon transport...|$|E
