40|$|This {{monograph}} on the œuvre {{of contemporary}} American author and multimedia artist Shelley Jackson addresses {{the question of}} how literary works employ language to evoke sense impressions. Gilles Deleuze’s notion of aesthetic percepts is drawn on to develop a theory of literary phantom sensations which is then tested on the work of Jackson and related authors.   Although imperceptible as such, it is argued that percepts are made perceptible in art in sense-specific forms as phantom sensations. “Phantom” is not meant to indicate a pale shadow of real sensations but the intensely perceived realness of phantom limb phenomena, in accordance with Deleuze’s understanding of the virtual as real but not actual. For the sake of clarity, literary phantom sensations are divided into phantom smells, tastes, touches, sights and sounds, with a chapter devoted to each in turn. It is found that different phantom sensations serve different functions in Jackson’s work, correlated to the cultural history of the senses as outlined by recent sensory scholarship.   Phantom smells are associated with Deleuze’s concept of becoming due to their liminality. Phantom tastes contribute to an aesthetics of distaste in which shades of disgust are cultivated and drawn upon for literary effect. Phantom touch creates conceptual intimacy and invites the reader to handle words like toys in a game. Phantom sight is turned back upon itself in an anatomy of the eye. <b>Phantom</b> <b>hearing</b> is associated with forms of ventriloquism in which it is unclear who is speaking through whom and in which language itself throws its voice. However, it is also found that all phantom sensations similarly serve to create a material and affective connection between the body of the reader and the body of the text. Throughout the dissertation, Jackson’s work is read against and alongside that of other writers such as Djuna Barnes, Neil Bartlett, Brigid Brophy and Leonora Carrington. Together these form a trajectory termed minor writing for queers to come, which is meant to indicate that aesthetic and sexual-political  radicalism go hand in hand.  Furthermore, Jackson’s work is described as a form of body writing informed by feminist body art and écriture féminine. Specifically, Jackson takes her cue from early modern anatomical blazons and describes living bodies in pieces.   Her work is also described as object writing: a literary equivalent to surrealist object art.  A central method for making words more like things is to arrange her texts spatially rather than temporally, as exemplified by her electronic hypertexts...|$|E

50|$|The Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS, English: Dutch Broadcast Foundation) found {{a stereo}} main {{microphone}} system {{by a number}} of practical attempts in the 1960s. This system resulted in a quite even distribution of the <b>phantom</b> sources (<b>hearing</b> event direction) on the stereo loudspeaker base, with two small cardioid characteristic microphones, and a recording angle of the microphone system of ±40.5° = 81°. This system got empirical an axle angle of α = ±45° = 90° and a microphone distance (microphone basis) of a = 30 cm.|$|R
50|$|The most ferocious {{family that}} {{is known for its}} power, harshness, and skilled assassins. They are the {{pre-eminent}} tribal family in Tohan territory. Many true Kikuta have a straight palm line across their hand and have great powers, such as invisibility, splitting off a <b>phantom</b> body, acute <b>hearing,</b> and the ability to put someone in a deep sleep merely by staring at them (the 'Kikuta sleep'). It was said that many of the Kikuta gifts were dying out, which was why the Tribe desired Takeo's talents so much. Minor skills, possess by the weaker Kikuta, include agility and the ability to perceive invisibility and the second self.|$|R
40|$|Of all Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s tragedies, Macbeth {{is by far}} {{the most}} supernaturally charged. The play opens with three witches who give Macbeth and Banquo a {{prediction}} that lays out the plot of the rest of the play. Macbeth sees a <b>phantom</b> dagger, <b>hears</b> voices, and is haunted by the ghost of his murdered comrade. The vast amount of supernatural events comes as no surprise considering that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the play as a tribute to King James I, the British monarch whose belief in the power of witchcraft ran so deep that he led several witchhunts throughout Britain, in addition to writing Daemonologie, a text that argued for the reality of witches and the study of witchcraft 2 ̆ 7 s place in legitimate theological studies at the time. Led by King James, England treated supernatural phenomenon as a very real presence in the world at the time Shakespeare wrote Macbeth. While witches are perhaps the most ostentatious and the primary focus of King James 2 ̆ 7 s attention, they were by no means the only form the supernatural was said to take. Ghosts, visions and dreams, postmortem bleeding corpses, possession of devils, each had a place in Jacobean culture...|$|R
