40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{censorship and}} the challenges of Library services delivery in Nigeria. Librarians, through their professional associations, have long been committed to the social justice principle of free access to information. External censorship challenges to library collections threaten this principle overtly. However, censorship can also occur in libraries in various covert and often unconscious ways. This paper also raises concerns about current librarian practices and library censorship processes which can effectively censor library collections from within. In managing the library and its services, the librarian should promote inclusion and should not discriminate against any library user regardless of sex, ethnic group, <b>nationality,</b> social <b>condition,</b> religion or political opinions. It concludes by calling librarians to provide {{the highest level of}} service through courteous, prompt, adequate, skillful, accurate and unbiased responses to all requests for assistance to the user...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies of}} college suicides have {{neglected}} {{the need for}} an adequate comparison or control group. To remedy this situation, student suicides were compared to their nonsuicidal classmates on selected demographic variables. Suiciding students could be significantly differentiated from their fellow students on the basis of age, class standing, major subject, <b>nationality,</b> emotional <b>condition,</b> and academic achievement. The suicidal students presented similar prodromal patterns which were precipitated by scholastic anxieties, concern over physical health, and difficult interpersonal relationships. Contrary to general belief, the greatest suicidal activity occurred during the beginning, not the final, weeks of the semester. On the basis of changes transpiring in the college population, a future increase of student suicide was predicted. The act of self-destruction rudely challenges our supposed love for life and fear of death. It is always a puzzlement, but in no case is suicide more shocking or bewildering {{than it is in the}} college student. For here are a relatively privileged group of persons enjoying valued advantages of youth, intelligence, and educational opportunity. Why should persons, seemingly so rewarded, seek to kill themselves, and, indeed, to commit suicide at a rate significantly in excess of their noncollege peers (Bruyn & Seiden, 196 S, p. 76) ? This perplexing question—"Why do students suicide?"—has motivated a great deal of concern among college health authorities leading to several studies and evaluations of the problem in American universitie...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} social identities are {{constructed}} through dominant notions of normalcy. Specifically, it draws upon feminist, disability, and legal theories {{to examine the}} ways in which the cultural construction of ablebodiedness produces disability as a social category or identity. Further, this project examines how the categories of ablebodiedness and disability establish conventional notions of citizenship and <b>nationality,</b> particularly under <b>conditions</b> of neoliberalism. It does so by undertaking a historical analysis of both mainstream cultural theater and disability theater in order to demonstrate that ablebodiedness is performative. This thesis will then briefly conclude with the argument that institutional practices like legal systems are reflective of cultural ideologies extracted from these performances. Through these methods and examinations, this thesis aims to destabilize common and naturalized notions about the ablebodied citizen and trouble {{the ways in which}} they bear significant meaning upon identity and citizenship...|$|R
60|$|He {{went over}} to Third Avenue and took the Elevated down to Chatham Square. He found the variety {{of people in the}} car as unfailingly {{entertaining}} as ever. He rather preferred the East Side to the West Side lines, because they offered more <b>nationalities,</b> <b>conditions,</b> and characters to his inspection. They draw not only from the up-town American region, but from all the vast hive of populations swarming between them and the East River. He had found that, according to the hour, American husbands going to and from business, and American wives going to and from shopping, prevailed on the Sixth Avenue road, and that the most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human nature were the brilliant eyes and complexions of the American Hebrews, who otherwise contributed to the effect of well-clad comfort and citizen-self-satisfaction of the crowd. Now and then he had found himself in a car mostly filled with Neapolitans from the constructions far up the line, where he had read how they are worked and fed and housed like beasts; and listening to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect, he had occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these poor animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life under its conditions; and whether they found them practically very {{different from those of the}} immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity with rapine under which they had been born. But, after all, this was an infrequent effect, however massive, of travel on the West Side, whereas the East offered him continual entertainment in like sort. The sort was never quite so squalid. For short distances the lowest poverty, the hardest pressed labor, must walk; but March never entered a car without encountering some interesting shape of shabby adversity, which was almost always adversity of foreign birth. New York is still popularly supposed to be in the control of the Irish, but March noticed in these East Side travels of his what must strike every observer returning to the city after a prolonged absence: the numerical subordination of the dominant race. If they do not outvote them, the people of Germanic, of Slavonic, of Pelasgic, of Mongolian stock outnumber the prepotent Celts; and March seldom found his speculation centred upon one of these. The small eyes, the high cheeks, the broad noses, the puff lips, the bare, cue-filleted skulls, of Russians, Poles, Czechs, Chinese; the furtive glitter of Italians; the blonde dulness of Germans; the cold quiet of Scandinavians--fire under ice--were aspects that he identified, and that gave him abundant suggestion for the personal histories he constructed, and for the more public-spirited reveries in which he dealt with the future economy of our heterogeneous commonwealth. It must be owned that he did not take much trouble about this; what these poor people were thinking, hoping, fearing, enjoying, suffering; just where and how they lived; who and what they individually were--these were the matters of his waking dreams as he stared hard at them, while the train raced farther into the gay ugliness--the shapeless, graceful, reckless picturesqueness of the Bowery.|$|R

Air conditioning, lighting, water heating and refrigeration represent the main activities demanding electrical energy in hotel business. The energy consumption per night spend changes a lot, depending on various factors; facilities provided, category of hotel, occupancy, geographical situation, weather <b>conditions,</b> <b>nationality</b> of clients, design {{and control of the}} installations. Energy benchmarking is an internal management tool designed to provide ongoing, reliable and verifiable tracking on the hotels performance. The most useful performance indicator (or Energy Efficiency Benchmarking) of hotels are: Lighting Power Density (LPD) in W (for lighting) /m 2, and energy intensity (kWh/m 2 / y). There are multiple benefits for improving energy in hotel business; reduces the hotel's operating cost, reduces climate change risks and promotes green tourism. Energy efficiency opportunities are low-cost measures and cost- effective investments.     There are many energy saving opportunities for lighting in hotel's guest rooms as well as the more obvious savings in lobbies and exterior lighting areas. Behavior campaigns can yield substantial energy savings, both through the guests and housekeeper behavior. Encouraging housekeepers to use natural light during room cleaning is a simple first step to implement energy saving program. This paper presents the energy efficiency guidelines and energy benchmarking for hotels. Also a case study showing how the energy efficiency program implemented is presented.   </p...|$|R
40|$|The last decades a {{great deal}} of {{research}} has been performed regarding different fields of fire safety and fire development in existing tunnels. During constructions of tunnels the physical conditions of the establishment as well as the fire load, the possibilities to evacuate and perform a fire and rescue operation are essentially separated from the conditions in the opened tunnel. During the construction phase, the safety installations prior to the finished state, often is not yet installed or in function. Before the break through, the tunnel can have a “dead end”, which can make both evacuation and fire and rescue operations very difficult. Many different organizations can be involved in the construction work with the tunnel and it is not uncommon that the workers have different <b>nationalities.</b> Both these <b>conditions</b> can, in case of an incident, influence the alarm chain {{and the quality of the}} information that reaches the emergency services.

To our knowledge, no previous study was conducted about HPgV in Qatar. Thus, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to determine the rates of HPgV infection in Qatar among healthy blood donors and HBV-infected patients, and (ii) to determine the most predominant HPgV genotype in Qatar. A total of 714 blood plasma samples from healthy donors (612) and HBV-infected patients (102) were collected. RNA was extracted, reversed transcribed, and then subjected for HPgV detection by two round-nested PCR using primers amplifying a 208 bp of 50 -UTR of the HPgV. For genotyping, the 50 -UTR PCR products (from 25 randomly picked samples) were cloned and sequenced. The overall infection rate of HPgV in Qatar was 13. 3 %. There was no significant difference (P¼ 0. 41) in the infection rates between healthy donor (13. 7 %) and in HBVinfected patients (10. 7 %). Moreover, we did not find any significant association between HPgV infection rates and nationality, sex, or age (P> 0. 05). Sequence analysis of 40 50 -UTR PCR amplicons yielded the European genotype 2 as most predominant in Qatar, although other genotypes (5 and 7) were also present. Our results indicate that there is no strong correlation between HPgV infection rate, <b>condition,</b> <b>nationality,</b> age, and sex, and genotype 2 is most predominant in QatarQatar University.

40|$|Religious and lay fraternities {{played an}} {{important}} role on the religious, social and cultural scene of the towns as they could take part in activities of municipal administration authorities and also influence activities of municipal school. Activities of fraternities were mainly a matter of their own members, but some actions of ceremonial character grew into a „citywide“ event or at least they were reflected by most of the municipality. This contribution focuses on the fraternities in royal towns of the North-western Bohemia, which due to their different denomination, <b>nationality</b> and social-economical <b>conditions</b> provide a wide range of modifications of given topic. Five royal towns are concerned – {{from the point of view}} of its importance headed by the town of Litoměřice and Žatec, followed by the town of Kadaň, Most, Louny and Ústí nad Labem. The aim of this contribution is not a mapping of activities of these fraternities, but a mapping of their donators – it means those burghers, who decided to support the fraternities by a legacy of a part of their property regardless whether they were members of fraternities or just supporters. The method is based on studying burghers´testaments which were preserved in the form of documents or as records in municipal books in the particular localities from the period of the 16 and 17 century. For acquiring enough information on the donators of fraternities we used almost 1800 last wills, when about 5 % of testaments contain legacies to fraternities. The legacies were mostly of financial character. Amounts of money ranged from 2 to 130 threescores (1 threescore= 60 pieces) of Meissen groschen. Some of financial gifts were exactly intended for example for hymnbooks, wax, candles or books. Beside the money there were bequeathed also wages, real estates or beverages (beer, wine). Absolute majority of donators of municipal corporations came from middle class, they were mostly artisans with one house in a town or in a suburb, although legacies from socially lower class were registered too. In the town of Žatec an exceptional situation occured, where donators of literary fraternities came from families materially and intelectually belonging to municipal elites. More than half of donators did not have their own families. Widowed people, particularly widows comprised a distinct proportion among these people. Women comprised a half of donators in all studied towns, sometimes the number of them was slightly higher than a half. Half of the donators bequeathed certain part of their properties to the church, guild, they donated to the hospital or they supported realization of some buildings beneficial for public. For answering question such as how was activity of corporations reflected or appreciated by a municipal community, testaments could give only partial answer.
