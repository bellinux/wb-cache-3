40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> has rapidly risen up the European {{political}} agenda. Using a threefold typology of sex-quotas, this article undertakes a classification of the measures taken by the 15 old E. U. member states to improve the gender balance in representative assemblies. This is then {{used as the basis}} for an exploration of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the parity approach as a tool to promote gender equality, including the constitutional obstacles which stand in its way. The article goes on to present a comparative study of several national systems in which attempts to achieve <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> have been pursued, concluding that, in order to maximise their effectiveness, parity measures must operate within a system of unbiased political structures and be properly adjusted to suit the particularities of individual national electoral regimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} elaborates {{a theoretical}} approximation {{to the subject}} of gender <b>parity</b> and <b>democracy.</b> The study contends that parity serves as an institutional mechanism that helps create a political space for the contestation of gender power relations (génos relations). After examining in detail the definitional borders of democracy and explicating the formation of democratic identity, grounded on Foucault’s notions of power, I analyze génos relations, as social constructions that mold the desires and beliefs of men and women. Accordingly, I explain how democracy needs to provide spaces of deliberation so as to guarantee the possibility for the political discussion of the predominant practices that distinguish male/female interaction. In the conclusion, I make a plea for the essentiality of difference when undertaking the task of analyzing the topics of democracy and gender, supporting the theoretical and practical approaches that propose to create a more democratic world by learning from heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this article}} {{examines}} Parity 2 ̆ 7 s strangeness to United States observers. United States sex discrimination law ignores political representation issues. United States voting rights law contains no provisions for gender inequality. Most importantly, leading United States thinkers of all stripes roundly reject quotas. Part II details the Parity debate {{and its relationship to}} French democracy. The democracies of the United States and of France share Eighteenth Century Enlightenment origins. They also share some form of universalism (labeled “neutrality” in the United States by Cass Sunstein) establishing the equality of all citizens before the law. Parity serves as a good counterpoint to the United States because of similarities between the French and U. S. <b>democracies.</b> <b>Parity</b> aims to reflect a gendered democracy, not institute a quota. France 2 ̆ 7 s universalism refuses even the acknowledgement of the existence of racial, ethnic, or religious minorities, even at the cost of inflaming ethnic inequalities. These elements of France 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of the relationship between democracy and identity (gender or racial), stimulate a revisiting of the quota debate here. Part III turns back to the United States. The United States and France share a fundamental respect for the neutrality of the state with regard to group rights. Parity affords a fresh perspective on the relationship between remedies for group inequality and the neutrality of the state. Inserting fluidity into quotas provides an anti-essentialist method to situate remedies for group inequality {{within the context of the}} neutral state. United States jurisprudence already incorporates some fluidity. Reviewing electoral gender inequality in light of these arguments allows us to revisit descriptive representation, based on the identity of the voter, and interest representation, based on the ideas of the voter. Revisiting descriptive representation suggests that remedies for electoral gender inequality may not foster essentialism or violate neutrality. Parity may not be the right remedy for the United States, but some remedy is required. Instead of relying on dualistic notions that men and women should possess equal political power, remedies should address the gendered nature of electoral power, including the political, as well as cultural, exclusion of women...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{traces the}} French {{construction}} and demonization of American feminism (Le Women’s Lib) by {{a segment of}} the women’s movement and by public left-wing intellectuals. The joining of anti-American and anti-feminist traditions produces a new entity, dubbed French anti-amér-féminisme. The development is traced in the writings of one women’s group, Psychanalyse et Politique, and in the debates around a so-called political correctness (PC). Defend-ing the image of a France distinguished by harmonious gender rapport and relations of seduction, this entity is used as a mechanism to encourage French women to reject feminism or to define a different, homegrown heterosocial version. Using the examples of debates in women’s studies, <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> and sexual harassment, the author demonstrates how anti-amér-féminisme has had material repercussions on French women’s lives, such as limiting the scope of sexual harassment law. KEY WORDS anti-Americanism anti-feminism feminism French feminism French intellectuals <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> political correctness sexual harassment women’s liberation women’s studies As US academic feminists promote a made-in-America French feminism (for critiques, see Moses, 1998; Delphy, 1995; Ezekiel, 1995 a, 1995 b), French intellectuals have constructed – and demonized – a made-in-France Women’s Lib. Few prejudices can be so candidly espoused, be it in the media, Left or Right, in a Latin Quarter cafe, or at a fashionable dinner party chock-full of public intellectuals. Neither anti-Americanism, nor anti-feminism is a new phenomenon. A significant body of literature exists on the history of French anti-Americanism, which goes back nearl...|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} over the past years, in Europe, some {{instruments}} and policies dealing with gender equality both at the national and supra-national level reflect a move from a narrow antidiscrimination frame to a broader model that tackles the underparticipation and disempowerment of women in public and private life as a deficiency of democracy and a problem of citizenship. By analyzing specific parity measures that have been adopted recently in some European Member States, such as electoral and corporate board gender quotas in publically held companies, the Article posits that a new understanding between <b>parity</b> <b>democracy,</b> sex equality and antidiscrimination law is evolving and explains why a combination of legal, historical, cultural, ideological and political factors make it unlikely that a similar development will take place in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, Spain {{has become a}} model in {{legislative}} policies for gender equality at the international level. However, the economic crisis {{has led to a}} growth in inequality, which has revealed the weaknesses of the adopted instruments. Despite the large amount of legislation in this area, the social reality has not changed at all, even experiencing a setback over the past few years. This situation was exposed in our country by a report issued in 2015 by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This report showed the negative effects of the economic crisis and austerity policies on women, even in a context necessitating increased efforts towards women’s rights. Therefore, it is imperative that the concept of gender mainstreaming and the adoption of instruments of “hard law” be revisited. The goal should be to achieve gender justice based on three elements—distribution, identity, and representation—and a real <b>parity</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|E

This book uncovers the dynamics that were at play in the recognition of male and female suffrage rights and in the definition of male and female citizenship in modern Europe. Whilst scholarship on women's suffrage usually focuses on a few emblematic countries, "The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe" casts a comparative look at {{the articulation}} of women's suffrage rights in the countries that now make up the political-unity-in-the-making we call the European Union. The book uncovers the dynamics that were at play in the recognition of male and female suffrage rights and in the definition of male and female citizenship in modern Europe. It allows readers to identify differences and commonalities in the histories of women's disenfranchisement and sheds light on the role suffrage has played in the construction of female citizenship in European countries. It provides the background against which a new European paradigm of <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> is gradually asserting itself...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{apparently}} sharp contrast in the respective state of antidiscrimination law in Europe and the United States at present. In Europe, antidiscrimination norms are proliferating, within both the European Union and the Council of Europe systems, and elaborate networks and programs of implementation are being established and funded. The grounds of discrimination are widening, the norms are being strengthened {{and the new}} laws are being actively litigated. In the United States, by comparison, decades {{of social and political}} backlash have significantly weakened the corpus of antidiscrimination law that emerged from the civil rights movement, and the courts have become an arena for ideological battle. Yet, even if certain juridico-cultural differences in conceptions of equality and discrimination between the two jurisdictions are evident, none of the likely explanations for such a stark contrast between the state of antidiscrimination law and policy in each seems fully convincing. On a closer analysis, it seems that the future of antidiscrimination law and policy in Europe faces equally daunting challenges, even if the body of law in question is decades younger and less tested than its U. S. counterpart. One of the themes emerging from this collection of essays, however, is that there are similarities in the way problems of entrenched inequality are being addressed and in some of the solutions being tested both in the United States and in Europe. In particular, there has been a shift away from traditional judicial remedies and towards renewed administrative as well as other more innovative approaches in both jurisdictions. In the United States, this seems to be prompted in part by disillusionment with the current legal stalemate, while in Europe some of the novel approaches - including the spread of equality bodies, <b>parity</b> <b>democracy,</b> and proactive public duties - are being promoted by international and European institutions...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, at the Millennium Summit at UN {{adopted the}} Millennium Development Goals, which cover global {{problems}} and are {{calculated for the}} period 2000 ­ 2015 years. Ukraine has signed the Millennium Development Goals and {{has taken over the}} political commitment to implement them. One of the goals of this international instrument provides for the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women. Тhe global goals, objectives and indicators adapted to the peculiarities of Ukraine on the basis of national development. For the analysis of qualitative and quantitative measurements of changes in gender conditions in politics and public administration in Ukraine at present of the experts proposed one objectives and three indicators. Objective: To provide a gender ratio of at least 30 to 70 % of either gender in representative bodies and high­level executive. Indicators: 1) Gender ratio among deputies of the Supreme soviet of Ukraine, women / men (or vice versa), and 2) the gender ratio among members of local authorities, women / men (or vice versa), and 3) the gender ratio among senior civil servants (1 ­ 2 categories), women / men (or vice versa). In 2015, Ukraine should report at the United Nations on the implementation of the MDGs. In this paper, the author analyzed the state of gender equality in politics and governance in Ukrainian society. One of the main problems of the present stage of gender equality in politics and public administration in Ukraine the author notes : no systematic gender mainstreaming to implement personnel policies in the civil service at the central and local level; the lack of effective state control over observance of gender equality, not provided the institutional legal mechanisms for gender equality; and without the current regulatory framework on gender turns into an empty declaration; the lack of political will to implement the goals of gender equality. The author of the article provides recommendations on optimal ways of gender <b>parity</b> <b>democracy</b> in Ukraine, in particular: the adoption of the law on gender quotas; review of indicators of gender equality upwards for thorough measurement processes of gender equality in Ukrainian society; massive gender education in Ukrainian society to overcome gender stereotypes; monitoring not only the state but also the public and informing the public annually on the status, problems and measures for gender equality in Ukraine...|$|E
