50|$|The {{propensity}} of a root system {{to develop new}} roots or extend existing roots cannot be determined by eye, yet it is the factor that makes or breaks the outcome of an outplanting operation. The <b>post-planting</b> development of roots or root systems of coniferous planting stock is determined by many factors, some physiological, some environmental. Unsatisfactory rates of <b>post-planting</b> survival unrelated to the morphology of the stock, led to attempts to test the physiological condition of planting stock, particularly to quantify the propensity to produce new root growth. New root growth can be assumed to be necessary for successful establishment of stock after planting, but although the thesis that RGC is positively related to field performance {{would seem to be}} reasonable, supporting evidence has been meager.|$|E
50|$|Fumigation with 1,2-dibromoethane {{can be an}} {{effective}} tool {{to reduce the number of}} Paratylenchus spp. in the soil, but the process typically kills most of the beneficial soil fauna as well (4,12,14). This can have additional negative repercussions on the soil health. Fumigation would also kill the plants you are trying to cultivate, so the soil would need to be fumigated before the planting date. Crop rotation with small grains is also another management tool for Paratylenchus hamatus since they typically parasitize on fruit and vegetable crops (13). For <b>post-planting</b> control some non-fumigant nematicides can be used, but the effectiveness is not always consistent (4).|$|E
5000|$|Planting {{stock is}} always {{subject to a}} variety of {{conditions}} that are never optimal in toto. The effect of sub-optimal conditions is to induce stress in the plants. The nursery manager aims, and is normally able to avoid stresses greater than moderate, i.e., restricting stresses to levels that can be tolerated by the plants without incurring serious damage. The adoption of nursery regimes to equip planting stock with characteristics conferring increased ability to withstand outplanting stresses, by managing stress levels in the nursery to [...] "condition" [...] planting stock to increase tolerance to various <b>post-planting</b> environmental stresses, has become widespread, particularly with containerized stock.|$|E

50|$|B. caryophylli is a soil borne {{bacterium}} that overwinters in the rhizosphere of soil forming close {{interactions with}} the host plant and soil itself. Additionally, it can also survive in infected host debris. B. caryophylli infects susceptible plants through wounds which are present at the base and the crown of the host. The successful dissemination of the bacterial infection can occur Pre and <b>post-planting.</b> Pre-planting dissemination occurs when the stems of Carnation flowers from the infected host are cut {{and placed in a}} water bed with healthy plants, before they are individually planted (the bacteria slowly spreads from one cutting to the next via free water). Because of the possibility of transmission during the latent period, cuttings require cautious cultural measures. <b>Post-planting</b> dissemination may occur from one root system to the next via an existing canker in the infected plant. When the canker, which contains accumulated yellowish-brown bacterial slime, oozes out via an opening, the bacteria is released to the surrounding soil. B. caryophylli cannot travel long distances, and therefore, only infects neighboring plant roots systems. As the root system absorbs the nutrient and water from the soil, it also absorbs the soil-borne bacteria in the soil. Once inside the host, the bacterium aggregates towards the vascular system, finding its way to the phloem. It also blocks the xylem, cutting off the water circulation of the plant. Eventually, the roots are no longer able to anchor properly onto the soil. As the host plant wilts and dies, the bacteria overwinters in the host debris and soil.|$|E
5000|$|Management {{practices}} {{consist of}} exclusion, preventive measures, and <b>post-planting</b> nematicide applications. All growers should avoid contaminated nursery rootstocks and use certified nematode-free soil and nematode-free rootstock (it is obligatory in some areas). Nematodes {{can easily be}} removed from seedlings by dipping the roots in 45 C water for 25 min, this kills the nematodes but does not harm the plant. For cultural practices, the container-grown citrus can be treated with steam and soil solarization. Fumigation and nematicides are used to reduced initial population densities. Halogenated hydro-carbons ( [...] MBr,1-3-D and chloropicin) are the most effective. Resistant rootstocks are available and this management strategy is the most useful to suppress nematode population density. Recently, the hybrid rootstock called Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi x P. trifoliata) is highly resistant to the citrus nematode.|$|E
40|$|Fusarium circinatum is a {{pathogen}} causing serious <b>post-planting</b> {{mortality of}} Pinus patula seedlings in southern Africa. Containerised planting stock that is asymptomatic but associated with F. circinatum {{in the nursery}} {{is thought to be}} the cause of this problem. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if re-use of seedling containers could be a source of inoculum resulting in asymptomatic planting stock and increased <b>post-planting</b> mortality of P. patula. Two experiments were conducted in successive years comparing nursery cull of symptomatic seedlings, seedling growth, association of F. circinatum with asymptomatic seedlings and <b>post-planting</b> mortality for crops raised in re-used containers, with and without sanitation, and factory-new containers. Each experiment consisted of a nursery production trial followed by out-planting into pots to assess <b>post-planting</b> mortality. Our results show that re-use of containers without sanitation increases the cull of symptomatic seedlings, incidence of F. circinatum associated with asymptomatic seedlings and <b>post-planting</b> mortality compared with the re-use of containers after steam sanitation or factory-new containers. Growth of asymptomatic seedlings was unaffected by container treatment or association with F. circinatum and in the absence of wilt symptoms the root system did not exhibit typical discolouration. Watering frequency did not influence <b>post-planting</b> mortality in pots. The comparison of two open-pollinated seed mixes of P. patula that, based on seedling stem inoculation screening, represented susceptible and tolerant material did not show differences in nursery cull or <b>post-planting</b> mortality. This work demonstrated that natural contamination of re-used containers can be a primary source of inoculum producing asymptomatic seedlings associated with F. circinatum that will succumb to the pathogen after field planting. The process of seedling infection, apparent latent infection in the seedling and expression of disease after planting needs greater understanding to improve nursery hygiene measures to control this disease.

40|$|Although plants {{introduced}} for site restoration are pre-selected {{for specific}} traits (e. g. trace element bioaccumulation, {{rapid growth in}} poor soils), the in situ success of these plants likely depends on the recruitment of appropriate rhizosphere microorganisms from their new environment. We introduced three willow (Salix spp.) cultivars to a contaminated landfill, and performed soil chemical analyses, plant measurements, and Ion Torrent sequencing of rhizospheric fungal and bacterial communities at 4 and 16 months <b>post-planting.</b> The abundance of certain dominant fungi was linked to willow accumulation of Zn, the most abundant trace element at the site. Interestingly, total Zn accumulation was better explained by fungal community structure 4 months <b>post-planting</b> than 16 months <b>post-planting,</b> suggesting that initial microbial recruitment may be critical. In addition, when the putative ectomycorrhizal fungi Sphaerosporella brunnea and Inocybe sp. dominated the rhizosphere 4 months <b>post-planting,</b> Zn accumulation efficiency was negatively correlated with fungal diversity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Alternative {{methods to}} control {{invasive}} fodder grasses {{are necessary to}} reduce the use of herbicides in forest restoration, which {{has been carried out}} primarily in riparian zones. We sought to investigate if inter-row cultivation of crotalaria (Crotalaria breviflora DC) or pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duschene ex.

We tested five treatments in a randomized block design, namely (1) control of brachiaria grass (Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) Webster) with glyphosate in the implementation and <b>post-planting</b> grass control of the reforestation, (2 and 3) glyphosate use in the implementation and inter-row sowing of crotalaria (2) or pumpkin (3), and control of brachiaria by mowing in the <b>post-planting</b> phase, (4 and 5) mowing in the implementa-tion and inter-row sowing of crotalaria (4) or pumpkin (5), and control of brachiaria by mowing in the <b>post-planting</b> phase. <b>Post-planting</b> grass control was carried out four and nine months after tree seedling planting. Throughout 13 months, we evaluated the percentage of ground cover by brachiaria grass, pumpkin production, and native tree seedling mortality, height and crown cover. The exclusive use of glyphosate, without inter-row sowing of pumpkin or crotalaria showed the most favorable results for controlling brachiaria grass and, consequently, for tree seedling development.

40|$|Aim of the study: We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of nursery fertilization and <b>post-planting</b> light environment on the growth and survival of out-planted two-year-old yew (Taxus baccata) seedlings. Area of study: <b>Post-planting</b> performance was assessed at two sites in the Valsain Forest (Central Mountain Range, Segovia, Spain). Materials and Methods: Seedlings were grown using the same seed-lot, container type and fertirrigation schedule. A soluble fertilizer with two contrasting doses resulting in 239 and 376 mg N per seedling was applied during the whole culture period. Seedlings grown under {{the highest level of}} fertilization had greater root collar diameter, height, shoot to root ratio, root and shoot mass, and root growth potential before planting. <b>Post-planting</b> performance was assessed at two sites in the Valsain Forest (Central Mountain Range, Segovia, Spain). In each site, seedlings from both fertilization treatments were planted in three plots with contrasting light environment (full sunlight, and under Pinus sylvestris stands with moderate and deep shade conditions). Survival, diameter and height growth were monitored for six years. Main results: Nursery fertilization did not affect survival, but high fertilization enhanced <b>post-planting</b> growth. Survival was highest under deep shade conditions but growth in this microsite was lower than in higher light sites, revealing a trade-off for survival and growth across light levels. Research highlights: The lower fertilization rate used in this study was suitable to produce seedlings with acceptable quality. Planting under shaded conditions (light availability< 30 %) is recommended to maximize the initial success of yew plantations in Mediterranean mountains.

Methods: A field study was conducted in a degraded area near the Balbina hydroelectric dam in Amazonas State (AM), Brazil, to evaluate two hypotheses: (i) leguminous tree species exhibit differences in growth, leaf nutrient content, and photosynthetic nutrient use efficiencies; and (ii) differences in these characteristics depend on the fertilization treatments to which the species have been subjected. Dipteryx odorata, Inga edulis and Schizolobium amazonicum were subjected to the following treatments: (T 1) unfertilized control; (T 2) <b>post-planting</b> chemical fertilization; (T 3) <b>post-planting</b> organic fertilization and (T 4) combined chemical and organic <b>post-planting</b> fertilization.

30|$|Control of {{competing}} vegetation during establishment of forests planted for timber or fibre production {{is the single}} most important treatment affecting tree growth and survival, and therefore crop productivity (Wagner et al. 2006). In New Zealand, herbicides provide the most cost effective means of controlling competing vegetation in commercially planted forests and are currently used for both pre-plant and <b>post-plant</b> vegetation control (Rolando et al. 2011). Despite their importance for effective forest management, there is limited information on the types and amount of herbicide currently used in New Zealand planted forests.

30|$|Glyphosate, {{terbuthylazine}} and hexazinone {{were found}} to be the most widely used active ingredients in pre-plant (glyphosate) and <b>post-plant</b> (terbuthylazine and hexazinone) forest weed control operations. The prohibition of two active ingredients that constitute 50 % of the total amount of herbicide used on planted forest land certified by the FSC would severely impact current forest weed control operations, unless viable, cost effective, alternative weed management options were found. The infrequent use of terbuthylazine and hexazinone within one rotation of approximately 30  years in New Zealand’s planted forests considerably reduces the environmental risk of polluting ground and surface waters. In addition, wide use of spot weed control means the risk of off-site movement of these herbicides is reduced.

We grew one-year-old seedlings of both species under 100, 40 and 5 % full sunlight. Shade had a low impact on the morphology and physiology of Q. ilex seedlings. In pines, only the deep shade treatment produced low quality seedlings with poor root development. In both species, transference to high light at planting in autumn did not impose any additional stress than that caused by frosts, but initial root growth was impaired in the two shaded treatments in pine. <b>Post-planting</b> growth and survival of oak seedlings showed no difference between treatments. Pine seedlings grown in deep shade showed higher mortality and lower growth after planting than those grown in full sun and intermediate light treatments, while intermediate light only reduced growth. For the nursery culture of Q. ilex seedlings, we advise using low light levels during summer to save water without impairing field performance.
