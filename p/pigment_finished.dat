40|$|Natural dyeing is a {{technique}} to dye the textile fabrics with the colours extracted from natural sources like plants, animals and minerals, microorganisms etc. They are eco-friendly, biodegradable and non-carcinogenic in comparison to synthetic dyes. In this research work, the pigment was extracted from Roseomonas fauriae using aqueous media. The dye potential of the extract was evaluated by dyeing on 100 % cotton fabrics under normal dyeing conditions. These findings reveal that the extract of pink pigment {{can be used for}} coloration of 100 % cotton. The relative colour strength of the dye was found to be more in case of cotton clothes mordant with alum. Air permeability of the treated cotton fabric was not much affected by the treatment. The slight decrease in tensile and tear strength was noticed in the treated samples. The aqueous <b>pigment</b> <b>finished</b> fabric has the best fastness criteria to washing. After treatment the stiffness of fabric was moderately increased...|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{comparison}} of the influence two-component and one-component waterborne base coatings on the quality of <b>pigmented</b> <b>finished</b> surface in high gloss. There are analyzed requirements for the mentioned surface treatment and applied coatings in the thesis. Samples preparation, depending on base coating and base material used and determination of the physical-mechanical, chemical and optical properties are indispensable part of the diploma thesis. The selected base coatings are compared {{with each other and with}} commonly used polyester and polyurethane coatings...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{based on}} experimental measurements of previously prepared samples. The samples {{are made of}} beech plywood. They are finished by pickling with various pigments and exposed to daylight in exterior. The thesis investigates influence of colour shade of <b>pigment</b> surface <b>finishing</b> on wood furniture to the physic-mechanical properties of surface finishing but mainly to the temperature of finished surface. Other properties examined are hardness, adhesion, and colour shade, degree of damage and abrasion resistance. The result of thesis is evaluation and description of achievements with the contribution for practice and new findings...|$|R
50|$|Wood can be stained {{to change}} its colour or left unstained before {{application}} of lacquer, or other types of top-coats. Staining should enhance the appearance of wood by reducing colour variation between and within sapwood and heartwood. It also provides a way of giving bland looking woods such as poplar, the appearance of prized furniture woods such as ebony, mahogany or walnut. Wood can be stained using dyes or <b>pigmented</b> <b>finishes.</b> These finishes are available {{in a wide variety}} of colours, many of which are not part of the natural colour palette of wood, for example, blues and greens. Pigmented stains tend to highlight the grain (and also sanding scratches), whereas dyes do not have this effect and are more transparent. Wood can also be coloured by exposing it to chemicals that react with the wood to form coloured compounds. Chemical staining of wood is rarely carried out because it is easier to colour wood using dye or pigmented stain, however, ammonia fuming is a chemical staining method that is still occasionally used to darken woods such as oak that contain a lot of tannins. Staining of wood is difficult to control because some parts of the wood absorb more stain than others, which leads to problems such as blotchiness and streaking. For this reason, as pointed out by Flexner, many people prefer to omit the staining step when finishing wood.|$|R
50|$|Some {{premixed}} acrylic renders have {{a smoother}} complexion than traditional renders. There are also many various acrylic-bound <b>pigmented</b> 'designer' <b>finishing</b> coats {{that can be}} applied over acrylic render. Various finishes, patterns and textures are possible such as sand, sandstone, marble, stone, stone chip, lime wash or clay like finishes. There are stipple, glistening finishes, and those with enhanced water resistance and anti fungal properties. Depending upon the product, they can be rolled, troweled or sponged on. A limited number can also be sprayed on. Acrylic renders take only 2 days to dry and cure - much faster than the 28 days for traditional render.|$|R
5000|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} that can either {{strengthen}} the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to <b>pigments</b> and other <b>finishes</b> from aqueous treatments. Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away. The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible. [...] The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} colour assays were {{conducted}} {{taking into account}} old bibliographic recommendations and oral testimony regarding traditional lime painting technology from the Alentejo (South Portugal) region. The main objectives were: (a) the colorimetric analysis of paintings made with different limewash preparation methods; (b) the comparison between natural processed red and yellows ochre pigments (‘‘home made’’ and from industrial origin) and synthetic iron oxides in different concentrations and lime proportions; (c) {{the evaluation of the}} colorimetric CIELAB coordinates during the lime carbonation process in coloured mortars and limewashes. The results shows that the evolution of L*, a*, and b* during the carbonation process is independent of pigment concentration and paint thickness but dependent of <b>pigment</b> composition and <b>finishing</b> technique (lime painting or coloured mortar). They also emphasize the importance of surface appearance attributes and its influence on the colorimetric parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{some of the}} {{research}} and development being undertaken as part of Meat and Livestock Australia's Sheepmeat Eating Quality Program. Some of the main outcomes of {{the research}} are outlined: • A system for describing the consumer-defined eating quality of sheep meat is described where the sensory attributes of the cooked meat are defined on a scale of 0 to 100. • Studies over a broad range of sheep ages have shown that loin tenderness declines with increasing animal age in a predictable way but liking of flavour is less affected by age, resulting in acceptable consumer scores even for older sheep (mutton) when cuts are denuded of fat. The difference between carryover lamb and mutton for overall consumer scores is about 8 to 10 points. • The effects of animal age on sensory ratings are significant in the sucker lamb ® carryover lamb ® hogget transition. Suckers lambs have a superior consumer score with little difference between carryover lamb and hogget (for loin and outside cuts). However, loin meat from hoggets was consistently darker due to an increased content of myoglobin (the major muscle <b>pigment).</b> • <b>Finishing</b> lambs on actively growing pasture (legume/grass based) versus balanced grain-based rations did not affect consumer score of grilled denuded loins. That is, grass-finished eating quality = grain-finished eating quality. • Allowing finished lambs to lose weight for 2 weeks prior to slaughter resulted in meat with reduced muscle glycogen, increased pHu and reduced consumer scores for juiciness and liking of flavour...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{substantiate}} the conditions for synthesis of the pigments with increased chromatic, mechanical, physical-chemical, thermic and operating properties and to develop the new energy-saving technology of their production. The new conditions for synthesis of the pigments with increased qualities have been substantiated, the new mechanic-chemical conception of the activation at "dry" procedure of the charge preparation that provided the special-strength initial physical-chemical bonds has been proposed. The pigments possessing the high commercial competitive power at production of the glaze covers for ceramics and other building materials have been created. The energy-saving technology reducing {{the duration of the}} production cycle and providing the increase of the power consumptions has been introduced. The results have been introduced at the Voronezh Ceramic Works, Kuchinsky Integrated Ceramic Works, Scientific-Production Association "Stroykeramika". In comparison with progressive technology for 1 t of the <b>finished</b> <b>pigment</b> the electric power consumption is reduced by 40 %, steam by 100 %, water by 80 %, labour input by 30; the yield of the pigments was increasedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The purple {{color of}} the caryopses in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{is an example of}} the countless {{diversity}} of the Mother Nature. Red and white caryopses are typical in common wheat. Genotypes with purple caryopses are also described. This coloring is caused by anthocyanins which deposit in the pericarp (purple). The anthocyanins biosynthetic pathway is well described. The key enzyme is chalcone synthase (CHS). It catalyzes the first step. We observed the deposition of anthocyanins in the pericarp, the expression of a chalcone synthase gene and the amount of the major anthocyanin - cyanidin- 3 -glycoside (pericarp of purple caryopses) and delphinidin 3 gycoside during caryopsis development. Purple pigment deposition was not homogeneous and/or uniform. At first, small isolated spots of purple color were formed and thereafter they expanded. The expression of chalcone synthase mRNA occurred five days before <b>pigment</b> deposition and <b>finished</b> earlier than expected. Amounts of cyanidin- 3 -glycoside increased continuously. Amounts of these fell at the end of caryopses development probably due to formation of more complex substances, process which is described as copigmentation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in perfluoropolyether (PFPE) resin technology for high solids, weather resistant polyurethanes for automotive (OEM) and heavy duty coatings are presented. In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed hexamethylene diisocyanate/isophorone diisocyanate (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. Clearcoats were applied over conventional OEM basecoats (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and mar resistance and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent stain release properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE. White <b>pigmented,</b> high gloss <b>finishes</b> were also prepared and evaluated as protective barrier coating for heavy duty paints working in highly corrosive environments...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemistry-based {{technologies}} are very promising {{methods for treating}} wastewaters containing organic and inorganic pollutants that are either resistant to biological processes or toxic for microorganisms [1]. On the other hand, in the reverse electrodialysis (RED), the electrical energy is directly extracted from chemical potential gradients arising from salinity differences [2], especially between brine solution and sea water. RED can be potentially used for the simultaneous {{generation of electrical energy}} and the treatment of waters contaminated by recalcitrant pollutants. The advantages of using the RED process for such dual purpose are: the utilization of a green reagent such as the electron, a good removal of numerous refractory pollutants, the lower requirements for transporting or stocking chemical reagents and the generation of electric energy The selection of the redox process is very important in order to obtain a good performance of RED. In this work, some redox processes have been investigated in a RED stack, with the main objective of obtaining a complete mineralization of an organic pollutant in an aqueous solution. A first chosen pollutant was Acid Orange 7 (AO 7), a largely used azoic dye. The mineralization of this pollutant can be achieved by: (i) electro-Fenton process, (ii) electrogenerated active chlorine at DSA anodes, and (iii) a system that combines both processes. The last part of this work was focused on the study of the RED process to remove hexavalent chromium, which is produced by textile, metal <b>finishing,</b> <b>pigment</b> industries and so on [3]. The electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI) (using a solution containing K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and Na 2 SO 4) to Cr(III) ions was investigated using graphite felt as the electrode. The experiments were carried out in a divided electrochemical cell, as well as in a stack equipped with 10 - 40 cells pairs...|$|R
