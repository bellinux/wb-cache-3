40|$|During {{the last}} decade, a rapid {{progress}} has been made in the development of validated analytical models for the thermal and mechanica 1 behaviour of fire exposed structures and structural members. In a long-term perspective, the development now goes towards an analytical design, directly based on a natural fire exposure and specified with respect to the combustion characteristics of the fire load and the geometrical,ventilation, and thermal properties of the fire compartment. Internationally, the development then includes a probabilistic approach, based either on a system of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> or the <b>safety</b> index concept. The paper describes the basic characteristics of an analytical method for a structural fire engineering design starting from the natural fire exposure and related to the semi-probabilistic approach via <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The consequences of a structural failure are considered by dividing the structures or structural members into categories with a differentiation with regard to the design fire load density and length of fire exposure.

40|$|Recommendations for {{dimensioning}} of {{pile foundations}} for noise protection walls in embankments were proposed. This report combines findings {{from various sources}} and offers a semi-empirical dimensioning process. In a study of literature, model tests, large-scale tests, dimensioning methods based on test loads and various theoretical models were analysed. Furthermore, a few model tests were carried out to verify the kinematics. The safety concept accordingto the new DIN 1054 (draft of 14 / 08 / 92) was taken into consideration. Subsequently a dimensioning method was proposed and checked {{by means of a}} data bank established within the framework of this study. The proposed dimensioning method is based on a bearing capacity corresponding to the ultimate limit state of construction parts. It was established that the serviceability limit state can be covered with the <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> and with a load increase factor by means of the verification of the bearing capacity so that the permanent tilting after 10. 000 load cycles is smaller than 1 %. Verification of overall stability is not necessary according to a simple comparative analysis by Vogt. The proposed dimensioning process was described in the following chapters: application limits, soil parameters, verification of bearing capacity, verification of serviceability, procedure in dimensioning, calculation examples.

40|$|One of {{the failure}} {{mechanisms}} of a rubble mound breakwater is the failure of its armour layer.

In a deterministic calculation this uncertainty is being left to engineering judgment, as the possible variations of the design wave height are not taken into account in a coherent way. In order to explicitly incorporate uncertainties into the design process, and therefore increase its reliability, probabilistic design methods should be applied. A commonly used approach is a semi-probabilistic computation, which introduces the application of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Nevertheless the indicated methods to derive and apply them do not clarify the uncertainties incorporated, adding an undefined degree of safety in the process, or end up with incorrect results under certain conditions.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{structural}} codes the safety verification {{is based on}} a linear analysis of the structure and the satisfaction of ultimate and serviceability limit states, using a semi-probabilistic security format through the consideration of <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> factors, which affect the action values and the characteristic values of the material properties. In this context, if a non-linear structural analysis is wanted a difficulty arises, because the global <b>safety</b> <b>coefficient,</b> which could be obtained in a straightforward way from the non-linear analysis, is not directly relatable to the different <b>safety</b> <b>coefficient</b> values usually used for the different materials, as is the case for reinforced concrete structures. The work here presented aims to overcome this difficulty by proposing a methodology that generalises the format of safety verification based on <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> factors, well established in structural codes within the scope of linear analysis, for cases where non-linear analysis is needed.

However it is not commonly used, {{due to the fact that}} there are not straight forward guidelines to support it, and therefore a number of critical decisions by the designers are required. The main objective of this study is to indicate the weaknesses of the existing design methods, and to suggest a design approach that is both attractive to designers and sufficiently reliable. This is achieved through application of the existing methods in an example case, whose features facilitates a critical assessment, and enables formulation of an improved approach. The chosen case is the jetties at the entrance of Galveston port, in the Gulf of Mexico, and the features of interest are the hurricane-dominated hydraulic climate and the fact that the structure is located in shallow water, meaning that the design load is determined by depth-limited waves. The design methods that are demonstrated are a classical deterministic design, a semi-probabilistic calculation on level 1 as proposed by PIANC in 1992, and a fully probabilistic calculation on level 3 with a Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the evaluation of the three design processes and the results, the new approach can be developed, which suggests a rational framework for deriving safety factors. According to it, a set of safety factors is generated which incorporate the same uncertainties as a fully probabilistic design; hence an equally reliable result is extracted. The final product is a guideline for code makers indicating the procedure to derive the safety factors and a guideline for future designers indicating the analytic steps for a proper use of the safety factors. In addition a large number of concluding remarks are summarized, which can contribute in optimizing the performed analysis. The concluding remarks refer in particular to the determination of hydraulic boundary conditions, the application of the design methods, the probabilistic model used for Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed design approach, and the safety factors derived with this approach.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{relatively}} broad statistical survey utilising the statistical data collected in the national accident database, Pronto. In this work, based on the available statistical data, a general view of the anatomy of fires is established and valuable information relating to fire risks and quantitative methods for the risk-assessment of buildings presented. This work is a step forward {{in the field of}} risk-analysis-based fire safety design and overall a step towards {{a better understanding of the}} anatomy of fires. The use of statistical information is a good objective way of attempting to characterise fires. This study concentrates on ignition frequency, economic fire losses and fire department operation in the event of building-fires. Ignition frequency was derived as a function of total floor area for different building categories. The analysis showed that the variations of ignition frequency are dependent on initial floor area distributions of the buildings hit by fire and at risk. For engineering design purposes, the generalisation of the theory starting from the initial floor area distributions, leading to a sum of two power laws, was found suitable. The parameters and <b>partial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the model were estimated for three building groups. The model is suitable for determining the ignition frequency of buildings with a total floor area of between 100 and 20   000 m 2. The elements describing the fire department operation were analysed on the basis of statistical information. In the presented approach, the buildings in which fire safety depends completely on automatic extinguishing systems can be distinguished from those in which the fire department is able to arrive at the fire scene early enough to have a good chance of saving the building. The most important factor affecting the performance of the rescue force was found to be the travel time to the fire scene. Thus, to make the task easier for the fire department, special attention must be paid to rapid fire detection and locating of the fire seat. Delays in these actions lengthen the total response time and reduce significantly the chances of the fire department successfully intervening in the progress of the fire. Economic losses were considered as consequences of the fires. The analysis showed the dependency of loss and value-at-risk of the building on the floor area. Clear local peaks were detected for both the ignition frequency and fire losses. A more detailed analysis of residential buildings where the phenomenon was most apparent revealed that the peaks were located around the floor-area region where the dominant building type of the building stock, and thus the compartmentation manner, changed. With small values of the total floor area of the building, the rise of the loss was very steep, but levelled off to substantially slower growth with large values. A natural explanation for the behaviour is compartmentation. Both the ignition frequency and the fire losses should therefore be examined in relation to the size of the ignition compartment, which would be a significantly more appropriate descriptor than the total floor area of the building. Hence, it is essential that the information becomes available to the Finnish accident database, in which it is not at the moment included. The analysis shows that the type of building and compartmentation, rather than the material of the load-bearing member itself, was the factor having the greatest effect on the risk of fire. The use of the information gathered was demonstrated through a simple example case in which the fire risk was assessed using the time-dependent event-tree approach. This study concentrates on the utilisation of statistics to collect information and gain an understanding of the elements affecting fire risks in buildings. Many of the methods used are well known in other application areas; the available statistical data now offers the possibility of applying them in connection with fire-risk problems as well. In risk-analysis-based design, the presented approach is very useful and the methods can be used for fire-risk assessment of buildings. Nevertheless, this study should be considered the first part of a major research effort and further studies will be needed to improve the tentative models to obtain more detailed and reliable risk estimates. In this work a preliminary exploration is carried out and a good base for further research is established. reviewe...|$|R
