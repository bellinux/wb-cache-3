40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{contains}} {{general information}} on <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> concerning the existing standards, emissions, exposure levels and effect levels. Since <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> will rapidly hydrolyse to o-phthalic acid {{in the presence}} of water, this reaction product is included in the evaluation. In general data on <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> are very scarce and incomplete, hampering a sound risk evaluation. In the Netherlands the registered emissions (0. 57 tonne per year) are small (0. 0005 %) compared with the amount of <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> produced, imported and applied (approx. 110, 000 tonnes per year). For the general population, inhalation is considered the most likely exposure route. In one limited 8 -month study with guinea pigs a LO(A) EL of 8, 500 mug. m- 3 was derived for <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Based on the registrated emissions the exposure levels will not likely exceed the 1 mug. m- 3 level. From this one may conclude that the risk of inhalatory outdoor exposure to <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> to the general population seems to be small, if present at all. As to oral exposure, an tentative toxicological limit value of 0. 375 mg. kg- 1 bw per day NO(A) EL was derived from a two-year carcinogenicity study, applying a large safety factor (1, 000). This tentative toxicological limit value {{is not likely to be}} exceeded. No data are available on the toxicity of <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and its main conversion product, o-phthalic acid, to aquatic and terrestrial species. Data on the occurrence in the environment in the Netherlands are scanty. <b>Phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> has been reported to hydrolyze very rapidly (estimated half-life of approx. 1. 5 minutes). Consequently, its product is biodegraded rapidly as well. Taking into account the emission figures the risk for aquatic and terrestrial life is expected to be small. It is concluded that <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> does not seem to present a significant risk to humans or ecosystems in the Netherlands. Therefore it is recommended not to stimulate in depth studies on <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> but to remove <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> from the attention substances list...|$|R

Arithmetic mean exposure levels to TMA and MA in the resin factories were well below their respective OESs.

Water proved to be an efficient bifunctional CTA affording a,¿-hydroxyl-terminated polyesters without loss of catalytic activity. When CO 2 was introduced as additional monomer to CHO and the anhydrides, both 1 and 2 in combination with DMAP as cocatalyst afforded perfect poly(ester-co-carbonate) s.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of controlling the selectivity of a partial oxidation reaction by simultaneous modulation of local oxygen concentration and coolant temperature {{along the length of}} a reactor. The microstructured membrane reactor (MMR) concept consists of an oxygen-permeable membrane for distributing the oxygen feed with the coolant channel divided into zones of different temperatures. The reactor concept was explored in simulation of the selective oxidation of o-xylene to <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (<b>PA).</b> A mathematical model of the reactor was developed and optimization performed with the objective of maximising PA selectivity at the reactor outlet. Dosing of oxygen at uniform wall temperature results in PA selectivity increase by 6. 3 %, albeit with a reduction in o-xylene conversion of about 8 % compared to a conventional fixed bed reactor. However, simultaneous modulation of both reactor wall temperatures and local oxygen concentration results in an improved conversion of o-xylene without a detrimental effect on selectivity, thus giving maximum yield of PA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the anti-allergy activities of persimmon leaf extract (PLE) on a <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (<b>PA)</b> -induced allergic mouse model. A human leukemic mast cell line (HMC- 1) was used to examine the inhibitory activity of PLE on the histamine release by human leukemic mast cells. PLE inhibited histamine release from HMC- 1 cells in response to cross-linkage of high-affinity IgE receptor-α (FcεRIα). Additio-nally, a PA-induced allergic mouse model was used to investigate the effects of PLE in vivo. Mice were orally administrated with or without PLE of single dose (250 mg/kg/day) for 31 days. Oral intake of PLE significantly inhibited passive cutaneous reactions. Oral administration of PLE to PA-induced allergic mice also led to a striking suppression of the development of contact dermatitis, ear swelling and lymph node weight. In addition, PA-specific IL- 4 production of draining lymph node cells was markedly diminished by PLE oral administration, but not IFN-γ. Furthermore, PLE treatment suppressed PA-induced thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL 17) and cuta-neous T cell-attracting chemokine (CCL 27) expressions in ear tissues.
