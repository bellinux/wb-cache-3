40|$|One of {{the early}} {{decisions}} facing a regulator {{in the context of}} an open access Next Generation Access networks (NGA) is the location <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to that NGA. This decision is one which needs to take into account the scope of the natural monopoly associated with an NGA and the extent to which there is the potential for competitive supply of transmission services (or backhaul) from access seeker <b>points</b> <b>of</b> presence to the NGA. The Australian NGA is called the National Broadband Network (NBN). This paper starts with the research question, where are the optimum sites for <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to the Australian NBN?. The paper commences by describing the architecture of the Australian NBN and considering some of the issues which arise from the fact that it is designed to be ubiquitous. The paper considers the issues that need to be considered in determining the extent to which there is a natural monopoly in transmission services as well as the effects on outcomes that arise from the existing deployment of infrastructure associated with the delivery of digital subscriber line broadband services based on unbundled local loops and line sharing services. The paper then moves to consider the requirements for consideration in the Australian regulatory context. This is summarised by the phrase long-term interests of end-users and the paper considers the interpretation of this phrase in the context of decisions on the number and location <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection.</b> There is a review of the nature and extent to which operators in Australia contributed to the deliberations of the Australian regulator in determining the location <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection.</b> In turn the paper then describes the actual approach taken in respect of the Australian NBN and the rationale behind those decisions. The final part of the paper describes the decision that was taken along with the rationale. It also examines the subsequent positions taken by stakeholders in respect <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to the Australian NBN.

30|$|Modern power systems, {{employing}} {{an increasing}} number of converter-based renewable energy sources (RES) and decreasing the usage of conventional power plants, are leading to lower levels of short-circuit power and rotational inertia. A solution to this is the employment of synchronous condensers in the grid, in order to provide sufficient short-circuit power. This results in the increase of the short-circuit ratio (SCR) at transmission system bus-bars serving as <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> (POI) to renewable generation. Evaluation of the required capacity and grid-location of the synchronous condensers, is inherently a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which could not be done on manual basis considering each type of machine and all bus-bars. This study therefore proposes a method of optimal allocation of synchronous condensers in a hypothetic future scenario of a transmission system fed by renewable generation. Total cost of synchronous condenser installations in the system is minimized and the SCRs at the POIs of central renewable power plants are strengthened. The method has potential for application on larger grids, aiding grid-integration of RES.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel coordinated {{control method}} is {{proposed}} {{to handle the}} negative voltage impacts on weak sub-transmission systems, which are caused by wind power fluctuations. Firstly, wind variations are divided into large and small fluctuations. Then, according to the different control characteristics of on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and static compensators (STATCOMs), the OLTCs are used to minimize the impacts caused by large fluctuations, while the STATCOMs are used to eliminate the impacts introduced by small fluctuations. The model predictive control (MPC) and a consensus based distributed control techniques are adopted to design the control schedules of OLTCs and STATCOMs, respectively. It is shown that by the coordination of OLTCs and STATCOMs, voltage violations <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> (POIs) are eliminated, and voltage fluctuations at unregulated load buses are mitigated. The effectiveness of our proposed control scheme is presented through a case study on the modified IEEE 14 -bus test system with a real wind power profile. According to the simulation results, {{it turns out that}} the proposed approach can reduce the operation number of OLTCs significantly, and decrease the required capacity of STATCOMs dramatically by comparison with the existing control scheme. ¬© 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.
