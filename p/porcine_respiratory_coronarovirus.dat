In the present study, the affinity for a crude preparation of <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract mucus of isolates of the Pasteurellaceae family, i. e., Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella spp., and of some unrelated gram-negative bacteria was examined. Affinity for crude <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract mucus was not a property shared by all Pasteurellaceae isolates tested. Furthermore, affinity for the porcine crude mucus preparation was not unique to the Pasteurellaceae group and {{did not seem to}} be restricted to bacteria originating from pigs. Different surface properties of A. pleuropneumoniae isolates in relation to their adherence to crude mucus were examined. The capsular layer seemed to mask the adhesin and interfered with adherence to crude mucus. Two poorly capsulated isolates, which had a more hydrophobic surface and bound Congo red, were also heavily labeled by gold particles coated with polymyxin, which is known to interact with the lipid A-core region of LPS, and adhered strongly to respiratory tract secretions. Tetramethylurea, charged polymers, divalent cations, chelators, monosaccharides and amino sugars, or lectins were unable to inhibit adherence of A. pleuropneumoniae to the crude mucus preparation. To identify the receptor(s) recognized by the lipopolysaccharidic adhesin of A. pleuropneumoniae, affinity chromatography was used.

40|$|Feral swine (Sus scrofa) are {{considered}} an invasive species that {{is comprised of}} the wild descendants of domestic swine, European wild boar, and hybrids of these two species. Feral swine were historically associated with the major river drainages in Coastal South Carolina. However, natural range expansion and human release and relocation of feral swine appear to be sources of their expansion into areas not previously occupied. Although an exact estimate of feral swine population numbers is not available, in 2006 feral swine were reported in 42 of 46 South Carolina counties, compared to 46 of 46 counties reporting feral swine activity in 2011. Feral swine can serve as reservoirs {{for a number of}} diseases including pseudorabies, swine brucellosis (Brucella spp.), <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> and reproductive syndrome and porcine circovirus which may be passed to livestock and, in some cases, native wildlife and humans. The National Wildlife Disease Program within the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services conducted serologic surveys for pseudorabies virus, brucellosis, porcine circovirus, and <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> and reproductive syndrome virus in South Carolina feral pig populations from 2007 - 2012. During that period, we opportunistically sampled and collected serum from 545 feral pigs. Overall, 111 of 544 (20. 40 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to pseudorabies, 87 of 545 (15. 96 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to brucellosis, 171 of 306 (55. 88 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to porcine circovirus, and seven of 312 (2. 24 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> and reproductive syndrome. Positive cases of pseudorabies and brucellosis were spatially limited to populations closely associated with the major river drainages in Coastal South Carolina. These positive cases of pseudorabies and brucellosis were found in areas of long established pig populations. The seven positive cases of <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> and reproductive syndrome were limited to one geographic cluster within the Congaree and Wateree river confluence and two clusters along the PeeDee River Drainage.

40|$|Pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{initially}} replicates in the <b>porcine</b> upper <b>respiratory</b> tract. It easily invades the mucosae and submucosae {{for subsequent}} {{spread throughout the}} body via blood vessels and nervous system. In this context, PRV developed ingenious processes to overcome different barriers such as epithelial cells and the basement membrane. Another important but often overlooked barrier is the substantial mucus layer which coats the mucosae. However, {{little is known about}} how PRV particles interact with <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus. We therefore measured the barrier properties of <b>porcine</b> tracheal <b>respiratory</b> mucus, and investigated the mobility of nanoparticles including PRV in this mucus. We developed an in vitro model utilizing single particle tracking microscopy. Firstly, the mucus pore size was evaluated with polyethylene glycol coupled (PEGylated) nanoparticles and atomic force microscope. Secondly, the mobility of PRV in <b>porcine</b> tracheal <b>respiratory</b> mucus was examined and compared with that of negative, positive and PEGylated nanoparticles. The pore size of <b>porcine</b> tracheal <b>respiratory</b> mucus ranged from 80 to 1500 nm, with an average diameter of 455 ± 240 nm. PRV (zeta potential: - 31. 8 ± 1. 5 mV) experienced a severe obstruction in <b>porcine</b> tracheal <b>respiratory</b> mucus, diffusing 59 -fold more slowly than in water. Similarly, the highly negatively (- 49. 8 ± 0. 6 mV) and positively (36. 7 ± 1. 1 mV) charged nanoparticles were significantly trapped. In contrast, the nearly neutral, hydrophilic PEGylated nanoparticles (- 9. 6 ± 0. 8 mV) diffused rapidly, with the majority of particles moving 50 -fold faster than PRV. The mobility of the particles measured was found to be related but not correlated to their surface charge. Furthermore, PEGylated PRV (- 13. 8 ± 0. 9 mV) was observed to diffuse 13 -fold faster than native PRV. These findings clearly show that the mobility of PRV was significantly hindered in <b>porcine</b> tracheal <b>respiratory</b> mucus, and that the obstruction of PRV was due to complex mucoadhesive interactions including charge interactions rather than size exclusion...|$|R

40|$|Pseudorabies virus (PrV) and swine {{influenza}} virus (SIV) both initiate their {{infection in the}} respiratory mucosa. Crossing the mucus layer which covers the respiratory mucosa is a crucial step for the mucosal invasion of PrV and SIV. In this thesis, interactions of PrV and SIV with <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus were investigated, and the association between the viral behavior in mucus and the viral pathogenesis was discussed. In the first part, it is demonstrated whether and how PrV invades the host via mucus barrier. We first set up a virus tracking model using single particle tracking. The diffusion of PrV in mucus was determined and {{compared with that of}} negatively, positively and neutrally charged nanoparticles. It was shown that PrV was almost completely obstructed, with 96 % of viral particles being immobilized in the <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus. The negatively and positively charged particles were similarly trapped, in contrast to the neutral particles that moved freely. This suggests that immobilization of PrV was at least partly due to charge-charge interactions between its surface proteins and mucus. Since PrV had difficulties in crossing the mucus barrier, we further identified which component mediates the interactions, by using an explant model. We found that MUC 5 AC was a dominant mucin expressed in the apical epithelium. The content of MUC 5 AC on the apical epithelium was inversely related to the attachment and infection of PrV to/in porcine trachea explants, suggesting an important role of MUC 5 AC in blocking PrV to reach the epithelium. The MUC 5 AC present above the epithelium was able to block more than 50 % of virus infection, which further confirmed a strong inhibition of respiratory mucus against PrV infection. However, the mucus barrier could be overcome by PrV at low temperature (4 oC), determined by a virus-mucus binding system, a virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system and the explant model. We found that, compared to 37 oC, less viral particles were bound to the respiratory mucus at 4 oC, which resulted in deeper viral penetration in mucus, leading to a higher percentage of PrV that overcame the mucus of the explants and caused infection eventually. These results may explain winter seasonality of PrV infection. In the second part, single particle tracking and the virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system were applied to track SIV H 1 N 1 in <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus. Results showed that 70 % of SIV particles were entrapped, while the rest diffused freely in mucus. In addition, SIV was partially able to penetrate through the respiratory mucus over time. Moreover, both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration were enhanced by the addition of exogenous neuraminidase, while they were in contrast diminished by the use of a neuraminidase inhibitor, indicating that neuraminidase helps SIV to move through the <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus. In summary, PrV was highly hindered in <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> mucus. Thus, it may depend on mucus defects or physiological changes which for example may be caused by low temperature to invade the mucus barrier. On the other hand, SIV has evolved to produce neuraminidase which is able to release SIV particles which may be bound to mucins, thereby enabling the virus to move through the respiratory mucus. The in-depth investigation of virus-mucus interaction may provide novel insights into the study of prophylactic treatment for {{swine influenza}} and Aujeszky’s diseas...|$|R

However, the replication efficiencies of influenza viruses from various hosts, {{as well as the}} expression of sialic acid (Sia) receptor variants in the entire <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract have never been studied in detail. Therefore, we established porcine nasal, tracheal, bronchial and lung explants, which cover the entire <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract with maximal similarity to the in vivo situation. Subsequently, we assessed virus yields of three porcine, two human and six AIVs in these explants. Since our results on virus replication were in disagreement with the previously reported presence of putative avian virus receptors in the trachea, we additionally studied the distribution of sialic acid receptors by means of lectin histochemistry. Human (Siaα 2 - 6 Gal) and avian virus receptors (Siaα 2 - 3 Gal) were identified with Sambucus Nigra and Maackia amurensis lectins respectively. Results Compared to swine and human influenza viruses, replication of the AIVs was limited in all cultures but most strikingly in nasal and tracheal explants. Results of virus titrations were confirmed by quantification of infected cells using immunohistochemistry. By lectin histochemistry we found moderate to abundant expression of the human-like virus receptors in all explant systems but minimal binding of the lectins that identify avian-like receptors, especially in the nasal, tracheal and bronchial epithelium. Conclusions The species barrier that restricts the transmission of influenza viruses from one host to another remains preserved in our <b>porcine</b> <b>respiratory</b> explants. Therefore this system offers a valuable alternative to study virus and/or host properties required for adaptation or reassortment of influenza viruses. Our results indicate that, based on the expression of Sia receptors alone, the pig is unlikely to be a more appropriate mixing vessel for influenza viruses than humans.

For tilmicosin, the three batches were found to consist of a mix of susceptible and resistant isolates.

Neither the A. pleuropneumoniae ΔexbB mutant nor the double ΔureC ΔexbB mutant was able to colonize sufficiently long to initiate a detectable humoral immune response.
