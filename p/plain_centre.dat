During this time in which Forest Hills was mostly Irish-Catholic, two public schools operated within its borders: the Parkman and the Seaver. [...] Students at these schools were mostly Black and Latino, reflecting the composition of Jamaica Plain as a whole. [...] They travelled back and forth in yellow school buses and there was little interaction between these schools and the all-White residents of the area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- An {{attempt is}} made to solve {{problems}} in the process flow in an alternator production plant. The plant had to outsource their partially machined shaft for tapper grinding for a certain rating of alternator. A small study was conducted for identifying is there any opportunity to do the operation within the plant. Next approach was {{to solve the problem}} with in the plant's available resource, with high quality and law cost. Machining time and labour cost was calculated. Finally the profit of the company for {{a certain period of time}} is calculated within the available data's. This attempt helped us to know about the production process of different rated alternators, working of different departments in the firm, problems faced by a company. This machine is used to produce external cylindrical surface. The surfaces may be straight, tapered, steps or profiled. Broadly there are three different types of cylindrical grinding machine as follows: 1. <b>Plain</b> <b>centre</b> type cylindrical grinder 2. Universal cylindrical surface grinder 3.

50|$|Established as {{a working}} dairy farm in 1914, the Emu Plains Prison Farm {{accommodated}} male inmates {{as part of a}} process of rehabilitation through farming.

In 1996 a women's and children's program was established that permitted inmates to maintain closer contact with their children. The program allows some children to stay with their mother in custody and also allows inmates to make recordings of book readings for their children.|$|R

In 1862 a public house was built there, called the One Tree Inn and the locality developed as a coach changing-stage and watering-place between the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers. One Tree village was surveyed and proclaimed in 1882, though the location remained as just an amenity on the <b>plain,</b> <b>centred</b> on the hotel.|$|R

In addition to the localities of Goyder and Beaufort, most of Nantawarra lies within the Hundred of Goyder.

50|$|Slavic peoples {{settled in}} the Balkan region {{including}} Macedonia by the late 6th century AD. During the 580s, Byzantine literature attests to the Slavs raiding Byzantine territories {{in the region of}} Macedonia, later aided by Bulgars.

Presian's reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. The Slavic peoples that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar Boris I of Bulgaria.|$|R

50|$|Three main {{grassland}} types {{occur in}} the Canadian prairies: tallgrass prairie, mixed grass prairie, and fescue prairie (or using the WWF terminology, northern tall grasslands, northern mixed grasslands, and northern short grasslands). Each has a unique geographic distribution and characteristic mix of plant species. All but a fraction {{of one percent of}} the tallgrass prairie has been converted to cropland. What remains occurs on the 6000 km2 <b>plain</b> <b>centred</b> in the Red River Valley in Manitoba. Mixed prairie is more common and is part of the dry interior plains that extend from Canada south to the U.S. state of Texas. More than half of the remaining native grassland in the Canadian prairies is mixed. Though widespread in southern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, because of extensive cattle grazing, it is estimated that only 24% of the original mixed prairie grassland remains. Fescue prairie occurs in the moister regions, occupying the northern extent of the prairies in central and southwestern Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan.|$|R
