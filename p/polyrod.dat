50|$|The antenna of the FuG 224 was unusual, a four element Dielektrische Strahler or <b>polyrod</b> (British) array. Capture of the {{magnetron}} {{had allowed}} {{the development of}} the Naxos radar detector as a countermeasure to it. This had been the first equipment to use a <b>polyrod</b> antenna. Each rod is a tapering end-fed rod made of a polystyrene dielectric. The four array elements were 3 λ long and spaced 1.5 λ apart. Using this array, rather than a parabolic dish, gave an extremely compact antenna, with only a shallow protrusion, which was well-suited for aircraft carriage, particularly when needed to rotate. The array could rotate at the high speed of 400 rpm, fast enough that the PPI display did not require the usual long persistence phosphor.|$|E
50|$|As the British {{engineers}} had predicted, {{it took the}} Germans two years to complete development of magnetron based radars. The first to reach operation in early 1945 was the FuG 240 Berlin, an Airborne Interception radar {{very similar to the}} British AI Mk. VIII. By this time the country was already in a shambles, and Berlin never entered service. Several other units developed from the same basic systems were also introduced but saw limited or no service. One advancement made by the Germans during this period was a new type of antenna using a dialectic to shape the output, known in the UK as a <b>polyrod.</b>|$|E
50|$|Germany {{built the}} Wullenweber {{circular}} array for direction finding {{during the early}} years of World War II. The Wullenweber could electronically scan the horizon 360° and determine the direction of any signal with reasonably good accuracy. Circular arrays were enhanced during the Cold War for eavesdropping purposes.The American Physicist Luis Walter Alvarez developed the first ground-controlled approach (GCA) system for landing aircraft in bad weather based on an electronically steered microwave phased array antenna. Alvarez tested and deployed the system in England in 1943. Near the end of the war, Germany’s GEMA built an early warning phased array radar system (the PESA Mammut 1) to detect targets up to 300 km away. The <b>polyrod</b> fire control antenna was developed by Bell Laboratories in 1947 using cascaded phase shifters controlled by a rotary switch (spinning at ten revolutions per second) to create a continuous scanning beam.|$|E
40|$|Antenna {{systems for}} a Ku-band {{synchronous}} orbit communications satellite were considered. A multiple beam offset feed cluster {{used in conjunction}} with an offset parabolic reflector was chosen for the antenna realization. For radiating elements in the feed array, <b>polyrod</b> or dielectric rod radiators fed by waveguide are investigated. <b>Polyrod</b> antennas shrink the cross section of the waveguide required, are fairly directive, and can be tapered to reduce sidelobes. As a consequence, it is thought that mutual coupling effects between adjacent elements will be minimal and the resultant physically small elements will allow greater packing densities for the drive elements in the feed array than would otherwise be possible...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations {{on the near}} field and radiation characteristics show a fairly good agreement which justifies the TE(11) (x) mode of excitation. Eight <b>polyrod</b> antennas of different configurations were built and tested as functions of taper angles, straight and curved axial lengths, and frequency of excitation. It is found that the radiation patterns. cross-polarization level, beamwidth and gain could be controlled {{not only by the}} axial length and taper angles but also by shaping the axis of the polyrods in order to realize an optimum desig...|$|E
