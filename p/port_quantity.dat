The model minimizes total system costs taking into account both port infrastructure costs and shipping costs. Due to the multipurpose function of the port, the model consists of 1020 decision variables and 2490 constraints. Results of the model determine the optimum number of berths that should be constructed in each period and {{for each type of}} cargo. In addition to, the results of sensitivity analysis on <b>port</b> operation <b>quantity</b> provide useful information for managers to choose the best scenario for port planning with the lowest investment risks. Despite all limitations-due to data availability-the model offers a straightforward decision tools to port planners aspiring to achieve optimum port planning steps...|$|R
50|$|Following {{statehood}} in 1845, Florida's economy became {{stronger and}} the principal <b>ports</b> shipped vast <b>quantities</b> of citrus, cotton, lumber and other products to the Atlantic states, the Caribbean and Europe. The Federal government began construction of coastal forts including Fort Taylor in Key West and Fort Jefferson on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas to better control navigation through the Florida Straits. Although Fort Jefferson was never finished, construction continued for 30 years, and vast quantities of bricks were shipped to the key in flat-bottomed steamboats like that found at the Bird Key wreck, which was lost while transporting bricks.|$|R
5|$|Constanța Port {{is both a}} {{maritime}} and a river port. Daily, {{more than}} 200 river vessels are in the port for cargo loading or unloading or waiting to be operated. The connection of the port with the Danube river is made through the Danube–Black Sea Canal, which {{represents one of the}} main strengths of Constanța <b>Port.</b> Important cargo <b>quantities</b> are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1970s, coal, grain, {{iron ore}} and package freight were handled through the <b>port</b> in {{enormous}} <b>quantities.</b> Gradually, shipping by train and boat diminished as most package freight is transported by road. The railway's Intermodal freight transport has {{done away with}} the costly transshipment of individual goods between box cars and Lake freighters. Combined with loss of grain subsidies (the Crow Rate) and {{the free trade agreement}} with the United States, have terminated Thunder Bay's privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east-west trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional raison d'être as a break-bulk point, and the city is in economic decline.|$|R

All optical WDM-based networks {{have been used to}} improve overall communication capacity and provide an excellent choice for the design of backbone networks. However, due to the high traffic load that each link can carry in a WDM network, survivability against failures becomes very important. Survivability in this context is the ability of the network to maintain continuity of service against failures, since a failure can lead to huge data losses. In recent years, many survivability mechanisms have been studied and their performance assessed through capacity efficiency, restoration time and restorability. Survivability mechanisms for ring and mesh topologies have received particular attention...|$|R
50|$|On 15 June Axis forces {{reached the}} coast, {{cutting off the}} escape for the Commonwealth forces still occupying the Gazala positions. With this task completed, Rommel struck for Tobruk while the enemy was still {{confused}} and disorganised. Tobruk's defenders were {{at this point the}} 2nd South African Infantry Division, 4th Antiaircraft Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry, 32nd Army Tank, and 201st Guards Brigades, all under command of Generalmajor Hendrik Klopper. The assault on Tobruk began at dawn on 20 June, and Klopper surrendered at dawn the following day. With Tobruk, Rommel achieved the capture of 32,000 defenders, the <b>port,</b> and huge <b>quantities</b> of supplies. Only at the fall of Singapore, earlier that year, had more British Commonwealth troops been captured at one time. On 22 June, Hitler promoted Rommel to Generalfeldmarschall for this victory.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} hinterland access conditions and port competition. Competition between ports is treated as competition between alternate intermodal transportation chains, while the hinterland access conditions are represented by both the corridor facilities and the inland roads. We find that when <b>ports</b> compete in <b>quantities,</b> an increase in corridor capacity will increase own port’s output, reduce the rival port’s output, and increase own port’s profit. On the other hand, an increase in inland road capacity {{may or may not}} increase own port’s output and profit, owing to various offsetting effects. Essentially, while more road capacity reduces local delays and moderates the negative impact of own output expansion, it induces greater local commuter traffic and may moderate the reduction by local commuter traffic in response to a rise in cargo traffic, both of which reduces own output and profit. Similarly, inland road pricing may or may not increase own port’s output and profit. Finally, case examples for selected ports and regions are discussed. investment, competition...|$|R
60|$|When Mr. Lorry had {{finished}} his breakfast, {{he went out}} for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the <b>port,</b> and a <b>quantity</b> of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.|$|R
60|$|They {{arrived at}} Gravesend at six, when they washed {{their faces and}} hands, and had their wigs powdered. Then they sallied forth for Rochester on foot, and drank by the way three pots of ale. At one o’clock they went to dinner with {{excellent}} <b>port,</b> and a <b>quantity</b> more beer, and afterwards Hogarth and Scott played at hopscotch in the town hall. It would appear that they slept {{most of them in}} one room, and the chronicler of the party describes them all as waking at seven o’clock, and telling each other their dreams. You have rough sketches by Hogarth of the incidents of this holiday excursion. The sturdy little painter is seen sprawling over a plank to a boat at Gravesend; the whole company are represented in one design, in a fisherman’s room, where they had all passed the night. One gentleman in a nightcap is shaving himself; another is being shaved by the fisherman; a third, with a handkerchief over his bald pate, is taking his breakfast; and Hogarth is sketching the whole scene.|$|R
2500|$|The Douro Wine Company (also {{known as}} the General Company of Agriculture of the Wines of the Upper Douro and in Portuguese Companhia Geral da Agricultura e Vinhos do Alto Douro) was a {{government}} oversight organization established by the Portuguese Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal to regulate the trade and production of Port wine. Established in 1756, {{one of the first}} official duties of the company was the delineation of the boundaries of the Douro wine region. This act essentially made the Douro the world's first regional appellation. While the boundaries of the Chianti and Tokaji wine regions were outlined in 1716 and 1737, respectively, neither of these regions were [...] "technically" [...] appellations in the sense of being subjected to continued government control and regulations. Under their charter, Pombal invested an immense amount of control in the Douro Wine Company to regulate all exports of <b>Port,</b> set production <b>quantities</b> limits, fix maximum and minimum prices for grapes and to serve as sole arbitrator in any disputes between vine growers and Port shippers. In 1761, the company was further granted a monopoly on the sale of brandy which was used in the fortification process of Port winemaking. The Douro Wine Company continued to operate to 1833 (and was briefly revived from 1843 and 1853). Today, many of it functions have been deregulated with the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto or (Port and Douro Wines Institute) being the official regulating body of Port wine and Douro table wine production.|$|R
40|$|Farmers in Vanuatu are {{cashing in}} on demand for a nut that can be eaten by sufferers of nut allergy. Allergies to peanuts and tree nuts {{are among the most}} common food allergies, {{affecting}} about 1 % of the population in developed countries. Sales of organically grown Canarium indicum nuts (known locally as nangai), to both overseas and domestic markets are booming. Exports have risen sharply over the past 5 years from a few dozen kilos to a current rate of more than 300 t. Principal destinations include Australia, Japan, Hawaii, New Zealand and the USA, where nangai nuts are eaten raw or roasted, and the oil used as an emollient in hair care, bath and suncare products. More recently, nangai nut oil has been selling in export markets as a topical treatment for arthritis. On the island of Pentecost, coconut-frond baskets of nangai nuts are loaded into the hold of the passenger aircraft that calls in three times a week, to be flown south to the capital <b>Port</b> Vila. Larger <b>quantities</b> are sent down on the inter-island trading ships. Domestic demand has also increased following promotion of the nuts in local hotels and shops so much so that farmers are working flat out to supply it. The boom comes as the value of other agricultural exports copra, coffee and cocoa has crashed. Not only are nangai nuts economically attractive but growing them makes ecological sense too. Canarium indicum {{is one of the oldest}} domesticated species in Melanesia and is a fast-growing forest tree. It does well beneath a natural canopy or in a typical food garden clearing, where the sapling can get established while bananas, climbing yams and more are tended all around.

30|$|As {{it is now}} clear, SOS Voyager {{followed}} by SOS Allocator {{is used to calculate}} the yearly gross profit needed by SOS Appraiser model. Programming algorithms used to solve SOS Voyager optimisation models permit the ship owner to change model parameters after optimisation without the need to re-optimise them from the beginning. This permits ship owner to easily change parameters such as cargo freight rate and <b>quantity,</b> <b>port</b> cargo handling rate and charges, and ship speed and fuel consumption, to see the effect of this change on the optimal solution. This permits the ship owner to validate the models used by SOS Voyager. In the sensitivity analysis, series of changes are given to SOS Voyager to see how far these changes are effective. In what-if analysis, a single change, in an interactive mode, is input to SOS Voyager to see the effect of this change on the objective function. Speed sensitivity or what-if analysis may be applied to all transport links, collectively, or to selective transport links, separately. Clicking menu options is all that is needed to perform optimisation, sensitivity, and what-if analysis. When a new ship is appraised, SOS Voyager is used to calculate its gross-profit-per-day for each voyage completed on each trade area, along with sensitivity and what-if analysis of cargo quantity and freight. Since ship appraisal model cares for futuristic values of its parameters, stochastic rather than deterministic cargo transport demand is considered, {{especially in the case of}} tramp shipping. Three sensitivity and what-if analysis levels are identified for the stochastic cargo transport demand: an upper limit, a deterministic-equivalent value, and a lower limit. To enable such analysis to take place, SOS Voyager archives data of every cargo offer for as long time as it takes to identify the behavior pattern of cargo quantity and freight. In the light of this pattern along with the forecast of future events that might affect it, a probability distribution of cargo transport demand may now be built and maintained.|$|R
40|$|Problem {{definition}} The city Mar del Plata {{has one of}} Argentina's largest {{ports and}} biggest seaside beach resort. After {{the construction of the}} port, a steadily growing sandbank appeared in the port entrance and considerable erosion occurred on the northern beaches. To warrant the accessibility of the port, frequent maintenance dredging is needed, but no measures have been taken to prevent/reduce shoaling of the port access. After numerous unsafe situations for vessels, large shipping companies have decided to stop berthing at Mar del Plata. Improvement of the accessibility for large ships will significantly lower the (transport) costs and results in more income and new investments in port activities and infrastructure. Objectives The main objective of this M. Sc. study is to identify the most promising feasible measures that improve the accessibility of the port and reduce the costs of maintenance and to quantitatively evaluate the effects and costs of these measures to support further detailed morphodynamic and design studies. Methodology Available literature and data is studied and reviewed to gain insight in the local system. During a field trip in the province of Buenos Aires data is collected by performing field measurements and different meetings took place with local experts and stakeholders. To identify and quantify the physical processes influencing the accessibility of the port, a Delft 3 D-FLOW model of the present area around Mar del Plata is set up and validated using present and historical data. Due to the lack of (reliable) near shore wave data, the nearshore wave climate in the model is derived from offshore wave data, wind data, and bathymetric data using a Delft 3 D-WAVE model with a larger scale. Various theoretical measures are evaluated. The most feasible, durable, and efficient type of measures are selected and quantitatively evaluated. To estimate the effects of these measures, with a focus on sediment transports, each measure is simulated in the Delft 3 D-FLOW model. From the resulting sedimentation rates in the <b>port</b> entrance, the <b>quantity</b> of needed maintenance is estimated for each measure. To be able to compare the measures, the total costs of initial investments and future maintenance is estimated. Conclusions 9 ̆ 5 Maintaining the original port access, without taking additional measures is not economic (total costs 8 ̆ 0 2. 5 to 8 ̆ 0 5. 4 million/year) and leads to frequent disturbance of the ship traffic. The irregular and uncertain circumstances are not attractive for companies and investors in the port and lead to higher transport costs. 9 ̆ 5 Maintaining the original port access and construction and maintenance of a sand trap along the southern breakwater strongly reduces the maintenance need (and the disturbance for the ship traffic) inside the access channel with 90...|$|R
