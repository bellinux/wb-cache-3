40|$|Previous {{scholarship}} on the <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of the <b>political</b> parties provides anecdotal evidence regarding the distinct {{differences between the}} two major U. S. political parties. This conventional wisdom is based on one important essay authored by Jo Freeman nearly 30 years ago. To date, our understanding regarding the nature and effects of the <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of the Democratic and Republican parties suffers from lack of rigorous empirical examination. This study explores the <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of the <b>political</b> parties by examining the behaviors of congressional members seeking their party's nomination for another office. In this dissertation, I measure the extent which the Democratic and Republican parties' <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> effect progressively ambitious members of the U. S. Senate and U. S. House of Representatives. In addition, I provide firsthand accounts of how these cultures impact state legislative careers. The empirical tests I present in this project largely support Freeman's earlier accounts as {{to the nature of the}} two major parties' <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> at the national level. Based on firsthand accounts, however, I also provide evidence to suggest the <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of the parties are subject to short-term, localized forces at the state-level...|$|R

5|$|Commanders in the Tang army were {{familiar}} with the <b>political</b> <b>culture</b> of nomadic empires. Nomadic alliances were formed through distributing war plunder and ensuring the security of tribal property, and grew tenuous when rulers failed to deliver their promises. The Chinese understood that disaffected tribes were vulnerable to switching allegiances, and used this to their advantage.|$|E
5|$|Such {{extensive}} and enthusiastic {{collaboration with the}} Einsatzgruppen {{has been attributed to}} several factors. Since the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Kresy Wschodnie and other borderlands had experienced a <b>political</b> <b>culture</b> of violence. The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his {{dissatisfaction with the}} position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the <b>political</b> <b>culture</b> in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education would be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E

40|$|The {{rich history}} of Kansas {{politics}} continues to generate an abundant literature. The state’s beginning as “Bleeding Kansas” followed by Prohibition, populism, the Progressive Era, and the Dust Bowl, {{through to the}} present day, have given local and national writers and scholars an intriguing topic for exploration. While historians and biographers shed light on pieces of this history, journalists focus on current political affairs in the state. Rarely, however, are past and present connected to fully illuminate an understanding of Kansas politics and government. This volume uses the prism of <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> to interpret Kansas politics and disclose the intimate connections between the state’s past and its current politics. The framework of <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> evolves from underlying political preferences for liberty, order, and equality, and these preferences {{form the basis for}} the active <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of individualism, hierarchy, and egalitarianism. This comprehensive examination of Kansas political institutions argues that Kansas politics, historically and presently, may best be understood as a clash of <b>political</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R
5|$|But several {{defining}} {{features of}} modern Canada {{can be traced}} back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian <b>political</b> <b>culture</b> that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Diefenbaker was the first to appoint women and ethnic minorities to Cabinet. It was under Diefenbaker that Canada finally achieved universal adult suffrage, with the granting of the vote to Native Canadians in 1960. The removal of explicit racial discrimination from the criteria for admission to Canada under the Immigration Act of 1961 was a factor in the creation of today's multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Canada.|$|E
5|$|India is the world's {{most populous}} democracy. A {{parliamentary}} republic with a multi-party system, it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), {{and more than}} 40 regional parties. The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian <b>political</b> <b>culture,</b> and the BJP right-wing. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held {{a majority in the}} parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's <b>political</b> <b>culture</b> is {{very liberal}} and {{progressive}} for the United States, with over 80% {{of the population}} voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a socialist councilor, Kshama Sawant. For {{the first time in}} United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the current city council is female.|$|E
