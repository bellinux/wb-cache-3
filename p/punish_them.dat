5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b> However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Kisuke's {{story begins}} with him {{suffering}} amnesia {{and on the}} run from his former ninja comrades. Returning to Edo to discover the truth in the company of Yuzuruha, he accidentally breaks an ancient seal keeping damned souls at bay. Defeating the monsters they manifest as, he learns from his mollified ninja companions and their employer Yukinojo that he was part of a mission to steal the Kuzuryu Demon Blade from Momohime's Nakurami Clan and <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> for defying the shogun's order to surrender it, which in turn was tied in with Yukinojo's intentions in marrying Momohime. Yukinojo sends Kisuke against Torahime, Momohime's sister and the shrine maiden in charge of keeping the Kuzuryu's power in check. Pursuing her, Kisuke fights both Torahime and undead soldiers loyal to her family. In pursuit of her, he faces agents who are preserving the flow of magic energy to Mount Fuji, including a young Yamabushi. His battles awaken his memories: he was originally disguised as a servant in Torahime's household as part of Yukinojo's scheme to destroy her family, but fell in love with Torahime and attempted to betray his ninja comrades when stealing the Kuzuryu. Dying from his wounds, the spirit of Senju Oboroya, the creator of the Oboro Style that controls the Demon Blades, fused with Kisuke to save his life and pass on the Oboro Style to someone who would use it for good. The fusion triggered Kisuke's amnesia, but left him with the ability to wield Demon Blades without succumbing to their evil.|$|E
25|$|During {{their long}} careers, Mark Felt and Edward Miller served the Federal Bureau of Investigation and our nation with great distinction. To <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> further—after 3 years of {{criminal}} prosecution proceedings—would not serve {{the ends of}} justice.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mạng {{unleashed}} {{persecution of}} Cham Muslims after he conquered the final remnants of Champa in 1832. The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus {{against their will}} to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture.|$|E
25|$|Helios was {{sometimes}} characterized with the epithet Panoptes ("the all-seeing"). In {{the story told}} {{in the hall of}} Alcinous in the Odyssey (viii.300ff.), Aphrodite, the consort of Hephaestus, secretly beds Ares, but all-seeing Helios spies on them and tells Hephaestus, who ensnares the two lovers in nets invisibly fine, to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{pertinent}} to mention here {{that when the}} Gakhars refused their allegiance to Sher Shah Suri, he launched an expedition to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b> This resulted in the capture of the Gakhar chief Sarang Khan and his daughter. Sarang Khan was then killed. His daughter was then married to Sher Shah’s favourite general Khwas Khan.|$|E

25|$|Stupar, who {{allegedly}} acted as the Commander of the 2nd Šekovići Detachment of the Special Police, was charged {{for the crime}} of genocide under the command responsibility since he allegedly failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent members of his Detachment from {{taking part in the}} perpetration of genocide in Srebrenica, and following the perpetration of the offense he failed to take the necessary steps to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Minh Mang {{enacted the}} final {{conquest of the}} Champa Kingdom after the centuries long Cham–Vietnamese wars. The Cham Muslim leader Katip Suma was educated in Kelantan {{and came back to}} Champa to declare a Jihad against the Vietnamese after Emperor Minh Mang's {{annexation}} of Champa. The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} the result of General Carleton's belief that Indians were {{responsible}} for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the fourth}} child's birth in 1994, Josef allowed the {{enlargement}} of the prison, , putting Elisabeth and her children to work for years digging out soil with their hands. The captives had a television, radio, and videocassette player. Food could be stored in a refrigerator and cooked or heated on hot plates. Elisabeth taught the children to read and write. At times, Josef shut off their lights or refused to deliver food {{for days at a}} time to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally Janissaries {{could be}} {{promoted}} only through seniority and {{within their own}} orta. They could leave the unit only to assume command of another. Only Janissaries' own commanding officers could <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b> The rank names were based on positions in the kitchen staff or Sultan's royal hunters; 64th and 65th Orta 'Greyhound Keepers' comprised as the only Janissary cavalry, perhaps to emphasise that Janissaries were servants of the Sultan. Local Janissaries, stationed in a town or city for a long time, were known as yerliyyas.|$|E
25|$|King Charles III, {{feeling that}} the {{national}} pride of Spain had been offended by the Algerines, resolved to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> by bombarding their town. Rear admiral Antonio Barceló was appointed {{to carry out the}} attack. Though he was by far the most capable naval officer of Spain {{and one of the few}} who had risen through the ranks by merit, Barceló's designation was coldly received both by the Spanish court and military. The Rear admiral was old and illiterate and of humble extraction, which, together with his naval victories, earned him the envy of most the senior Spanish officers.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that free riding, or reaping the {{benefits}} without any effort, is often a problem in collective action. Examples of free riding would be if an employee in a labor union pays no dues, but still benefits from union representation. In a study published in 1995, scientists found that female lions showed individual differences in {{the extent to which they}} participated in group-territorial conflict. Some lions consistently 'cooperated' by approaching intruders, while others 'lagged' behind to avoid the risk of fighting. Although the lead female recognized the laggards, she failed to <b>punish</b> <b>them,</b> suggesting that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity.|$|E
25|$|The New Model Army then marched {{south to}} secure the ports of Wexford, Waterford and Duncannon. Wexford {{was the scene of}} another infamous atrocity, when Parliamentarian troops broke into the town while {{negotiations}} for its surrender were ongoing, and sacked it, killing about 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 townspeople and burning much of the town. Cromwell's responsibility for the sack of Wexford is disputed. He did not order the attack on the town, and had been in the process of negotiating its surrender when his troops broke into the town. On the other hand, his critics point out that he made little effort to restrain his troops or to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> afterwards for their conduct.|$|E
25|$|The Mormon issue {{made the}} {{situation}} for women the topic of nationwide controversy. In 1870 the Utah Territory, controlled by Mormons, gave women the right to vote. However, in 1887, Congress disenfranchised Utah women with the Edmunds–Tucker Act, {{which was designed to}} weaken the Mormons politically and <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> for polygamy. In 1867-96, eastern activists promoted woman suffrage in Utah as an experiment, and as a way to eliminate polygamy. They were Presbyterians and other Protestants convinced that Mormonism was a non-Christian cult that grossly mistreated women. The Mormons promoted woman suffrage to counter the negative image of downtrodden Mormon women. With the 1890 Manifesto clearing the way for statehood, in 1895 Utah adopted a constitution restoring the right of women's suffrage. Congress admitted Utah as a state with that constitution in 1896.|$|E

25|$|The town {{came under}} threat from 1780 onward {{due to the}} {{intermittent}} raids launched by the Wahhabi on the Bani Khalid strongholds in nearby Al-Hasa. The Wahhabi speculated that the population of Zubarah would conspire against the regime in Al-Hasa {{with the help of}} the Bani Khalid. They also believed that its residents practiced teachings contrary to the Wahhabi doctrine, and regarded the town as an important gateway to the Persian Gulf. Saudi general Sulaiman ibn Ufaysan led a raid against the town in 1787. In 1792, a massive Wahhabi force conquered Al Hasa, forcing many refugees to flee to Zubarah. Wahhabi forces besieged Zubarah and several neighboring settlements two years later to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> for accommodating asylum seekers. The local chieftains were allowed to continue carrying out administrative tasks but were required to pay a tax.|$|E
25|$|Notably {{absent from}} toleration of drugs is its production, {{particularly}} {{the cultivation of}} weed. This {{has led to a}} seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to <b>punish</b> <b>them.</b> A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production of weed. In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.|$|E
25|$|De Soto {{contacted}} Chief Pacaha {{and convinced}} {{him that he had}} nothing to do with the attack and that the expedition's intentions were peaceful. De Soto even assured the Pacaha that the expedition would help the Pacaha attack the Casqui to <b>punish</b> <b>them</b> for their subterfuge. The Casqui received advance warning of the planned attack and decided to return the looted items and issue an apology in order to stave off retribution from the combined Spanish and Pacaha force. De Soto arranged a dinner for the two leaders and arranged a peace treaty between the two groups. As a gesture of gratitude for the arrangement of peace and also to outdo his rival, who had only presented a daughter to de Soto, Chief Pacaha presented de Soto with one of his wives, one of his sisters, and another woman from his tribe. The de Soto expedition stayed at Pacaha's village for approximately 40 days.|$|E
