5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began the}} 1975–76 Football League {{campaign}} losing 2–0 to Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Liverpool's form <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of}} the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season games left them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, Club Brugge scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought back for a 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.|$|E

5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball {{in the first}} hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The main {{battle was}} over, but more combat took place as Kesselring sent in even more Bf 109s {{to support the}} {{withdrawing}} bombers. Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2) and Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) engaged RAF fighters near the Isle of Wight as the bombers left British air space. II./JG 2 lost one Bf 109 destroyed and another damaged in battle with Hurricanes from No. 601 Squadron, suffering one pilot missing and the other wounded. JG 27 lost six Bf 109s (three each from I. and II./JG 27) in action against No. 85 Squadron RAF. Three pilots were killed, two were posted missing presumed dead {{and the other was}} <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Channel by a Heinkel He 59 air-sea rescue aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a long third down after a quarterback sack on the final play of the first quarter. On the first play of the quarter, Tech quarterback Al Clark was sacked by Brian Simmons, {{and this time he}} fumbled the ball. The loose ball was <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone by Carolina defender Greg Ellis for the Tar Heels' third touchdown of the game. Because North Carolina missed its extra-point kick following its previous touchdown, Tar Heels' head coach Carl Torbush ordered the team to attempt a two-point conversion in order to gain the missed extra point from the previous play. A pass attempt by Keldorf fell incomplete, but with just seven seconds elapsed in the second quarter, North Carolina led 220.|$|E
