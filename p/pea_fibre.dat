40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} a chicken nugget formulation with partial substitution of the meat or fat by <b>pea</b> <b>fibre.</b> Three formulations were developed: Control (C) – commercial formulation, Fibre Less Meat (FLM) – reduction of 10 % of meat and addition of 2 % of <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> and Fibre Less Fat (FLF) – reduction of 10 % of fat and addition of 2 % <b>pea</b> <b>fibre.</b> The products were characterized for their pH value, instrumental colour, texture, cooking loss (frying), proximate composition, and sensory properties (acceptance test). The control treatment presented lower (p 0. 05) amongst the treatments. The texture analysis showed no significant differences amongst the treatments for elasticity and cohesiveness, although the FLF batch was firmer than the others (p 0. 05) amongst the three treatments for aroma, texture, flavour or overall acceptability.

In this work, a poly (ester amide) (PEA) derived from from L-phenylalanine, sebacoyl chloride and 1, 4 butanediol was synthesized and electrospun to form both 3 D fibrous mats and tubular constructs. Both the polymer solution concentration and mandrel rotation speed were optimized to fabricate bead-free fibres.

30|$|Dietary fibre {{has been}} {{recommended}} on an empirical {{basis for the}} management of chronic constipation. As is known, dietary fibres can promote the excretion of intestinal mucin by stimulating the capacity of mucosal protein synthesis (Derrien et al. 2010). Dietary fibre is broken down in the proximal colon and provides an energy yielding substrate for microbial fermentation. The result of this is to stimulate the growth of intestinal microbiota and contribute significantly to the stool dry weight. Besides, fibres could promote the excretion of bacterial fermentation products, such as SCFAs, which has the pro-motility effects (Jennings et al. 2009). Dietary fibre is also an important source of gas in the colon. Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, which are principal end products of bacterial fermentation, can increase stool bulk and promote colonic transit (Lopez Roman et al. 2008). There is evidence indicates that dietary <b>fibres</b> (wheat bran, <b>pea</b> <b>fibres)</b> can modulate intestinal microbiota, including the stimulation of beneficial bacterial species and the suppression of pathogenic bacterial species (Chen et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Constipation is {{a serious}} problem in the {{pediatric}} population and often requires medical management with laxatives and enemas. Participants (2 - 10 years of age, n= 13) with a history of mild constipation were assigned randomly to a fibre treatment or placebo group. After three weeks, subjects were crossed over to the other treatment. <b>Pea</b> hull <b>fibre</b> (4. 0 - 7. 6 g/day = 3. 6 - 6. 8 g/day of dietary fibre) was added to snack foods and an inulin supplement (5. 0 g/day = 4. 5 g/day of dietary fibre) was given, whereas the placebos were non-fortified snacks and maltodextrin (5. 0 g/day). Subjects or their parents documented stool frequency, stool consistency, occurrence of abdominal pain and intake of snack foods and the supplement. Over the final two weeks, there was a trend towards an increase in the mean number of daily bowel movements in the fibre treatment group compared to the placebo group (n= 11, 0. 68 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 59 ± 0. 26, p= 0. 064). Exclusion of one subject with diarrhea-type stools led to a significant difference between groups (n= 10, 0. 54 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 67 ± 0. 22, p= 0. 002). Stool consistency, using the Bristol Stool Form Rating Scale, showed no significant differences in stool consistency between groups (p= 0. 379) nor was there a difference in the incidences of abdominal pain (p= 0. 129). Not all subjects experienced abdominal pain. The inulin supplement (91 % compliance rate; 1 serving per day) was consumed more consistently than were the snack foods fortified with <b>pea</b> hull <b>fibre</b> (77 % compliance rate; 2 servings per day). There {{were no significant differences in}} the intake of the snacks or supplement when the placebo and treatment groups were compared. Energy intake was significantly lower during the fibre treatment period compared to placebo (n= 12, 1307 ± 296 kcal/day vs. 1441 ± 285 kcal/day, p= 0. 035). The addition of <b>pea</b> hull <b>fibre</b> to typical snack foods and an inulin supplement to beverages were well accepted by children and no adverse effects were reported.

40|$|The {{effects of}} using pea and various {{fractions}} of pea on {{the consequences of}} an oral challenge with an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) were evaluated in post weaning piglets. The experiment comprised six treatment groups each consisting of 12 individually housed weaned piglets. Each group received {{one of the following}} diets: 1) and 2) basal diet, 3) diet with 250 g/kg pea; 4) diet with 150 g/kg native pea starch; 5) diet with 100 g/kg <b>pea</b> <b>fibre,</b> and 6) diet with 100 g/kg pea hulls. The experimental diets were fed ad libitum (day 0 – 22). At day 7 the piglets of group 1 were inoculated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and groups 2 to 6 were inoculated orally with an ETEC suspension. The piglets were sacrificed on day 22 for obtaining intestinal digesta. Feed intake and body weight gain were not affected by the treatments, except for a lower feed intake for the <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> diet in the first period after the challenge. After the ETEC challenge on day 7, faecal consistency scores increased in all groups, and were higher for the group receiving the diet with <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> than for the groups receiving the diet with pea starch or the basal diet (P < 0. 05). Only in the first three days after the challenge the number of ETEC in the faeces was lower (P < 0. 05) for the groups fed the basal and the pea hull diet than for the groups receiving the pea and the <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> diet. It can be concluded that inclusion of peas and pea fractions in diets for weaned piglets does neither positively nor negatively affect performance and gut health under challenged conditions...|$|E
40|$|Feather pecking {{has been}} {{controlled}} in the laying hen industry through {{methods such as}} beak trimming, breeding low feather pecking lines, providing enrichment items, and altering diets to promote satiety. Two {{recent studies have shown}} the positive impact of feeding silage (a relatively low nutrient feed item) in addition to (or as supplement) a nutritionally balanced hen ration in terms of decreased aggressive and feather pecking behaviour and improved feather score. The objectives of this thesis were to determine which specific characteristic(s) hens prefer, and if the preferred characteristics were responsible for improving hen welfare. Initial experiments consisted of a preference test, which provided a supplement in a removable insert in front of half a cage, and a balanced ration in the other half. In the first experiment, hens were shown to have a locational preference in the feed trough, not resulting from the presence of the insert, nor from intraspecific competition. Experiment two tested the preference for an ensiled or non-ensiled, and moist or dry material using barley greens, dried barley greens, barley silage, and dried barley silage. Results indicated that hens show preference for moist, non-ensiled materials, but ensiled materials are not rejected. Further investigations took place focusing on physical characteristics as experiment two results suggested a preference for unfermented products. Experiment three examined the provision of a forage-able substrate which was edible (wet or dry barley) or not (plastic lace), and found that edible materials increase the time spent at the feeder. Experiment four tested the preference for particle size of various edible materials (oats, silage and alfalfa) and found hens spend more time with smaller particles sizes of silage and oat materials. The final experiment (Experiment five) used a supplement with all preferred characteristics (wet <b>pea</b> <b>fibre)</b> to determine its impact on feather pecking in birds housed in conventional and enriched cages. Birds given supplemental material did not increase time spent at the feeder, and feathers showed no more or less wear than would be expected from the housing system. Vent scores (areas typically affected by pecking) tended to improve under the presence of <b>pea</b> <b>fibre.</b> Feather pecking decreased when hens were offered <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> when housed in large group and enriched cages. Decreased body weight, heavier gizzards, and improved feed efficiency (balanced feed per dozen eggs) point towards improved digestive efficiencies with consumed fibre, even though elongation of the ileum and jejunum seem to contradict this hypothesis. While highly preferred, moist, non-ensiled, low nutrient <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> did not impact hen welfare to the degree seen in previous studies with silage. However, similar feedstuffs are still a possible means of enrichment to reduce feather pecking and increase welfare in laying hens, and future research should continue with different bird strains and materials for enrichment, as well as examining hen digestive efficiencies and effects on production costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate whether bodyweight and the micronisation of dietary fibre affect the endogenous nitrogen and amino acid losses (ENL and EAAL) in pigs. The effect of the micronising process was tested by providing pigs with 90 g DM·kg– 1 BW 0. 75 of a N-free diet supplemented with isolated pea inner fibres, presented in native or micronised form and with a water-holding capacity of 12 and 4 g water·g– 1 DM, respectively. ENL and EAAL were measured on pigs weighing 24, 62 and 105 kg. In all cases, daily ENL increased linearly (P < 0. 05) with BW, {{for the majority of the}} AA and total N. As BW increased, daily ENL, total EAAL and the majority of EAAL increased linearly independently of micronisation (P < 0. 05). When expressed per kg DMI, total EAAL and the majority of each EAA decreased curvilinearly and reached nadir at around 100 kg BW. For ENL expressed per kg DMI, micronisation resulted in a curvilinear decrease with increasing BW, as compared to a linear decrease for pigs fed the native <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> diet (non-micronised). Micronisation of pea inner fibres did not decrease ENL or EAAL daily, except for proline. When the losses were expressed as g·k– 1 g DMI, micronisation did not decrease ENL but decreased (P < 0. 05) endogenous losses for a majority of AA as well as for total AA. The results suggest that small pigs excrete more endogenous N per kg DMI than large pigs and that <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> micronisation reduces EAAL but not ENL when expressed per kg DMI.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} using the gas technique to study the fermentation characteristics of different feed ingredients differing in their fermentable carbohydrate and protein composition by colonic bacteria isolated from pigs. The effect on in vitro bacterial protein synthesis was also evaluated. The ingredients used were wheat bran (WB), wood cellulose (Solka-floc®, SF), peas, pea hulls (PH), <b>pea</b> inner <b>fibre</b> (PIF), sugar beet pulp (SBP), flax seed meal (FSM) and corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The samples were pre-treated with pepsin and pancreatin and the hydrolyzed substrates were then incubated with pig faeces in a buffered mineral solution. The nitrogen source in the buffer solution (NH 4 HCO 3) was replaced by an equimolar quantity of 15 N-labeled NH 4 Cl, used for {{the determination of the}} rate of bacterial protein synthesis. Gas production, proportional to the amount of fermented carbohydrate, was recorded for 48 h and modelled. The fermented product was subjected to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) analysis. The source of fibre affected the in vitro dry matter degradability (IVDMD), the fermentation kinetics and the gas production profile (P 0. 05) in SCFA production after the fermentation of SF, P, PH, PIF and SBP (ranging from 3. 8 to 4. 5 mmol/g DM incubated) while WB and FSM yielded lowest (P< 0. 05) SCFA. The bacterial nitrogen incorporation (BNI), both at T/ 2 and after 48 h of fermentation was the highest (P< 0. 001) for PIF (18. 5 and 15. 6 mg/g DM incubated, respectively) and the lowest for DDGS and WB. In conclusion, <b>peas</b> and <b>pea</b> <b>fibres</b> had higher rates of fermentability, produced more SCFA and had high bacterial protein synthesis capacity. They thus have the potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment and reduce nitrogen excretion. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Fine tuning a {{nutritional}} strategy by incorporating dietary fibre (DF) in pig diets {{can help to}} improve gut health. Fermentation of DF, especially the soluble fraction, in pig intestines yields short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid, which {{have been found to}} improve gut health by favouring the growth of health-promoting bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, at the expense of pathogenic ones like Clostridium or Salmonella, which may enhance the health of host species. The presence of fermentable fibre in the pig diet can also contribute to reducing nitrogen (N) excretion, which can {{have a positive impact on}} the environmental footprint, one of the main concerns of a modern commercial pork production. The overall objective of this thesis project was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics of a selection of feedstuffs in the pig intestines and their potential impact on the gut environment and nitrogen excretion. The evaluation was performed by executing two projects using both in vitro and in vivo studies. The first project focused on the fermentation characteristics of hulless barley in comparison to hulled barley and oats and their effects on the gut environment, especially the production of fermentation metabolites. The rate of fibre fermentation in the intestines was first studied by means of an in vitro gas production technique. The results demonstrated that hulless barleys have higher fermentability and produce higher amounts of SCFA than hulled barley and oats. An experiment carried out on pigs confirmed that the fermentation of the soluble fibre fraction of hulless barley in the gut leads to increased production of SCFA and lactic acid, which in turn contribute to the growth of potentially beneficial microbiota and decrease potentially harmful bacteria, an indicator of improved gut health. This finding shows that gut health parameters may be modulated. Thus gut health could potentially be improved through feed formulation by a judicious selection of feed ingredients with specific fibre fractions, not only by the addition of isolated fibres, which is commonly recommended at present. The second project was executed to study the effect of some feedstuffs differing in their DF and protein content on fermentation characteristics and N excretion in pigs. The feedstuffs included wheat bran, wood cellulose, peas, pea hulls, <b>pea</b> inner <b>fibre,</b> sugar beet pulp, flax seed meal and corn distiller's dried grains with solubles. The results showed that peas and pea fibre-based diets produced higher amounts of SCFA and reduced N excreted, compared to others. In a parallel in vitro study, fermentation characteristics and bacterial protein synthesis was also studied using the same feed ingredients. The findings of the in vitro study corraborated the results of the in vivo experiment. These studies showed that <b>peas</b> and <b>pea</b> <b>fibres</b> have the potential to be used in pig diets in order to gain gut health-benefits and reduce N excretion. From this thesis, it can be concluded that sources and type of dietary fibre have a significant effect on the production of fermentation metabolites in the pig intestine and on N excretion. Among the feed ingredients studied, hulless barley and <b>pea</b> <b>fibres</b> seem to have the greatest potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment, which in turn, extend possibly health-promoting properties and reduce N excretion from pigs. However, further research is needed to understand the specific health benefits of these fibre sources and to quantify the specific fibre components required to achieve these benefits...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fibre {{has been}} studied to reduce the {{postprandial}} glucose response of dogs, but the results are inconsistent. Starch intake, however, was not properly considered in the published studies. The effects of starch and fibre intake on the postprandial glucose response were studied in non-obese adult dogs. Cellulose (CEL), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> (PE) and sugarcane fibre (SCF) were combined to form six diets with starch contents ranging from 33 % to 42 %: SCF+CEL and PE+CEL diets, both with high insoluble fibre (IF= 22 %) and low soluble fibre (SF= 2. 5 %) content; SCF+CMC and PE+CMC diets with high SF (SF= 4. 5 %; IF= 19 %) content; and CMC and CEL diets with low dietary fibre (14 %) content. The diets were fed in two amounts, providing an intake of 9. 5 g or 12. 5 g of starch (kg 0. 75) - 1 day- 1, totaling 12 treatments. Each diet was fed to six dogs conditioned to consume all of the daily food in 10 min. Their plasma glucose levels were measured before and during 480 min after food intake. Results of fibre and starch intake and their interactions were compared by repeated measures ANOVA and the Tukey test (P 0. 05). High-dose starch intake, however, induced a higher glycaemia at 180 and 240 min after the meal and a greater maximal glycaemia and greater area under the glucose curve (P< 0. 05).

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} awareness {{about the role of}} fibres as multifunctional substances, positively affecting the activity of the human body. From the structural point of view, insoluble fibres are known to have a strong impact on food texture. This work is part of a broader project aimed at understanding the role of fibres from different sources in traditional cookies delectableness. The impact on cookie dough characteristics, when enriched with dietary fibre, was evaluated by dynamic oscillatory tests, transient uniaxial extensional viscosity measurements and texture profile analysis. Three different sources of fibre were added: oat from cereals, orange from fruits and pea from legumes, at contents ranging from 0 to 10 g. In terms of processibility, there were serious difficulties in processing some of these doughs, especially those with fibre addition levels over 8 g for oat and orange and 9 – 10 g for pea. However, the results for the mechanical spectra of these doughs are {{similar to that of the}} standard dough without fibre. Tests in compression with a 4 mm cylinder in a 25 mm flask filled with dough showed to be more sensitive than oscillatory tests but still the results were somewhat difficult to interpret in terms of describing the differences in the processing behaviour of these doughs. Thus, extensional uniaxial tests were performed (for the first time in this type of materials, i. e., with no developed gluten) and showed to be suitable to describe the modification in dough structure, showing an increase of extensional viscosity for the dough with orange or oat fibre at levels of 4, 8 and 10 g, whereas for the <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> dough, no significant changes on the extensional behaviour were observed for formulations with up to 10 g of fibre, which was in general agreement with the processibility studies...|$|E

Developed bone cements on the base of poly(methylmethacrylate- 2 -ethylhexylmetharylate) – ethylmethacrylate-triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as well as carboxylic groups containing cement on that base are the cements with less expressed temperature increase during polymerization. Isolated from pea beans and wheat bran dietary fibre was used as additive which was introduced into bone cement solid phase.

The mechanical properties of formed cements were determined from four- point bending tests and uniaxial compression. <b>Pea</b> beans dietary <b>fibre</b> introduction did not worsen mechanical properties of bone cements, whereas enhancement was noticed in some results. The introduction of the same amount of wheat bran dietary fibre caused the decrease of ultimate stress of both bone cements in bending and in compression. This additive introduction caused the decrease of apparent density of carboxylic groups containing cement what might compensate polymerizing mixture shrinkage. The changes probably were caused by difference in morphology of isolated pea beans and bran dietary fibre what was established by scanning electron microscopy. The data show that bone cement modification with pea beans and bran dietary fibre is promising for bioactivity rise of non ionogenic bone cement and bioactivity increase of carboxylic groups containing cement. Bran dietary fibre additive introduction might be proper only in small amount (3 - 9 % in solid phase), also to diminish bone cement shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 160 growing-finishing pigs with initial body weights of 27 kg and {{originating}} from eight farms {{were used in}} a performance trial to investigate the effects of dietary fibre content (medium or high) and growth-promoting feed additives (none, avilamycin, formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend) on pig growth, the feed to gain ratio and the incidence of diarrhoea. Medium-fibre grower and finisher diets (188 and 196 g neutral detergent fibre (NDF) /kg dry matter (DM)) were composed of barley and soybean meal and the respective high-fibre diets (239 and 284 g NDF/kg DM) of barley, oats, barley <b>fibre,</b> <b>peas,</b> soybean meal and vegetable oil. Both medium- and high-fibre diets were similar in net energy (8. 7 MJ/kg) and ileal digestible lysine content (8. 0 and 6. 6 g/kg for grower and finisher diets, respectively). Avilamycin (40 mg/kg) was added to grower diets only whereas formic acid (8 g/kg) and formic acid-sorbate blend (8 g/kg formic acid and 0. 4 g/kg potassium sorbate) were added to both grower and finisher diets. No diet × additive interactions were observed in the performance or carcass characteristics of pigs. Dietary fibre content {{did not affect the}} growth or feed to gain ratio of pigs. In the growing period, pigs fed diets with avilamycin, formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend grew faster and had a lower feed to gain ratio than did those fed diets without additives. The differences between the additives were not significant. In the finishing period, pigs fed acidified diets grew faster and utilised feed more efficiently than did those in the avilamycin group. Furthermore, formic acid-sorbate blend enhanced pig performance more than did plain formic acid. For the total fattening period, the average growth rates were 856, 878, 896 and 930 g/d and the feed to gain ratios 2. 55, 2. 51, 2. 43 and 2. 32 kg DM/kg gain for diets without additives and with avilamycin, formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend, respectively. Additives improved the growth and feed to gain ratio compared to diets without additives. Performance was better with organic acid supplementation of grower and finisher diets than with avilamycin supplementation of grower diet only. In addition, formic acid-sorbate blend improved the feed to gain ratio more than did plain formic acid. In the growing period, additives decreased the incidence of diarrhoea in the medium-fibre diet. In the high-fibre diet, the incidence of diarrhoea was generally low, except in the avilamycin treatment. We concluded that formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend were equally effective alternatives to the antibiotic avilamycin in grower diets. Since organic acids can be added to finisher diets as well, their use resulted in further improvements in pig performance compared to avilamycin which can be used in grower diets only. The efficacy of formic acid as a growth promoter was intensified with sorbate addition. v 2002 okEripainoksia saatavissa tekijält...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{burden of}} obesity, type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) and cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) is rapidly increasing worldwide. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), in which the blood glucose level is higher than normal but {{not as high as}} in diabetes, is also a major public health problem. People with IGT have a higher risk of developing T 2 D and CVD, and especially the magnitude and duration of the postprandial blood glucose concentration (PPG) seems of crucial importance. In Norway, immigrants from Pakistan have a high prevalence of T 2 D, especially women. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) suggests that reducing PPG is important for achieving HbA 1 c goals, probably even more important than control of the fasting level. IDF further states that there is a progressive relationship between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk well below the diabetic threshold. Thus, reducing the post meal glucose levels could be important for T 2 D/CVD prevention. Therefore, it seemed of interest to study to what extent moderate meal changes would influence PPG in a group of diabetes prone female Pakistani immigrants. Since previous studies in healthy ethnic Norwegians had shown a PPG-blunting effect of light post meal physical activity, we wondered if the very low intensity activity (slow walking) usually practised by these women, would have a similar effect. Aim The main aim of this thesis was to investigate the extent to which moderate variations in the amount and type of carbohydrates in a meal, and post meal slow walking, might acutely modify the PPG in female Pakistani immigrants living in Oslo, Norway. Method Applying a cross-over design, 31 female Pakistani immigrants living in Oslo were recruited from participants of the completed InnvaDiab Study to participate in experiments where their blood glucose concentration was measured every 15 min for 2 h after intake of various amounts and types of a carbohydrate food, either while resting after the meal or doing very light post meal walking of two durations. The carbohydrate rich meals included three different types of bread (regular bread, and <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> enriched bread with two levels of rapeseed oil), cornflakes with milk, and chick peas with onion and tomato. Results Intake of an amount of <b>pea</b> <b>fibre</b> enriched bread containing 25 g CHO attenuated the postprandial peak glucose value (PV, p 0. 9, p< 0. 001). When resting after intake of 50 g CHO, the blood glucose concentration increased during the first 30 to 45 min, reaching a maximum value of 9. 1 mmol/L after 45 min Then the glucose concentration decreased but was still about one mmol/L higher that at baseline {{at the end of the}} experiment, i. e. at 2 h. When 20 min very slow post meal walking was performed after intake of the same meal the mean PV was lowered by 8. 2 % (NS), and time to reach the PV was delayed, on average by 19 min (p= 0. 002). These effects of walking were strengthened when the postprandial walk was increased to 40 min. In this latter experiment the time to reach PV from zero time (TTP) was delayed by 25 min (p= 0. 001) and the PV was lowered by 16. 3 % (p= 0. 001). Additionally, after postprandial walking, the blood glucose concentration approached baseline levels after 2 h. A significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not diastolic blood pressure, was observed in response to 40 min postprandial walking as compared with resting after the meal. Conclusion In diabetes prone subjects the PPG can be appreciably blunted both by reducing the quantity and changing the quality of the ingested carbohydrates, and by light post meal walking. The study suggests that there are “high- and low responders” to a carbohydrate load, below the blood glucose threshold indicating diabetes...|$|E
