Ptolemy's Geography also contains a <b>physical</b> <b>map</b> probably designed before the Roman conquest, and containing no detailed nomenclature. There are references to the Tabula Peutingeriana, but it appears that the Dacian map of the Tabula was completed after the final triumph of Roman nationality.

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Milton Guasti under the pseudonym DoctorM64 {{over the course of}} about ten years, although with several periods of no work done on the game. Guasti created the game with the intention of recreating the fast pace of Metroid: Zero Mission gameplay, and the [...] "atmosphere and solitude" [...] of Super Metroid. After having finished Metroid II for the first time, he imagined it to be [...] "cool" [...] to play the game with modern gameplay, an in-game minimap rather than with a <b>physical</b> <b>map</b> on one's lap, and the Omega Metroids being as tall as the screen. As Guasti was not yet a programmer at the time, he used a trial-and-error method to modify a platforming game engine by Martin Piecyk within the game creation system , with learning being his main motivation for working on the game. At first the remake followed the original Metroid II map layout and already existing sprites from Metroid: Zero Mission and Super Metroid. As Guasti kept working on the game engine and polished each ability, he felt that AM2R started to seem more and more authentic. After the game had been made public, several artists contacted Guasti and volunteered to create original art for the game: the Metroid evolutions were redesigned, and new enemies and areas unrelated to other Metroid games were added. He remade the music himself while waiting for customers in his recording studio.|$|E

This line will separate the Malayan and all the Asiatic races, from the Papuans and all that inhabit the Pacific; and though along the line of junction intermigration and commixture have taken place, yet the division is on the whole almost as well defined and strongly contrasted, as is the corresponding zoological division of the Archipelago, into an Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan region.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: <b>Physical</b> <b>mapping</b> of {{chromosomes}} {{using the}} maximum likelihood (ML) {{model is a}} problem of high com-putational complexity entailing both discrete optimization to recover the optimal probe order as well as continuous optimization to recover the optimal inter-probe spacings. In this paper, two versions of the genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed, one with heuristic crossover and determinis-tic replacement and the other with heuristic crossover and stochastic replacement, for the <b>physical</b> <b>mapping</b> problem under the maximum likelihood model. The genetic algo-rithms are compared with two other discrete optimization approaches, namely simulated annealing (SA) and large-step Markov chains (LSMC), in terms of solution quality and runtime efficiency. Results: The <b>physical</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms based on the GA, SA and LSMC have been tested using synthetic datasets and real datasets derived from cosmid libraries of the fungus Neurospora crassa. The GA, especially the version with heuristic crossover and stochastic replace-ment, is shown to consistently outperform the SA-based and LSMC-based <b>physical</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms in terms of runtime and final solution quality. Experimental results on real datasets and simulated datasets are presented. Further improvements to the GA in the context of phys-ical mapping under the maximum likelihood model are proposed.

40|$|RUS {{is a major}} {{dominant}} gene controlling quantitative resistance, inherited from Populus trichocarpa, whereas R 1 is a gene governing qualitative resistance, inherited from P. deltoides. • Here, we report a reiterative process of concomitant fine-scale genetic and <b>physical</b> <b>mapping</b> guided by the P. trichocarpa genome sequence. The high-resolution linkage maps were developed using a P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa progeny of 1415 individuals. RUS and R 1 were mapped in a peritelomeric region of chromosome 19. Markers closely linked to RUS were used to screen a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library constructed from the P. trichocarpa parent, heterozygous at the locus RUS. • Two local <b>physical</b> <b>maps</b> were developed, one encompassing the RUS allele and the other spanning rUS. The alignment of the two haplophysical maps showed structural differences between haplotypes. The genetic and <b>physical</b> <b>maps</b> were anchored to the genome sequence, revealing genome sequence misassembly. Finally, the RUS locus was localized within a 0. 8 -cM interval, whereas R 1 was localized upstream of RUS within a 1. 1 -cM interval. • The alignment of the genetic and <b>physical</b> <b>maps</b> with the local reorder of the chromosome 19 sequence indicated that RUS and R 1 belonged to a genomic region rich in nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) and serine threonine kinase (STK) genes...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{construction}} of high-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>maps</b> requires accurate information about overlap between DNA clones {{and the size}} of gaps between clones or clone contigs. We recently developed a procedure termed ‘quantitative DNA fiber mapping’ (QDFM) to help construct <b>physical</b> <b>maps</b> by measuring the overlap between clones or the physical distance between non-overlapping contigs. QDFM is based on hybridization of non-isotopically labeled probes onto DNA molecules that were bound to a solid support and stretched homogeneously to ~ 2. 3 kb/µm. In this paper, we describe the design of probes that bind specifically to the cloning vector of DNA recombinants to facilitate <b>physical</b> <b>mapping.</b> Probes described here delineate the most frequently used cloning vectors such as BACs, P 1 s, PACs and YACs. As demonstrated in representative hybridizations, vector-specific probes provide valuable information about molecule integrity, insert size and orientation as well as localization of hybridization domains relative to specifically-marked vector sequences...|$|R
