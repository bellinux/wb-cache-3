In this paper, we investigate a uniquely parallel parsable grammar (UPPG). We give a simple sufficient condition on morphism languages, and show that every such morphism language can be parsed efficiently in <b>parallel</b> <b>by</b> a UPPG. We show that the Fibonacci and Thue-Morse languages, which are instances of such languages, can be parsed in logarithmic time in <b>parallel</b> <b>by</b> UPPGs...|$|R
