50|$|In {{international}} versions, escabeche {{is usually}} poached or fried, then served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer.

In the New World, versions of the basic marinade are often used with foods other than fish and meats, for example cassava or green bananas with chicken gizzards (Puerto Rico), jalapeño peppers (Mexico), etc. The origin of the word escabeche is Persian, and was brought to Spain by the Arabs during the Moorish conquests.

About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of selected processed fruit products falling within subheading 2008 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The subheading is defined as: Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise <b>prepared</b> <b>or</b> <b>preserved,</b> whether <b>or</b> not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included. As specified {{in the terms of}} reference, the inquiry covers products under the following tariff classifications: 	 2008. 30. 00 (citrus) 	 2008. 40. 00 (pears) 	 2008. 50. 00 (apricots) 	 2008. 70. 00 (peaches) 	 2008. 97. 00 (mixtures) 	 2008. 99. 00 (other). The terms of reference are reprinted {{at the beginning of this}} report. Safeguard action is temporary, ‘emergency action’ (using tariffs, tariff-quotas or quotas) implemented in situations where a surge of imports causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. Safeguard measures may be applied for up to four years, and may be extended for a further four years, subject to several conditions. The Commission is to provide a report to the Australian Government by 20 December 2013 on whether safeguard measures are justified. In addition, the Commission is to provide an ‘accelerated report’ by 20 September 2013, as to whether provisional safeguard measures should be put in place...|$|R
40|$|Trade with Latin American {{countries}} is {{an increasingly important}} issue, as negotiations progress for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze U. S. agricultural trade with Latin American countries, determine factors influencing agricultural trade with these countries, and estimate possible effects of trade liberalization under the FTAA on U. S. agricultural trade. This study analyzes U. S. exports of wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, soybean meal, beef, pork, and poultry meat to 16 Latin American countries; U. S. imports of bananas, coffee, grapes, fruit and vegetable juice, sugar, pineapples, avocados, mangos, <b>prepared</b> <b>or</b> <b>preserved</b> meat, crustaceans, and fish fillets or meat from these countries are also analyzed. An econometric model is developed and estimated to determine factors influencing U. S. agricultural trade with these countries. Results from the model show that there is a negative relationship between U. S. exports and foreign tariffs, price, exchange rates, and foreign production, while there is a positive relationship between U. S. exports and foreign real GDP. U. S. imports have a negative relationship with U. S. tariffs and price and a positive relationship with the exchange rate. U. S. tariffs on imports of agricultural products from Latin American countries, though, are small or nonexistent in many cases. This would suggest that trade liberalization could have a larger effect on U. S. exports than on imports. Trade creation and trade diversion effects of tariff removal under the FTAA are calculated. Trade creation effects, overall, are higher for U. S. exports to these countries than they are for U. S. imports. The trade diversion effects, especially for exports, are small because most agricultural imports in the hemisphere are from other countries within the hemisphere, indicating that the FTAA will not significantly affect trade of the agricultural commodities under analysis with third-party, non-member countries. The United States could significantly increase exports of meat products, corn, and rice, and imports of fruit juice and grapes, under the FTAA.

This study aimed to evaluate <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> production from technical, marketing, consumer perception and business development strategy perspectives. The analysis {{used in this study}} is descriptive statistics. The interview and questionnaire are administered to 30 respondents (15 small, medium and large scale fish producers in Tegalsari Village and 15 customers in Semarang). 	The results show that Layang fish as raw material is collected from PPI Tegalsari, PPI Pelabuhan, and PPI Muarareja. <b>Preserved</b> <b>fish</b> distribution is including fisherman, large traders, and producers. Marketing pattern for <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> is simple. The fish 2 - 3 times handed over before delivered to final customers.

The main {{objectives of the}} study were to identify different bacteria constituents and quantitative bacterial load in Asian seabass when preserved with ice and sea salt. For the purpose of this study, Asian seabass was stored in two different conditions of ice-chilled and salted for 2 days. All fish samples were analyzed by performing bacteriological analysis and the isolated bacteria were identified by using API ® identification system. In case of the quantity of bacteria in the flesh, Chilling and salting had no significant difference to the quantity of bacteria on fish flesh. As for the skin, salt-preserved fish showed higher quantity of bacteria than ice-preserved fish. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas fluorescens had been identified from skin sample of ice-chilled fish. Besides P. fluorescens and A. baumannii other isolates identified include Vibrio and Myxobacteria. All bacteria were cocci-shaped except a few bacilli. In term of bacteria number and morphological characteristics, ice-chilled <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> was better than salt <b>preserved</b> <b>fish.</b> Overall, less number of bacteria was observed in both ice-chilled and sea salt <b>preserved</b> <b>fish.</b> The result of this study indicated that the quick preservation is a very important factor to control bacterial load in the <b>preserved</b> <b>fish...</b>|$|R
