40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether students who achieved a four-year college degree <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> entering <b>pharmacy</b> <b>school</b> had significantly higher first year <b>pharmacy</b> <b>school</b> grade point averages than students without a prior four year college degree. All students who entered the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy during 1992, 1993, and 1994 were included in the study. A total of 342 pharmacy student records were audited from the entering professional classes of 1992, 1993, and 1994. Four way analysis using the general linear model procedure was performed on the total study population (1992 - 1994) to determine whether degree, age, class-year, math/science prepharmacy grade point average, or any interaction term involving these variables was a significant factor contributing to the academic performance of first year pharmacy students. Analysis using the general linear model procedure was used to determine whether ages of students were different according to degree status (students with or without four year college degrees). For all years, students with a prior college degree performed significantly better than students without a prior college degree (P< 0. 05). The difference in grade point averages that existed between students was significantly associated with degree status and math/science prepharmacy grade point average, not age or class-year. The overall model R-square is 0. 38 (the math/science prepharmacy GPA and the degree partial r-square is 0. 28 and 0. 10 respectively). The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 52 and the variance inflation factor (age= 1. 37; degree= 1. 33) revealed no adverse effect of collinearity between age and degree in our model. This study validates that students with prior four year college degrees had significantly higher first year grade point averages than students without degrees in this population. Significance and implications of the results for pharmacy admission procedures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to assess pre-pharmacy students’ {{perceptions}} (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and professional commitment) of the professional role of pharmacists <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> enrollment in <b>pharmacy</b> <b>school.</b> The secondary {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the association between pre-pharmacy student perceptions of the professional role and student demographics. A survey instrument was distributed to students (N= 195) enrolled in the pre-pharmacy curriculum at Purdue University during an organic chemistry laboratory. The 58 item survey contained questions regarding roles of the pharmacist, work experiences, and demographics. A seven point Likert scale (3 =strongly agree to - 3 =strongly disagree) was used to determine factors affecting perceptions. Results revealed that theory of planned behavior (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) subscales were affected by grade point average (attitude p= 0. 044, perceived behavioral control p= 0. 043), gender (subjective norm p= 0. 014), and application <b>to</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>school</b> (attitude p= 0. 001, subjective norm p= 0. 029, perceived behavioral control p= 0. 005) while unpaid work experience affected professional commitment (p= 0. 043). Students evaluated work experience related <b>to</b> their <b>pharmacy</b> studies more positively than students employed in non-pharmacy related areas in the areas of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The theory of planned behavior measures utilized in this study, in conjunction with the professional commitment measures, could be used as potential screening methods for <b>pharmacy</b> <b>school</b> applicants. However, scores on such measures must first be linked to adequate or desirable levels of such attitudes, as well as standardized with a number of “ideal” practitioners. The scores of potential applicants could be compared to “ideal” practitioner scores and the differences and/or similarities could be used as support in modifying curriculum. ...|$|R

METHODS: A remodeled version of the Interdisciplinary Education Perceptions Scale (IEPS) was administered during a regular class time for first, second, and third year students. This adapted IEPS was designed and validated to assess three aspects of interprofessional perceptions: competency and autonomy (sub-scale 1), perceived need for cooperation (sub-scale 2), and perception of actual cooperation (sub-scale 3). Data regarding sex, age, previous health care work experience, and previous degree achievement were also collected.

40|$|AbstractThe {{trends in}} the quality of {{biomedical}} education in <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools</b> have witnessed significant changes in the 21 st century. With the advent of continuous revision and standardization processes of medical curricula throughout the world, the focus has been on imparting quality education. This pedagogic paradigm has shifted <b>to</b> <b>pharmacy</b> <b>schools.</b> In Saudi Arabia, the concept of “medical and pharmacy education” is relatively new as mainstream pharmacy curriculum and universities were established only half a century ago. This period has seen major changes in the dimension of “pharmacy education” {{to keep pace with the}} education systems in the United States and Europe. As our knowledge and perceptions about pharmaceuticals change with time, this motivates educators to search for better teaching alternatives to the ever increasing number of enthusiastic and budding pharmacists. Recently, the academic system in Saudi Arabian Pharmacy has adopted a more clinically-oriented Pharm. D. curriculum. This paper deals with the major changes from the inception of a small pharmacy faculty in 1959, the College of Pharmacy at the King Saud University, Riyadh, to the model of progress and a prototype of pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia. The fifty year chronological array can be regarded as an epitome of progress in pharmacy education in Saudi Arabia from its traditional curriculum to the modern day Pharm. D. curriculum with a high population growth and expanding health care sector, the demand for qualified pharmacists is growing and is projected to grow considerably in the future. The number of pharmacy graduates is increasing each year by many folds and to meet the needs the system lays stress upon a constant revising and updating of the current curriculum from a global perspective...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies suggest}} that some medications, {{including}} proton pump inhibi-tors and -agonist inhalers, are administered to hospitalized patients and sometimes continued without indications. Medication reconciliation has been offered as one mechanism to reduce the frequency of such medication errors and is now mandated by the Joint Commission (NPSG. 03. 06. 01). We hypothesized that (1) agonists and acid-blocking medications are prescribed following critical illness without indications, and (2) medication reconciliation can reduce the frequency of inappro-priate continuation of these agents. The study {{was carried out in}} a 414 -bed community teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Connecticut Medical School. All subjects were admitted to the ICU between February and April 2012 (physician-driven reconciliation) and between July and September 2012, just following implementation of pharmacy technician-driven medication recon-ciliation.
