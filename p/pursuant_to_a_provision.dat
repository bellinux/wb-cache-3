500|$|The {{introduction}} of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity {{and use of the}} three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the base metal five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government if presented in $100 lots <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as [...] "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would take no more than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a surplus of base metal coins often sold them at a discount.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The federal government guarantees loans in the Federal Family Education Loan program (FFELP) so that private lenders that {{participate in the program}} will be reimbursed if a borrower defaults, and about $ 4. 6 billion was spent in fiscal year 2006 to repay lenders for defaulted loans. To retain the guarantee on their loans, all FFELP lenders must comply with minimum due diligence requirements for servicing loans, including establishing a borrower's first repayment due date and making a certain number of attempts to contact delinquent borrowers. Lenders that adhere to these requirements are eligible to receive at least a standard reimbursement rate of 97 percent of the outstanding principal and accrued interest for defaults. However, <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, the Secretary of Education has the authority to designate lenders and loan servicers as "exceptional performers" in servicing FFELP loans, and loans serviced by those with the exceptional performer designation qualify for a 99 percent reimbursement rate. The amendments also provided authority to the Secretary of Education to terminate the exceptional performer program following a GAO study, if such termination is in the fiscal interest of the United States. To obtain the exceptional performer designation, loan servicers have to obtain an initial audit, by independent auditors, demonstrating at least 97 percent compliance with due diligence requirements for a random sample of loans they service, and they must continue to demonstrate compliance through quarterly and annual audits to maintain the designation. The first exceptional performer designation that Education granted took effect in January 2004, and 18 organizations that service about 90 percent of all FFELP loans currently have the exceptional performer designation. Congress asked us to conduct a review of the exceptional performer program to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent is the exceptional performer program meeting its objectives of improving loan servicing and decreasing defaults? (2) What are {{the costs and benefits of}} the exceptional performer program?...|$|E
5000|$|Federal jurisdictions may {{presume that}} either federal or local {{government}} authority prevails {{in the absence}} of a defined rule. In Canada, there are areas of law where provincial governments and the federal government have concurrent jurisdiction. In these cases the federal law is held to be paramount. However, in areas where the Canadian constitution is silent, the federal government does not necessarily have superior jurisdiction. Rather, an area of law that is not expressly mentioned in Canada's Constitution will have to be interpreted to fall under either the federal residual jurisdiction found in the preamble of s. 91โknown as the Peace, Order and Good Government clauseโor the provinces residual jurisdiction of [...] "Property and Civil Rights" [...] under s. 92(13) of the 1867 Constitution Act. This contrasts with other federal jurisdictions, notably the United States and Australia, where it is presumed that if legislation is not enacted <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>provision</b> of the federal Constitution, the states will have authority over the relevant matter in their respective jurisdictions, unless the state's definitions of their statutes conflicts with federally established or recognized rights.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{analysis}} of the Danes who were deported as โasocialโ and โhabitual criminalsโ during a short period of the Second World War, i. e. from 1944 to 1945. The purpose of this project is to identify who this group comprised by examining their compensation cases from the Danish โErstatningsrรฅdโ (compensation board). The purpose is also to gain insight into the function of the โErstatningsrรฅdโ and how it processed the applications for compensation submitted by the โasocialโ individuals. Furthermore the purpose is to discuss whether {{the way in which the}} โasocialโ were viewed as a group at the time influenced their compensation cases. Our primary sources are individual cases from the โErstatningsrรฅdโ, as well as a German article about โasocialsโ in concentration camps, written by Wolfgang Ayass. This article gives insight into the โasocialโ group and how they were regarded, especially by political inmates in the concentration camps and during the post-war period. We conclude that Danes who were deported as โasocialโ were primarily criminals but a few were deported due to the Nazi ideology of eugenics. A lesser number of the Danes deported for being โasocialโ were members of the resistance movement in Denmark. In {{an analysis of}} the Danish compensation cases submitted by โasocialโ individuals, we conclude that there was a discreet aversion towards giving compensation and that the compensation cases were often rejected <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> special <b>provision</b> of the law โ section 65. This paragraph was only applied to the cases involving the โasocialsโ and covered disgraceful national behaviour. Nonetheless, many of the โasocialโ individuals were granted compensation...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From 1945 through 1962, the United States {{conducted a series of}} aboveground atomic weapons tests as it built up its Cold War nuclear arsenal. Around this same time period, the United States also conducted underground uranium-mining operations and related activities, which were critical to the production of the atomic weapons. Many people were exposed to radiation resulting from the nuclear weapons development and testing program, and such exposure is presumed <b>to</b> have produced <b>an</b> increased incidence of certain serious diseases, including various types of cancer. To make partial restitution to these individuals, or their eligible surviving beneficiaries, for their hardships associated with the radiation exposure, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was enacted on October 15, 1990. RECA provided that the Attorney General be responsible for processing and adjudicating claims under the act. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP), which is administered by its Civil Division's Torts Branch. RECP began processing claims in April 1992. RECA has been amended various times, including on July 10, 2000, when the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000 (RECA Amendments of 2000) were enacted. The RECA Amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for benefits to include two new occupationally exposed claimant categories (uranium mill workers and uranium ore transporters), expanding both the time periods and geographic areas covered, and adding compensable diseases, thus allowing more individuals to be eligible to qualify. The RECA Trust Fund is scheduled to terminate in 2022 <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sunset <b>provision</b> in the legislation. The RECA Amendments of 2000 also mandated that we report to Congress on DOJ's administration of RECA not later than 18 months after the enactment of the amendments and every 18 months thereafter. We have reported three times previously on DOJ's administration of RECA. This report updates information on DOJ's administration of RECA including the outcome of the claims adjudication process, including the number and status of claims approved, denied, and pending since RECP began in April 1992; average processing time for claims; and RECP's current {{estimates of the number of}} future claims to be paid from the RECA Trust Fund, associated funding requirements, and RECP administrative costs. ...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Supreme Courtโs {{important}} {{ruling in}} Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Bartlett concerns whether the Food and Drug Administrationโs (โFDAโ) {{approval of a}} generic drug insulates the drug manufacturer from liability under state tort laws from claims of injury due <b>to</b> <b>an</b> alleged โdesign defect. โ The Court previously ruled that FDA approval does not preempt state law claims based upon failure-to-warn, at least with respect to brand name products. In contrast, the Court previously ruled that the federal regulatory process leading to FDA approval of generic equivalents of brand drugsโand designation of the drug labelโdoes preempt state law as to claims that challenge the warnings that accompany generic drugs. In each of these cases, the underlying issue has been whether the federal regulatory process leading to FDA approval of drugs and medical devices โpreemptโ state laws as to the safety issues addressed through the approval process. Thus, to summarize the applicable law prior to Bartlett, the Court had upheld failure-to-warn claims against the brand (preemption denied) but denied failure-to-warn claims against the generic (preemption upheld); the Court has also denied device manufacturersโ liability for most product liability-related claims (preemption upheld) <b>pursuant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific statutory <b>provision.</b> By <b>a</b> vote of 5 - 4, Bartlett has now denied liability of generic manufacturers {{on the basis of}} design-defect. Following the Supreme Court opinion, however, the FDA set forth its agenda, which includes proposing a rule that would allow generic drug makers to revise their drug labels. If created and adopted, this rule could again alter the landscape of liability for generic manufacturers. Further, the related issue (which is still unresolved by the high court and {{is the subject of a}} split among the circuit courts) is whether FDA approval of medical devices preempts all state law actions, thus insulating device manufacturers from product liability claims under all circumstances. This Article will address each of these issues, as well as the related issue of whether off-label use of FDA-approved medical devices give rise to liability...|$|R
40|$|Poland is a {{participant}} in the ongoing process of globalisation, of which one of the characteristic features is a greater movement of people. Also, Polandโs accession to the European Union has brought about a trend called Europeanisation, current-ly being observed in the administrative law as well. This, in turn, has resulted in a growing number of related legislative acts that govern the administrative and legal status of foreigners. And yet, despite this extensive legislation on the subject, not all procedural questions have now been answered. The core of the analysis presented in this paper is the decision on the permit to settle, delivered in the context of constitutional rights provided for in Article 52 Paragraph 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. <b>Pursuant</b> <b>to</b> its <b>provisions,</b> <b>a</b> person whose Polish origin has been confi rmed in accordance with applicable law may settle permanently in Poland. However, an analysis of substantive adminis-trative law suggests that in the current legal system there is no specifi c regulation upon which a public body could base its decision in the above matter. Thus, unless the Constitution provides otherwise, its provisions will be directly applicable. Con-sequently, a decision permitting settlement will be an example of a unique, direct application of constitutional provisions. In practice, this means that both, individuals and administrative bodies, fi nd themselves in a diffi cult legal position. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the specifi c features of a settlement permit and to identify the procedure leading to granting such permit. It has been concluded that <b>a</b> decision <b>to</b> settle is <b>a</b> bound decision, grounded in the provisions of the Act on Foreigners, the Charter of the Pole and the Repatriation Act. Because of the specifi cs of the proceedings and the resulting decisions, the ad-ministrative body must rely for support on the above acts, taking into account the specifi city of the matter. Currently, administrative bodies must base their decisions directly on the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic Poland, and will have to do so until appropriate legal solutions have been adopted...|$|R
