40|$|Cryptic {{chromosome}} aberrations are {{a common}} cause of idiopathic mental retardation and multiple congenital malformations syndromes (MR/MCM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study describes results and compares three methods for detection of submicroscopic chromosome aberrations in 76 children with MR/MCM and normal routine G-banded karyotype. RESULTS: Cryptic chromosome aberrations were detected in 15 patients (19. 7 %) : in 3 of 19 patients (15. 8 %) by subtelomeric fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), in 5 of 47 patients (10. 6 %) by Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and in 7 of 23 patients (30. 4 %) by array-Comparative Genome Hybridization (array-CGH). Seven deletions, four duplications and four complex rearrangements have been diagnosed in the present study. Six were de novo and 2 were inherited from a <b>parent</b> <b>carrier</b> of balanced translocation. DISCUSSION: We observed a slightly higher imbalance incidence compared to the literature. Among these aberrations there were well known syndromes {{as well as some}} rare variants. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the utility of molecular-cytogenetic screening in patients with MR/MCM. We suggest array-CGH as the most reliable technique with a high diagnostic yield. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of IFRS for the consolidated {{accounts of the}} EU-listed companies meant a change in Sweden in terms of reviewing tangible assets depreciation method, useful life and residual value. The change led to a requirement to do reviews annually, unlike before when companies only had to do reviews when they felt a need for it. The regulation does not give specific guidelines of how to implement reviews, and since IFRS is a policy-based framework the companies are given room for interpretation. In the mining industry tangible assets {{are closely related to}} the useful life of the mine since they are depending on the ore mining. Tangible assets represent over 50 % of mining companies’ balance sheet which makes reviews significant in this industry. The study aims to create understanding of how IAS 16 paragraph 51 and 61 is interpreted by describing the reviewing process in practice in the mining industry. Companies’ interpretation can result in various ways of conducting reviews which in turn affects the design of their financial reports. Financial reports should display a true and fair view but former {{studies have shown that the}} term true and fair view is hard to define. The study also examines whether the interpretation contributes to a true and fair view in terms of the qualitative characteristics relevance, faithful representation, comparability and understandability. Empirical data was collected through interviews at corporate level and <b>parent</b> <b>carrier</b> level at two mining companies' financial departments’ in order to, from an accounting perspective, understand how the reviews is performed in practice. The study concludes that the companies’ interpretation of the standard is similar, but the companies are in different stages when it comes to establishing and implementing reviewing processes. The companies' interpretation is based on trade-offs between benefits and costs, which means that reviews occur when companies consider the impact on financial results to be large enough to justify the workload that reviews requires. This interpretation is somewhat subjective, but the trade-off does not seem to affect the financial result to the extent that a true and fair view will not be presented in financial statements. The study raises questions about what is considered to be a review. Is it enough to devote a thought to tangible assets to determine that the circumstances around them have not changed, or should all tangible assets routinely be reviewed annually?Validerat; 20150610 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
50|$|Familial dysautonomia is seen almost {{exclusively}} in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

40|$|A {{brother and}} two sisters of {{remotely}} consanguineous parents had congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis and moderate mental retardation. In the two older sibs, mental deficiency could have resulted from birth asphyxia, but the youngest girl was already microcephalic at birth and had no apparent asphyxia. The mother, who was healthy and of normal intelligence, was found on laryngoscopy to have unilateral laryngeal abductor paralysis. This is the first family with both mentally retarded and nonretarded affected members with congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis. Inheritance is most likely autosomal dominant with variable expression, but autosomal recessive inheritance, with both <b>parents</b> <b>carriers</b> and the mother an affected homozygote, and X linked inheritance are also possible...|$|R
40|$|Can {{a parent}} {{adjust to the}} idea that its child is at risk for a sudden death? This {{question}} is raised by a diagnostic procedure in which children were tested for an inherited Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). This potentially life-threatening but treatable cardiac arrhythmia syndrome may cause sudden death, especially in children and young adults. The long-term psychological effects are described for parents whose children were tested for inherited LQTS. The adverse short-term impact of such testing has been described previously. The goal of this investigation is to determine whether this distress endures. Thirty-six parents completed measures of psychological distress. With the twenty-four <b>parents</b> of <b>carrier</b> children, a semi-structured interview was held 18 months after DNA disclosure. <b>Parents</b> of <b>carrier</b> children reported more distress than parents of non-carrier children. <b>Parents</b> of <b>carrier</b> children remained vulnerable to high levels of distress; up to one-third of these parents showed clinically relevant high levels of distress. High levels of distress were reported by <b>parents</b> of <b>carrier</b> children who (1) were highly distressed at previous assessments, (2) were familiar with the disease for a longer time, (3) had experienced a sudden death in the family, (4) were lesser educated, and who (5) were unsatisfied with the given information. Parents were particularly concerned about possible hazardous behavior during puberty. We conclude that the continuous threat of developing LQTS symptoms despite prophylactic treatment affected the psychological well-being of the parents for a long time. In light of the tempetuous developments in the areas of cardiac genetics, periodical information on new insight and developments may act as a buffer for the parents' (growing) concerns about their child's inherited disorder.
