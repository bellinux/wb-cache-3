Here, several findings using a combination of isotopic, pyrolytic, microscopic and gas chromatographic methods lead to the <b>proposal</b> <b>of</b> a novel model of humin structure. The formation of humin should thus involve at least three processes: selective preservation of microbial, straight-chain biopolymers; physical encapsulation <b>of</b> apolar <b>substances</b> by weak forces; and chemical binding by covalent bonds...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Condition <b>of</b> <b>Substance</b> Search (COS) {{algorithm}} is introduced to solve optimal reactive power dispatch problem. The Condition <b>of</b> <b>Substance</b> Search (COS) {{algorithm is}} based on the simulation of the shape <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> incidence. In Condition <b>of</b> <b>Substance</b> Search (COS) algorithm, individuals follow molecules which interrelate to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the corporal principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is developed by considering each condition <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> in harmony with different exploration–exploitation ratio. The evolutionary progression is alienated into three phases which emulate the three condition of substance: solid, liquid & gas. This technique can considerably improve the equilibrium between exploration–exploitation, however preserving the high-quality search ability of an evolutionary approach. The proposed Condition <b>of</b> <b>Substance</b> Search (COS) algorithm has been tested on standard IEEE 30 bus test system and simulation results show clearly the improved performance of the projected Condition <b>of</b> <b>Substance</b> Search (COS) algorithm in reducing the real power loss and voltage stability also enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Evidence of an {{association}} between use <b>of</b> illicit <b>substances</b> and aggressive behavior is pervasive. But the precise causal mechanisms by which aggression is influenced by intoxicants are still not well understood. Research on intoxication and aggression often has overlooked the nonviolent behavior <b>of</b> most <b>substance</b> users, controlled use <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> and the evidence from other cultures of a weak or nonexistent relation between substance use and aggression. There is only limited evidence that ingestion <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> is a direct, pharmacological cause of aggression. The temporal order <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use and aggression does not indicate a causal role for intoxicants. Research on the nexus between substance use and aggression consistently has found a complex relation, mediated by the type <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> and its psychoactive effects, personality factors and the expected effects <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> situational factors in the immediate settings where substances are used, and sociocultural factors that channel the arousal effects <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> into behaviors that may include aggression.
