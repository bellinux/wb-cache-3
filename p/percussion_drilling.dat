500|$|Salt well: The Chinese {{have been}} using brine wells and a form of salt {{solution}} mining {{as part of the}} civilization for more than 2000 years. [...] The first recorded salt well in China was dug in the Sichuan province around 2,250 years ago. This {{was the first time that}} ancient water well technology was applied successfully for the exploitation of salt, and marked the beginning of Sichuan’s salt drilling industry. Shaft wells were sunk as early as 220 BC in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. By 1035 AD, Chinese in the Sichuan area were using <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> to recover deep brines, a technique that would not be introduced to the West for another 600 to 800 years. Medieval and modern European travelers to China between 1400 to 1700 AD reported salt and natural gas production from dense networks of brine wells. Many of the wells were sunk deeper than 450 m and at least one well was more than 1000 meters deep. The medieval Venetian traveler to China Marco Polo reported an annual production in a single province of more than 30,000 tonnes of brine during his time there.|$|E

50|$|Salt {{production}} via boreholes {{was once}} {{prevalent in the}} entire Sichuan area - but for several factors (war, rebellion, taxes, wells drying up) Zigong {{became the center of}} production. Salt wells in Zigong were deeper and had better brine salinity - making for better yields in the salt extraction process. The method in which boreholes were drilled is significant. In 1835, the world's (at that time) deepest well was drilled reaching 3,300 feet (compared with a much publicised well in Pennsylvania at 69.5 feet). Wealthy families of the Sichuan city of Jingyan invented deep <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> techniques used in Zigong - 400 years before the Europeans. The miners of Zigong refined the techniques of deep borehole drilling. Later, Europeans copied and further refined the <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> methods - so its effects {{can be seen in the}} modern Drilling rig used for oil and water.|$|E

The <b>percussion</b> <b>drill</b> is designed to go down to 2 m and collect cemented ice samples for an onboard miniaturised laboratory called ProSPA.|$|R
5000|$|Pneumatic drills were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven <b>percussion</b> <b>drill.</b> In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven drill. A pneumatic drill was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a <b>percussion</b> <b>drill</b> of his own design. In Fowle’s drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true pneumatic drill.|$|R
50|$|In DTH drilling, the {{percussion}} mechanism - {{commonly called}} the hammer - is located {{directly behind the}} drill bit. The drill pipes transmit the necessary feed force and rotation to hammer and bit plus compressed air or fluids for the hammer and flushing of cuttings. The drill pipes {{are added to the}} drill string successively behind the hammer as the hole gets deeper. The piston strikes the impact surface of the bit directly, while the hammer casing gives straight and stable guidance of the drill bit. This means that the impact energy does not have to pass through any joints at all. The impact energy therefore is not lost in joints allowing for much deeper <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling.</b> This is a great breakthrough for smaller portable water well drilling rigs, that before were limited. The DTH on smaller rigs now can get same results as large heavy truck rigs.|$|E
50|$|Salt {{became an}} engine of {{commerce}} and wealth for Zigong. There were cheaper methods for salt production, as to start a borehole well cost 3,000 pieces of silver, but transportation cost into the Sichuan valley negated the cheaper production methods (as they usually involved sea water). Zigong {{is located in the}} central Chinese Sichuan province, which was a large basin, surrounded by mountains on three sides and therefore somewhat isolated. Before refrigeration was available salt was a key chemical used in preserving vegetables, meat, and fish. Because of the factors mentioned above (war, wells drying up, and a rebellion) Zigong became a significant supplier of salt to the Sichuan province up until the 1930s. In 1892, miners discovered a vein of rocksalt that feeds Zigongs aquifers. In 1946, a well was drilled with a rotary drillbit. Ancient <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> methods became obsolete and most of the drilling rigs were torn down due to decay. Today, only one traditional salt well still exists, the Shenhai Well, as a tribute to the workers and industry. The Shenhai Well (Bore depth: 1,001.4 meters/4,400 feet) still operates using the older manual methods of pumping and boiling. The salt is used for pickling or canning - and makes an important ingredient to Sichuan style pickles (which are a local favorite). In the modern day, Zigong is a primary source for Natural Gas, Coal, and Inorganic Chemical Production in addition to salt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A major {{challenge}} in laser <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> of steel is {{to enhance the}} material removal rate by optimizing the process parameter.

Commissioned by the King of Sardinia in 1845 to dig the Fréjus Rail Tunnel between France and Italy through the Alps, Maus had it built in 1846 in an arms factory near Turin. It consisted of more than 100 <b>percussion</b> <b>drills</b> mounted {{in the front of}} a locomotive-sized machine, mechanically power-driven from the entrance of the tunnel. The Revolutions of 1848 affected the funding, and the tunnel was not completed until 10 years later, by using less innovative and less expensive methods such as pneumatic drills.|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{external}} electric field was employed during the laser <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> on highly reflective materials. The laser-produced plasma was sputtered substantially, and the charged ions in the plasma plume were {{drawn by the}} electrodes. Different configurations of plate electrodes were proposed and investigated in this work to provide a simple, low-cost method that allows expelling the laser-induced plasma during the <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> process. The electric field resulted from the potential that was applied across the two electrodes.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of ultrafast laser ablation technology in precision micromachining has dramatically increased {{the demand for}} reliable and real-time detection systems to characterize the material removal process. In particular, the laser <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> of metals is lacking of non-invasive techniques able to monitor into the depth the spatial-and time-dependent evolution all through the ablation process. To understand the physical interaction between bulk material and high-energy light beam, accurate in-situ measurements of process parameters such as the penetration depth and the removal rate are crucial. We report on direct real time measurements of the ablation front displacement and the removal rate during ultrafast laser <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> of metals by implementing a contactless sensing technique based on optical feedback interferometry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the forearm muscular contraction levels associated to the use of anti-vibration gloves, by comparing the contraction levels with gloves and without gloves. Two different vibration tools were used in a simulated work environment: (1) A compact Duty Multi-Cutter Bosch and (2) and a <b>Percussion</b> <b>Drill</b> with a drill bit Ø 20 mm. Standard operations were performed by each subject in the following materials: (1) Performing cross-sectional cuts in 80 x 40 mm pine section and (2) performing 20 mm diameter holes in a concrete slab 2 x 2 m, 70 mm thick. The forearm contraction level were measured by surface electromyography in four different muscles: Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS), Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU), Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus (ECRL) e Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (ECU). For the flexor muscles (FDS, FCU), an increase tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (2 - 5 % MVE increase in the FDS and 3 - 9 % MVE increase in the FCU). For the extensor muscles ECU a decrease tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (1 - 10 % MVE decrease). Any tendency was found in the ECRL muscle.

40|$|In most laser micro-machining {{applications}} using copper vapour lasers, {{the system}} is configured for near-diffraction limited beam quality. This enables the beam to be tightly focussed to very small spot sizes {{and can be used}} for drilling very small holes or trepanning larger ones. The focused spot has a gaussian-like profile. In this paper a new laser system is presented that has a flat-top beam when focused. This has many advantages over gaussian beams when applied to <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> and certain other applications. This system has demonstrated high speed <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> of high quality 100 micron diameter holes in metals.

The new laser system is a compact copper vapour laser (CVL) master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) incorporating telescopic beam expansion in a high-gain double-pass amplifier. By configuring an oscillator for low coherence output and using a multimode optical fibre between the oscillator and a double-pass amplifier, high power (up to 34 W) low divergence output beams having well defined flat-top far field beam profiles have been produced. This scheme generates a flat-top far-field beam profile by control of the spatial coherence of a flat-top near-field beam rather than the usual techniques of producing flattened gaussian beams from coherent gaussian beams.

A gradual change in sedimentary porosity produces a similar gradual change in drilling rates and strength properties. A small change in crystalline rock porosity produces a profound change in strength properties and a lesser effect on drill penetration rates. Brazilian disc fracture modes in the sandstones were predominantly inter-granular and through the phyllosilicate matrix. Crystalline rocks exhibited three fracture modes: inter-granular along grain boundaries, intra-granular along cleavage direction and intra-granular chonchoidal fractures.

Pulses of 10 ns to 250 ns are applied, with peak powers up to 10 kW while maintaining average power. This corresponds to over 3 GW/cm 2 fluence levels.

40|$|One {{industrial}} application of laser drilling is {{the production of}} cooling holes at acute angles in single crystal nickel superalloy material. However, laser drilled holes are inherently associated with metallurgical defects such as recast layers and oxide formations. In previous studies {{it has been found}} that optimising laser parameters to minimise the recast layer increased the oxide layer thickness. In an attempt to better understand the formation of this oxide defect, a comparative study was performed to investigate the effects of drilling angle and peak power on the metallurgy of laser <b>percussion</b> <b>drilled</b> holes in turbine blade material - CMSX- 4. The variation of the oxide layer thickness with peak power, drilling angle and hole depth is compared. The location and thickness of the oxide layer is found to be highly dependent on drilling angle - with the greatest thickness being observed on the leading edge corner at most acute angle (30 °).
