40|$|Packed bed wet {{scrubber}} is an {{air pollution control}} device which uses liquid to remove pollutant from the process air streams. It is widely used in many industries in Malaysia to remove soluble gaseous pollutants. It is also capable of removing particles with low particles loading. The common designs of the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> are cross flow and counter current flow. In this project, the efficiencies of cross flow and counter current flow packed bed {{wet scrubber}}s used in Penang, Malaysia are studied and compared.

40|$|Biogas can be {{produced}} from any biomass source and is renewable fuel. The main drawbacks {{in the composition of}} biogas are the presence of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) which affect the storage devices. The removal of CO 2 and H 2 S is of great interest today. Different methods for removal of both the elements were suggested by many researchers. The present work aims to remove the CO 2 and H 2 S using combined effects of water scrubbing and algae. For this purpose a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> was designed using Solid Works and fabricated in our department.

40|$|In the Dutch Hercules project feces {{and urine}} from pigs are {{collected}} separately and treated in two processes: feces are composted and urine is concentrated by water evaporation. Water unsaturated exhaust {{air from the}} pig house is used for evaporation in a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber.</b> The urine is acidified with nitric acid to scrub ammonia from the air. In this way a concentrated N/K fertilizer is produced from urine and ammonia {{is removed from the}} pig house exhaust air. Experiments were conducted using a pilot scale <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> in an experimental pig house. The ammonia scrubbing efficiency and the evaporation rate were determined during one pig fattening round of 112 days. The average composition of the collected pig urine was 4. 4 g nitrogen/kg, 6. 6 g potassium/kg and 0. 03 g phosphorus/kg. The volume of the urine was reduced by a factor 6 - 7 resulting in a concentrate composition of 91. 3 g/kg total nitrogen (including nitrogen added as nitric acid), 46. 5 g/kg potassium and 0. 2 g/kg phosphorus. The mean evaporation rate was 28 kg/day at inlet air conditions of 74 % relative humidity and a temperature of 19 °C. The inlet air of the scrubber was more humid (74 % instead of 60 %) than expected. This resulted in a evaporation rate that was below expectations. The ammonia scrubbing efficiency was determined 5 times and ranged from 68 to 95 %. The efficiency decreased at higher salt concentrations of the urin...|$|E

40|$|Emission {{control in}} the chrome plating {{industry}} has seen an evolution in regulation.

40|$|The use of air {{cleaning}} systems to reduce ammonia emissions from animal houses is increasing. These systems are normally used {{in order to}} comply with local or national regulations of ammonia emission. Therefore, accurate determination of the proportion of ammonia being removed by these systems is crucial. There are two main methods available to measure ammonia removal efficiency of scrubbers: air balance (based on the measurement of ammonia concentrations in air) and combined water-air balance (in which it is also necessary to {{determine the amount of}} nitrogen recovered in the liquid phase). The first method is simpler to establish, while the second method might provide deeper information about the processes occurring. The main aim of this work was to assess, in terms of the variability of the results, the use of these two methods to evaluate the efficiency of an acid <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> on a pig farm. An acid <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> (70 % NH 3 removal) was monitored during ten complete 24 h cycles for ammonia concentrations, airflow rates, and nitrogen accumulation in the acid solution basin. The average efficiency calculated using the air balance method was 71 % (Â± 4 %), close to the design value of 70 %, while the average efficiency when using the combined water-air balance method was 255 % (Â± 53 %). The accumulation and precipitation of ammonium salts in the packing material seem to be the main cause of the high variability and inaccuracy of the combined water-air balance method observed for this type of scrubber. According to these results, it is recommended to use the air balance method when determining the ammonia removal efficiency for acid packed bed scrubbers similar to the one studied here. According to the variability of the results observed in this work, at least 24 measurement days are needed {{in order to keep the}} relative error below 5 % when using the air balance method to determine the ammonia removal efficiency of an acid packed bed scrubbe...|$|E

40|$|Present {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) systems demonstrate high system efficiency and impressive environmental performance, giving them {{an edge over}} conventional pulverised fuel power stations. A key area {{in the development of}} IGCCs is hot fuel gas clean-up (HGCU). Fuel gas cleaning at elevated temperatures reduces thermal efficiency losses associated with gas quenching in conventional cold gas cleaning methods. Current hot gas desulphurisation techniques focus on the use of regenerable metal oxide sorbents, however the long-term sorbent performance issues have yet to be fully addressed. A fresh and radical approach may provide the key to overcoming the inherent limitations associated with metal oxide sorbents. A molten tin irrigated <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> adopted in this research project is one such innovative way forward in HGCU. The hot scrubber offers the prospect of a multicomponent clean-up device. High-temperature sulphur removal takes place via absorption of H 2 S (and COS) into molten tin whilst discrete molten tin droplets and rivulets on the packing surface act as solid particulate collectors. The primary aim of this research project was to investigate the workings of a small-scale room temperature <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>scrubber</b> operating under non-wetting flow conditions analogous to the molten tin irrigated scrubber. Water irrigation of low surface energy packings simulated the nonwetting flow of liquid metals. The air-water analogue of the liquid metal scrubber provided the platform for hydrodynamics (flow visualisation, flooding and liquid holdup), particulate removal and mass transfer studies under non-wetting flow conditions. The performance of a small air lift for water circulation through the column was also investigated. These cold studies offered insight into the operation and performance of the liquid metal hot scrubber. Prior to the cold gas scrubber studies, preliminary small-scale gasification tests on petroleum coke samples were performed to investigate the effect of molten tin on H 2 S in the product fuel gas. The tests provided actual experimental evidence of the possibility of sulphur removal by molten tin in a gasification environment. It was shown that the maximum possible size of a liquid droplet hanging from a non-wetting spherical solid surface could be predicted from the liquid surface tension and density based on force balance. The mobility of static holdup in a non-wettable packed bed has been demonstrated, this being due to the tendency for the liquid to form discrete droplets rather than spreading films. Existing flooding and liquid holdup correlations that hold for conventional wettable packed beds were shown to be inadequate where non-wetting systems were concerned. Summary hence alternative methods applicable to the latter were sought. The introduction of a non-wetting tendency factor based on the ratio of the solid critical surface tension to the liquid surface tension, enabled the flooding capacities of non-wetting systems including those of this study to be predicted using Sherwood et al. 's graphical flooding correlation. The total volumetric liquid holdup was well correlated against the bed pressure drop, true gas velocity and gas density, offering the prospects of predicting holdup for systems using the same spherical packing. In general, the water-irrigated packed bed showed good hydrodynamic similarities to liquid metal systems, suggesting a dominating influence of liquid-solid contact angle which overrides striking differences in liquid physical properties. The performance of the small air lift pump was unaffected by varying the number of gas ports on the injector without any change to the hole size. The operating curve of the air lift pump could be predicted with good accuracy using momentum balance and two phase flow theory, provided that all major pressure losses in the system were accounted for, including notably the downcomer friction losses and accelerative effects.

In this paper three counter-current single-stage packed towers at laboratory scale, randomly packed with two differentsizes of two types of packing material were experimentally tested to study the role of the packing on the performance of them in the removal of sulfuric acid mists. Gas samples were extracted from specified points and quantified using US EPA method 8. All required steps were taken in order to comply with quality assurance procedures described in US EPA method 8. The results from 98 tests in four series including two types of packing materials each in two packing sizes revealed that 1. 27 cm (0. 5 inch) Raschig ring and Intalox saddle had higher removal efficiencies (94. 0 % and 92. 3 % respectively) than 2. 54 cm Raschig ring and Intalox saddle (86. 8 and 81. 8 % respectively). The statistical comparison of the average removal efficiencies showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (Pvalue = 0. 344) between the average removal efficiency of the tower packed with 1. 27 cm Intalox saddle and 1. 27 cm Raschig ring. The highest removal efficiency of 98. 2 % was obtained at Hc/Dc ratio of 3 for 1. 27 cm Raschig rings. The highest removal performance versus gas flow rate over packing volume (Qgas/Vpack) ratio was obtained with average removal efficiency of 95. 0 % for 1. 27 cm Raschig rings.

In this study liquid tin {{used as a}} non-wetting scrubbing medium in a countercurrent empty bed scrubber to remove sulfur compounds (H 2 S) from a gas mixture. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software (CFX 12 code) was used to simulate hot fuel gas cleaning technology. It was conducted through three main procedures namely: pre-processing, solving and post processing. Three sets of simulation were run for H 2 S models, by varied the gas superficial velocities at range from 2. 0 m/s to 1. 2 m/s and liquid superficial velocity at range from 0. 1 m/s to 0. 05 m/s. higher liquid flow rate contributes to higher liquid hold up inside the column and higher adsorption occurred at lower gas velocities.

A scheme suitable for short duration applications is passive cooling of gas generator gases by using a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> as compact heat exchanger. A study indicated that the mass flow rates of solid {{propellant gas}} generators for applications such as air bottle pressurization and control system actuators were {{of the order of}} 1 kg/s. Since pressure and enthalpy drop correlations for <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> with mass flow rates (~ 1 kg/s) and packing sphere based Reynolds number (Red) ~ 9 X 104 were unavailable in open literature, an experimental investigation was deemed necessary. The objectives of the present study were (a) characterization of <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> for pressure and enthalpy drop, (b) develop Euler and Nusselt number correlations at Red~ 105 and (c) evolve an engineering procedure for estimation of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> pressure and enthalpy drop. An experimental test facility with a hydrogen-air combustor was designed and fabricated for this purpose to characterize a variety of <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> for pressure drop and heat transfer. Flow through separate <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> consisting of 9. 5 mm and 5 mm steel spheres and lengths ~ 200 mm and ~ 300 mm were studied in the sphere based Reynolds numbers (Red) range of 0. 4 X 104 to 8. 5 X 104. The average porosity (є) of the randomly <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> was ~ 0. 4. The ratios of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> diameter to <b>packing</b> diameter for 9. 5 mm and 5 mm sphere packing were ~ 9. 5 and 18 respectively. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a suitable arrangement using mesh of spheres was used at either ends to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Stagnation pressures were measured at entry and exit of the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The pressure drop factor fpd, (ratio of Euler number (Eu) to <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> dimensions) for <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> with 9. 5 mm spheres exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number, and a correlation for the pressure drop factor is proposed as, fpd=Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 125. 3 Red- 0. 4; 0. 8 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104 (9. 5 mm sphere packing). However, for <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> with 5 mm spheres the pressure drop factor fpd, was observed to increase in the investigated Reynolds number range. The correlation based for pressure drop factor is proposed as, fpd= Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 0. 0479 Red 0. 37; 0. 4 X 104 < Red < 3. 9 X 104 (5 mm sphere packing). The pressure drop factor was observed to be independent of the inlet flow temperature. Gas temperatures were measured at the entry, exit and at three axial locations along centerline in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The solid <b>packing</b> temperature was measured at three axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> At Red~ 104, the influence of gas phase and solid phase thermal conductivity on heat transfer coefficient was found to be negligible based on order of magnitude analysis and solid packing temperature data obtained from the experiments. Evaluation of sphere based Nusselt number (Nud) at axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> indicated a length effect on the heat transfer coefficient, which was a function of Reynolds number and size of spheres used in packing. The arithmetic average of Nusselt numbers at different axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> were correlated as Nud= 3. 85 Red 0. 5; 0. 5 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104. The Nusselt numbers obtained in the experiments were consistent with corresponding literature data available at lower Reynolds numbers. In this experimental study Euler number correlations for pressure drop and Nusselt number correlations for heat transfer were obtained for <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> at Red~ 105. An engineering model for estimation of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> pressure and enthalpy drop was evolved, which is useful for sizing of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> heat exchanger in solid propellant gas generation systems...|$|R

The objective of this work was to study the heat effects in <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> reactor under supercritical conditions using CFD comparing the simulations with empirical correlations. Simulations were done for a geometrical model of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> of cylindrical catalysts at high pressure supercritical conditions.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study for {{transient temperature response}} and pressure drop in a randomly <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> at high Reynolds numbers is presented. The <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> {{is used as a}} compact heat exchanger along with a solid-propellant gas generator, to generate room-temperature gases for use in control actuation, air bottle pressurization, etc. <b>Packed</b> <b>beds</b> of lengths 200 and 300 mm were characterized for packing-sphere-based Reynolds numbers ranging from 0. 8 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The solid packing used in the bed consisted of phi 9. 5 mm steel spheres. The bed-to-particle diameter ratio was with the average packed-bed porosity around 0. 43. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a mesh of spheres was used at either end to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Gas temperature and pressure were measured at the entry, exit,and at three axial locations along centerline in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The solid <b>packing</b> temperature was measured at three axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> A correlation based on the ratio of pressure drop and inlet-flow momentum (Euler number) exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number. Axial conduction across the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> was found to he negligible in the investigated Reynolds number range. The enthalpy absorption rate to solid packing from hot gases is plotted as a function of a nondimensional time constant for different Reynolds numbers. A longer <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> had high enthalpy absorption rate at Reynolds number similar to 10 (4), which decreased at Reynolds number similar to 10 (5). The enthalpy absorption plots can be used for estimating enthalpy drop across <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> with different material, but for a geometrically similar packing...|$|R
