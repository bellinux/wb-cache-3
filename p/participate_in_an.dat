40|$|Despite the {{implementation}} of supported employment programs and the assistance from supported employment specialists, people with disabilities continue to have lower employment rates than their non-disabled counterparts. Persons with psychiatric disabilities continue to have lower employment rates than people with visual disabilities and people with hearing disabilities. The purposes of this secondary analysis research study were to identify factors that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program and to identify the variables that contributed to job tenure of people with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Participants were clients who <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the Back to Work Program at St. Luke's House and {{were enrolled in the}} study for 27. 5 months. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed that the only factor that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment was social security benefits. No variables were found to contribute to the job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Due to the low enrollment rate, additional descriptive analyses were used and found interesting patterns for employment and job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. This study introduced the Social Cognitive Career Theory as a proposed framework to understanding employment for persons with psychiatric disabilities and their job tenures while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Attachment to the labor market was used to expand how job tenure was measured. Limitations to the study, implications for Rehabilitation Counselors and Rehabilitation Counselor Educators, and future research suggestions were provided...|$|R

5|$|After their crews {{arrived to}} take them back to Austria-Hungary in early 1886, both vessels were taken into the navy's {{shipyard}} in Pola, where their armament was installed {{over the course of}} 1887, to include their torpedo tubes. Both ships took part in the Barcelona Universal Exposition, which saw a squadron of ironclads and cruisers sent to represent Austria-Hungary at the opening ceremonies. Coincidentally, both ships ran aground during training operations in late June 1888. The two cruisers spent much of the early 1890s laid up, with Panther being reactivated in 1896 for a major training cruise in the Pacific Ocean from May 1896 to February 1898, and Leopard returning to service in 1897 to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international naval demonstration off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. Leopard went on a training cruise in the Pacific in 19001901 for naval cadets, while Panther spent those years in reserve. The latter went on a cruise to Morocco in 1902, and to eastern Africa in 1905 to arrange a trade treaty with Ethiopia before embarking on another cruise in the Pacific. In the meantime, Leopard served with the main Austro-Hungarian fleet in home waters in the mid-1900s.|$|E
