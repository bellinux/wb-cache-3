Samples were tested according to standard methods and the results obtained are the substance of this thesis, Activated sludge treatment reduced 96. 1 % of the total bacteria and 88, 6 % of the coliforms as compared with trickling filter treatment which reduced only 65 % of the total bacteria arid 39, 8 % of the coliforms, Holding pond reduced 77 % of the total bacteria and 85 % of the coliforms, It is concluded that activated sludge effluent should be used to charge the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter.</b> This <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> was effective in removing 99, 6 % of the total bacteria and 99, 9 % of the coliforms, No Salmonella or Shigella species were found under the conditions of this experiment.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} estimate qualitatively and quantitatively the content of bacteriophage in wastewater before and after tertiary treatment through Tucson's <b>pilot</b> <b>filter.</b> Preliminary studies on methods to eliminate or reduce bacteria in wastewater, prior to assaying for bacteriophage, included membrane filtration and centrifugation. Membrane filtration was superior to centrifugation but serum pretreatment was necessary to eliminate loss of bacteriophage by adsorption. Five enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Aerobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella paratyphi, were isolated from <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> influent and subsequently used to assay wastewater filtrates for bacteriophage. The concentration of bacteriophage capable of causing lysis of these bacteria was determined by using a modification of the most probable number method customarily used to estimate coliforms. The concentrations of all five bacteriophages {{were found to be}} reduced after tertiary treatment through the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter.</b> A modification of the bacteriophage assay procedure was investigated in an effort to concentrate bacteriophages present in wastewater using an aluminum hydroxide adsorption method recently devised to adsorb human enteroviruses. This procedure yielded good recovery of bacteriophage and with slight modification might be used for direct plaque enumeration of bacteriophages in water rather than the indirect most probable number method used in this study...|$|E
40|$|A {{membrane}} virus concentration procedure {{was used to}} demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} tertiary treatment <b>Pilot</b> <b>Filter</b> in reducing the virus concentration of activated sludge effluent from the Tucson sewage treatment plant. This technique, which allows the quantitative determination of virus infective units per sample volume, showed that the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Filter</b> reduced the virus concentration by an average of 96 %. No significant difference in removal of virus content was observed when the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Filter</b> was loaded from two different basins with horizontal travel distances of approximately 50 and 100 feet. For identification of virus types, a rapid and economical plastic panel micro culture technique showed an excellent correlation to the standard tube culture method in virus neutralization studies. Virus types detected during the eight month period of the study included poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, one adenovirus, and several echovirus types. Preliminary studies were carried out to determine whether the {{membrane virus}} concentration procedure could be improved. These studies included pre-treatment of membranes with serum, use of a Dowex anion exchange column, and the investigation of an aluminum hydroxide virus adsorption method. Each of these procedures significantly improved the efficiency of virus recovery. The aluminum hydroxide method was superior to the other procedures and gave 100 % recovery of virus added to wastewater samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{temperature}} on nitrification in biological {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) filters was evaluated {{in order to improve}} the understanding of the nitrification process in drinking water treatment. The study was conducted in a northern climate where very cold water temperatures (below 2 °C) prevail for extended periods and rapid shifts of temperature are frequent in the spring and fall. Ammonia removals were monitored and the fixed nitrifying biomass was measured using a method of potential nitrifying activity. The impact of temperature was evaluated on two different filter media: an opened superstructure wood-based activated carbon and a closed superstructure activated carbon-based on bituminous coal. The study was conducted at two levels: <b>pilot</b> scale (first-stage <b>filters)</b> and full-scale (second-stage filters) and the results indicate a strong temperature impact on nitrification activity. Ammonia removal capacities ranged from 40 to 90 % in <b>pilot</b> <b>filters,</b> at temperatures above 10 °C, while more than 90 % ammonia was removed in the full-scale filters for the same temperature range. At moderate temperatures (4 – 10 °C), the first stage <b>pilot</b> <b>filters</b> removed 10 – 40 % of incoming ammonia for both media (opened and closed superstructure). In the full-scale filters, a difference between the two media in nitrification performances was observed at moderate temperatures: the ammonia removal rate in the opened superstructure support (more than 90 %) was higher than in the closed superstructure support (45 %). At low temperatures (below 4 °C) both media performed poorly. Ammonia removal capacities were below 30 % in both pilot- and full-scale filters. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the convenience and effectiveness of using a disc filter to treat washing water from the sand filters at Sundet wastewater treatment plant. The disc filter is used aiming for the reduction of suspended solids and phosphorus. The study was divided in two main experimental stages. During the first stage laboratory jar-tests were performed in order to identify which flocculation aid was more suitable, this was further on used to improve the water treatment. Based on the laboratory trials results, two different polymers (1 and 2) were chosen to be tested at pilot scale. The second stage involved the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> operation itself; this period was as well divided in two sub-stages where filter cloths with two different pore openings were tested. During the first sub-stage the pilot operated with an 18 μm pore opening filters cloth and both polymers.

40|$|The {{presence}} of ammonia during drinking water production {{can be the}} source of several water quality problems during distribution and during disinfection when chlorine is used. It is therefore important to optimize the ammonia removal before disinfection. The purpose of this work was to compare nitrification on an opened superstructure (Picabiol) and two closed superstructure (Picacarb and Calgon F 400) granular activated carbon (GAC) during colonization of new filters and after longer operating times in <b>pilot</b> and full-scale <b>filters.</b> Fixed nitrifying biomass levels, ammonia removal and oxygen consumption were monitored at high and low temperatures and at two different ammonia loadings. In first stage <b>pilot</b> <b>filters</b> supplied by an ammonia concentration higher than 0. 4 [*]mg l- 1 N-NH 4 and at temperatures higher than 20 oC, nitrification capacity was higher on Picabiol than on Picacarb. At low temperature, no ammonia removal occurred on both materials. Calgon and Picabiol provided equal nitrification performances. In full-scale second stage filters fed with ammonia concentrations ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 16 [*]mg l- 1 N-NH 4, nitrification performances were similar on Picabiol and on Calgon. In cold water, none of these filtration materials provided a proper nitrification; nitrifying biomass, however, did not disappear on the GAC filters during winter. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{filtration}} system consisting of coarse media filters {{in series with}} standard dual media filters was proposed and evaluated as an alternative for direct filtration of high turbidity waters. The coarse media filters utilized a 3. 08 mm uniform sand with a media depth of 1. 32 m;The study was divided into three phases. The first phase involved the use of jar tests to determine optimum coagulants and approximate dosages for direct filtration. The jar test results {{were used in the}} second phase of study which involved laboratory <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> studies. The optimum alum dosage in the pilot plant studies was less than that determined in the jar test. Successful filter runs were possible with influent solids concentrations of 100 mg/l of kaolin or less. Headloss development (3 m maximum) limited the filter run lengths at kaolin concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/l. With 100 mg/l of kaolin, filter runs were terminated due to turbidity breakthrough. The third phase of the study involved a pilot plant field investigation using Des Moines river water as the raw water source. The chemical coagulants used in the laboratory did not produce acceptable results during the field study. The difference in chemical requirements was attributed {{to the nature of the}} raw water turbidity. The turbidity in the Des Moines river water was attributed mainly to the presence of diatoms;Particle deposition in the coarse media filters was recorded photographically during the laboratory filter runs. The particles were deposited in the filters by first coating the media. Next, the particles filled the media void spaces. The filling of the void spaces resulted in the development of narrow channels through which the suspension was transferred deeper into the filter;Two mathematical models were applied to the laboratory <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> data. Both models agreed reasonably well with the experimental data and were subsequently used to develop design curves.

40|$|The {{impact of}} empty-bed contact time and {{temperature}} on the efficiency of biological GAC filtration has been studied on <b>pilot</b> <b>filters</b> at the Neuilly-sur-Marne treatment plant.

With a fixed bacterial carbon biomass of c. 2 mg/l, pilots with empty-bed contact times of 10 min removed around 60 % of BDOC. The net exportation of bacterial biomass was very low {{when compared to the}} removal of BDOC achieved by the filtration. BDOC removal increased with increasing empty-bed contact times in the tested range of filtration velocities (6 - 18 m/h). Data showed that it was necessary to double the empty-bed contact time when temperature decreased from 20 degree C to 8 degree C to keep a similar BDOC removal efficiency, although the average bacterial biomass was the same at both temperatures. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effluent}} treatment plant at Glencore Nikkelverk experiences the generation of liquid waste from various areas and processes in the plant. Being primarily a nickel refinery, but also producing copper and cobalt, the effluent contains significant concentrations of heavy metals. Such effluents are harmful to the environment. The {{effluent treatment}} plant thus operates to limit the discharge of harmful elements from the plant to the effluent, to allow the plant to comply to discharge limits set by authorities and to recover valuable elements from effluents for reprocessing. This is currently performed by means of metal hydroxide precipitation followed by solid-liquid separation. The solid-liquid separation is carried out by manual chamber filter presses that require heavy manual labour and have thus been classified as a health hazard by the health, safety and environment department. An investigation is therefore done to assess the suitability of DrM Fundabac candle filters as an alternative filtration technology by use of a DrM Fundabac <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> rig. The investigation analyses filtration performance while also exploring variations in general filtration behaviour. This is done by carrying out initial filter cloth screening tests in the laboratory to choose a suitable range of filter cloths for further testing. Filtration tests are then performed on the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter,</b> employing the chosen filter cloths. Operating parameters including filtration time, applied pressure and feed flowrate are evaluated. The feed to the filter varies continually and cannot be controlled. It is thus investigated how variations in feed affect variations in filtration {{in order to understand}} why filtration performance can change. Samples from the feed slurry, filtrate and filter cake are taken and analysed. Measurements from online data systems are recorded. These enable an overview of some of the primary particle properties, the state of the system and the secondary properties that together govern filtration. The study shows that the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> operates effectively and through the use of either the DrM N 11 U 030 or Markert PPV 2737 filter cloth, good filter cake release and production of filtrate of equal clarity to that of the currently employed filter presses is enabled. For optimal throughput of filtrate and good cloth-cake adhesion during filtration, the filtration time should be set to at least 40 minutes and the applied pressure to 4 bar. An increase in the pH in the range of 9 to 10 during the precipitation process is beneficial for filtration as it results in a higher concentration of solids in the feed to the filter. Both an increase in the solution pH and an increase in the feed solids concentration result in a decreased specific cake resistance and decreased filter cake moisture content. An increase in the feed solids concentration also results in an increase in the mass of filter cake produced. Further information on the particle size distribution in the solution is required in order to conclude on its effect on filtration. An increased concentration of nickel hydroxide precipitate and a decreased concentration of iron hydroxide precipitate in the feed appear to result in a lower specific cake resistance. It is recommended that the study continues whereby the mentioned filter cloths are operated on for a longer duration of time while also investigating the benefit of setting an even longer filtration time. The next stage of investigation will be to design a full-scale filter such that potential candle filter performance can be evaluated and compared to chamber filter press performance...|$|E
40|$|The present work shows a way {{to develop}} an {{industrial}} organic solvent-free process for lithium-ion battery electrodes manufacturing. The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF latex as a binder in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO 2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper {{on the surface of}} the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes has been carried out with cycling tests in coin cells, confirming the cycling stability during charge/discharge cycles. Cycling performances of the water-based cathodes containing coated active material particles are comparable to a reference NMP-based cathode, while uncoated particles show a sensibly lower capacity retention during cycling.

Because these data were not conclusive, additional dosing experiments were performed on laboratory and pilot plant scale. These experiments confirmed the high DEC-values for Cryptosporidium (4. 7 log or more) described in literature. The results also showed that the DEC of these filters for persistent organisms can be influenced by long term accumulation and delayed breakthrough. Assessment of the spatial distribution of retained oocysts in the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> showed a significant reduction of oocyst concentration over time. The sand contained {{a high concentration of}} zooplankton and on the basis of literature data it was concluded that the oocyst reduction was most likely caused by predation.

40|$|Nitrification during {{biological}} filtration is currently used {{in drinking water}} production to remove ammonia, which {{is the source of}} several water quality problems during treatment and distribution. We evaluated here the impact of backwashing on nitrification efficiency in filters used for drinking water treatment. Two different granular activated carbon (one open and one closed carbon superstructure) were tested. Ammonia removal and fixed nitrifying bacterial biomass before and after backwashing were compared in first-stage pilot filters and full-scale second-stage filters. Backwashing has a greater impact on nitrification on first-stage than on second-stage filters. Backwashing improved the ammonia removal in warm (≥ 18 °C) water in a first-stage filter containing an open-superstructure granular activated carbon, whereas a closed-superstructure support showed a removal capacity that is less after a regular backwashing than before, or similar to it. In cold water (≤ 4 °C), backwashing had a negative impact on nitrification capacity in an open-superstructure medium first-stage filter. In full-scale second-stage filters, backwashing had a slight negative impact on filter performances for both open- and closed-superstructure media at temperatures between 8 °C and 12 °C. In colder waters (≤ 3 °C), nitrification was very poor both before and after backwashing. Sampling of fixed, nitrifying biomass in the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter</b> columns showed that in all cases (low and high expansion backwash; both media tested) and at 20 ± 3 °C, the overall biomass levels remained unchanged before and after backwash.

Turbidity, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Fe, Mn, NO 3 - and NH 4 + were measured in each sample for three different low, medium, and high filtration rates. Pilot No. 2 had a maximum efficiency in the removal of the parameters that removal average of turbidity, TOC, Fe, Mn, NO 3 -, NH 4 +, respectively. So, the best performance of GAC-sand filter is in EBCT= 20 min during loading rate of 35 l/d. Conclusion: In general, both pilot filters performed better at low surface loading rate. More specifically, pilot scale No. 2 showed better removal of parameters and longer empty bed contact time (EBCT) in that surface loading rate...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{examination}} {{is made of}} {{the ecology of the}} meiofauna in a slow sand filter used for the purification of river derived water for industrial and domestic supply. The physical and operational features of the filter are described in relation to the biology of the organisms inhabiting it. Problems encountered with sampling the meiofauna of such a system are discussed and a criticism of the sampling methods employed is presented. A discussion is made of the uses of total particulate organic carbon as a parameter for characterising the biomass changes in the system. An evaluation of the horizontal and vertical distributions of the meiofauna in the filter is presented. Similar observations are made regarding the distributional heterogeneity of the organic carbon in the system. Special attention is directed to the oligochaetes present. A relationship is determined between length and dry weight and also segment number and dry weight of Enchytraeus buchholzi, the only actively sexually reproducing oligochaete worm present. The segment number - dry weight relationship is exploited to obtain quick estimates of the dry weight of the worm for biomass estimates. Seasonal changes in population abundance of the meiofauna are presented. The need to obtain estimates of parameters not easily measured in an operational filter is discussed. The design and functioning of an experimental small-scale filter is described and criticised. A method is detailed for obtaining interstitial water samples without them coming into contact with air. An account of a micro-Winkler oxygen analysis is given. The results of redox potential measurements and dissolved oxygen analyses, made in the <b>pilot</b> <b>filter,</b> are presented together with a discussion on the insight which these measurements give as far as bacterial activity in the filter is concerned. A discussion is made of the ecology of the meiofauna in slow sand filters and further suggestions for research investigations are made. <p...|$|E
40|$|Contaminated {{irrigation}} water constitutes {{one of the}} main sources of plant pathogens that can cause disease and lead to potentially significant production losses in forest nurseries. Recycling of contaminated {{irrigation water}} increases the risk of spreading diseases. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a simple slow sand filtration treatment of irrigation water as a method for eradicating fungal and bacterial pathogens in eucalypt cutting nurseries. <b>Pilot</b> <b>filter</b> units were constructed from PVC pipes containing a 80 cm high layer of sand with grain size varying from 0. 50 to 0. 75 mm, drainage layers of 10 cm of fine gravel (4 mm) followed by a 15 cm layer of coarse gravel (8 mm), connected to a water outlet. The PVC pipe had space for a 150 mm water column above the sand layer and the filter had a flow rate of 100 to 300 L m- 2 h- 1. Eradication of the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and the fungal pathogens Cylindrocladium candelabrum and Botrytis cinerea through the use of the filter was evaluated. Detection of bacteria in filter-treated irrigation water was performed through the micro drop method followed by PCR of colonies, while fungal pathogens were detected using a castorbean leaf biological bait method. Evaluations were performed daily 35 times for R. solanacearum, 25 times for C. candelabrum and 18 times for B. cinerea during a period of 12 months. After the last evaluation period, samples from various depths of the sand layer in the filters were taken and analyzed for the presence of the plant pathogens. The slow sand filters were able to remove B. cinerea and C. candelabrum spores with 100 % efficiency while eradication of R. solanacearum colonies reached up to 99. 6 %. Colonies of Trichoderma sp. were found predominantly on the all filter layers. The results of this study show that slow sand filters are efficient for recycled water in eucalypt nurseries, especially in eradicating fungal pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Lignin was precipitated from kraft {{black liquor}} using carbon dioxide. To remove the {{residual}} black liquor and to purify the lignin, a <b>pilot</b> press <b>filter</b> or a <b>pilot</b> belt <b>filter</b> was used, and their performance was compared. The purity, molecular weight distribution, morphology, chemical and thermal {{properties of the}} final lignin product were characterized. The {{results showed that the}} lignin recovered from both the filter press and the belt filter was sufficiently pure {{to be used as a}} fuel in the lime kiln (or in most other combustion processes), or in any of the several possible high-value applications. No major difference was observed in the physico-chemical properties of lignins produced using a belt filter vs. a filter press. However, the solids content of the lignin filtered through the press filter was about 2 times higher than the one obtained using the belt filter, and the filtration rate obtained with the filter press was 5 to 6 times higher than that obtained with the belt filter. The purified lignin product recovered from the filter press was used to substitute 30, 40 and 50 % of the phenol present in the formulation of the lignin-phenol-formaldehyde (LPF) resins used as an adhesive for the preparation of plywood samples. The results showed that up to 30 % of phenol could be replaced by kraft lignin, without any major change in plywood shear strength. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{biological}} filtration on {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) has been performed at the Neuilly-sur-Marne (France) treatment plant using experimental <b>pilot</b> <b>filters.</b> Bacterial colonization of GAC was monitored in three carbon filters having varying depths and filtration velocities, but similar empty bed contact time (EBCT). About three months were required to colonize the GAC in the filters and a steady state bacterial biomass of around 2 µgC/cm 3 GAC was reached. During the colonization period, removal of nonbiodegradable organic carbon (NBDOC) by filtration decreased from 50 % to less than 10 % showing a gradual saturation of GAC adsorption capacity. However, biological processes take turn with adsorption to ensure a significant removal of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) {{during the study period}} (more than 200 days). Filters operating under different conditions did not show any difference in the BDOC removal. This indicates that biological removal of organic matter in GAC filters having a given EBCT is independent of filtration rate (in the range 6 m/h– 18 m/h). The maximum bacterial density in the filter effluent water was 1. 5 × 105 bacteria/mL during the colonization phase; this seemed to be linked to a lag in establishing a protozoan population, which, at equilibrium, efficiently removed bacterial biomass produced within the filters. Once established, the efficiency of this complex microbial assemblage was remarkable; the removal of about 0. 25 mgC/L of BDOC resulted in the release of less than 0. 5 × 105 bacteria per millileter, around 0. 0015 mgC/L as bacterial biomass in the effluent. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
