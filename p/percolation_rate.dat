40|$|SUMMARY Laboratory {{tests were}} made to {{determine}} the effectiveness of different compounds and microbial groups in increasing the stability of Peorian loess lumps against the action of falling water drops. The influence of these on percolation tests in the laboratory was also determined. Many organic substances-dextrose, sucrose, starch, peptone, cullulose, and gum arabic-did not themselves contribute directly to soil-structure stability, though these substances do furnish energy material for soil microorganisms, which can convert them readily into either microbial tissue or decomposition products that increase soil-structure stability. Lignin, proteins, oils, fats, waxes, resin, and paraffin increased the stability of lumps of Peorian loess to water drops. Organic matter, Vinsol, dodecyl dimethylamine sulfate, and dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride increased stability. The order of descending effectiveness of different microbial groups for soil lump stabilization against the beating action of water drops was: (1) Fungi, (2) Actinomycetes, (3) certain bacteria, (4) yeasts, and (5) the majority of bacteria used. The <b>percolation</b> <b>rate</b> of Peorian loess material was increased by certain organic substances, especially if these {{were in the process}} of decaying. Water-soluble organic substances like starch and sugar were not immediately effective in increasing percolation. Coarse organic substances such as straw, cornstalks, and soybean straw in sufficient concentration increased the <b>percolation</b> <b>rate</b> of the Peorian loess by holding up the soil lumps so that the water could run down between them. Organic substances such as sawdust or lignocellulose, added in a finely divided mechanical state, did not increase the <b>percolation</b> <b>rate.</b> Microorganisms grown at the surface of Peorian loess plugged up the pores, provided the soil was not stirred, so that the <b>percolation</b> <b>rate</b> was decreased.

Undisturbed soil samples were taken from 3 different soils including silty clay, clay loam and loam, with 3 replications. The soil samples were puddled by a laboratory apparatus with different intensities. The results showed that the low puddling intensity treatment caused a 29. 3, 32. 4 and 36 % reduction of <b>percolation</b> <b>rate</b> in silty clay, silty loam and loam textures, respectively.

40|$|Given a time-series of {{potential}} evapotranspiration and rainfall data, {{there are at}} least two approaches for estimating vertical <b>percolation</b> <b>rates.</b> One approach involves solving Richards' equation (RE) with a plant uptake model. An alternative approach involves applying a simple soil moisture accounting procedure (SMAP) based on a set of conceptual stores and conditional statements. It is often desirable to parameterize distributed vertical percolation models using regional soil texture maps. This can be achieved using pedotransfer functions when applying RE. However, robust soil texture based parameterizations for more simple SMAPs have not previously been available. This article presents a new SMAP designed to emulate the response of a one-dimensional homogenous RE model. Model parameters for 231 different soil textures are obtained by calibrating the SMAP model to 20 year time-series from equivalent RE model simulations. The results are then validated by comparing to an additional 13 years of simulated RE model data. The resulting work provides a new simple two parameter (% sand and % silt) SMAP, which provides consistent vertical percolation data as compared to RE based models. Results from the 231 numerical simulations are also found to be qualitatively consistent with intuitive ideas concerning soil texture and soil moisture dynamics.

40|$|Several {{areas in}} Nebraska are not {{appropriate}} for onsite home sewage treatment using conventional septic tank absorption field systems. Site factors that limit the use of conventional absorption fields include slowly permeable soils, shallow or gravelly soils and high water tables. The septic tank-mound system, which consists of a septic tank for primary sewage treatment and a constructed mound for final waste treatment was developed to overcome these site limitations (Figure 1). Although mound systems differ only slightly in principle from conventional sewage systems, they allow the user to select suitable materials to build an absorption field that relies on evapotranspiration {{as well as the}} absorption capacity of existing soil. A pump located in a chamber is generally recommended to distribute the effluent evenly in the mound. Mound location, size and shape, construction procedures, distribution of effluent, and dosing quantity all interact in determining how well the mound will function. Each component must be properly designed and constructed to prevent premature failure of the system. Mound Location The septic tank-mound system can be constructed on soils having <b>percolation</b> <b>rates</b> from 0 to 120 minutes per inch (0 to 48 min/ em); the traditional septic tank-absorption field system is limited to soils with <b>percolation</b> <b>rates</b> from 5 to 60 minutes per inch (2 to 24 min/em). Ideally, the mound should be constructed on the flat area of a hill crest. Other flat areas that do not receive drainage water from surrounding land are also suitable. Gently sloping areas can be used if the soils have minimum <b>percolation</b> <b>rates</b> shown in Table 1. Do not locate the mound on a natural slope exceeding 12 percent under any soil condition, and do not move or grade the soil to change the ground slope. A mound system cannot be used in areas subject to frequent flooding because of possible downstream water contamination. Areas where a seasonal water table, rock formation or impervious stratum occurs within 24 inches (61 em) of the soil surface should also be avoided, since ground water close to the soil surface could be contaminated. Greater distances will further reduce the possibility of contamination. The mound absorption area should be at least 100 feet (30 m) down slope from any well or spring, 50 feet (15 m) from streams, 5 feet (1. 5 m) from property lines, and 10 feet (3 m) from the drip area of trees...|$|R

The operational and post-closure management costs of landfills have increased recently due to the introduction of stringent environmental laws and regulations. Research is therefore needed to develop alternative methods to the current capping technique that will minimise the construction and management costs and also demonstrate increased environmental performance and ecologically sustainable development. An alternative technique known as ‘Phytocapping’ was trialed in Rockhampton, Australia. Twenty one tree species were established in each of two phytocaps, viz thick phytocap (1400 mm soil) and thin phytocap (700 mm soil). Plant growth and water relation parameters (e. g. transpiration, soil moisture, ccanopy interception) were monitored over a three year period. This data, together with 15 years of meteorological data were used to simulate site water balance using HYDRUS 1 D, under two scenarios, viz, with or without vegetation.

Gas samples were collected in chambers placed over plots with and without rice plants for an entire growing season, and redox potentials were measured from the 10 and 25 cm soil depth. The soil was a Pahokee muck (Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Medisaprist). Surprisingly, no measurable (> 30 g ha) methane emission was observed. This lack of methane emission was attributed to the observation that redox potentials seldom fell below- 200 mV, the minimum potential required for methane production by bacteria. The relatively high redox potential in the flooded rice plots probably was due to oxygen carried in percolate water, as cropped Histosols in the Everglades may have <b>percolation</b> <b>rates</b> of 5 to 7 cm d...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{change of}} soil water balance and soil element budget {{as well as}} {{groundwater}} recharge in the Emscher river catchment. The most important planning und prediction instruments for future groundwater management are numerical groundwater models. One of the key input parameter for these models is groundwater recharge, which is basically dependant on the soil water balance. Hence, the soil water balance is further investigated and where possible quantified with respect to soil development processes and soil properties which alter {{as a result of}} climate change. The investigations focus on urban soils (especially Technosols), which represent the type of soil covering wide areas of the Emscher region. Groundwater is influenced by a combination of recharge <b>percolation</b> <b>rates</b> as well as potentials for pollutant transport and biodegradability within the soil layer. The quality of surface water of gaining streams within the river catchment can therefore also be influenced by the described processes. Due to these coherences, the climatic impact on the pollutant transport and biodegradation potentials in soils as well as their influence on groundwater and surface water quality are investigated...|$|R
