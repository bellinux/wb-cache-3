After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, {{there were a}} number of changes in health legislation. This work provides a comprehensive view of the development and current situation of health care assistants, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses,</b> nurses and health care workers. The objectives of this work were to compare the development of individual professions, the concept of education, the possibilities of lifelong learning and professional association. The aim of the work was also to describe the actual performances, performed by <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing</b> staff and the legal requirements for the competencies of these professions. Through the form of a questionnaire survey, a survey was carried out between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing</b> staff in both countries, which showed that there was a significant overrun of competencies in both Slovak and Czech respondents. The provision of high-quality nursing care is currently highlighted. An important factor in providing quality and safe care is the proper division of tasks between nursing team members and the pursuit of a profession in accordance with legally defined competencies. keywords: Regulation of profession, health-care profession, <b>nursing,</b> health-care assistent, <b>auxiliary</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the quality and}} quantity of the oral health care training in the education of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> in Norway. Material and methods: An e-mail-administered questionnaire was sent to all 164 high schools in Norway offering basic education for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> in the academic year 2011 / 2012. The questionnaire collected information on the theoretical and practical oral care education, teaching material, curriculum and the school’s opinion of the core curriculum from the government, the students’ interest in the subject, and the schools’ self-assessment of their oral care training program. Results: Of the 114 schools responding to the survey (69. 5 % response rate), 56 (49. 1 %) offered three hours or more teaching in oral health care. 39 (34. 2 %) stated that the students are not well enough prepared for later work in health care. Important elements as working techniques, interdental brushes and electrical powered toothbrushes were included in few of the schools. Only 12 (10. 5 %) stated that the core curriculum from the government is good enough. Conclusions: The oral care teaching program for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> seems inadequate.

40|$|Background. The {{performance}} of midlevel health workers {{is a critical}} lever for strengthening health systems and redressing inequalities in underserved areas. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> form the largest cadre of health workers in Guatemala. In rural settings, they provide essential services to vulnerable communities, and thus have great potential to address priority health needs. This paper examines auxiliary nurses' motivation and satisfaction, and the coping strategies they use to respond to challenges they confront in their practice. Methods. Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 14 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> delivering health services in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Results. Community connectedness was central to motivation in this rural Guatemalan setting. Participants were from rural communities and conveyed a sense of connection to the people they were serving through shared culture and their own experiences of health needs. Satisfaction was derived through recognition from the community and a sense of valuing their work. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> described challenges commonly faced in low-resource settings. Findings indicated they were actively confronting these challenges through their own initiative. Conclusions. Strategies to support the {{performance of}} midlevel health workers should focus on mechanisms to make training accessible to rural residents, support problem-solving in practice, and emphasize building relationships with communities served...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} describes {{and analyses}} how central education reforms {{through a period}} of more than 40 years influences on a particular field of vocational education and work, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing.</b> The reforms do not meet a field that is easily reconstructed through central planning and modernisation. The analytical perspective of the dissertation is to study how education reforms interact with other conditions contributing to the shaping of this field, as the established recruitment patterns based on adult females, and the position the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> hold in the division of labour, as subordinated to the nurses. The study is based on empirical data from several research projects finished during the last years and which includes studies of education policy, collective organisation, students and recruitment patterns. This includes interviews with representatives from the educational authorities, the health authorities, local administrators of both education and the care and nursing services, teachers, tutors, and students. It also includes document studies and a large survey of candidates from the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education [...] The study also makes use of education and personell statistics from public databases in order to establish time series covering a period of 40 years. The establishment of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education in 1963 symbolises a break in the way of recruiting, educating and organizing nursing personnel. Previously nursing had been divided in two, with the registered nurses on the one side and the unskilled on the other. With the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education a third way was introduced. The education was established under what is described as organized modernity. During this period mass education was organized, occupations were established also on the lower level, the females were entering the labour force, hospitals and nursing homes were build, and new employee organisations were founded. The belief in the rational governing of society through comprehensive state interventions were during this period probably stronger than ever. The establishment of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education was, however, not only a modernisation from above. It may partly be seen as a modernisation from below in the sense that thousands of women pushed for the extension of the educational capasity in the field. The further efforts on modernizing the field through education reforms have a stronger character of modernisation from above. To an increasing degree they express the policy of modernizing the educational system; the needs to rationalize and unify educational paths, curriculas and search criterias. The aim was a more effective system giving the whole population equal education offers independent of social class, geography and gender. Through these reforms the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education is gradually closer integrated into the new upper secondary school. From 1994 it is only offered as an education for adolescents, and the adult educations are closed. However, quite a small number of adolescents opted for this kind of education. The result was a great decrease in recruitment. The reform in 2000, the socalled competency reform, introduces a new scheme giving adults possibilities of going through socalled real competency assesments. This reform unintendedly reopened the traditional recruitment path into <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing,</b> attracting thousands of adult females. The most important finding of the dissertation is that there exists a very strong pattern of recruitment into the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education and occupation among adult females which the educational authorities, though trying hard, have not succeeded in changing through educational reforms. Those applying for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> education today have important similarities with the ones applying in the 1960 ’s. Most of them are adult females with experience from unskilled care work and caring for their own children and families. The average age of the candidates is 33 years. At the same time the applicants of today are more educated and have longer work experience. The education policy in this field, which still is to recruit adolescents through upper secondary school, must be characterised as a failure. Only a small share of the recruitment, about 20 percent, comes from this group. The costs of this policy seems to be that the professionalisation of the field of work has been suffering. By concentrating on developing an education directed towards the ones who are not being recruited, the educational authorities have abdicated from the role as organizer of education and learning to those who are doing the work and who want education, the adults. This group is left to participate in fragmented, individualised learning scheemes, normally organised on an ad hoc-bases and in close connection to the work places. This may be seen {{as an example of the}} resolving of organized modernity with strong collective arrangements as standardised educations and occupations. It is replaced by a modernity giving more space to individual solutions, and where the steering capasity of the state is reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Previous {{research}} in performance appraisal (PA) indicates that variation exists in learning and job motivation from performance appraisal between occupational groups. This research evaluates the potential effect of job motivation, learning and self-assessment through performance appraisals for health personnel. Case description This {{article focuses on}} goal-setting, feedback, participation and training in performance appraisals in municipal health services in Norway; and job motivation, learning and self-assessment of performance are the dependent factors. Questionnaires were distributed to {{a representative sample of}} 600 health personnel from the Norwegian municipal health service, with a response rate of 62 %. Factor analysis and regression analysis were run in SPSS 12. Discussion and evaluation The study suggests that respondents learn from performance appraisal. Nurses experienced some higher job motivation from performance appraisal than <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses.</b> All subordinates perceived higher job motivation after performance appraisal than managers. Conclusion Useful feedback, active participation and higher education are fundamental elements of discussion in performance appraisal, as well as the role of increasing employees' job motivation. In this study, nurses' job motivation seems to be more effected by PA, than for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses.</b> Both <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> indicate that there is a learning effect from PA. This study may be of interest to health researchers and managers in municipal health services. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In India, the {{hypertensive}} disorders {{of pregnancy}} and postpartum haemorrhage {{are responsible for}} nearly 40 % of all maternal deaths. Most of these deaths occur in primary health settings which frequently lack essential equipment and medication, are understaffed, and have limited or no access to specialist care. Community health care workers are regarded as essential providers of basic maternity care; {{and the quality of}} care they provide is dependent on the level of knowledge and skills they possess. However, there is limited research regarding their ability to manage pregnancy complications. This study aims to describe the current state of knowledge regarding pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among community health care workers (<b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> midwives, accredited social health activists, staff nurses) in northern Karnataka, India. Furthermore, this study describes the treatment approaches used by various cadres of community health workers for these conditions. The findings of this study can help plan focussed training sessions to build upon their strengths and to address the identified gaps. METHODS: Data were collected {{as part of a larger}} study aimed at assessing the feasibility of community-based treatment for pre-eclampsia. Eight focus group discussions were conducted in 2012 - 2013 in northern Karnataka State: four with staff <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> midwives and four with accredited social health activists. In addition, twelve <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> midwives and staff nurses completed questionnaires to explore their competence and self-efficacy in managing pre-eclampsia. Qualitative data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated for thematic analysis using NVivo 10. RESULTS: Community health workers described their understanding of the origins of hypertension and seizures in pregnancy. Psychological explanations of hypertension were most commonly reported: stress, tension, and fear. The most common explanation for eclampsia was not receiving a tetanus vaccination. Despite some common misperceptions regarding aetiology, these community health workers demonstrated a good grasp of the potential consequences of hypertension in pregnancy. According to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> midwives and staff nurses, if hypertension was detected they encouraged rest, decreased salt intake, iron supplementation and tetanus vaccination. In addition, some staff nurses administered antihypertensives, MgSO 4, or other anticonvulsants. All <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> midwives had some awareness of MgSO 4, but none had administered it themselves. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that knowledge regarding the aetiology of pre-eclampsia was limited. Nevertheless, their basic knowledge and skills could be strengthened to more effectively manage the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in their communities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01911494...|$|R
