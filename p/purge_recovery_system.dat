40|$|<b>Recovery</b> <b>systems</b> must save state {{before a}} failure occurs {{to enable the}} system {{to recover from the}} failure. However, {{recovery}} will fail if the <b>recovery</b> <b>system</b> saves any state corrupted by the fault. The frequency and comprehensiveness of how a <b>recovery</b> <b>system</b> saves state has a major effect on how often the <b>recovery</b> <b>system</b> inadvertently saves corrupted state. This paper explores and measures that effect. We measure how often software faults in the application and operating system cause real applications to save corrupted state when using different types of <b>recovery</b> <b>systems.</b> We find that generic recovery techniques, such as checkpointing and logging, work well for faults in the operating system. However, we find that they do not work well for faults in the application because the very actions taken to enable recovery often corrupt the state upo...|$|R
