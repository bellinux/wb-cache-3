Oil production in the interior of North America has exceeded the capacity of pipelines to carry it to markets on the Gulf Coast and east coast of North America; as a result, the oil price on the US and Canadian east coast and parts of the US Gulf Coast since 2011 has been set by the price of Brent Crude, while markets in the interior still follow the WTI price.

Additional file  1 : Annexes 1 and 2 show the ranked <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> between corn and wheat (i.e., wheat price/corn price) and between SBM and RSM. It further shows the inclusion rate corresponding to the ranked <b>price</b> <b>spread.</b> In the simulated starter and grower diets, at a <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> of less than 79 %, diets were based on wheat with minimal corn inclusion. At price spreads {{greater than or equal}} to 92 %, corn remained in the diet at the maximum inclusion rate and substituted for wheat completely. With a <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> between 79 and 92 %, the substitution between corn and wheat was disconnected; however, corn appeared more frequently in the starter diet than in the other diets. The disconnection between corn and wheat at this stage was also influenced by the price of other feed additives. Similar results were obtained from the simulated finisher diet; however, at a <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> of 86 %, corn remained in the diet at the maximum inclusion rate and replaced wheat completely. The first position for dietary switch from wheat to corn occurred when the wheat price was 80 % of the corn price. At this <b>price</b> <b>spread,</b> the results show two levels of substitution rate—one in the starter diet where corn substituted 70 % of wheat and the second in the grower and finisher diets where corn substituted 100 % of wheat. Nevertheless, the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> borders found in our study could diverge slightly depending on the physical objective function prices used.|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} for the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread,</b> which {{accounts}} for both farm supply and retail demand changes, is introduced. This model is applied to beef, and its empirical performance relative to the markup pricing formulation is evaluated using nonnested testing procedures. The {{results are consistent with}} theory and indicate the markup pricing model is misspecified. Key words: beef, marketing margins, markup pricing, nonnested testing. In recent years the real farm price of beef has declined despite a secular decline in beef pro-duction. This suggests demand as well as sup-ply changes are important in explaining price changes. Farm-level demand for beef is influ-enced by changes in both consumer demand and the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> for beef. This paper focuses on factors affecting the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> by estimating and testing alternative empirical specifications of the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> for beef. A common approach to modeling <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> behavior is to assume the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> is a combination of both percentage and con-stant absolute amounts (Waugh; George and King). This suggests an empirical specification in which the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> is related to retail price and marketing input prices. This mod-eling approach has been applied to beef by Freebairn and Rausser, Arzac and Wilkinson, and Brester and Marsh. As emphasized by Gardner (p. 404) the problem with this ap-proach is that the relationship between farm Michael K.
