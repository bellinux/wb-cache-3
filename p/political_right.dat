Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the <b>political</b> <b>right</b> wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
40|$|Although {{historically}} incorrect, <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> {{continue to}} be seen as the natural privilege of citizens. Since the First World War, <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> have been conceived in the framework of the Westphalian interstate system and citizenship only. Theorizing about <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> has gone hand in hand with this perception. Accordingly, acquisition of citizenship or naturalization is seen as the prerequisite for aliens’ eligibility to <b>political</b> <b>rights.</b> The conception of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> as citizen rights stands {{in stark contrast to the}} conception of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> as human rights. This paper presents an argument to the effect that the boundaries of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> in the European Union should be re-thought in the light of the diversity perspective, which sees <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> as human rights, and introduce a typology of mobility that can be used to create a differentiated scale of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> for different types of mobility. diversity/homogeneity; political science; citizenship...|$|R

The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others approved parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.|$|E
5|$|While the Progress Party {{dropped out}} of {{parliament}} altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the <b>political</b> <b>right</b> in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E

I focused on five major indicators in my analysis of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> including: the ethno-linguistic heterogeneity of a country, the feelings of each country 2 ̆ 7 s population towards religion, the economic development of a nation, the percentage of the a country 2 ̆ 7 s population that is rural, and whether the country awarded women 2 ̆ 7 s suffrage before or after 1920. The model has an R Square of. 779, which means that the independent variables explain 78 percent of the variation in the <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> scores of nations around the world. Other tests confirmed that each of the five independent variables were effective in determining the variation within the dependent variable. Each of my original hypotheses were confirmed by analysis. The model revealed that all other things being equal, as a particular country’s ethno-linguistic hetereogeneity increased, the <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased; as the percentage of country’s population that viewed religion as “very important” increased, the <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased; as the economic development of a country increased, the <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score increased, as the percentage of a country’s population that was rural increased, the <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased and if a nation awarded women’s suffrage before 1920 it would have a higher <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score than if suffrage had been awarded after 1920.

According to the seminal work in Mayer (1984), capital-poor individuals prefer more trade openness in poor (capital-scarce) countries and less trade openness in rich (labor-scarce) countries. We use the level of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> {{as a proxy for}} the relative capital-labor endowment of the median voter so that an increase in <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> should have asymmetric effects in poor and rich countries: an increase in <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> should lead to more openness in capital poor countries and less openness in capital rich countries. Our results show that, while both income per capita and <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> are positively associated with import intensity, their interaction has a negative and very robust negative association with openness. Increases in <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> lead to sizeable decreases in import intensity after a given income per capita threshold has been surpassed. Our results are robust to the inclusion of structural, geography and cultural determinants of openness, different estimation methods and different proxies for country endowments.
