5|$|The {{result was}} the 1981 {{dismissal}} of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (PLP). Pilgrim's government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the United Workers Party to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> won only a single seat.|$|E
25|$|Elections must {{be called}} at {{no more than}} five-year intervals. The most recent took place on 17 December 2012. Following this election, the One Bermuda Alliance took power, with Craig Cannonier {{succeeding}} Paula Cox, of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> as Premier.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Progressive Alliance leader, Senator Meg Lees, and the One Nation {{parliamentary}} leader, Senator Len Harris, {{lost their}} seats. One Nation's {{vote in the}} House of Representatives collapsed. The Christian Democratic Party, the Citizens Electoral Council, the Democratic Labor Party, the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and the Socialist Alliance all failed to make any impact. The Family First Party polled 2% of the vote nationally, and their candidate Steve Fielding won a Senate seat in Victoria.|$|E
50|$|Following the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party's</b> {{defeat in}} the 2012 General Election, Mr. Bean {{replaced}} Ms. Cox as Party Leader, thereby becoming Bermuda's newest Opposition Leader.|$|R
50|$|Third {{parties have}} been common in Canadian legislatures since the 1920s. In particular, legislatures often contain {{members of an}} ideological party, such as a labour-based <b>party</b> (<b>Progressive</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> CCF, NDP) or a right-wing party (Socreds, Reform Party, Wildrose Party).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party</b> and <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> had an even split {{of seats}} with each party taking three each.|$|R
25|$|In New South Wales, Democrat {{preferences}} {{flowing to}} Labor {{rather than the}} Greens were instrumental in Labor's winning of the last Senate seat. Had Democrat preferences flown to the Greens rather than Liberals for Forests and the Christian Democrats, then the final vacancy would have been won by the Greens' John Kaye. The scale of Glenn Druery's (of the Liberals for Forests party) preference deals was revealed by {{the large number of}} ticket votes distributed when he was eliminated from the count. He gained preferences {{from a wide range of}} minor parties such as the Ex-Service Service and Veterans Party, the Outdoor Recreation Party, and the Non-Custodial Parents Party. Liberals for Forests also gained the preferences of two leftish parties – the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and the HEMP Party. When Druery was eventually excluded, these preferences flowed to the Greens, but the Greens would rather have received the preferences earlier in the count. In the end, three Liberal/National Senators and three Labor Senators were elected in New South Wales.|$|E

In Opposition, Brown first served as Shadow Minister for Youth and Sports and in 1995 became Shadow Minister for Human Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|In total, 16 {{candidates}} {{nominated for}} the by-election – the most since the 1992 Wills by-election and until the 2009 Bradfield by-election. The by-election included candidates from the Australian Greens, Family First Party, Christian Democratic Party, One Nation, <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and Australians Against Further Immigration. Nine independents were among them, including independent Liberal James Young, self-confessed former Labor branchstacker Sam Bargshoon, and radio presenter Mal Lees, who ran on a joke platform of free beer. Police whistleblower Deborah Locke, an endorsed People Power candidate, was forced to run as an independent due to her party's failure to re-register in time. Most of the independent and minor candidates joined in an [...] "anyone but Labor" [...] campaign, with Young and Locke considered the most likely challengers during the campaign.|$|E

50|$|Bermuda gained {{internal}} self {{government with}} the introduction of a constitution in 1968 and for the first 30 years afterwards the United Bermuda Party was in power. Their domination was broken by defeat in the 1998 election leading to the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> coming to power for the first time.

5000|$|For {{the next}} few years, the CCF's primary concern was {{preventing}} infiltration from Communists (then officially represented by the <b>Labour</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party).</b> Some figures in the LPP favoured cooperation with the CCF; the CCF leadership was fully opposed to this, and suspended two prominent Manitoba MLAs when they advocated formal cooperation. Accusations of being [...] "Communist sympathizers" [...] would hinder the party's fortunes for years to come.|$|R
50|$|It {{resulted}} in a minority victory for the Progressive Conservative Party {{under the leadership of}} Dufferin Roblin. Roblin's Tories won twenty-six seats, while Premier Douglas Campbell's Liberal-Progressives were reduced to second-place status with nineteen.

Both parties were strongest in Ward Three, covering the city's working-class north end.|$|R
