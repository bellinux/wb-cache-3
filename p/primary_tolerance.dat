40|$|Acid {{soils are}} {{estimated}} to cover up to 30 % of arable soils globally and lead to significant limitations on agricultural productivity, primarily through aluminum toxicity. In sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], significant genetic variation exists for tolerance to phytotoxic species of aluminum; tolerance is conferred through the exudation of citrate at the root tip, binding aluminum in the soil rhizosphere. A gene in the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family is the <b>primary</b> <b>tolerance</b> locus in sorghum. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of sorghum segregating for SbMATE to establish potential relationships between the SbMATE gene and agronomic performance. The study was conducted in a two-year, two-location replicated field trial during the 2012 and 2013 crop seasons. Lines were subsequently genotyped and screened in the lab for aluminum tolerance. While there was an apparent relationship between some agronomic characters and the allele of the gene, such as for plant height at maturity, it was shown that there was no discernible relationship between yield and the SbMATE locus in a non-stress environment. This suggests that tolerance to aluminum in sorghum is an inducible response such {{that there is not a}} metabolic cost for genetics conferring aluminum tolerance when plants are not subjected to the acid soil stress. ...|$|E

Ugobe, an Idaho-based company {{located within the}} Treasure Valley, has enlisted the New Product Development (NPD) Lab at Boise State University, to fabricate polymer prototypes via SL technology. Although part tolerances within onethousandth of an inch are required for Ugobe, the SL manufacturing process is not producing parts at the specified/desired tolerances.

40|$|Random {{rearrangement}} of {{the heavy}} chain (HC) and light chain (LC) genes encoding the B cell receptor (BCR) creates a diverse reper-toire capable of recognizing {{a wide array of}} an-tigens but at the cost of generating self-reactive specificities that can predispose for widespread autoimmune disease. An important stage for removal of self-reactive B cells from the devel-oping repertoire, termed <b>primary</b> <b>tolerance,</b> occurs when the BCR is first expressed on the cell surface at the immature stage of develop-ment in the BM. At this stage, receptor editing, or secondary rearrangement of Ig genes to alter the specificity of an autoreactive BCR (Gay et al., 1993; Radic et al., 1993; Tiegs et al., 1993), is the default mechanism for the removal of autoreactive B cells (Melamed and Nemazee, 1997; Halverson et al., 2004). It is estimated that one quarter of all mature B cells that enter peripheral lymphoid organs such as the spleen have been subjected to receptor editing (Casellas et al., 2001). If receptor editing proves unsuccess-ful at reducing BCR self-reactivity, immature B cells are removed by clonal deletion (Nossal, 1983; Nemazee and Bürki, 1989) or are rendered anergic, particularly if they react to soluble or low avidity self-antigens (Goodnow et al., 1988). Censoring of the B cell repertoire also oc-curs in peripheral B cells. BCR transgenic B cells undergo deletion when they encounter their cognate antigen expressed solely in peripheral tissues (Russell et al., 1991; Lang et al., 1997; Aït-Azzouzene et al., 2006; Duong et al., 2010; Ota et al., 2010).

HartnettHerbivory {{is one of}} {{the major}} biotic {{interactions}} shaping the structure and dynamics of grassland plant populations and community structure. The two major grass growth forms, rhizomatous and caespitose species, may show different grazing tolerance and short-term overcompensation may offset long-term reductions in plant performance and fitness. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) the effects of long-term ungulate grazing on plant architecture, population structure, and life history traits of the caespitose perennial grass, Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), and the rhizomatous Bouteloua curtipendula (sideoats grama) in tallgrass prairie, and 2) the effects of grazing intensity (frequency of defoliation) on growth responses of little bluestem. Long-term bison grazing decreased the cover, frequency, tiller height, and proportion of tillers producing seed in little bluestem, but caused no changes in tiller density and total genet size. Grazed little bluestem plants maintained a significantly larger below ground bud bank. Bison grazing had no long-term effect on the abundance, bud bank densities, or rhizome growth of the rhizomatous side-oats grama grass. Biomass, tiller density, relative growth rates, and proportion of tillers flowering in little bluestem all decreased with increasing frequency of defoliation. However, even an intense grazing regime (9 defoliations over a 12 month period) caused no plant mortality and no changes in new tiller emergence rates, or bud bank densities. Increasing defoliation frequency did result in shifts in plant architecture, as an increasing proportion of extravaginal tillers led to a more lateral, decumbent growth form. These results show that the rhizomatous side-oats grama grass has a significantly higher grazing tolerance than does little bluestem, and/or that bison selectively graze little bluestem. Results from responses to the experimental defoliation regimes suggest that little bluestem shows lower tolerance to high frequency of defoliation, and its maintenance of a reserve below ground bud bank may be its <b>primary</b> <b>tolerance</b> mechanism, allowing tiller populations to recover following severe defoliation...|$|E

Liming and fertilisation frequently are insufficient to overcome the problem, especially in tropical areas with subsoil acidity. The focus on breeding for acid soil tolerance as a more sustainable tool to achieve better crop performance has strongly stimulated research into the mechanisms of Al toxicity and tolerance.

However, in order to fill the still existing gap between geneticists and breeders a deeper knowledge on the Al-toxicity and tolerance mechanisms at the genetic, molecular and physiological levels is required, not only in crop plants, but also considering the large ecological diversity of naturally adapted species.

Methods: In 79 IBS patients (defined by Rome III criteria) with rectal hypersensitivity (defined as discomfort threshold ≤ 44 g) a parallel, placebo- controlled, randomized, and double- blind study was performed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation (5 g d − 1) with scFOS vs placebo for 4 weeks on rectal sensitivity (<b>primary</b> outcome: <b>tolerance</b> to increasing wall tension applied by a tensostat), clinical outcomes (IBS, anxiety/depression and quality of life scores) and composition of fecal microbiota.

It may seriously damage the end-user applications. Hence fault-tolerance tolerance becomes an important issue on these types of networks. The light path which carries traffic during normal operation is called as primary path. In case any failure occurs, the same traffic is rerouted on an alternative path that may be called as backup path. h. This paper mainly presents the routing approach for establishing primary and backup paths. In order to establish the primary path, this approach uses load balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current load of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking probability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a small fraction of probe packets along the existing paths. It then selects the optimal light path with the lowest est blocking probability.

Here, subjects with and without tinnitus, all with clinically normal hearing thresholds, underwent 1) behavioral testing to assess sound-level tolerance and 2) functional MRI to measure sound-evoked activation of central auditory centers. Despite receiving identical sound stimulation levels, subjects with diminished sound-level tolerance (i. e., hyperacusis) showed elevated activation in the auditory midbrain, thalamus, and primary auditory cortex compared with subjects with normal <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Primary</b> auditory cortex, but not subcortical centers, showed elevated activation specifically related to tinnitus.

Antigenic competition (depressed contact sensitivity to PCl) was induced not only by painting with DNFB via various routes, such as intravenous (i. v.), oral or subcutaneous routes. Antigenic competition was abolished by the treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) 4 days after i. v. injection of competing DNFB or Ox, and also by thymectomy 6 weeks prior to the injection of DNFB.

The clinical research on inhibitors towards factor VIII (FVIII) is challenged by the fact that this is an infrequent event occurring in a rare disease. Therefore, it is widely accepted that complementary studies involving animal models can provide important insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of this complication. In this respect, mouse models have been studied for clues to FVIII immunogenicity, natural history of immunity and for different approaches to <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>tolerance</b> induction. In the clinical setting, the type of FVIII product used and the occurrence of product switching are considered important factors which may have an influence on inhibitor development. The evaluation of data currently available in the literature does not prove unequivocally that a difference in the immunogenicity exists between particular FVIII products (e. g. recombinant vs. plasma-derived, full length vs. B-domainless). In addition, national products switches have occurred and, in this context, switching was not associated with an enhanced inhibitor risk.

METHODS: Depleting anti-CD 4 antibody administration in conjunction with allogeneic heart transplantation generates donor-specific operational <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Primary</b> C 57 BL/ 6 heart grafts were transplanted into the neck cavity of the anti-CD 4 antibody pretreated C 3 H/He mice. At day 50, functioning heart grafts were removed from tolerant mice. At day 100, a secondary C 57 BL/ 6 or a third-party heart was transplanted into the abdomen. RESULTS: Anti-CD 4 antibody therapy induced CD 4 CD 25 regulatory T cells by 50 days after transplantation, as depleting anti-CD 25 treatment in tolerant mice abrogated graft prolongation when spleen leukocytes were adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Tolerance was maintained by CD 4 CD 25 regulatory T cells via a CTLA- 4 signal at 100 days, even after removal of the primary graft at day 50. Administration of anti-CD 25 antibody immediately after removal of the primary graft did not break tolerance, as five out of six second allografts transplanted at day 100 were accepted. Anti-CD 25 antibody therapy in conjunction with splenectomy, but not thymectomy, immediately after removal of primary heart grafts at day 50 broke tolerance at day 100; all allografts were rejected.

40|$|Leaf venation is a {{showcase}} of plant diversity, {{ranging from the}} grid-like network in grasses, {{to a wide variety}} of dendritic systems in other angiosperms. A principal function of the venation is to deliver water; however, a hydraulic significance has never been demonstrated for contrasting major venation architectures, including the most basic dichotomy, “pinnate” and “palmate” systems. We hypothesized that vascular redundancy confers tolerance of vein breakage such as would occur during mechanical or insect damage. We subjected leaves of woody angiosperms of contrasting venation architecture to severing treatments in vivo, and, after wounds healed, made detailed measurements of physiological performance relative to control leaves. When the midrib was severed near the leaf base, the pinnately veined leaves declined strongly in leaf hydraulic conductance, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rate, whereas palmately veined leaves were minimally affected. Across all of the species examined, a higher density of <b>primary</b> veins predicted <b>tolerance</b> of midrib damage. This benefit for palmate venation is consistent with its repeated evolution and its biogeographic and habitat distribution. All leaves tested showed complete tolerance of damage to second- and higher-order veins, demonstrating that the parallel flow paths provided by the redundant, reticulate minor vein network protect the leaf from the impact of hydraulic disruption. These findings point to a hydraulic explanation for the diversification of low-order vein architecture and the commonness of reticulate, hierarchical leaf venation. These structures suggest roles for both economic constraints and risk tolerance in shaping leaf morphology during 130 million years of flowering plant evolution...|$|R

Finite Element contact models of reconstructed hips, subjected to physiologically-based boundary constraints and peak loads of walking mode, were simulated using a coefficient of friction of 0. 4 and an interference-fit of 50 ?m. Maximum and average implant micromotions across the subpopulation were predicted to be 100 ± 7 ?m and 7 ± 5 ?m with ranges [15 ?m, 350 ?m] and [1 ?m, 25 ?m], respectively. The computed percentage of implant area with micromotions greater than reported critical values of 50 ?m, 100 ?m and 150 ?m never exceeded 14 %, 8 % and 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Inclusion body {{myopathy}} {{associated with}} Paget’s disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD; OMIM 167320) is an autosomal dominant inherited multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. Knock-in mice expressing the common human p. R 155 H VCP mutation develop a progressive myopathy with ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies, accumulation of abnormally shaped mitochondria in skeletal muscle and focal bone degradation reminiscent of Paget’s disease of bone. To further assess the physiological {{effects of this}} mutation in muscle, we compared the in vitro contractile properties of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (fast-twitch muscle) and soleus (slow-twitch muscle) from mice heterozygous for the p. R 155 H mutation in VCP and wild-type mice. Our results showed that fast-twitch muscle fibres isolated from VCPR 155 H/+ mutant mice 12 - 15 months old not only fatigued faster and to a greater extent, but also recovered significantly slower {{and to a lesser}} degree than those of age-matched wild-type mice. Thereafter, the muscles seem to recover {{and by the time the}} mice were 27 months old, there was no difference in the fatigue resistance of mutant and wild type mice. These results suggest that VCP may be necessary for maintenance of glycolytic capacity in mouse fast-twitch muscle fibres at 12 - 15 months only. Investigation of oxidative capacity in 12 and 14 month old VCPR 155 H/+ mice revealed significantly lower mitochondrial enzyme activity (citrate synthase) in VCPR 155 H/+ mice at 14 months; concomitant with the reduction in fasttwitch fibre fatigue <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Primary</b> fibroblast cells isolated from our VCPR 155 H/+ mouse model showed reduced ability of mitochondrial networks to fragment when exposed to oxidative stress, indicating that intact VCP is required for the successful maintenance of mitochondrial network dynamics and quality control...|$|R
40|$|Background: Uncertainty is {{inevitable}} in clinical practice in <b>primary</b> care and <b>tolerance</b> for uncertainty {{and concern for}} bad outcomes {{has been shown to}} vary between physicians. Uncertainty is a factor for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Evidence-based guidelines as well as near-patient tests are suggested tools to decrease uncertainty in the management of patients with respiratory tract infections. The aim of this paper was to describe strategies for coping with uncertainty in patients with pharyngotonsillitis in relation to guidelines. Methods: An interview study was conducted among a strategic sample of 25 general practitioners (GPs). Results: All GPs mentioned potential dangerous differential diagnoses and complications. Four strategies for coping with uncertainty were identified, one of which was compliant with guidelines, "Adherence to guidelines", and three were idiosyncratic: "Clinical picture and C-reactive protein (CRP) ", "Expanded control", and "Unstructured". The residual uncertainty differed for the different strategies: in the strategy "Adherence to guidelines" and " Clinical picture and CRP" uncertainty was avoided, based either on adherence to guidelines or on the clinical picture and near-patient CRP; in the strategy " Expanded control" uncertainty was balanced based on expanded control; and in the strategy "Unstructured" uncertainty prevailed in spite of redundant examination and anamnesis. Conclusion: The majority of the GPs avoided uncertainty and deemed they had no problems. Their strategies either adhered to guidelines or comprised excessive use of tests. Thus use of guidelines as well as use of more near-patient tests seemed associated to reduced uncertainty, although the later strategy at the expense of compliance to guidelines. A few GPs did not manage to cope with uncertainty or had to put in excessive work to control uncertainty.

40|$|Background and Aims: Submergence is a {{recurring}} {{problem in the}} rice-producing rainfed lowlands of south and south-east Asia. Developing rice cultivars with tolerance of submergence and with agronomic and quality traits acceptable to farmers is a feasible approach to address this problem. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub 1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub 1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub 1 A and Sub 1 C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F 1 hybrids heterozygous for the Sub 1 A- 1 -tolerant allele. Methods: Tolerant varieties were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing through two or three backcrosses, and their performance was evaluated to determine the effect of Sub 1 in different genetic backgrounds. The roles of Sub 1 A and Sub 1 C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub 1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data. Key Results: All mega varieties with Sub 1 introgression had a significantly higher survival rate than the original parents. An intolerant Sub 1 C allele combined with the tolerant Sub 1 A- 1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub 1 C- 1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub 1 A allele; however, even when Sub 1 C- 1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub 1 A- 2, plants remained intolerant. Survival rates and Sub 1 A expression were significantly lower in heterozygotes compared with the homozygous tolerant parent. Conclusions: Sub 1 provided a substantial enhancement in the level of tolerance of all the sensitive mega varieties. Sub 1 A is confirmed as the <b>primary</b> contributor to <b>tolerance,</b> while Sub 1 C alleles do not seem important. Lack of dominance of Sub 1 suggests that the Sub 1 A- 1 allele should be carried by both parents for developing tolerant rice hybrids. Endang M. Septiningsih, Alvaro M. Pamplona, Darlene L.

A computational tool is developed that automatically selects and positions the most suitable stem from an implant system made of a total of 48 collarless stems to best match a 3 D model based on a library of CT femur scans (75 males and 34 females). Finite Element contact models of reconstructed hips, subjected to physiologically-based boundary constraints and peak loads of walking mode, were simulated using a coefficient of friction of 0. 4 and an interference-fit of 50 μm. Maximum and average implant micromotions across the subpopulation were predicted to be 100 ± 7 μm and 7 ± 5 μm with ranges [15 μm, 350 μm] and [1 μm, 25 μm], respectively. The computed percentage of implant area with micromotions greater than reported critical values of 50 μm, 100 μm and 150 μm never exceeded 14 %, 8 % and 7 %, respectively. To explore the possible correlations between anatomy and implant performance, response surface models for micromotion metrics were constructed. Detailed morphological analyses were conducted and a clear nonlinear decreasing trend was observed between implant average micromotion and both the metaphyseal canal flare indices and average densities in Gruen zones. The present study demonstrates that the <b>primary</b> stability and <b>tolerance</b> of the short stem to variability in patient anatomy were high, reducing the need for patient stratification. In addition, the developed tool could be utilised to support implant design and planning of femoral reconstructive surgery. CetimEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC...|$|R
