40|$|AbstractStudies of {{the cost}} of carbon capture and storage (CCS) {{frequently}} make a single set of assumptions about the characteristics of the source of CO 2 and the injection site (the sink). However, in practice, the design of the whole CCS system will require optimisation involving selecting the appropriate pipeline sizes, the pipeline route, the number, type and <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> wells. This study reports the optimisation of a possible CCS project in Australia and examines the effects of different parameters in designing the system. The area in and surrounding Gladstone, Rockhampton, Stanwell and Callide (“Gladrock”) in Central Queensland Australia emits over 40. 5 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from fixed sources every year. The study examines least cost solutions for CCS technologies in the Gladstone and Rockhampton area. The study optimises the cost of transporting CO 2 from power stations in the Gladrock region and injecting the CO 2 in the Aramac coal measures. Basic engineering results together with the capital and operating costs of the whole project and individual sets of equipment are assessed. Large compressors of several hundred megawatts are required at each source to raise the CO 2 to supercritical conditions for transport and storage. Carbon dioxide is maintained in a supercritical state by booster pumps. The paper analyses the effect of the following aspects of the CCS process - network configurations, flow rates, well types, permeability and best combinations of compressors and pipelines. The paper shows that the cost depends mainly on pipeline characteristics, permeability, flow rate and the type of wells used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two massive binaries, Cyg X- 3 and LSI 303 o + 61, {{are inside}} the error boxes of γ-ray sources {{detected}} by the Compton GRO. If somewhere inside such binary systems are injected very high energy (VHE) γ-rays, {{as suggested by}} some Cherenkov observations, they may initiate the inverse Compton e ± pair cascade in the soft radiation of a massive companion, and the detected high energy γ-ray emission {{may be caused by}} the secondary γ-rays of such cascade process. Since VHE γ-rays has to propagate in the anisotropic radiation of a massive star (the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> does not cover with the source of soft radiation), the intensities of secondary γ-rays depend on the angles of observation measured from direction defined by the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> of VHE γ-rays and the center of a massive star. We compute γ-ray spectra formed in such anisotropic cascade by using the Monte Carlo method. It is found that the intensity of secondary γ-rays does not varies strongly for the angles of observation greater than ∼ 90 o, but the highest intensities are observed at the angles corresponding to the limb of a massive star. Moreover, some cascade γ-rays can also emerge from behind the massive star, i. e. from the opposite site than the location of a source of primary γ-rays. This interesting feature can be called as a focusing of γ-rays by the soft radiation of a massive star...|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} here that in real world, {{the system is}} more complex than the one in Fig.  1. Fig.  1 is only a two-bus system that all the P and Q injected from the source side can pass through the whole line to the other end. In reality, the LV feeders have usually more than one literal, and connected with loads. The injected P and Q can often be absorbed along the feeder in case there are loads surrounded. The created |∆V| is therefore reduced too since less impedance the power flow goes through. To create the same amount of |∆V| at a point in the system, the Q/P ratio is then varying dependent on the flow patterns as well as the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection.</b> The study in the paper is based on low load conditions; therefore the results are close to the R/X ratio of the grid.|$|E

A ausência de consenso entre os autores em relação a diversos aspectos técnicos, como o local de injeção, pode contribuir, em parte, para essa variação. OBJETIVO: Estudar o efeito do local de injeção em relação à distribuição espacial da gordura dentro da prega vocal e à configuração glótica após essas injeções. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Experimental. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Seis laringes adultas excisadas foram utilizadas. Gordura colhida por lipoaspiração foi injetada, por meio de uma seringa de pressão, no ponto médio da prega vocal em três laringes e lateralmente ao processo vocal da aritenóide em outras três. Fotografias digitais em vista cranial da glote foram obtidas antes e após as injeções. Após fixação e descalcificação, as laringes foram cortadas no plano frontal nos terços anterior, médio e {{posterior}} da prega vocal e no nível da cartilagem aritenóide, para estudar a distribuição da gordura. RESULTADOS: Somente a injeção de gordura lateralmente ao processo vocal da aritenóide permitiu o fechamento da glote posterior. A gordura tendeu a ocupar um espaço cilíndrico dentro do músculo tireoaritenóideo, ao longo do maior eixo da prega vocal, mesmo quando injetada próximo ao processo vocal. CONCLUSÕES: O local de injeção da gordura teve influência sobre a configuração glótica após a injeção, apesar da gordura tender a ocupar um espaço cilíndrico ao longo da prega vocal em ambos os grupos.

Methods. In this experimental study, 40 pig cadaver heads were used (80 eyeballs). The material was divided into four groups (of 20 eyeballs each). Each group was administered 4. 5 ml of a mixture of 2 % lignocaine, 0. 5 % bupivacaine, and 0. 5 ml of Indian ink, with different amounts of hyaluronidase - 15 IU/ml, 75 IU/ml, 150 IU/ml, except the control one. Samples of retrobulbar tissue were analyzed using the standard histopathological procedure. After that, they were also analyzed using the Adobe Photoshop program® (Windows, USA). The retrobulbar space was divided into eight zones by four perpendicular lines, which crossed in the centre of the optic nerve. The presence of ink in fat and muscle tissues and in the sheath of the optic nerve was observed. Results. The presence of the local anesthetic solution was significantly higher in inferonasal and superonasal quadrants of the fat and muscle tissues (p < 0. 01). The distribution in optic nerve sheath is similar in each quadrant. Distribution of local anesthetic in each zone of the muscle tissue (I-VIII) was strongly influenced by the amount of hyaluronidase added. In the fat tissue, the distribution of local anesthetic under the influence of hyaluronidase was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in the areas which were distant from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> (I-IV).

Registrars have input {{to this process}} by reflecting on their learning needs and developing learning plans. This article discusses the teaching of practical procedures in general practice and describes the planning, delivery and evaluation of an educational session about the management of shoulder conditions for general practice registrars. Measuring quality in postgraduate general practice education is complex and has been likened to ‘looking inside a black box’. 1 Most models focus on the ‘preceptorship ’ relation-ship between teacher and learner. In this relationship, a variety of learning opportuni-t ies can be offered in a supportive environment to achieve educational out-comes and goals. 2 – 4 Translating these curriculum goals and learning plans into educational programs requires the planning, delivery and evaluation of educational sessions by general practi-tioner supervisors and medical educators. The assessment and documentation of these processes are key aspects of quality assur-ance within educational programs. 3, 5 Despite this, clinicians receive limited instruction in this vital task. 6 Planning The RACGP curriculum identifies five broad domains for competence in general practice {{to be applied to}} priority learning areas. 7 The learning objectives of the training session were developed using the curriculum as a guide. These included to: • demonstrate knowledge and skil ls required to competently examine a shoul-der joint • understand the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> in the management of common acute and chronic joint problems, and • perform an injection of the subacromial bursa and supraspinatus tendon on a joint manikin. Several aspects of the curriculum are relevant to this training session. The educational goals of this lesson can be mapped on a curriculum matrix. A similar matrix is available on th...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the pharmacokinetics of parenteral products of d-[alpha]-tocopherol and its acetylated ester. Then, a third experiment was undertaken to assess the effect of dietary and i. m. (one of the alcohol sources previously evaluated) vitamin E supplementation on reproductive performance and tocopherol status of sows and their progeny. Alpha-tocopherol concentration with time data were fitted to a sum of exponentials. Compartmental models were developed based on the slopes and intercepts of the exponential equations. The absorption from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> was calculated to be 43 and 40 % of the dose after i. m. administration of d-[alpha]-tocopherol and d-[alpha]-tocopherol acetate, respectively. The ratio of the area under the curve for d-[alpha]-tocopherol/d-[alpha]-tocopherol acetate was between 1. 26 to 1. 33. Products as emulsion were readily available, whereas the product using olive oil as a carrier was not. Animals receiving the acetate sources had serum and tissue vitamin E concentrations only detectable as alcohol 14 d after administration. The injection of the alcohol source of vitamin E resulted in greater total muscle [alpha]-tocopherol content than the acetate source. These results indicate that: olive oil {{was not a good}} carrier for i. m. vitamin E preparations; when vitamin E was formulated with an adequate carrier, it was readily available and improved vitamin E status of the pigs; pigs were able to hydrolyze the acetate to alcohol vitamin E; and that i. v. administration of vitamin E resulted in adverse systemic reactions, whereas the i. m. route did not. Therefore, the i. m. route is the therapeutic tool of choice to rapidly increase plasma [alpha]-tocopherol concentration of deficient animals. Dietary and injectable tocopherol supplementation of the sows can improve the tocopherol status of sows and their offspring. Pigs were born depleted of vitamin E, but the immediate uptake of colostrum replete them. When reproductive performance was used as response criterion, 11 IU of vitamin E per kg of diet for gestating and 22 IU/kg for lactating sows may be adequate for sows fed diets containing. 3 ppm of Se for three consecutive parities...|$|E

In this thesis we have discussed the methods of analyzing the waterflood performance of the O'Daniel waterflood pilot in the Spraberry Trend Area with the help of reservoir simulation. Spraberry Trend Area is considered {{to be one of the}} richest oil fields in the world. However, out of 6 - 10 billion bbls of original oil only 700 million bbls have been produced. In an effort to increase recovery, several waterflood pilots were conducted in Spraberry beginning in the late 1950 's. Because of profoundly complicated nature of the reservoir, waterflooding has been only moderately successful, and billions of barrels of hydrocarbons remain unrecovered. A recent waterflood pilot study started in 1995 with dramatically different results. The pilot was conducted in the O'Daniel unit of the Spraberry. The recovery in this lease has exceeded 25 % of the original oil in place, compared to only 10 % recovery in the entire Spraberry. Data from the current waterflood clearly shows that on-trend wells which are outside the pilot and along the major fracture trend responded favorably. In the previous waterflood pilots in Spraberry, the producer located off-trend from the water injectors received all the attention and the response in the on-trend wells was overlooked. In this study, we have developed a waterflood pattern for Spraberry where the target wells for waterflood response will be the on-trend producers. A successful waterflood depends on properly positioning the injectors and producers. In fractured reservoirs, fracture location, orientation and permeability dictates the <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> and production wells. So, to understand the fracture distribution, the main intention behind this thesis is to develop a method to determine location, orientation and permeability of fractures in Spraberry by using reservoir simulation. We performed three simulation studies: Humble pilot waterflood, O'Daniel tracer analysis and O'Daniel pilot waterflood. The first two simulation studies were performed with simple two-well models. The fracture orientation and permeability ratio obtained in these models were applied to the full field O'Daniel pilot that consists of 59 wells in about 8500 -acre area. Our simulation model shows that a concept of fracture enhancement (grid-blocks with high fracture permeability) in the dual-porosity model is necessary to capture the effect of heterogeneity of fracture network. The major fracture orientation obtained from the simulation is very close to the one obtained from the interference test and horizontal core analysis. The results of this study could be used in determining an optimum waterflood pattern suitable for that area to forecast oil production with different scenarios such as, infill drilling, CO 2 injection, horizontal wells etc. Finally, the results of this work will provide a method to assess the economic feasibility <b>of</b> large-scale water <b>injection</b> in the remainder of the field...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{atoms and}} small {{clusters}} introduced into superfluid helium (He II) concentrate there in quantized vortices to form (by further coagulation) the thin nanowires. The nanowires' thickness and structure are well predicted by a double-staged mechanism. On {{the first stage}} the coagulation of cold particles in the vortex cores leads to melting of their fusion product, which acquires a spherical shape due to surface tension. Then (second stage) when these particles reach a certain size they do not possess sufficient energy to melt and eventually coalesce into the nanowires. Nevertheless the assumption of melting for such refractory metal as tungsten, especially in He II, which possesses an extremely high thermal conductivity, induces natural skepticism. That is why we decided to register directly the visible thermal emission accompanying metals coagulation in He II. The brightness temperatures of this radiation for the tungsten, molybdenum, and platinum coagulation {{were found to be}} noticeably higher than even the metals' melting temperatures. The region of He II that contained suspended metal particles expanded with the velocity of 50 m/s, being close to the Landau velocity, but coagulation took place even more quickly, so that the whole process of nanowire growth is completed at distances about 1. 5 mm from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> metal <b>injection</b> into He II. High rate of coagulation of guest metal particles as well as huge local overheating are associated with them concentrating in quantized vortex cores. The same process should take place not only for metals but for any atoms, molecules and small clusters embedded into He II...|$|R
