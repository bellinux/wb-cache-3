40|$|The {{changes in}} the in vitro {{activity}} of nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase of leaves and roots of tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) with the supply of different nitrogen sources (ammonium, nitrate, or both) were examined. Nitrate reductase activity of leaves and roots became very low when nitrate was omitted from nutrient media. <b>Plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium nitrate had a detectable level of nitrate reductase activity. Glutamine synthetase activity increased similarly in roots of <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium alone and of plants with ammonium nitrate, {{but it was not}} affected in leaves by the supply of different nitrogen sources. On the contrary, glutamate dehydrogenase activity was not clearly affected in roots by the supply of different nitrogen sources whereas it became much higher in leaves of <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium alone and slightly higher in those of plants with ammonium nitrate than in those of plants with nitrate alone. It is considered that lower accumulation of ammonium in leaves of <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium nitrate may be due to stimulation of metabolic steps other than the primary ammonia assimilation...|$|R

40|$|At {{the moment}} the Dutch {{ornamental}} plant sector has a dominant international position fulfilling about 44 % of the European market. However, emerging markets are positioned at a great distance requiring new logistics concepts to operate efficiently and effectively, new marketing channels become apparent which require increased responsiveness and product diversification, and new competitors like Spain and Italy are entering the arena. If no action is taken, the Dutch might loose their renowned international position. What actions should the Dutch ornamental plant sector take; can network collaboration or logistics orchestration provide the answer? This is the central question in this position paper {{as part of the}} Transforum “FloriLog-regie” project. This paper aims to support the development of logistics orchestration concepts in the ornamental <b>plant</b> <b>supply</b> chain network by presenting literature reviews regarding logistics orchestration concepts and network design, and by developing a typology of orchestration concepts for the ornamental <b>plant</b> <b>supply</b> chain network using case studies from multiple sectors.

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{overview}} of the current situation as well as future prospects for biogas production in rural plants in Poland. Our research has focused on the management of agricultural waste. While Poland’s agriculture and its local food industry have substantial potential, many barriers persist to the development not only of biogas plants but also in every other renewable source of energy. The main obstacles have to do with politically motivated economic factors. Our interest has been in larger plants having sufficient capacities to produce in excess of 500 kW of electricity.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{demonstrated that}} ammonium nutrition enhances the drought tolerance of rice seedlings compared to nitrate nutrition {{and contributes to}} a higher root water uptake ability. It remains unclear why rice seedlings maintain a higher water uptake ability when supplied with ammonium under drought stress. Here, we focused {{on the effects of}} nitrogen form and drought stress on root abscisic acid (ABA) concentration and aquaporin expression using hydroponics experiments and stimulating drought stress with 10 % PEG 6000. Drought stress decreased the leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductivity and increased the leaf temperature of <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with either ammonium or nitrate, but especially under nitrate supply. After 4 h of PEG treatment, the root protoplast water permeability and the expression of root PIP and TIP genes decreased in <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium or nitrate. After 24 h of PEG treatment, the root hydraulic conductivity, the protoplast water permeability, and the expression of some aquaporin genes increased in <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium compared to those under non-PEG treatment. Root ABA accumulation was induced by 24 h of PEG treatment, especially in <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium. The addition of exogenous ABA decreased the expression of PIP and TIP genes under non-PEG treatment but increased the expression of some of them under PEG treatment. We concluded that drought stress induced a down-regulation of aquaporin expression, which appeared earlier than did root ABA accumulation. With continued drought stress, aquaporin expression and activity increased due to root ABA accumulation in <b>plants</b> <b>supplied</b> with ammonium...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{induction}} furnaces for steelmaking has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade throughout the world. The steel melting process involves the use of large quantities of energy in a short time and in some instances the process causes large decrease in the quality of electric power system to electricity users on the same network. In this paper, a new block for induction furnace was developed using MatLab Simulink software and the effect of induction furnace loads on the steel <b>plant</b> <b>supply</b> network was analyzed in terms of total harmonic distortions of voltage and current, using the developed block. Installation of a commensurate passive filter for distortion reduction was proposed, designed and simulated.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} a financial analysis for new supercritical pulverized coal plants with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) that compares {{the effects of}} two relevant climate policies. First, an updated cost estimate is presented for new supercritical pulverized coal plants, both with and without CCS. The capital cost escalation of recent years {{can be attributed to}} rising materials, <b>plant</b> <b>supply,</b> and plant contractor constraints. This estimate is then compared with recent estimates from public sources. Second, several current and proposed public policies relevant to CCS are presented. Finally, a financial analysis is performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two likely US carbon regulations on deploying Nth-plant CCS technology. The major conclusion is that the leading US carbon cap-and-trade bills will likely not be sufficient to deploy CCS technology in a manner consistent with a 550 ppm CO 2 stabilization scenario. A more aggressive carbon policy including CCS research, development, and demonstration must be considered to achieve this goal with significant CCS deployment...|$|E
