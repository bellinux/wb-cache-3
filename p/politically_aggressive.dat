40|$|The British Unitarians, a "sect {{everywhere}} spoken against" said Joseph Priestley, were a small, highly educated, financially respectable, <b>politically</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{and articulate}} denomination, which exerted an influence {{far beyond what}} their numbers ordinarily would command. They possessed an unbounded enthusiasm for reform and took part in almost every movement for social justice, {{one of which was}} particularly attractive to them the antislavery movement. Sadly, much of what they wrote and tried to accomplish has been ignored by scholars. This study is the story of their involvement in the thirty years war against the "master sin of the world" andndash; American slavery. In eight chapters, the thesis focuses on the antislavery writings opinions, and contributions of the British Unitarians, particularly a group of abolitionist stalwarts called Garrisonians. It also describes their racial views as revealed in their writings and in their conduct towards black people; and it describes their attitudes towards the American Civil War. The thesis is based on extensive manuscript, pamphlet, and periodical material, much of which has not been previously utilized in historical and religious monographs. The thesis makes several observations. The British Unitarians in their antislavery activity were devoted to the common welfare of the human race, to racial tolerance, and to participation in reform as an ecumenical endeavor. Their motivations for antislavery reform in particular, and reform in general, arose out of a liberal theology which sought to prove its moral superiority; a minority status and consciousness which sought acceptance; a strange and surprising evangelical warmth (typical of only some Unitarians and alien to the denomination as a body) that fired an emotive drive against social evils; a capitalist ideology that believed in a liberating progress; a political philosophy that favored freedom, honesty, and benevolence in government; a nationalism within an internationalism that proclaimed England's manifest destiny to be the protection and encouragement of human liberty at home and abroad; and a familial attachment to the members of their faith and reformers of their persuasion that was mutually supportive and rewarding. This study seeks to prove that the nineteenth century Unitarians are worthy of scholarly investigation and analysis, and suggests that the study of their motivation, commitment, vitality, and perseverance in the fight against American slavery can enhance our understanding of {{the role of religion in}} reform. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since its re-independence in 1991, Estonia has had {{an immense}} {{economic}} and political success - especially if compared to other ex-soviet states - it has joined NATO and European Union, {{it is also the}} only ex-soviet state to adopt the euro currency. But in society-level, it has one large problem still unsolved. One third of the population - the non-Estonians, mainly Russians - are not well-integrated in the society. 7 % of the population are Russian citizens and almost as much do not have any citizenship. As non-citizens, their rights on the highest level - voting - are limited to local councils only, the cannot vote or in Parliamentary elections. Even more, many Russians are primarily influenced by Russian state-media and other info channels, leaving them outcast in Estonian society. After the Bronze Riots in state's capital Tallinn in 2007 April, where atmosphere of national conflict rose to unprecedented level since the re-independence, a state-wide debate began in Estonia, primarily about how to improve the integration process and how to further avoid such conflicts. In 2009. Estonian state Ombudsman Indrek Teder reflected, that maybe the best solution to unite the state population as one would be concentrating on the idea of constitutional patriotism instead of nationalism. "Citizens' connection with their country should be rational and based on proven values, not in irrational nationalism and passion", Indrek Teder said. (Teder 2009) But constitutional patriotism is also a still a theoretical concept, which means it isn't proven to be the main basis of any state's national identity and should not be as the only basis of a nation's identity. Estonia cannot be compared to other states that are sometimes brought out as examples of implementing constitutional patriotism (Germany, USA), simply because of our unique geopolitical issues. It might be said that Estonia must be in constant defense position, as long as its neighbor state Russia is <b>politically</b> <b>aggressive</b> and anti-liberal. Nationalism, which was contraindicated to German identity because of their difficult history of its improper use, is preferable in Estonia's position, considering our history of its (Estonian nationalism's) suppression by our neighboring nation. Its removal from the core of citizens' identity would be unrealistic, not to say a security risk. This paper explains that constitutional patriotism has many valuable arguments that should be or already are part of Estonian citizens' identity such as attachment to liberal democracy, equality of all men, etc. Also, it is found that universal constitutional values should be more stressed in Estonian society, {{but that does not mean}} abandoning nationalism, just equilibrating it...|$|E

5000|$|On 15 December 2010, the General Prosecutor's Office {{instituted a}} {{criminal}} case against Tymoshenko, alleging that she misused funds received by Ukraine {{within the framework of}} the Kyoto Protocol. She was officially charged on 20 December 2010. Tymoshenko denied the money had been spent on pensions, insisting it was still at the disposal of the environment ministry. She called the investigation against her a witch-hunt. According to government officials, the criminal case against Tymoshenko was a legitimate attempt to uncover corruption by the previous administration. In the case of [...] "Kyoto money" [...] American experts [...] "Covington & Burling" [...] and [...] "BDO USA" [...] stated the following: [...] "the Documents that we were able to see, clearly point out that the Kyoto Target balance account in the amount of approximately 3.3 billion on the date of receipt remained unchanged throughout the period that is considered, and that, moreover, Kyoto funds have not been touched at all in 2009. Since the balance of this account remained unchanged on the date of receipt, any accusations that Prime Minister Tymoshenko [...] "used" [...] these funds contrary to their intended purpose, are obviously false". On 7 August 2014 the Chairman of the State Treasury service Tatiana Slyuz confirmed that the Tymoshenko government has never spent [...] "Kyoto money", the funds were on special accounts and in 2010 were transferred to the Yanukovych government. Tymoshenko was not arrested, but ordered not to leave Kiev while the inquiry was under way. In the same case, the environment minister in the second Tymoshenko Government, Georgiy Filipchuk, was detained. Filipchuk was the third minister from this government to face criminal charges since its fall in March 2010 (prosecutors charged former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko with abuse of office in early December 2010, and former economy minister Bohdan Danylyshyn was detained in the Czech Republic in October 2010 on similar charges). Lawmakers of BYuT blocked the rostrum and presidium of the Verkhovna Rada the next day in protest against this. That same day, the European People's Party issued a statement in which it [...] "condemns the growth of <b>aggressive,</b> <b>politically</b> motivated pressure by the Ukrainian authorities on the opposition and its leader Yulia Tymoshenko." [...] Tymoshenko dismissed the probe as [...] "terror against the opposition by President Yanukovych." [...] Earlier that month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka had stated that there were no political reasons for the interrogations of the opposition leaders Tymoshenko, Lutsenko and Oleksandr Turchynov.|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 126 - 131. xi, 131 leaves illOne of {{the most}} {{persistent}} questions which rebounds through political science and which in fact must pervade all responsible intellectual inquiry is a question particularly crucial in inquiries dealing with political instability [...] It {{is the question of}} what we do with, or about, our values. In pursuit of objective explanations of social reality how do we handle, control for, or eliminate values? This, of course, raises the more basic question of whether we ~ study politics objectively. I am of the view that we cannot. We all, whether we care to admit it or not, trudge around this planet with our little satchel full of values always at hand as a major component of our intellectual baggage. I do not see how we can escape the influence of these values in even the most basic of our intellectual undertakings [...] in the very selection of problems for study, in the establishment of relevant criteria and standards for evaluating the data we uncover, or in the positions we take on important and controversial questions within the discipline. But this need not deter us, nor detract from our efforts as long as we [...] both as researchers and students, [...] remain aware of this fact. We can, I think, legitimately claim the mantle of science as long as we continually question the extent to which our values are tutoring the intellectual decisions we are making. There is a context in which we must rigorously strive to keep our values out of our work [...] that is when our values impinge upon our empirical findings. When our belief in what ought distorts our view of what is, we have seriously erred, and I believe we must, insofar as possible, keep our work value free to this extent. Recognizing, however, that we cannot keep our values totally separated from our work, we have a responsibility, where they have impinged, to explicate them as fully as possible. I raise this question because, in the work which follows, an implicit value has been introduced, and the reader should be aware of it. What is presented here is a general theory of political instability in developing nations which treats the efficacy of politically relevant institutions as the major intervening variable between development or rapid social change, and political instability. The proposition is that the social mobilization which characterizes developing nations overburdens existing politically relevant institutions and renders them incapable of producing the desired effects. The consequence is that behavior moves outside the institutional framework of well established, structured, legitimate patterns of behavior and takes the form of <b>aggressive</b> <b>politically</b> relevant behavior which is dysfunctional in terms of the existing order of government and society. The value implicit in this theoretical framework is that political order [...] the stable society [...] is a prerequisite for achieving other political "goods. " As a result the theory ignores legitimate questions which may be raised as to the desirability of political order as a goal and the costs involved in attaining it. Be defining political instability as <b>aggressive</b> <b>politically</b> relevant behavior which is dysfunctional in terms of the existing order of government and society, the theory ignores the possibility that governments can themselves be a source of disorder as they seek to safeguard privilege. In its present stage the theory ignores a distinction between short term political instability which may be regarded as necessary for the attainment of a long term political "good" and chronic political instability. Most Americans, for example, probably regard the temporary disorder of our own revolution as necessary and desirable for the attainment of the ends that were sought. By failing to distinguish between disorder {{in the form of a}} popular challenge to a corrupt regime and a narrowly based military coup against a democratically chosen government, the model can be said to ignore the cost of political order and the fact that there can be integrated, perfectly functional systems of tyranny or inequality or exploitation. The reader, then, is forewarned that there is a value premise implicit in the model I have formulated which is clearly manifested in the concept of political instability as I have defined it, and which is further reflected in many of the operationalized indicators of political instability derived from the definition, e. g. anti-government demonstrations, assassinations of government officials, or the presence or absence of extremist political movements. Beyond this caveat, however, I believe this study to be as free of the values formed by my own cultural experience as I am able to make it. I believe that through the disciplined application of a deductive theoretical framework and the specific knowledge and experience I bring to bear, both in terms of the universe and institution selected for study, that I have been able to control, insofar as possible, for the value predisposition implicit in the development of the model. But the reader will have to judge for himself. If I have been successful then I would argue that the validity of my analysis tracing the conditions which promote political stability is independent of whether the reader shares this goal preference or not. It should also be recognized that the model, in its present form, does not come to grips with the underlying cultural attitudes and values of the universe examined. The theory is not yet powerful enough to do more than establish a relationship between the three major variables presented. It cannot, at its present stage of evolution, get at the perceptions and attitudes of the political actors involved [...] it cannot address a whole host of behavior linkages which may explain-the relationships [...] they must temporarily be treated as unobservables, as part of the unknown in the social systems analyzed. The model then has certain limitations, but I believe them to represent the temporary short term costs we must expect to pay if we are to be successful in our efforts at developing general theoretical systems which may some day be powerful enough to give meaning and form to our universe. A more complex model might be able to take into account some of the phenomena this model ignores. But such an approach would be short sighted. The theory proposed is very simple and ignores certain aspects of social reality. Along with Popper and Kemeny, however, it is my view that simplicity is the crux of theory building, that theories should have the highest attainable degree of falsifiability, and that only through simplicity can we achieve this. It is only after repeatedly failing to falsify a theory in its most simple form that we should begin to build in complexity step-by-step [...] attempting further falsification at each level until we ultimately attain the level of complexity and sophistication which can provide us with meaningful explanations of social reality. It is this view of theory building which justifies this present effort and the future research possibilities which it opens up. In terms of the viability of the theory as a useful model in exploring some uncharted ground in the development field, the short term costs are worth the long term potential acquired. Finally, it is only fair to recognize that Frustration-Aggression theory, and the model of political instability derived from it, as I have critiqued them in the introductory chapter, have been somewhat short changed. This does not reflect inadequate attention, nor a value premise, but a perceptual bias It is realized that I have dealt with aggression theory here in a narrow way and that the criticism presented may not be applicable to some of the more refined and sophisticated treatment of frustration and aggression in the fields of sociology and psychology; and I am not prepared to render a final judgment on the empirical foundation of these approaches. There are, however, as I have noted in the introduction, sufficient questions about the validity of the Frustration-Aggression model of political instability to warrant a search for alternative explanations [...] and this is my primary purpose. I do not undertake here to seriously appraise the adequacy or inadequacy of the premises upon which the Frustration-Aggression model is based. My aim is only to provide a viable, and possibly more logically, sound, alternative from which we all may benefit whether we are proponents of Frustration-Aggression theory or not...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT LONDON CALLING: THE LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY AND THE ASCENSION OF POPULAR POLITICS by FRANK L. PETERSMARK III May 2015 Advisor: Dr. Eric H. Ash Major: History Degree: Doctor of Philosophy This {{proposed}} dissertation {{will focus}} on the short but historically important life of the London Corresponding Society (LCS) in Britain in {{the last decade of the}} eighteenth century, from 1792 - 1799. The intent of such a focus should serve as a way to better understand the spread of political participation in Britain at the end of the eighteenth century and the key role that the London Corresponding Society played in that phenomenon. This dissertation will also suggest and argue that the London Corresponding Society effectively leveraged and even accelerated an existing trend toward widening political participation through the use of a growing mass media, a more politically astute public sphere, and a language of political engagement that was carefully constructed to represent a reconciliation with British constitutional traditions and ideals, rather than any radical break from the past as was the case in France during this period. To that end, this dissertation will attempt to answer the following historical questions: 1. What role did the London Corresponding Society play in the widening of political participation in Britain at the end of the eighteenth century? 2. What approaches, methods, and tactics were utilized by the London Corresponding Society in their quest to achieve their objectives of parliamentary reform and universal manhood suffrage? 3. To what extent did the London Corresponding Society and other such political associations contribute to a widening public sphere in late eighteenth century Europe? 4. To what extent was the London Corresponding Society influenced by the events in America and France in the late eighteenth century, and how did that impact the methods the London Corresponding Society used to achieve their goals and objectives? 5. What is the historical legacy of the London Corresponding Society? The rise and fall of the LCS, while short in duration, marks another important mile marker in the evolution of British politics, and can and should be used as a prism with which to view the changing nature of political culture in Britain and its empire during this period. Founded primarily by Thomas Hardy, a shoemaker, the LCS began as a group committed to political education, but the LCS quickly evolved into something that was much more <b>politically</b> and publically <b>aggressive,</b> leading to the arrests and deportations of many of its members. The fact the LCS and other such groups were established as the French Revolution radicalized was not lost on British conservatives and authorities, and connections were drawn between what had happened in America beginning in 1776, and what was happening in France beginning in 1789, and the threat that posed to political, social and economic stability in the British Empire. The British government watched the development of these 2 ̆ 2 radical 2 ̆ 2 groups closely, including the use of local police officials and spies, and had access to most of the correspondence of the LCS, as we now do. One need not read too far into the correspondence of the LCS without divining their political goals in the Society 2 ̆ 7 s support of the ideas of Thomas Paine, its congratulatory letters to the new Jacobin leaders of France, and its attempts to organize groups in Scotland in preparation for a British convention of radical reformers. All of this resulted in harsh crackdowns by the British government, including the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1794, and part of the story of the LCS is its ability to persist and survive, at least temporarily, in this politically charged environment. The LCS managed to hold huge rallies in London in 1794 and 1795, and there are some estimates that a rally led by LCS co-founder John Thelwall was attended by 100, 000 people. LCS founders Hardy, Thelwall, and others, were arrested and tried for treason and sedition in 1794 and 1795, and the LCS was ultimately put to an untimely death in the 1799 with the passage of the Corresponding Societies Act...|$|R
