40|$|Differences {{exist in}} {{electrocution}} rates of birds on wooden versus metal <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> However, mitigation measures effective on wooden <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> have not solved electrocution problems on metal poles. We examined {{the effectiveness of}} 12 experimental modifications of metal <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> to prevent electrocution of raptors. We did so by comparing raptors' perching behavior on paired modified and control poles. We tested 8 of these modifications in the field by comparing avian mortality before/after modification. Modifications were less effective when a 'perch guard' or 'perch' was used than when insulation was used. Small raptors (e. g., tawny owl [Strix aluco], Eurasian kestrel [Falco tinnunculus]) especially were not adequately protected by non-insulation methods. Differences in perching behavior and possibility of electrocution (i. e., wooden vs. steel power poleS) caused differences in effectiveness of modifications. We considered insulation of crossarm braces {{the most effective and}} practical modification to reduce electrocution of raptors by metal <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Discussing urban {{planning}} requires rethinking sustainability {{in cities and}} building healthy environments. Historically, some aspects of advancing the urban way of life have not been considered important in city planning. This is particularly the case where technological advances have led to conflicting land use, as with the installation of <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and building electrical substations near residential areas. This research aims to discuss and rethink sustainability in cities, focusing on {{the environmental impact of}} low-frequency noise and electromagnetic radiation on human health. It presents data from a case study in an urban space in northern Portugal, and focuses on four guiding questions: Can <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause noise? Do <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause discomfort? Do <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines cause discomfort due to noise? Can <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and <b>power</b> lines affect human health? To answer these questions, we undertook research between 2014 and 2015 that was comprised of two approaches. The first approach consisted of evaluating the noise of nine points divided into two groups “near the source” (e. g., up to 50 m from <b>power</b> <b>poles)</b> and “away from the source” (e. g., more than 250 m away from the source). In the second approach, noise levels were measured for 72 h in houses located up to 20 m from the source. The groups consist of residents living within the distance range specified for each group. The measurement values were compared with the proposed criteria for assessing low-frequency noise using the DEFRA Guidance (University of Salford). In the first approach, the noise caused discomfort, regardless of the group. In the second approach, the noise had fluctuating characteristics, which led us to conclude that the noise caused discomfort...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the most}} visible and least {{monitored}} elements of our national security infrastructure are the poles and towers used for the distribution of our nation’s electrical power. Issues surrounding these elements within the United States include safety such as unauthorized climbing and access, vandalism such as nut/bolt removal or destructive small arms fire, and major vandalism such as the downing of <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and towers by the cutting of the poles with a chainsaw or torches. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has an ongoing research program working to develop inexpensive and sensitive sensor platforms for the monitoring and characterization of damage to the power distribution infrastructure.

50|$|Between November 25 and November 30, 2005, {{the town}} was often off the German power grid, and was the topic of {{national}} news. The cause was a heavy snow storm with very wet snow.

40|$|AbstractTo provide {{additional}} wastewater capacity and redundancy in South Chandler, Arizona, a new 28 ” High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) force main was installed from the upsized Kyrene Lift Station three miles east to tie into an existing 66 ” transmission sewer line. The force main was installed under the State Route Loop 202 (SR 202 L) freeway through existing 48 ” steel casings constructed ten years prior. Additionally, the force main was constructed {{through a narrow}} Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) corridor, which required clearance from existing utilities, including overhead 69 kV <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Two locations required innovative solutions to both access the existing sleeves and cross the transmission <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> foundations: 1) crossing of the 69 kV <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> required detailed slope stability analysis and location specific trench backfilling; and 2) access to the existing 48 ” was within 15 feet of an existing ADOT sound wall. Various alternatives for access were analyzed in this paper including temporary shoring, sheet pile installation, and full wall replacement and reconstructing on drilled shafts. Based on the objectives above, the existing <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> does not have sufficient embedment for maximum design loads but is stable with reduced load factors and lower operation wind forces. Also, for construction issue with the existing ADOT sound wall, the temporary shoring and sheet piles used due to the geotechnical conditions and construction costs...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th Conference of the European Ornithologist's Union, celebrada en Badajoz (España) del 24 al 28 de agosto de 2015. Electrocution is a {{major problem}} for large raptors in open areas. The {{construction}} of safe electrical pole and wire configurations is the primary way of reducing this mortality and has been applied successfully in many regions of the Iberian Peninsula. However, electrocution is still the main cause of mortality for the Spanish Imperial Eagle. We employed an electric fence equipped <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> in a flight cage to train rehabilitated eagles ready for release to not use these poles as perches. To date three eagles were trained and released. Despite being the highest and most attractive perch in the cage avoidance of the <b>power</b> <b>pole</b> was effective after two low power electric shock experiences. Post- release satellite transmitter data is available only for one of the three individuals. This two-year-old eagle has establishes a small home range in an open area, and five months after release is still avoiding <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> as perches. These preliminary results show that similarly to other species such as the Californian Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) or the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) conditioned learning is effective in the mid-term, as an additional tool to the correction of dangerous <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
