50|$|<b>Polypropylene</b> <b>Twine</b> is {{made out}} of 100% polypropylene. It is lightweight, inexpensive, strong, and has low density, which allows it to float. It has amazing {{strength}} and knots easily.|$|E
50|$|The {{tensile testing}} of the {{polypropylene}} and sisal twines {{was done with the}} aid of an Instron tensile testing machine using capstan grips in the Material Science Lab at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. At the point of each type of twine’s ultimate tensile strength, it is apparent that polypropylene is a stronger material. With approximately an ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, it has more than 100% more tensile strength than that of sisal twine which has an ultimate tensile strength of 100 MPa. The two twines broke differently, however, as it {{can be seen in the}} two videos. <b>Polypropylene</b> <b>twine</b> had a straight break, where all of its fibers broke at once; this resulted in the straight line dropping to zero on the graph. The sisal twine broke in a different fashion. As the force load increased on the twine sample, individual fibers that were carrying the load broke and new ones became engaged. Thus was created the popping noises in the video; these properties directly correlate to the strength properties. Because all the fibers are engaged at once in polypropylene, it gives the twine high strength; the downside is that all the fibers break at once. Because only certain fibers in sisal twine carry the force of the load at one time, it doesn’t have as high of a strength as <b>polypropylene</b> <b>twine.</b> It does, however, allow the twine to stay intact much longer as each new fiber becomes engaged.|$|E
50|$|PSM 40 {{has a more}} porous {{structure}} than PSM Standard which provides increased lubrication. Only Nylon travellers should be used with PSM 40. Due to the higher porosity, PSM 40 is ideal for production of coarse count yarns and heavier denier cord processes i.e. tyre cord, <b>polypropylene,</b> <b>twines</b> and carpet yarn etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{large amount}} of used <b>polypropylene</b> baler <b>twine</b> {{generated}} from the agricultural community may provide a low-cost, environmentally friendly source of fibre reinforcement {{that can be used}} to improve the properties of concrete. However, the performance of such fibres for the application has not yet been explored. The effectiveness of using small amounts of chopped baler twine to control the restrained plastic shrinkage cracking of portland cement mortar was investigated in this study. To determine the influence of baler twine fibre type, length and volume fraction on their performance, two types of baler twine (one composed of strands with circular cross section, the other composed of flat band shape strands) in two lengths (19 mm and 38 mm) and three volume fractions (0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 3 %) were evaluated. To compare the performance of baler twine fibre with that of other commercially available synthetic fibres, fibrillated polypropylene fibres at equal lengths and volume fractions was investigated. The restrained plastic shrinkage tests were carried out by subjecting the fibre-reinforced mortar specimens, cast on rough substrate bases, to a wind speed of 2. 6 m/s, and relative humidity less than 3 % at 35 °C for 22 hours. To evaluate the effectiveness of the fibres, the crack numbers were recorded, and the maximum crack width and total crack area on the surface of each specimen were measured using an image analysis technique. Unrestrained plastic shrinkage tests were also conducted in which fibre-reinforced mortar specimens without the substrate bases were tested under the same environmental conditions. Test results indicate that both types of baler twine are capable of controlling restrained plastic shrinkage cracking to some extent, but are not as effective as fibrillated <b>polypropylene.</b> The baler <b>twine</b> composed of band shape strands performed better than the one composed of strands with circular cross section. Compared with plain specimens, the total crack area was reduced by 95. 3, 77. 5 and 38. 7 % when 0. 3 % volume fraction of 38 mm fibrillated polypropylene, band shape baler twine and circular baler twine fibres, respectively, were added. Similar reductions in maximum crack width were observed. Fibre length did not significantly influence cracking behaviour. Free plastic shrinkage was significantly reduced only when long fibre lengths (38 mm) and high volume fractions (0. 3 %) were used...|$|R
40|$|Development of a Braided Polypropylene Rope Using Polypropylene Tape Yarns is {{a journal}} article. Traditionally, braided ropes are {{manufactured}} using either staple yarns or multifilament yarns. This study therefore sought {{to break this}} traditional paradigm by uniquely and economically manufacturing braided polypropylene ropes using polypropylene tape yarns. A recipe made up of virgin polypropylene granules, calcium carbonate and black masterbatch was used to produce a polypropylene plastic sheet, which was extruded on a Barmag machine. Tape yarns with a width of 22 mm on average were produced. Count, width, thickness, elongation and tensile strength of the tape yarns used to produce the rope were tested. The elongation and tensile strength tests were done on a Micro 500 Testometric strength-testing machine. Test results on the tape yarns revealed that they have properties that fall within the standard range of fibrillated polypropylene tape yarns. Sorptive properties of both the tape yarns used and the braided rope developed revealed {{a slight increase in}} water absorbance to approximately 0. 15 % compared to standard water absorbance of less than 0. 1 %. This increment in water absorbance, however, did not change the floating properties of both the tape yarns and the braided rope as they both remained with their positive buoyancy. Also, no signs of microbial attack were seen on the tape yarns and the braided rope by naked eyes after exposing the samples to water. The resultant braided rope produced was made up of 12 X 4973 denier polypropylene tape yarns with a 9200 -denier <b>polypropylene</b> bailer <b>twine</b> as the core. The count and diameter of the resultant rope were found to be close to those of hazard barrier and hydro-pulling ropes and were also analogous to those of 5 mm cotton braided ropes produced...|$|R
40|$|Minor {{natural fibres}} such as sisal, kenaf and coir were {{important}} exports from ACP countries until low-cost synthetic polypropylene destroyed their markets almost over-night. Ij {{the last two}} decades these natural fibres have regained some of their lost markets as oil and its derivatives have increased in price and as environmental concerns have encouraged a return to 'natural' products. Despite this, production of hard fibres remains stagnant. Could these industries be revitalized and their economic potential realized? Asia dominates world markets for hard industrial fibres, and certain countries have won themselves leading positions as suppliers of coir (India and Sri Lanka), jute (India and Bangladesh) and abaca (Philippines). In Africa sisal is the major hard fibre, although smaller quantities of coir (coconut fibre) and kenaf are also produced. Until the 1960 s Tanzania, followed by Kenya, led the world market in sisal, with smaller but economically significant quantities grown in Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique. The development of lower-cost rot-proof twine for baling hay and straw in Europe and the US and the trend to the use of plastic sacks was a damaging blow to sisal; large acreages were abandoned. In Tanzania, the sisal production collapsed from 250, 000 tonnes to 30, 000 tonnes. Mauritius abandoned the crop completely. Coir also suffered competition from synthetics and although never a major product in Africa, it was again Kenya and Tanzania that suffered, in common with many islands with extensive coconut plantations in the Caribbean. and Pacific. Despite this damaging reversal there was a revival of interest in natural fibres in the eighties; as the price of polypropylene increased, natural fibre products were seen to be equal or better value for money Unfortunately, weakened industries were in a poor position to exploit their opportunity. The sisal industry in Tanzania was perhaps typical: nationalization of estates, lack of investment in processing machinery and poor management had eroded output, quality and buyer confidence. Skilled estate workers had drifted away to alternative employment or subsistence farming. A future, or only a past? Natural hard fibres have been used to manufacture a great variety of products from twines and ropes to woven fabrics for bags and carpet backing and for brush bristles, matting, screens and wall hangings. New possibilities include making paper from sisal, geotextiles for stabilizing ground disturbed by civil engineering, using natural fibres for soundproofing cars and developing coir dust as a plant growing medium in place of peat. The tragedy of recent policy decisions in ACP producing countries has been that not even local domestic, industrial and government buyers have supported their own industries but instead have opted for, and paid hard currency for, imported <b>polypropylene</b> <b>twines,</b> plastic bags and sheets, and nylon brush heads. Despite these damaging developments, production of hard fibres in ACP countries is remarkably stable and production is now concentrated {{in the hands of a}} relatively small but committed core of growers and processors. These could provide a foundation of expertise and production on which to expand production on which to expand national output of selected fibres, develop value-added processing, stimulate rural industries and provide much sought-after employment. World demand for industrial hard fibres currently exceeds supply and there is considerable potential for using more locally-grown and processed, fibre-based products. Fibre crops are not demanding with regard to fertilizer or pesticide inputs; they provide substantial employment opportunities at harvesting and processing and offer the benefit of substituting for imports paid for in hard currency. But, to be economically successful and sustainable, fibre-based industries require careful planning, quality control and stronger links between research and development and commercial developments. The manufacturers of oil-based competitor products invest in research to improve their products and to develop new uses and new products. They also advertise to promote their products. Natural fibre producers and processors must be prepared to compete in all these activities. There are many examples of successful producers of other commodities which have developed brand awareness and loyalty: Mauritius sugar, Ivorien, Jamaican and Kenyan coffee, Dominica's coconut oil soap and Indian jute. Some have achieved this entirely through commercial endeavour, some with a degree of government assistance; but all have benefited the respective countries in terms of employment, import substitution and export earnings. Many ACP countries could do the same with the minor fibre crops suited to their agro-ecological conditions if long-term political and commercial commitments were made.
