DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for:- (1) equipment for separating granular material into various grain fractions; (2) plastics aggregate for lightweight concrete {{in the form of}} granular waste rendered inert by chemical treatment with strong caustic alkali and/or strong acid. USE - The separating equipment is used for separating round and angular grains, especially the plastics aggregate (all claimed). The lightweight concrete is useful e. g. in overground, underground, agricultural and horticultural construction and road building. ADVANTAGE - Recycling <b>plastics</b> <b>scrap</b> saves mineral oil resources and reduces carbon dioxide and associated toxic emissions by avoiding incineration. However, impurities in the scrap can make concrete swell on exposure to humidity and reduce the strength. Chemical treatment eliminates this problem.

40|$|Within {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{the use of}} energy recovery from waste was analysed for several industrial facilities, focussing on cement plants, kilns in the lime and gypsum industry, steel works and plants {{for the production of}} non ferrous metals. 44 German cement plants dispose of an own clinker production. Presently 31 plants have a permit for recovering energy from waste. The total permitted capacity for energy recovery in German cement kilns amounts to nearly 2, 6 Mio. t/a. Mainly waste oil, old tyres, fuel derived from processed production-specific and municipal waste, <b>plastics,</b> <b>scrap</b> wood and waste paper are co-incinerated. In 1998 / 99 a total amount of roughly 945. 000 t refuse was processed in 30 units of the studied facilities. In five furnaces at three steel works waste can be used for energy or material recovery. The approved total capacity of high calorific waste for energy recovery comes to nearly 350, 000 t/a. Especially industrial plastics and packaging waste from DSD, <b>plastics</b> processed in <b>scrap</b> mills and shreddered waste and granulated paint sludge are used. In 1998 the facilities processed only old plastic, representing a total amount of nearly 109. 000 t. At present seven facilities in the non ferrous metal industry have a permit for energy recovery from waste. The maximum capacity amounts on national level to nearly 140. 000 t/a. Especially waste oil, packaging waste, <b>plastics</b> and <b>scrap</b> wood can be processed. The analysis of respective applications of the 17 th BImSchV shows an inconsistency within the amending permitting procedures. For the time to come a conformity between the respective regional permitting authorities would be recommendable. Moreover, the effects on air emission caused by using waste for energy recovery were analysed for cement kilns with own clinker production. Due to the amendment of the 17 th BImSchV more stringent requirements regarding waste composition must be established. This is especially valid for the highly volatile mercury. For this heavy metal suitable input limitations need to be fixed. (orig.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{feasibility}} research was to study a novel sensor based separation method for recycling of plastic materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) by using eigen-frequency response of impact acoustic emission. In this research three kinds of commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and styrene-maleic-anhydride (SMA) sampled from end-of-life vehicles, were researched. Almost all the crushed <b>plastic</b> <b>scraps</b> had a flake structure, theoretically their impact response behaviors were determined by their diameters and thicknesses. The equivalent diameters of the scraps were characterized by fine sieving and their thicknesses were measured online by a 3 D laser triangulation sensor above the conveying path. Following this the scraps were free dropped one-by-one to impact with an impact passive body on which impact acoustic emission (AE) signals were generated and acquired by an acoustic pickup sensor. Thirdly, the AE signals which carried eigen-frequency response features were processed and characterized. Results demonstrated that the scraps with diameters < 8 mm were too weak for the actual devices to process; the scraps with diameter from 8 – 13 mm still generated {{quite a lot of}} AE signals of inadequate intensity. Finally the general characterization and recognition yields were 64. 6 %, 61. 7 %, and 63. 9 % of PP, ABS, and SMA in mass, respectively of tested materials...|$|R

40|$|Sediments from Mtoni estuary and 2 tributaries, Tanzania, were {{screened}} for polychlorinated- p -dibenzodioxins, -dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) using the chemically activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX) bioassay approach. PCDD/Fs expressed as bio analytical equivalence (BEQ) values ranged from 5. 7 ± 1. 4 to 39. 9 ± 5. 8 pg BEQ/g sediment {{in the wet}} season and from 14. 1 ± 2. 0 to 32. 8 ± 4. 7 pg BEQ/g sediment in the dry season, with higher levels observed in Kizinga River and stations close {{to the mouth of}} that river. Dioxin-like PCB levels ranged from 0. 21 ± 0. 03 to 0. 53 ± 0. 03 pg BEQ/g sediment in the wet season and from 0. 22 ± 0. 03 to 0. 59 ± 0. 04 pg BEQ/g sediment in the dry season. Higher PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels in sediments are probably related to open burning of <b>plastic</b> <b>scraps,</b> household burning of wood or charcoal and traffic related emissions, all of which occur in the Dar es Salaam region. The denser population and the more intense industrial activities in the Kizinga River basin may explain the enhanced PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels observed in the sediments of that river compared to the levels in the Mzinga River basin. A third sampling campaign, including also stations in the downstream estuary, confirmed the enhanced levels in the Kizinga River (maximum of 400 pg-BEQ/g) and also showed that a clear decreasing concentration gradient in the downstream direction exists.
