25|$|Upon {{release of}} nuclear {{proteins}} and chromatin, antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, display these antigens to T helper cells. Although {{the details of}} this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an antigen presenting cell to produce type 1 interferons. This cytokine serves to induce maturation of <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T helper cells. The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, immunogenic CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the pattern recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 9, found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T helper cells then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} Class A ODN, ODN 2216, was {{described}} in 2001 by Krug et al. This class of ODN was distinctly different from the previously described Class B ODN (i.e., ODN 2006) in that it stimulated the production of large amounts of Type I interferons, {{the most important one}} being IFNα, and induced the maturation of <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells. [...] Class A ODN are also strong activators of NK cells through indirect cytokine signaling.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{very few}} studies have {{investigated}} the expression levels of miR-155-3p, Landgraf et al. established that expression levels of this miRNA was very low in hematopoietic cells. [...] Additionally, PCR analyses found that while miR-155-3p was detectable {{in a number of}} human tissues the expression levels of this miRNA were 20-200 fold less when compared to miR-155-5p levels. Even though the function of miR-155-3p has been largely ignored, several studies now suggest that, in some cases (astrocytes and <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells), both miR-155-5p and -3p can be functionally matured from pre-mir-155.|$|E
2500|$|CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (or CpG ODN) {{are short}} {{single-stranded}} synthetic DNA molecules that contain a cytosine triphosphate deoxynucleotide ("C") {{followed by a}} guanine triphosphate deoxynucleotide ("G"). The [...] "p" [...] refers to the phosphodiester link between consecutive nucleotides, although some ODN have a modified phosphorothioate (PS) backbone instead. When these CpG motifs are unmethylated, they act as immunostimulants. CpG motifs are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) due to their abundance in microbial genomes but their rarity in vertebrate genomes. The CpG PAMP is recognized by the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9), which is constitutively expressed only in B cells and <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells (pDCs) in humans and other higher primates.|$|E
2500|$|Epithelial {{cells in}} SS lesions are active {{participants}} in the induction and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. Environmental and hormonal factors, in concert with an appropriate genetic background, are believed to trigger SS, which dysregulates epithelial cells and allows aberrant homing and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and B cells. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells [...] which process antigen material and present it to other T cells. Following the migration of lymphocytes into the glands in response to chemokines and specific adhesion molecules, T cells interact with epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are further activated by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF), which are produced by adjacent T cells. The early accumulation of <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells in the target tissues, which produce high levels of type 1 IFNs, seems to be important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues and their subsequent activation. IFN-α stimulates the production of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) by epithelial cells, DCs, and T cells. BAFF stimulates aberrant B-cell maturation, leading {{to the emergence of}} self-reactive B cells, which locally produce autoantibodies, in a germinal centre-like structure (GC-like), which is also the location of lymphomagenesis (origin of lymphoma).|$|E

50|$|Autoimmunity {{occurs when}} the body starts attacking itself. The link between {{atherosclerosis}} and autoimmunity is <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells (pDCs).

50|$|The myoepithelial cells may be spindled, <b>plasmacytoid,</b> eithelioid or clear. Tubules or {{epithelium}} are absent, {{or present}} in a small amount (<5%) by definition.

50|$|Hydroxychloroquine {{increases}} lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells. In inflammatory conditions, it blocks toll-like receptors on <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells (PDCs). Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9), which recognizes DNA-containing immune complexes, {{leads to}} the production of interferon and causes the dendritic cells to mature and present antigen to T cells. Hydroxychloroquine, by decreasing TLR signaling, reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process.|$|E
50|$|The PAX5 gene {{is located}} in {{chromosome}} 9p13 region, which is involved in t(9;14)(p13;q32) translocations recurring in small lymphocytic lymphomas of the <b>plasmacytoid</b> subtype, and in derived large-cell lymphomas. This translocation brings the potent E-mu enhancer of the IgH gene locus into close proximity of the PAX5 promoters, suggesting that the deregulation of PAX5 gene transcription contributes to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|Cross-presentation is {{a special}} case in which MHC-I {{molecules}} are able to present extracellular antigens, usually displayed only by MHC-II molecules. This ability appears in several APCs, mainly <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells in tissues that stimulate CD8+ T cells directly. This process is essential when APCs are not directly infected, triggering local antiviral and anti-tumor immune responses immediately without trafficking the APCs in the local lymph nodes.|$|E
50|$|For a time, WM was {{considered}} to be related to multiple myeloma {{because of the presence of}} monoclonal gammopathy and infiltration of the bone marrow and other organs by <b>plasmacytoid</b> lymphocytes.

In recent years, there have been significant advances in the understanding and treatment of WM.|$|E
5000|$|It mainly impacts myeloid {{cells and}} induces {{the release of}} T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes [...] and enhances the {{maturation}} of myeloid (CD11c+) dendritic cells. TSLP {{has also been shown}} to activate the maturation of a specific subset of dendritic cells located within the epidermis, called Langerhans cells. Within the thymus TSLP activation of both myeloid and <b>plasmacytoid</b> (CD123+) dendritic cells results in the production of regulatory T cells.|$|E
5000|$|Tetherin, {{also known}} as [...] bone marrow stromal antigen 2, is a lipid raft {{associated}} protein that in humans is encoded by the BST2 gene. In addition, tetherin has been designated as CD317 (cluster of differentiation 317).

5000|$|Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and blood, marrow, {{and skin}} {{involvement}} with dendritic-like blast and more mature appearing dendritic cells are characteristic findings. Such skin involvement usually presents as a violaceous papular rash. Bone marrow, lymph node and spleen enlargement from leukemic cell infiltration usually is present. Infrequently, other soft tissues and organ {{systems such as}} central nervous system, lung etc can be involved. A few cases of therapy related blastic <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) have also been reported.|$|E
5000|$|Like other DOCK-A and DOCK-B {{subfamily}} proteins Dock2 GEF {{activity is}} specific for Rac. Leukocytes express both Rac1 and Rac2 and Dock2 {{has been shown}} to bind and promote nucleotide exchange on both of these isoforms. Rac isoforms regulate a multitude of processes in leukocytes and studies so far have shown that Dock2-dependent Rac activation regulates the neutrophil NADPH oxidase and is also important for chemotaxis in neutrophils, lymphocytes and <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells. Dock2-dependent NADPH oxidase activation was reported in response to the soluble agonist fMLP, which acts via G protein-coupled receptors in neutrophils. Dock2-dependent chemotaxis has been reported in response to the chemokines CXCL12/SDF-1 in T lymphocytes, CXCL13/BLC in B lymphocytes and CCL19/ELC in thymocytes (immature lymphocytes) emigrating from the thymus as well as CCL21/SLC in ex vivo <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells. In neutrophil chemotaxis Dock2 signals downstream of the C5a and CXCL8/IL-8 receptors. Additional receptors which signal through Dock2 include the [...] T cell receptor/TCR and EDG1, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor. Interestingly, the HIV-1 protein Nef is able to constitutively activate Dock2 in T lymphocytes which disrups chemotaxis and immunological synapse formation thereby inhibiting the antiviral immune response.|$|E
50|$|Interleukin 26 (IL-26), is {{a natural}} human {{antimicrobial}} that promotes immune sensing of bacterial and host cell death. IL-26, a human TH17 cell-derived cytokine, is a cationic amphipathic protein that kills extracellular bacteria via membrane-pore formation. Furthermore, TH17 cell-derived IL-26 formed complexes with bacterial DNA and self-DNA released by dying bacteria and host cells. The IL-26-DNA complexes triggered the production of type I interferon by <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells via activation of Toll-like receptor 9, but independently of the IL-26 receptor.|$|E
50|$|IRF7 encodes {{interferon}} regulatory factor 7, {{a member}} of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) family. IRF7 has been shown {{to play a role in}} the transcriptional activation of virus-inducible cellular genes, including the type I interferon genes. In particular, IRF7 regulates many interferon-alpha genes. Constitutive expression of IRF7 is largely restricted to lymphoid tissue, largely <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells, whereas IRF7 is inducible in many tissues. Multiple IRF7 transcript variants have been identified, although the functional consequences of these have not yet been established.|$|E
5000|$|Hartmann´s group {{contributed to}} the {{understanding}} of several innate immune receptors. 1996 in the laboratory of Prof. Stefan Endres in Munich he made the unexpected observation that single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with certain chemical modifications activate human immune cells. [...] During his DFG-funded fellowship in the laboratory of Prof. Arthur Krieg in Iowa City (USA) in 1998/1999 he identified the molecular patterns that are responsible for immunorecognition of DNA (so-called CpG motifs detected via the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 9, TLR9). [...] Back in Munich he continued to work on the immunological activities of CpG oligonucleotides in the human system. He found that the direct recognition of CpG motifs via TLR9 is restricted to B cells and <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cells, the only two immune cell subsets in humans that express TLR9. Notably, CpG DNA was the first molecularly defined stimulus to activate the <b>plasmacytoid</b> dendritic cell, a cell type first described only in 1999. Based on the insight in the biological function he established different classes of CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-A, CpG-B and CpG-C). Together with Arthur Krieg he published the CpG oligonucleotide ODN 2006 which later was clinically developed by Coley Pharmaceuticals and is currently (2013) studied in phase III clinical trials as immune adjuvant in a novel type of cancer vaccine.|$|E
