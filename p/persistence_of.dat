It presents a set of mathematical tools to analyse the structure and to establish the stability of such modules, providing a sound mathematical framework for the study <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagrams. Completely self-contained, this brief introduces the notion <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> measure and makes extensive use of a new calculus of quiver representations to facilitate explicit computations. Appealing to both beginners and experts in the subject, The Structure and Stability <b>of</b> <b>Persistence</b> Modules provides a purely algebraic presentation <b>of</b> <b>persistence,</b> and thus complements the existing literature, which focuses mainly on topological and algorithmic aspects...|$|R

40|$|The {{computation}} <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> times <b>of</b> populations {{has become}} a central focus in conservation biology.

Thus, even though the population dynamics may be very complex for population sizes below the maximum, it is possible to write a finite set of equations from which the mean and second moment <b>of</b> the <b>persistence</b> time can be found by using simple, algebraic methods. We apply the method to compute the mean and coefficient <b>of</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> times <b>of</b> populations that suffer large decrements (catastrophes). Our results show that in the presence of catastrophes, the increase in mean persistence time with large populations is not nearly as rapid as other theories suggest and that catastrophes occurring at even modest rates can considerably increase the risk of extinction...|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Lorenzo {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited the coast of Africa on September11.

Initially, a Hurricane Hunters flight was scheduled to investigate the system, although the low became disorganized over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico due to high wind shear.

Methods: Based on Japanese claims data of 16, 214 patients between 2012 and 2014, 6 -, 12 -, and 18 -month <b>persistence</b> rates <b>of</b> different biologic agents were calculated. Determinants <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> were assessed by means of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model controlling for age, sex, and comorbidities. A sensitivity analysis was performed with different definitions <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> and parametric survival analysis. Results: Overall persistence rates in Japan are high and reach 86 % after 1 year in the entire sample. The persistence rate for the biologic-naïve subpopulation is above 95 %. Persistence is higher for older patients (hazard ratio 0. 60 [95 % confidence interval 0. 40 – 0. 91] for > 75 years compared to ≤ 60 years) and lower for patients with a high comorbidity score (hazard ratio 1. 33; 95 % confidence interval 1. 03 – 1. 70 for Charlson Comorbidity Index score 3 – 5 compared to ≤ 2). We found a high variation <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> between different drugs. Conclusion: Japanese rheumatoid arthritis patients have a high <b>persistence</b> rate <b>of</b> biologic treatments.

40|$|Topological {{persistence}} {{has proven}} to be a key concept for the study of real-valued functions defined over topological spaces. Its validity relies on the fundamental property that the <b>persistence</b> diagrams <b>of</b> nearby functions are close. However, existing stability results are restricted to the case of continuous functions defined over triangulable spaces. In this paper, we present new stability results that do not suffer from the above restrictions. Furthermore, by working at an algebraic level directly, we make it possible to compare the <b>persistence</b> diagrams <b>of</b> functions defined over different spaces, thus enabling a variety of new applications of the concept <b>of</b> <b>persistence.</b> Along the way, we extend the definition <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagram to a larger setting, introduce the notions of discretization <b>of</b> a <b>persistence</b> module and associated pixelization map, define a proximity measure between persistence modules, and show how to interpolate between persistence modules, thereby lending a more analytic character to this otherwise algebraic setting. We believe these new theoretical concepts and tools shed new light on the theory <b>of</b> <b>persistence,</b> in addition to simplifying proofs and enabling new applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} diagram is {{the fundamental}} object in topological data analysis. It inherits the stochastic variability of the data we use as input. As such {{we need to understand}} how to perform statistics on the space <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagrams. This paper looks at the space <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagrams under a variety of different metrics which are analogous to $L^p$ metrics on the space of functions. Using these metrics we can form different cost functions defining different central tendencies and their corresponding measures of variability. This gives us the natural definitions of both the mean and median of a finite number <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagrams. We give a characterization of the mean and the median of an odd number <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> diagrams.
