50|$|These {{crossovers}} are wired by hand, in Montreal, by {{skilled and}} experienced technicians. We prefer to mechanically crimp wires rather than solder components into place {{because it simply}} sounds better. Solder affects micro dynamics and clarity but for the times when we must use it we use WBT Silver Solder, regarded as the purest and cleanest in the industry. Crossovers {{are connected to the}} drivers with wire so it is as important as any other part creating the synergy. The wiring inside every single Totem speaker is unique and requires us to use roughly 40 different types. Each and every wire, inside each and every Totem network, feeding each and every Totem driver, has been painstakingly selected by Vince. While they are all different, all are 99.999% oxygen free silver <b>plated</b> <b>copper</b> and Teflon coated so they will never oxidize and keep the electron flow the same over the long life of the speaker. These ultra-high grade wires have also been chosen because the copper has been stretched slowly, allowing the molecular crystals to align themselves in a very cohesive fashion once the speaker has had a proper break in time.|$|E

From {{the analysis of the}} stress-strain relation of the copper-plated tape at 77 K, it was shown that the copper plated at room temperature is yielded in tension at 77 K due to the higher coefficient of the thermal expansion of copper than that of the substrate tape. The <b>plated</b> <b>copper</b> gave compressive strain to the substrate tape and, hence, the superconducting layer at 77 K, due to which the strain tolerance of critical current was improved. The observed improvement of the strain tolerance with increasing volume fraction of <b>plated</b> <b>copper</b> was quantitatively described from the viewpoint of the stress balance at 77 K between the substrate tape and yielded copper. The tolerant strain increased, but the tolerant stress decreased with increasing copper volume fraction.
