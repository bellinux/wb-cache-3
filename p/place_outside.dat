5|$|On August 25, 2012, Mangold {{said that}} {{production}} moved to Tokyo and began shooting. On September 4, 2012, filming took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> Fukuyama Station in Fukuyama, Hiroshima. Filming in Tomonoura, a port in the Ichichi ward of Fukuyama, concluded on September 11, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the inquest to include events that took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the province of Ontario. Presiding Coroner Dr. Carlisle dismissed this motion {{at the same time as}} that of the Correctional Service of Canada motion, but subsequently granted the out-of-province doctors standing at the inquest when they agreed to testify voluntarily at the inquest proceedings.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events in Perl 5 history took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> of the language proper and was a consequence of its module support. On October 26, 1995, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) was established as a repository for Perl modules and Perl itself; as of May 2017, it carries over 185,178 modules in 35,190 distributions, written by more than 13,071 authors, and is mirrored worldwide at more than 245 locations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} of basal metasuchians {{has experienced}} many revisions in recent years. The phylogeny of notosuchians {{has been particularly}} revised, {{with the construction of}} Sebecia by Larsson and Sues (2007) to include peirosaurids in the clade. Previously, peirosaurids were <b>placed</b> <b>outside</b> of Notosuchia. Larsson and Sues (2007) also suggested that Sebecosuchia (containing the families Baurusuchidae and Sebecidae) was polyphyletic, as Baurusuchus was <b>placed</b> <b>outside</b> Sebecia, which itself was <b>placed</b> <b>outside</b> Notosuchia. However, more recent phylogenetic studies have placed Baurusuchus within Notosuchia once again, although it is still not considered to be a sebecosuchian.|$|R

5|$|SummerSlam (1992) was {{the fifth}} annual SummerSlam {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on Saturday August 29, 1992, at Wembley Stadium, London, England, but didn't air on pay-per-view until Monday August 31. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers. To date {{it is the only}} major WWF pay-per-view to take <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> North America.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the start of}} the second-half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick. Kujabi fouled Suso by pulling his jersey and catching his heel, but television replays showed that the foul had taken <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the penalty area. Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card, resulting in a red. Danny Grainger converted the penalty, which was also his first goal for Hearts. Soon afterwards, Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott. Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

5|$|As of June 23, 2013, the United States Office of Special Counsel is {{investigating}} reports that two schedulers at the Ft. Collins facility were reassigned to Wyoming after {{they refused to}} comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times. The VA Office of Medical Inspector has substantiated a report that punitive action was taken against employees who scheduled appointments {{in a way that}} honestly showed that appointments would take <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> of the 14-day window, and the OMI also substantiated reports of other problems at the facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the episode}} was broadcast, it was {{announced}} that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series after playing Adam Carter for four years, while afterwards, another announcement was made introducing a new lead character, Lucas North. Inspiration towards the plot for the episode, and the remainder of the series, came from the resurgence of Russia, which the producers felt would in subtle ways threaten the security of the West. The episode was partially filmed on location in Moscow, the first time in series history where filming took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Dave Skylark is {{the host}} of the talk show Skylark Tonight, where he {{interviews}} celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, the show's producer Aaron Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.|$|E

5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
5|$|Over 97% of {{all known}} fish are oviparous, that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, cichlids, tuna, and eels. In the {{majority}} of these species, fertilisation takes <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the horn shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out by Louis Salzmann between 1906 and 1908, concentrating on the north-west sector of the Roman fort, the east gate and the north postern. Harry Sands undertook the clearing of debris around the medieval castle keep in 1906 and more extensive excavations in 1910. Further clearing work took place {{under the supervision of}} the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation in the area of the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat of debris the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 that limited exploration by Stuart Rigold took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993–95, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations in the area of the keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.|$|E
5|$|Hausser {{intended}} {{that the}} 9th SS Panzer Division, with Kampfgruppe Weidinger protecting its left flank, to {{cut across the}} British salient north of the Odon, while the 10th SS Panzer Division retook Gavrus and Hill 112 south of the river. The 9th SS Panzer attack began at 1400, heavily supported by artillery. The 19th and 20th SS Panzergrenadier Regiments supported by Panthers, Panzer IV's and assault guns attacked Grainville, le Haut du Bosq and le Valtru, aiming for Cheux. A British company was overrun and tanks and infantry penetrated le Valtru, where anti-tank guns knocked out four German tanks {{in the village and}} artillery fire forced their supporting infantry to withdraw. Confused fighting, at times hand-to-hand, took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> Grainville and the Panzergrenadiers captured a tactically important wood, before being forced back by a British counter-attack. The Panzergrenadiers claimed they also captured Grainville but no British sources support this and by nightfall British infantry were in control of the village.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies {{and set them}} on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E

5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The event spent {{its early}} years at one venue: Cirkus in Stockholm, which hosted the first ten competitions. It has hosted the final of Melodifestivalen {{seventeen}} times in total. The Stockholm Globe Arena has hosted seven finals, and SVT's headquarters in Stockholm has staged five. The competition first took <b>place</b> <b>outside</b> Stockholm in 1975 {{as part of a}} decentralisation policy at SR. Stockholm has hosted thirty-seven finals in total, including the first fourteen. Gothenburg has hosted eight, and Malmö seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest {{in the event of a}} Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg, and the 1992 contest in Malmö. Since 2002, the only venue that has hosted more than three semifinals is Gothenburg's Scandinavium, which has hosted one every year since 2003. In 2008, Andra Chansen was held in Kiruna, north of the Arctic Circle. The finals have since 2013 been hosted in Friends Arena.|$|E
5|$|The film grossed an {{estimated}} $4.7million {{on the first}} day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3million over the weekend, finishing in third <b>place.</b> <b>Outside</b> North America it earned $35.2million finishing second, and improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9million. China has proven to be its most successful territory where it earned $11.6million on its opening day, going on to earn a record-breaking $67million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run. The reissue ultimately earned $343.4million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8million from Canada and United States.|$|E
