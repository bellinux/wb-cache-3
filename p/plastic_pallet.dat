50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> {{are often}} made of new HDPE or {{recycled}} PET (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting {{for a hundred}} trips or more, and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion. The benefits of <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> over wood pallets include {{the ability to be}} easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly.They often stack. <b>Plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping. HDPE is impervious to most acids and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily. Some <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> can collapse from plastic creep if used to store heavy loads for long periods. <b>Plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood, so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and stackability. The large supply chains have increased the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport and health & safety. Pallets and dolly combined for example the Pally eliminate pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment, but also create valuable space in busy operating environments and deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics' reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets.</b>|$|R

Most of the pallet in circulation are made up of wood, however the market share of <b>plastic</b> <b>pallet</b> is also increasing rapidly. In India, the pallet industry in valued at approximately Euro 858. 3 Million, with wood pallets dominating the market. However, with wood resources dwindling in India, timber imports are increasing and plastic being a non-environmental friendly resource, it is crucial to find an alternative solution to such a problem. This research work gives a detail description of developing a wood-plastic composite pallets for Indian market. The report aims to determine the current status of the Indian Pallet market and how a foreign firm can establish its unit of operation in India to produce wood-plastic composite pallets. The main feature of this research is the usage of waste material as raw material to produce composite pallet. Also, the research aims to identify the profitability of the investment if a foreign firm decides to invest in India and starts its production operation. The design and analysis is done of two size of pallets 600 x 400 mm and 800 x 600 mm. The design and analysis results determine the load capacity of the pallet which {{is similar to that of}} wooden pallets. The economic evaluation of the initial investment of Euro 1 Million shows return of investment at 110. 51 % for 600 x 400 mm pallet and 48. 36 % for 800 x 600 mm pallet.

5000|$|A pallet {{inverter}} or {{pile turner}} is {{a machine that}} is used to turn over pallets whilst still loaded with products. The reasons for needing to turn over a pallet are varied, but one main reason is the need to replace a broken or inappropriate pallet without unstacking the whole load. Sometimes a manufacturer simply needs to turn their products to stop their contents settling. In some industries, it is necessary to transfer goods from one type of pallet to another [...] - [...] for example, when <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> are used for on-site storage and wooden pallets are used for shipping.

40|$|Problem – Companies {{and supply}} chains, {{such as those}} in the grocery industry, {{continuously}} face stricter requirements in the form of customer satisfaction, quality, profit margins, as well as information sharing in order to stay competitive. One specific technology that may be used in dealing with increasing competitive demands is the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. A wide body of research recognizes the positive impacts from RFID, yet even so, doubts and uncertainty have been present among different supply chain members in industries striving to put the RFID technology to use. Nevertheless, many actors in the Norwegian grocery industry are replacing traditional wood <b>pallets</b> with <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets,</b> and these pallets are integrated with RFID tags. Purpose – The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets</b> with integrated RFID tags can contribute to improve supply chain efficiency in the grocery industry. Also, the managerial perception on the pallets and their accompanying technology will be compared to the existing literature, to identify if the managerial opinion supports the literature, and if not, where the gaps exist. Method – The thesis combines an exploratory and an explanatory qualitative study of the managerial perception of RFID pallets in the Norwegian grocery industry, and investigates whether the perception supports the literature. The empirical material is gathered through telephone interviews with logistics and warehouse managers in the various companies. Conclusions – Physical implications: The managerial perceptions’ support towards the addressed implications of the reviewed literature is mixed. RFID pallets improve automatic operation processes through reduction in downtime and eases physical handling of pallets. Additionally, sorting of pallets becomes less labor demanding. Regarding holding of goods, the managerial perceptions do not seem to view RFID pallets as an important factor for efficiency improvement. Information related/RFID aspects’ implications: The managerial perceptions in these concerns were based on plans and thoughts, since the technology had not been put to use. There is a difference in producers’ and wholesalers’ perception of whether efficiency in receiving of goods can be improved through utilizing RFID pallets. Concerning dispatching of shipments, the managerial perceptions support the literature in that information-related activities can be automated, and thus improve efficiency and reduce risk of human errors. In regards to information sharing, the managerial perception supports the literature, but highlights that the information’s nature determines whether sharing is considered. Further research could include the retail store level to get a more complete supply chain picture, and also apply the research methods to a larger area in order to investigate the transferability to other industries and countries...|$|R

The general results of the survey showed that a protozoan community of amoebae, ciliates, and flagellates was present in all of the plants. Protozoa were detected mainly in floor drains, in standing water on the floor, on soiled bars of cutting tables, on <b>plastic</b> <b>pallets,</b> and in out-of-use hot water knife sanitizers, but they were also detected on surfaces which come into direct contact with meat, such as conveyer belts, working surfaces of cutting tables, and needles of a meat tenderizer.

Based on microscopic observations, 61 morphospecies were found, and Bodo saltans, Bodo spp., Epistylis spp., Glaucoma scintillans, Petalomonas spp., Prodiscophrya collini, and Vannella sp. were the most frequently encountered identified organisms. Sequencing of DGGE bands resulted in identification of a total of 49 phylotypes, including representatives of the Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, Excavata, Opisthokonta, and Rhizaria. Sequences of small heterotrophic flagellates were affiliated mainly with the Alveolata (Apicomplexa), Stramenopiles (Chrysophyceae), and Rhizaria (Cercozoa).
