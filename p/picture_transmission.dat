5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

HRPT transmissions are available {{around the world}} and are available from both polar and geostationary weather satellites. The polar satellites rotate in orbits that allow each location on earth to be covered by the weather satellite twice per day while the geostationary satellites remain in one location at the equator taking weather images of the earth from that location over the equator. The sensor on weather satellites that picks up HRPT is referred to as an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).|$|R

25|$|A literal {{term for}} SSTV is {{narrowband}} television. Analog broadcast television requires at least 6MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture {{frames per second}} (in the NTSC, PAL or SECAM color systems), but SSTV usually only takes up {{to a maximum of}} 3kHz of bandwidth. It is a much slower method of still <b>picture</b> <b>transmission,</b> usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit one image frame.|$|E

With {{the addition of the}} new Digital <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> system (DPT), a single ship carrying Type 984 and CDS could pass off information to any ship with an output display and the DPT radio equipment. This allowed destroyers to get their initial cueing from the 984 while being positioned some distance away, which was important given the fairly short range of Seaslug. When the cruiser design was canceled, this need became more pressing. Pye Ltd. was given the production contract.|$|E

50|$|John Logie Baird, the {{television}} pioneer, leased the former stables and coach house at Kingsbury Manor in 1928. He employed H. Barton-Chapple {{to take charge}} of his experiments there, which included designing and building prototype TV receivers. In May 1929, two 25-metre high masts were erected, and the first international moving <b>picture</b> <b>transmissions,</b> from Berlin in Germany to England, were received here. The following year, the first combined sound and vision signals were received. For many years afterwards the former stables were known as Kingsbury Manor Studio, and are now the home of Kingsbury Veterans' Club. The masts were taken down {{at the start of the}} Second World War, as they would have been a landmark for German bombers, but the concrete base of one of the masts can still be seen in Roe Green Park. A plaque to commemorate Baird's work here was unveiled next to this by Wembley History Society in the 1950s, which was moved to the Veterans' Club after damage by vandals.|$|R

Genome {{sequencing}} is revolutionizing clinical microbiology and {{our understanding of}} infectious diseases. Previous studies have largely relied on the sequencing of a single isolate from each individual. However, {{it is not clear}} what degree of bacterial diversity exists within, and is transmitted between individuals. Understanding this 'cloud of diversity' is key to accurate identification of transmission pathways. Here, we report the deep sequencing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among staff and animal patients involved in a transmission network at a veterinary hospital. We demonstrate considerable within-host diversity and that within-host diversity may rise and fall over time. Isolates from invasive disease contained multiple mutations in the same genes, including inactivation of a global regulator of virulence and changes in phage copy number. This study highlights the need for sequencing of multiple isolates from individuals to gain an accurate <b>picture</b> of <b>transmission</b> networks and to further understand the basis of pathogenesis.
