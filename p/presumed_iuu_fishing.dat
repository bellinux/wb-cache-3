By undermining effective management systems, <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> activities not only generate harmful effects on economic and social welfare, but also reduce the incentives to comply with rules. The issue of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> has recently attracted increasing attention.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} one of {{the contemporary}} problems facing the sustainability of world 2 ̆ 7 s fisheries [...] -illegal, unreported and unregulated (<b>IUU)</b> <b>fishing.</b> As a result of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing,</b> {{it is estimated that}} Indonesia loses revenue in excess of US 4 billion annually. The Indonesian Government has identified <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> as a priority policy issue to be addressed. A number laws, regulations and measures have been adopted by the Indonesian Government to address <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> concerns. The thesis examines how Indonesia addresses the problem of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> and how it implements international fisheries instruments. The discussion commences by providing a brief overview of the key binding and non-binding international instruments and an examination of the national legal framework to address <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> Despite the enactment of fisheries laws and regulations, there is still a gap between international fisheries instruments and Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s domestic implementation of such instruments. One of the critical gaps in the effective implementation of its international fisheries obligations to combat <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> is the failure of Indonesia to participate as a full member in existing regional fisheries management organizations. The continuous <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> activities by Indonesian-flagged vessels in areas under the competence of RFMOs also indicates the failure of Indonesia to regulate the activities of its vessels on the high seas. The thesis also demonstrates the major challenge being faced by Indonesia with respect to its institutional framework to deal with the problems of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s institutional framework is characterized by multiple institutions at the national and provincial levels, lack of coordination in fisheries-related functions, and conflicts in jurisdiction. The thesis concludes that the national legal and institutional framework is inadequate to combat <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> and that such framework needs to be improved and made consistent with international fisheries instruments in order to ensure long-term conservation and management of fisheries resources...|$|R
40|$|Illegal, unreported, and {{unregulated}} (<b>IUU)</b> <b>fishing</b> is {{a global}} fishing concern considered {{as one of the}} obstacles in achieving sustainable fisheries. In the Philippines, <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> is known to undermine national efforts related to the conservation and management of fisheries resources. International fisheries instruments, particularly the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU), recognises the increasing concern on <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> and calls on States to adopt measures that would effectively address the problem. This thesis examines the adequacy of the Philippine legal, policy, and institutional framework to combat <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> It analyses the definition of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> provided under the IPOA-IUU and assesses how such definition applies within the Philippine context. The measures adopted in international fisheries instruments to address the problem are also examined. From the analysis, three sets of criteria are formulated to measure the adequacy of the Philippine framework to combat <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> The first set of criteria involve the application of flag and coastal State measures; the second relate to the application of port and market-related measures; while the third entail the adoption of “all State” responsibilities. It is concluded that by failing to satisfy most of the criteria established under international fisheries instruments, the Philippines renders its legal, policy, and institutional framework inadequate to address <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> The major areas of inadequacy relate to the Philippine definition of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing,</b> the measures adopted by the State to address the problem, and the corresponding institutional framework for fisheries management. The thesis also provides specific options for legislative and policy reforms that would address the gaps in the current national framework in order to effectively prevent, deter, and eliminate <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Philippines...|$|R

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (<b>IUU)</b> <b>fishing</b> {{is a product of}} overfishing and affects all marine fisheries. Southern Ocean fisheries have been particularly targeted by <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> The efforts of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Commission and the Australian government to adopt complementary measures to deter <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Southern Ocean form the basis of this study, although the examination is conducted following a comprehensive review of the legal and other factors contributing to the development of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> as well as the applicable international law. The author concludes that in the absence of flag State control, alternative measures and strategies have proved to be effective in influencing the behaviour of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels. By improving coastal State surveillance, enhancing regional cooperation, imposing port and market State controls, establishing IUU vessel databases and vigorously prosecuting offenders, Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and coastal States can jointly increase the risk of conducting <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> activities. At the same time financial returns can be diminished so that engaging in <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> becomes economically unattractive.

40|$|Background: Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (<b>IUU)</b> <b>fishing</b> is {{a problem}} for marine {{resource}} managers, leading to depletion of fish stocks and negative impacts on marine ecosystems. These problems are particularly evident in regions with weak governance. Countries responsible for sustainable natural resource management in the Southern Ocean have actively worked to reduce <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> in the region over a period of 15 years, leading to a sequence of three distinct peaks of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed existing public records relating to <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Southern Ocean between 1995 – 2009 and related this information to the governance capacity of flag states responsible for IUU vessels. IUU operators used a number of methods to adapt to enforcement actions, resulting in reduced risks of detection, apprehension and sanctioning. They changed fishing locations, vessel names and flag states, and ports for offloading IUU catches. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of IUU vessels flagged to CCAMLR countries, and a significant decrease in the average governance index of flag states. Despite a decreasing trend of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing,</b> further actions are hampered by the regional scope of CCAMLR and the governance capacity of responsible states. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study of long-term change in the modus operandi of <b>IUU</b> <b>fishing</b> operators, illustrating that IUU operators can adapt to enforcement actions and that such dynamics may lead to new problems elsewhere, where countries have a limited capacity.
