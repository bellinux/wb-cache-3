5000|$|In {{following}} a modern recipe that specifies [...] "brown sugar", one usually may {{assume that the}} intended meaning is <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> but which one prefers is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the moisture content might be critical, {{the amount of water}} involved is too small to matter. More importantly, adding dark <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> or molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel.|$|R
5000|$|The Codex Alimentarius {{requires}} <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{to contain}} at least 88% of sucrose plus invert <b>sugar.</b> Commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> contains from 4.5% molasses (<b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar)</b> to 6.5% molasses (dark <b>brown</b> <b>sugar)</b> based on total volume. Based on total weight, regular commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> contains up to 10% molasses. The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic {{nature of the}} molasses and is often labelled as [...] "soft." [...] The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.|$|R
50|$|Kinetic Sand is a {{three-dimensional}} building toy made of 98% sand and 2% polydimethylsiloxane (a type of silicone oil) that mimics the physical properties of wet sand. Kinetic Sand was originally designed for sculpting but is commonly sold as indoor play sand for children. In appearance it resembles <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> It can be molded, it sticks to itself {{but not to}} most other materials or surfaces, {{and it does not}} dry out.|$|R
50|$|A gypsy tart {{is a type}} of tart {{made with}} {{evaporated}} milk, muscovado sugar (though some varieties include <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar),</b> and pastry. It originates from the County of Kent in England, and most specifically East Kent. The tart is extremely sweet and is, for many people, associated with school dinners. Although most will know the version of gypsy tart made with evaporated milk, it can also be made with condensed milk in place of evaporated milk. This makes a firmer and even sweeter tart, with a darker colour.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, an {{accident}} in October 1866 damaged the machinery and a boiler, which delayed crushing until February 1867. The late crush produced low sugar content {{and a very}} dark sugar. The enterprise experienced difficulties due to the small scale of the refinery, primitive equipment and inexperience. Although by September 1867 a fine <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> was being produced, {{the problems of the}} business were compounded by an explosion and by a labour shortage caused by the discovery of gold at Gympie. In October the mill was operating night and day, but by November, it had closed due to financial problems.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, {{the more}} popularly known drink is simply Rum and Coke or [...] "Rumbo", which {{contains}} no lime, commonly uses a local dark rum {{and can be}} purchased in cans as a ready-to-drink. However, the combination of <b>light</b> rum, <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> and cola is commonly ordered at cocktail bars as a Cuba Libre.|$|R
60|$|This alone {{might well}} astonish {{the eyes of}} {{children}} from the outside world, but it {{was by no means}} all that Twinkle and Chubbins beheld in that first curious look at Sugar-Loaf City. For the city was inhabited by many people--men, women and children--who walked along the streets just as briskly as we do; only all were made of sugar. There were several different kinds of these sugar people. Some, who strutted proudly along, were evidently of pure loaf-sugar, and these were of a most respectable appearance. Others seemed to be made of a <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> and were more humble in their manners and seemed to hurry along as if they had business to attend to. Then there were some of sugar so dark in color that Twinkle suspected it was maple-sugar, and these folks seemed of less account than any of the others, being servants, drivers of carriages, and beggars and idlers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two main}} {{processing}} techniques for salmon jerky are wet-brining and dry salting. In {{both cases the}} salmon is trimmed into narrow slices and then stored cold for less than one day. After being skinned and frozen, if the fish is to undergo the brining method it will require an additional step in which the salmon is left soaking in wet brine (salt solution) for one hour. It is then removed and the excess water is discarded. After this, in both the wet-brining and dry salting method, ingredients such as non-iodized salt, potato starch, or <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> are added. [...] In some smoked salmon jerky products preservatives may also be added to extend the shelf life of the final product. The salmon is then minced with the additives and reformed into thin strips that will be smoked for twenty hours. Between the brining and salting methods for smoked salmon jerky the brining method {{has been found to}} leave the salmon more tender with up to double the moisture content of salted jerky. The salmon jerky that undergoes the dry salting method has a tougher texture due to the lower moisture content and water activity. Both forms of salmon jerky still have a much lower moisture content than is found in raw salmon.|$|R
50|$|While the Hunza {{bread is}} {{agreed to be}} cost-effective, it is also argued to be low in calories. It is {{prepared}} by adding two cups of flour, one cup of wheat flour, one quarter cup of wheat germ, one pack of active dry yeast, one quarter <b>pack</b> of <b>light</b> or dark <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> one teaspoon of organic honey, one teaspoon of salt in addition to one quarter teaspoon of ground ginger as well as half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Three quarters of optional dried fruit must be added followed by {{one and a half}} cup of water. Two tablespoons of butter are also recommended.|$|R
5000|$|Speculaas dough {{does not}} rise much. Dutch and Belgian {{versions}} are baked with <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> (sometimes beet) <b>sugar</b> and baking powder. German [...] uses baker's ammonia as leavening agent. Indian, Indonesian, and Mediterranean spices used in speculaas are cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cardamom and white pepper; these were {{common in the}} 1600-1700s due to the Dutch East Indies spice trade. Family recipes may also include other small amounts of spices like anise, etc. Traditionally, speculaas were made from Frisian flour and spices. The name speculoos was coined for Belgian wheat flour cookies with hardly any spices. Today most speculaas versions are made from white (wheat) flour, <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> butter and spices. Some varieties use some almond flour and have slivered almonds embedded in the bottom.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, the newly {{consolidated}} refined white sugar industry, {{which did not}} have full control over <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> production, mounted a smear campaign against <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by [...] "a minute insect."

5000|$|Although <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{has been}} touted as having health {{benefits}} ranging from soothing menstrual cramps to {{serving as an}} anti-aging skin treatment, there is no nutritional basis to support <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> as a healthier alternative to refined sugars despite the negligible amounts of minerals in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> not found in white sugar.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> is a sucrose {{sugar product}} with a {{distinctive}} brown color {{due to the}} presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content (natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar),</b> or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white <b>sugar</b> (commercial <b>brown</b> <b>sugar).</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> comes {{either from}} the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine {{crystals}} with significant molasses content, or from coating white refined sugar with a cane molasses syrup (blackstrap molasses). <b>Brown</b> <b>sugar's</b> color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugars</b> also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.|$|R
5000|$|Pet de sœur (French: [...] "(religious) sisters' fart"), euphemistically {{translated}} nun's pastries or <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> rolls, are French-Canadian pastry cakes {{covered with}} butter and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> which are rolled, sliced and then baked. They are often served during the Christmas season. A variation uses molasses instead of <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> or caramel sauce or maple syrup can also be substituted. A tart can also be made with pets de sœurs.|$|R
50|$|Natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{raw sugar}} or whole cane sugar are sugars that retain a small to {{large amount of}} the {{molasses}} from the mother liquor (the partially evaporated sugar cane juice). Based upon weight, <b>brown</b> cane <b>sugar</b> when fully refined yields up to 70% white sugar, the degree {{depending on how much}} molasses remained in the sugar crystals, which in turn is dependent upon whether the <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> was centrifuged or not. As there is more molasses in natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> it contains minor nutritional value and mineral content. Some natural <b>brown</b> <b>sugars</b> have particular names and characteristics, and are sold as turbinado, demerara or raw sugar if they have been centrifuged to a large degree. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugars</b> that have been only mildly centrifuged or unrefined (non-centrifuged) retain a much higher degree of molasses and are called various names across the globe according to their country of origin: e.g. panela, rapadura, jaggery, muscovado, piloncillo, etc.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{is often}} {{produced}} by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control {{the ratio of}} molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. <b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>sugar</b> {{that has}} {{hardened}} {{can be made}} soft again by adding {{a new source of}} moisture for the molasses, or by heating and remelting the molasses. Storing <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> in a freezer will prevent moisture from escaping and molasses from crystallizing, allowing for a much longer shelf life.|$|R
40|$|Jaggery {{and other}} sugars namely white, refined and <b>brown</b> <b>sugars</b> were {{evaluated}} for cytoprotectivity on NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and erythrocytes, DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power and DNA protection. In addition, total phenol content and phenolic acid composition were also determined. Results indicated a total phenolic content of 26. 5, 31. 5, 372 and 3837 mu g GAE/g for refined, white, brown and jaggery, respectively. The HPLC analysis revealed {{the presence of}} different phenolic acids in <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> and jaggery. On NIH 3 T 3 cells oxidation, at 4 mg/ml concentration, jaggery showed 97 % protection compared to <b>brown</b> <b>sugar,</b> and both Sugars effectively reduced erythrocyte oxidation. A dose dependent reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity was also observed for jaggery and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> An EC(50) of 7. 81 and 59. 38 mu g/ml were observed for jaggery and <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> in the DPPH scavenging assay. In DNA oxidation studies, higher protection was observed in jaggery followed by brown, white and refined sugar treated samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
