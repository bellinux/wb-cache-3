5|$|One of Bach's {{predecessors}} {{as director}} musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat. The portfolio of <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> of this composition was updated until well into Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleine Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as spurious in the BWV catalogue (BWVAnh.21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases {{the text of the}} Magnificat canticle, also seems rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to whom this work used to be attributed.|$|E

25|$|As well, the Nissan 240Z was {{introduced}} {{at a relatively}} low price compared to other foreign sports cars of the time (Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, etc.), while providing performance, reliability, and good looks.

30|$|Distributed Transactions [28]: They {{are used}} in the <b>performance</b> <b>part</b> of a rule. A {{transaction}} allows to group as one operation the verification of conditions (rd), the realisation of actions (put), and the update of the system logical state (get, put). Thus, the <b>performance</b> <b>part</b> of a rule may abort if, for instance, the verification of a condition through a rd operation is no longer true. The <b>performance</b> <b>part</b> also aborts if a put operation fails because the corresponding action (e.g., switch on a lamp) cannot be performed (e.g., due to a communication error or a hardware failure).|$|R

25|$|To {{deal with}} the {{enormous}} amount of mail he was receiving, in 1946 Edelbrock created the company's first catalog, Edelbrock Power and Speed Equipment, {{with the help of}} Pete Petersen. This hastened the transformation of the Edelbrock company from a repair garage into a <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> manufacturer. Then, in 1947, Edelbrock produced the first cylinder heads for the Ford flathead.|$|E
25|$|The {{main bearing}} web area was thicker in the 390, 401 and SR blocks, thick enough that two {{additional}} bearing cap bolt holes could be {{drilled and tapped}} for an aftermarket four bolt main cap, providing a stronger bottom end. AMC never built a factory four bolt main block, they sold aftermarket four bolt main caps through their Group 19 <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> program.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, one {{variant of}} SPI uses single {{bidirectional}} data line (slave out/slave in, called SISO) {{instead of two}} unidirectional ones (MOSI and MISO). This variant is restricted to a half duplex mode. It tends {{to be used for}} lower <b>performance</b> <b>parts,</b> such as small EEPROMs used only during system startup and certain sensors, and Microwire. Few SPI master controllers support this mode; although it can often be easily bit-banged in software.|$|E

25|$|For 1968, {{the team}} had {{consistently}} improved and suffered only one DNF (did not finish) from an engine problem. The race program was supporting a company that had no <b>performance</b> <b>parts,</b> no test facility, and no technical support for the program. As for the production cars, they had no anti-dive potential built into the uni-body; only single-barrel carburetor manifolds; and even when running properly, they didn’t make as much horsepower as the competitors. The 1968 deal provided Jeffords and Kaplan support from Carl Chakmakian, who was the primary contact on the AMC program.|$|E
25|$|The PT Cruiser GT (also {{known as}} the GT Cruiser) is a high output {{turbocharged}} hot hatch variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. Much like the Dodge Neon SRT-4 sedan, the PT Cruiser GT uses the same 2.4L turbocharged I4 engine. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT with improved cooling, oiling, an aluminum cylinder block with steel sleeves, and forged internals. The PT Cruiser GT is much {{more powerful than the}} standard model and has the potential to make significantly more power with available and relatively simple performance upgrades. Upgrades such as MOPAR Stage 1 and supporting turbo components are common. Most <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> from the Dodge Neon SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.|$|E

25|$|The City Turbo was {{the brainchild}} of Hirotoshi Honda, son of Honda founder Soichiro Honda as well as founder and owner of Mugen. In the early 1980s Mugen was a small tuning company that was {{beginning}} to make its mark producing <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> for motorcycles and automobiles, but was yet to gain recognition outside of racing circles. When he created the City Turbo, Hirotoshi took one of Honda's most unassuming vehicles and successfully turned it into an aggressive street rocket, considered to be well ahead of its time. Impressed, Honda took Hirotoshi's idea and made a production version, introduced in September 1982. A few months earlier, Honda staffers took two City Turbos on a gruelling 10,000km round trip of Europe, all the way from Sicily to Karasjok in the arctic north.|$|E
25|$|The GT variant {{kept the}} twin driving lights, but reverted to a bonnet {{blackout}} with no stripes {{at all on}} the vehicle. The front guards received fake 'vents' just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. These GTs are generally referred to as RPO83s after the option code covering the additional parts, although what parts any given RPO83 received seem to have been governed by the luck of the draw rather than any specific process.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Watt's linkage rear suspension came first. This {{was followed by the}} front anti-dive modifications. The {{development of}} the anti-dive geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC’s schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang’s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> for Ford.|$|E

[...] Holley introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford {{offered in the}} 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats.

500|$|The first {{occasion}} {{after the}} mourning period that re-allowed concerted church music was {{the feast of}} Visitation, Thursday [...] It is possible that Bach produced his {{new version of the}} Magnificat for this occasion, although Christmas of the same year as first performance date for the new version is possible too: it can not be determined with certainty on which day around 1732–1735 the Dmajor version of the Magnificat was first performed, and until when Bach amended the score to its final state. Around 1733 Bach filed two cantatas by Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel, for the fifth and the sixth Sunday after Trinity (5 and 12 July in 1733): Bach may have relied on church music by other composers for the services in Leipzig in July 1733, while composing and copying out the <b>performance</b> <b>parts</b> of the extensive first part of the Mass in Bminor.|$|E

50|$|In {{reciprocal}} contracts, a creditor has {{the right}} to receive full and complete performance. There must be strict compliance, in other words: 100 per cent performance.
