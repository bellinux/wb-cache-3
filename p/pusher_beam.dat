Subnatural polarization rotation introduces by a strong circularly polarized light {{in the absence of any}} external magnetic field was also studied. A detailed theoretical treatment, given in this dissertation, allows to associate each of the features of the spectra with a special physical mechanism. Many quantum phenomena related to interferences, coherences, optical pumping etc. experiments are studied using home-built diode lasers. This thesis also describes laser cooling and trapping of rubidium atoms using two techniques. Deﬂection of cold atoms horizontally from MOT using <b>pushing</b> <b>beams</b> are discussed in close consideration for the improvements in the precision measurements. This thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, an introduction to the importance of sub-natural narrow resonance and simplified technique in the precision measurement will be discussed. In Chapter 2, an introduction to EIT, EIA and NMOR resonance are discussed. This chapter will provide a basic theoretical background of atom-field interactions, especially for Λ-type and N -type systems and its steady state solution using density matrix analysis and experimental tools. The most important notion of laser cooling of atoms, ions or molecule i. e., exchange of momentum between light and atoms combining with the Doppler effect will be discussed. In Chapter 3, the observation of subnatural EIT and subnatural EIA in closed and open degenerate two-level system using room temperature vapor cell filled with Rb will be presented. Physical mechanisms that contribute to EIT and EIA, and the contrast of our results from the coherent population trapping (CPT) –type resonances are discussed in detail in appendix A. 2 according to our experimental results. In Chapter 4, the narrowing of subnatural EIT and subnatural EIA linewidth in closed and open systems again in degenerate two level transition, using the “Laguerre-Gaussian” control beam instead of generally studied Gaussian beam, will be discussed in detail. In Chapter 5, the conversion between subnatural EIT to subnatural EIA in a degenerate Λ system will be discussed. The physical mechanism created by the introduction of a coherent counter propagating control laser to the co-propagating probe and the control laser are studied. The effect of polarization and axial velocity Doppler averaging will also be studied. In Chapter 6, we will discuss the sensitive technique for precise measurement of small magnetic fields using the NMOR, by chopping the resonant laser beam. We will study the sensitivity and the potential application of this technique in the measurement of an atomic electric-dipole moment. In Chapter 7, we will be studying about the induced optical rotation by a circularly polarized control laser on the linearly polarized probe laser. The effect of the intensity of the control laser beam on the higher order optical rotation will also be studied.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} of this study. First, the agar-gelatin samples prepared from the same solution may have small variations in stiffness across different samples. Large samples cure slower than smaller samples, possibly leading to different final stiffness. Therefore, the assumption that all samples had the same material properties may not necessary be true. This may also explain the discrepancy between experimental results and FEM/empirical-formula predictions. Second, the frequency of shear waves used in the experiments by the Aixplorer scanner was unknown to us, and was obtained by fitting FEM to experimental results. Future studies should investigate if the shear wave center frequency would change for SWE measurements using machines from different vendors. As a first order correction, one can still use the empirical formula and shear wave frequency of this study to provide a corrected measurement that {{is closer to the}} “true” answer. Third, the FEM simulation using a line load with four cycle of sinusoidal wave may be somewhat different from the ultrasound <b>push</b> <b>beam</b> used in Aixplorer to generate shear waves. This approximation may cause small discrepancy between FEM and SWE experimental results seen in the study. Fourth, the stiffness of samples used in this study were only calibrated with ultrasound shear wave elastography. An independent validation using mechanical testing would have strengthened the paper. Last, simulations and experiments were performed for samples surrounded by liquid. Therefore, the method may not be adequate for plates surrounded by soft tissues. In addition, the curvature of the plate, which may be important for structures such as vessels, was not considered in this study. Future studies should be conducted to investigate the impact of loading medium and structure curvature for more specific applications.|$|R

The goal {{of this study is}} to show the feasibility of a full ultrasound approach that relies on the assessment of the changes in both tissue elasticity and temperature implemented on conventional ultrasonic imaging probes. HIFU treatment and monitoring were performed using a confocal set made up of a 8 MHz ultrasound diagnostic probe (Vermon) and a 2. 5 MHz single element transducer focused at 30 mm (Imasonic) on ex-vivo porcine samples. 2 D temperature estimation was combined with Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) on the same device (Aixplorer, SuperSonic Imagine). To lower the thermo-acoustic lens effect, the ultrasound thermometry was performed using plane wave emissions steered at 13 angles (+/- 12 degrees). The SSI sequence consisted in 2 successive shear waves induced at different lateral positions. Each wave was created thanks to <b>pushing</b> <b>beams</b> of 100 ?s at 3 depths. The shear wave propagation was acquired at 17000 frames/s, from which the elasticity map was recovered. HIFU sonications were interleaved with fast imaging acquisitions allowing a duty cycle of more than 90 %. Elasticity and temperature mapping was achieved every 5 seconds during treatment. Tissue stiffness was found to decrease at the focal zone with temperature up to 50 °C. Ultrasound-based temperature estimation was highly-correlated to stiffness variation maps. The lesion formation comes with a strong increase (up to four-fold) of the elastic modulus. These combined methods provide complementary measurements of tissue properties and overcome the limitations of US-thermometry alone as SSI acquisitions are motion-insensitive.
