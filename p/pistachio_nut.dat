40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{roasting}} temperature and storage period on the moisture, texture and sensory attributes of <b>pistachio</b> <b>nuts</b> were investigated. <b>Pistachio</b> <b>nuts</b> were salted and roasted with conventional method at 90, 120 and 150 °C for 30 min. The changes of moisture, textural properties including hardness, fracture force and firmness as a sensory attribute of salted roasted <b>pistachio</b> <b>nuts</b> were determined during 3 months of storage. In order to analyze results, Pearson correlation method, response surface methodology (RSM) and least mean square regression were used. The textural properties {{were correlated with}} sensory attributes, RSM was used to predict the effects of roasting temperature and storage on textural properties and the first-order model was used to describe textural changes at different roasting temperatures during storage period. Firmness as well as hardness and fracture force increased with the storage time. Furthermore, during the storage period, the moisture content of roasted <b>pistachio</b> <b>nuts</b> increased. Using high roasting temperature led to less firmness, moisture content, hardness and fracture force were significantly decreased.

40|$|Background: Cashew nut, <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> and mango {{belong to}} the Anacardiaceae family and are botanically related. Therefore, cashew nut sensitised {{children}} are frequently advised to eliminate cashew nuts and pistachio nuts from their diet. The ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572) study showed that cashew nut sensitised children were co-sensitised to <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> in 98 % of cases and to mango in 21 % of cases. The aim of this follow-up study to IDEAL is to assess the clinical relevance of co-sensitisation to <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> and mango in cashew nut sensitised children. Methods: Children were recruited from the study: ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572). Inclusion criterion for the IDEAL study was sensitization to cashew nut as demonstrated by either SPT or sIgE, and a clinical history of reactions to cashew nuts or no previous (known) exposure. Sensitized children who were tolerant to cashew nuts were excluded. Inclusion criterion for this IDEAL follow-up study was co-sensitization to <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut,</b> regardless {{the result of the}} DBPCFC with cashew nut. In this follow-up study a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge with <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> and an open food challenge with mango were performed.

40|$|Pistacia vera L. is {{the only}} species of Pistacia genus {{producing}} edible nuts. This paper investigates the antioxidant potential of a Sicilian variety of <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> by chemical as well as biological assays and measured antioxidant vitamins {{and a number of}} antioxidant polyphenols in either the hydrophilic and/or the lipophilic nut extract. In accordance with the majority of foods, the total antioxidant activity, measured as a TAA test, was much higher (50 -fold) in the hydrophilic than in the lipophilic extract. Substantial amounts of total phenols were measured. The hydrophilic extract inhibited dose- dependently both the metal-dependent and -independent lipid oxidation of bovine liver microsomes, and the Cu+ 2 -induced oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Peroxyl radical-scavenging as well as chelating activity of nut components may be suggested to explain the observed inhibition patterns. Among tocopherols, γ-tocopherol was the only vitamin E isomer found in the lipophilic extract that did not contain any carotenoid. Vitamin C was found only in a modest amount. The hydrophilic extract was a source of polyphenol compounds among which trans-resveratrol, proanthocyanidins, and a remarkable amount of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein, 3. 68 and 3. 40 mg per 100 g of edible nut, respectively, were evaluated. With the exception of isoflavones that appeared unmodified, the amounts of other bioactive molecules were remarkably reduced in the <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> after roasting, and the total antioxidant activity decreased by about 60 %.

40|$|Background Dietary {{approaches}} to control inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may include proanthocyanidin-rich foods. Our previous research {{showed that a}} hydrophilic extract from Sicilian <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> (HPE) contains sub- stantial amounts of proanthocyanidins and possesses anti- inflammatory activities. Purpose We studied the effects of HPE and of its poly- meric proanthocyanidin fraction (PPF) in a cell model that simulated some conditions of IBD, consisting of interleukin (IL) - 1 b-stimulated Caco- 2 cells. Methods HPE was prepared by Pistacia vera L. nuts, and PPF was isolated from HPE by adsorbance chromatogra- phy. Proanthocyanidins were quantified as anthocyanidins after acidic hydrolysis. Differentiated Caco- 2 cells were pre-incubated with HPE or PPF and then were exposed to IL- 1 b. Cell viability and parameters associated with nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation were assayed. Adsorption of polymeric proanthocyanidins to the cell membrane was investigated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. Results HPE decreased prostaglandin (PG) E 2 production, IL- 6 and IL- 8 release, and cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 expression. HPE also inhibited the increase in paracellular permeability and reduced NF-kB activation. Polymeric proanthocyanidins, tested at a concentration comparable with their content in HPE, produced effects comparable HPE. Finally, cell exposure to PPF increases TEER of the epithelial monolayers. Conclusion Our results provide evidence that <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> components inhibit inflammatory response of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and indicate polymeric proanthocyanidins as the major bioactive nut components. The protection implies inhibition of NF-jB activation and occurs in parallel with the adsorption of polymeric pro- anthocyanidins to cell membrane.

Using high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method, 10 fractions were separated and collected from methanol extract of cell free supernatant fluid. Two fractions showed inhibition zones against A. flavus. Mass spectrometric analysis of the both antifungal fractions revealed a high similarity between these anti-A. flavus compounds and cyclic-lipopeptides of surfactin, and fengycin families.

Aflatoxin B 1 content of samples was quantified using ELISA.   Overall, high content of aflatoxin B 1 in pre-harvest was observed in early splitting pistachios which were 5 times higher than healthy ones. The mean value of aflatoxin B 1 content in early splitting and healthy pistachio was 10. 2 and 1. 8 ng/g, respectively. In processing plant, the content of aflatoxin B 1 in stained, small, floater and open shell pistachios was 21, 4, 15 and 2 times higher than unstained, large, sinker and closed shell pistachios, respectively. The presence of aflatoxin B 1 in samples taken from orchards and processing plants indicates pre-harvest contamination by aflatoxin-producing fungi, which may exacerbate by inadequate post-harvest conditions. Physical properties of contaminated pistachios may be used to reduce aflatoxin levels in pistachio bulks during or after processing.

40|$|Intestinal {{epithelial}} cells {{play an important}} role in the mucosal inflammatory response. These cells synthesize and secrete inflammatory mediators, and selectively modulate the permeability of the epithelial monolayer thus exposing immune cells to antigens. Although intestinal inflammatory response is crucial to maintain gut structural integrity and function, alteration and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways contribute to tissue damage and ulceration, and are thought to be pivotal factors in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory gut diseases [1]. The limited efficacy of conventional pharmacological therapy in the intestinal inflammatory conditions has fostered research on alternatives and, at the same time, stresses the importance of prevention. In this context, the influence of dietary components, becoming in a physiological close proximity to intestinal cells and then to inflammatory processes within the intestinal mucosa, appears of nutritional and clinical interest [2]. Among natural preventive and complementary approaches to improve inflammatory symptoms, dietary polyphenols represent potential candidates and proanthocyanidins are particularly interesting [3]. For their relatively high concentration in a number of edible plants and their high digestive stability and limited intestinal adsorption [4, 5], proanthocyanidins reach the colon at relatively high concentrations and may have direct effects on the intestinal mucosa through their interaction with the intestinal epithelial cell membranes [6, 7]. The edible <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> has been ranked among the first 50 food products highest in antioxidant potential [8]. A number of data show that the <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> consumption has positive effects in human serum lipid profile and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [9, 10] and significantly improves oxidative status and reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers [11]. Our previous research provided evidence that a hydrophilic extract from Sicilian pistachio nuts (HPE) contains substantial amounts of polyphenols, including proanthocyanidins, and possesses radical scavenging and antioxidative properties in in vitro models of lipid oxidation [12]. Moreover we also demonstrated that HPE has anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated macrophages interfering with the NF-kB activation, and that the high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fraction (PF) can play a major role as the bioactive component of HPE [13]. In the present study we investigated the activity of HPE, and of its polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction as well, in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation, consisting of Caco- 2 cells differentiated into epithelial intestinal cells and exposed to the inflammatory actions of interleukin (IL) - 1 . Our results clearly show that HPE effectively inhibits the inflammatory response in intestinal {{epithelial cells}}, and that highly polymeric proanthocyanidin components exhibit qualitative and quantitative effects substantially comparable to those of whole extracts when tested at the same concentration found in the extracts. The protective effects are expressed through a marked decrease in release and expression of inflammatory mediators and occur in parallel with a reduced activation of the nuclear factor-B. Moreover, our results clearly show that HPE can partially prevent the IL- 1 -induced gap formation with perturbation of the monolayer integrity, as shown by a limited IL- 1 -induced increase of paracellular permeability. Finally we provide evidence that HPE treatment increases transepithelial electrical resistence of Caco- 2 cells monolayer, demonstrating that protective effects of HPE under our conditions occur in parallel with molecular interaction of nut components with the epithelial cells membranes. To assess the physiological relevance of the tested concentration it is worth noting that a single serving of <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut</b> (28. 34 g) [USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference] contains around 62, 34 mg polymeric proanthocyanidins (cyanidin equivalents). Once diluted in a gastrointestinal volume of 600 mL, this results in a 3, 5 M concentration (104 g/ml) (as cyanidin equivalents) of polymeric proanthocyanidins which represent a plausible concentration in the human gut [14]. This concentration is one order higher than the concentrations selected in our cell model and this suggests that our results might be physiologically relevant in the gastrointestinal tract. Data here presented may further remark the potentially beneficial health effects that may arise by daily intake of small quantity of <b>pistachio</b> <b>nut.</b> Widely available, inexpensive and frequently consumed, this nut for its favorable fatty acid profile and high content in bioactive antioxidant compounds, positively influences the plasma lipid parameters and oxidative status, and elicits antinflammatory properties.

The study also addressed the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between pistachio and other nuts, including almond, peanut, and cashew in pistachio allergic patients. Methods: A survey was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of pistachio allergy is affected by exposure to this nut in pistachio cultivation regions, as well as possible cross-reactivity between pistachio and other nuts including cashew, almond, and peanut. Inhibition Western blot and inhibition ELISA studies were conducted to assess the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between pistachio and the other tree nuts. Results: Our results revealed that the prevalence of pistachio allergy is twice as much in pistachio cultivation regions than other areas. Western blotting and inhibition ELISA presented high percentages of inhibition with pistachio and cashew, followed by almond and, to some degree, peanut which indicates different levels of aller- genic cross-reactivity. Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure of people to pistachio significantly affects the prevalence of its allergic reactions.
