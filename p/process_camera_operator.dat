In documentary filmmaking and news, the camera is often called on to film unfolding, unscripted events.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{factors contributing}} {{to the effectiveness of}} <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> in urban <b>camera</b> surveillance. The use of camera surveillance has taken an enormous flight in the past decades. Despite this increase, its effectiveness is strongly debated. One reason for the disputed effectiveness may be that an understanding of how to use camera surveillance, including elements contributing to the effectiveness of <b>camera</b> <b>operators,</b> has not kept track with technological developments. This paper focuses on the role of expertise and familiarity with the environment on the effectiveness of <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> to detect offenders in video footage from Rotterdam City Surveillance in the Netherlands. Results show no effect of expertise, but do show that familiarity with the location contributes to operator effectiveness and that <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> seem to use different criteria for detecting and selecting suspects depending on the familiarity with the location. These results contribute to our understanding of operator effectiveness and offer guidelines for the training of <b>camera</b> <b>operators.</b> Implications are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited...|$|R
