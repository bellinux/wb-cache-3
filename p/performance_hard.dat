30|$|Dairy {{productivity}} {{is a function}} of both lactation and reproductive performance; hence, the productive performance of a given breed of dairy cow should never be separated from the reproductive efficiency of the animal (Mukassa-Mugerwa et al. 1989) and (Negussie et al. 2002). Reproductive efficiency is known to be the product of successful estrus detection and conception rates (Cavestany and Galina 2001). Normal estrous cycles in cows and overt signs of estrus are essential, so that insemination can occur at the appropriate time (6 – 12  hr after onset of estrus) relative to ovulation (Dransfield et al. 1998). Estrus detection, therefore, becomes a vital aspect of dairy herd reproductive management. Whilst good estrus detection does not necessarily guarantee good reproductive performance, poor estrus detection makes poor <b>performance</b> <b>hard</b> to avoid (Arthur 2001).|$|E

Joint maximum likelihood detection is performed on received signal at each base station to get an estimate of desired signal {{as well as the}} strongest interferer. The estimates of the detected users are then exchanged and are used together with the local estimate of dominant interferer to improve <b>performance.</b> <b>Hard</b> information bits or reliability information at the output of the decoder are repeatedly exchanged with an improving estimate in each iteration. In addition, the influence of weak interferences and the quantization effects of reliability information on the receiver performance are investigated.

40|$|Abstract. The replica server {{placement}} problem determines the optimal location where replicated servers {{should be placed}} in content distribution networks, in order to optimize network performance. The estimated traffic demand is fundamental input to this problem and its accuracy {{is essential for the}} target performance to be achieved. However, deriving accurate traffic demands is far from trivial and uncertainty makes the target <b>performance</b> <b>hard</b> to predict. We argue that it is often inappropriate to optimize the performance for only a particular set of traffic demands that is assumed accurate. In this paper, we propose a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the replica server {{placement problem}} under traffic demand uncertainty. The objective is to minimize the total distribution cost across a variety of traffic demand scenarios while minimizing the performance deviation from the optimal solution. Empirical results demonstrate that robust optimization for replica server placement can achieve good performance under all the traffic demand scenarios while nonrobust approaches perform significantly worse. This approach allows content distribution providers to provision better and predictable quality of service for their customers by reducing the impact of inaccuracy in traffic demand estimation on the replica server placement optimization. ...|$|E
40|$|Hard-carbon is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Now it is imperative to develop a proper preparation method to obtain hard carbon anode particles with high initial coulombic efficiency and good cycling performance. In this paper, we have successfully prepared high <b>performance</b> <b>hard</b> carbon anodes, by selecting abundant and low-cost pinecones as biomass precursor and optimizing the preparation parameters of pinecone-derived hard carbon (PHC). The microstructure of PHC is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) as well as nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm methods. The performance of PHC is highly dependent on the carbonization temperature. Increasing carbonization temperature of pinecone precursor can reduce surface area and thus improve the initial coulombic efficiency. Varying carbonization temperature can also adjust the slope and plateau capacity of PHC, and then regulate the energy density and power characteristics of PHC in battery operation. PHC 1400 still delivers a capacity of 334 mA h g(- 1) after 120 cycles, with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 85. 4 %. Our results suggest that PHC is a promising anode material for practical large-scale SIB application...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} {{comprehensive mathematical model}} to conceptualize the interaction between soft measurements and latent traits. Traditionally, engineers divide the measurement process into two groups. The first comprises hard measurements, or concrete variables such as length and velocity; whereas the second comprises soft measurements, or nonconcrete variables such as customer satisfaction and job <b>performance.</b> <b>Hard</b> measurement instruments are widely recognized and accepted by engineers. However, soft measurement instruments, generally questionnaires, are often mistrusted due to their perceived lack of reliability and validity. A proposed model [...] called the ν-function [...] employs psychometric principles, latent variables, {{and the concept of}} human sensors to enable quality engineers to estimate not only reliability coefficients but also a novel validity index, γ, for soft measurement instruments. One of the main advantages of using quantitative parameters to control the precision and the exactness of the measurement process is the rise in the confidence with which inferences are made to and predictions are performed from a particular domain. A case study is also conducted to collect evidence to discuss the efficiency and efficacy of the ν-function according to empirical data...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current thesis was twofold: 1) to review the {{literature}} while linking the effects of background noise, music and driving performance and 2) {{to determine the effects of}} sound type and volume and gender on driving-related activities. Driving involves great requirements for attention and concentration while performing concurrent tasks (i. e. listening to music, conversing). It has been previously demonstrated that loud industrial noise detrimentally affects human performance. Meanwhile, there exist inconsistent results on music and performance. Background hard rock music has been shown to have both facilitating as well as distracting characteristics. In the present study, it was demonstrated that loud sound volume (94 dB (A)) adversely affects simple vigilance, as well as simulated driving (SimD) <b>performance.</b> <b>Hard</b> rock music has a greater detrimental effect on male reaction times (RT) compared to females. Also, hard rock music was demonstrated to facilitate nonconscious perception performance, while increasing accommodation heart rate (HR). In conclusion, both genders should avoid loud noise or music when driving while males should be especially aware of the detrimental effects of hard rock music on their driving performance...|$|E
