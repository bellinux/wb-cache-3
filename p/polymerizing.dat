25|$|The {{growth of}} actin {{filaments}} can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin binds to G-actin to buffer the <b>polymerizing</b> process, while profilin binds to G-actin to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric {{addition to the}} barbed, plus end of F-actin filaments.|$|E

25|$|This {{limitation}} can {{be overcome}} by <b>polymerizing</b> directly on the surface. This process {{is referred to as}} grafting from, or surface-initiated polymerization (SIP). As the name suggests, the initiator molecules must be immobilized on the solid surface. Like other polymerization methods, SIP can be tailored to follow radical, anionic, or cationic mechanisms and can be controlled utilizing reversible addition transfer polymerization (RAFT), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), or nitroxide-mediated techniques.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} {{is known}} for its compatibility {{with a wide range of}} monomers as compared to other controlled radical polymerizations. Some monomers capable of <b>polymerizing</b> by RAFT include styrenes, acrylates, acrylamides, and many vinyl monomers. Additionally, the RAFT process allows the synthesis of polymers with specific macromolecular architectures such as block, gradient, statistical, comb, brush, star, hyperbranched, and network copolymers. These properties make RAFT useful in many types of polymer synthesis.|$|E
25|$|A third popular type of reactor is the electrodeless. This uses an RF coil {{wrapped around}} the glass apparatus, which then uses a radio {{frequency}} generator to form the plasma inside of the housing {{without the use of}} direct electrodes (see Inductively Coupled Plasma). The polymer can then be deposited as it is pushed through this RF coil toward the vacuum end of the apparatus. This has the advantage of not having polymer building up on the electrode surface, which is desirable when <b>polymerizing</b> onto other surfaces.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} <b>polymerized</b> by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species because they have to be able to go into the plasma state.

40|$|When the {{temperature}} is lowered from 20 to 4 degrees C, the specific viscosity of actin <b>polymerized</b> {{in the presence of}} either 4 mM-CaCl 2 or 2 mM-MgCl 2, but not of actin <b>polymerized</b> in the presence of 90 mM-KCl, is decreased by 50 % in the absence of free ATP. Addition of ATP restores the viscosity of the actin <b>polymerized</b> by Mg 2 +, but not that of actin <b>polymerized</b> by Ca 2 +, to the original value. The effect of temperature on actin <b>polymerized</b> in the presence of Ca 2 + is due to (a) polymer-into-monomer conversion, (b) latero-lateral aggregation of filaments, and (c) fragmentation of the filaments.

25|$|Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both {{carry out}} template-dependent {{nucleotide}} polymerization, {{it might be}} expected that {{the two types of}} enzymes would be structurally related. However, x-ray crystallographic studies of both types of enzymes reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site, they are virtually unrelated to each other; indeed template-dependent nucleotide <b>polymerizing</b> enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the modern DNA Polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases from viruses. The other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.|$|E
25|$|Poisonous {{compounds}} may {{be useful}} either for their toxicity, or, more often, because of another chemical property, such as specific chemical reactivity. Poisons are widely used in industry and agriculture, as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, e.g. carbon monoxide, methanol and sodium cyanide, respectively. They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as ammonia and methanol. For instance, phosgene is a highly reactive nucleophile acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for <b>polymerizing</b> diols and diamines to produce polycarbonate and polyurethane plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic. In fact, phosgene {{has been used as}} a chemical weapon. It can be contrasted with mustard gas, which has only been produced for chemical weapons uses, as it has no particular industrial use.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the related}} {{fluorinated}} acetylenes, dichloroacetylene does not easily engage in thermal polymerization in either its gas phase or its condensed phase. Despite this, two patents {{have claimed that}} it is possible to <b>polymerize</b> dichloroacetylene. Using molybdenum pentachloride to <b>polymerize</b> dichloroacetylene has been investigated. It can be <b>polymerized</b> in certain circumstances, and its polymer is known as polydichloroacetylene. Polydichloroacetylene is white in color.|$|R
50|$|Not all cyclic {{monomers}} containing an heteroatom undergo CROP. Ring size influences {{whether the}} cyclic monomer <b>polymerize</b> through this mechanism. For example, 4, 6 and 7-membered rings of cyclic esters <b>polymerize</b> through CROP. When considering the ring {{size of the}} monomer, the reactivity toward polymerization is dictated by the ability to release the ring strain. Therefore, cyclic monomers with small or lacking ring strain will not <b>polymerize.</b>|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of tubulin in tissues has been developed. The procedure consists of homogenization and centrifugation {{of the tissue}} in a microtubule- stabilizing solution and depolymerization of the precipitated microtubules; <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of tubulin are quantitated by a colchicine-binding assay. The validity of the technique was assessed by electron microscopy and recovery studies with labeled and unlabeled preparations of <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of rat brain tubulin. The sensitivity of this technique allows quantitation of tubulin in 150 micrograms of tissue, wet weight.

2500|$|The growth {{capacity}} of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments.

[...] When this happens, the <b>polymerizing</b> ends of microtubules {{come into contact with}} F-actin adhesion sites, where microtubule tip-associated proteins act as [...] "ligands". Laminins of the basal membrane interact with the integrins of the growth cone to promote the forward movement of the growth cone. Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon.|$|E
30|$|Either organic {{solvents}} {{or water}} {{can be used as}} medium for TR polymer polymerization. Although water is environmental friendly, we have found that the polymerization yields and recoveries in water are not as high as in organic solvents. In this study, PVBAm and PN are <b>polymerized</b> in benzene, giving higher yields than in water (Table  3). Moreover, when <b>polymerized</b> in benzene, PVBAm and PN shrunk to a clot when heated above their LCST and could easily be removed, whereas when <b>polymerized</b> in water, they needed to be centrifuged before recovery. In another TR ATPS (Table  3), PNBAa <b>polymerized</b> in benzene also showed high yields after forming clots that can be easily collected, whereas PNE <b>polymerized</b> in water only gave 85.8 % yield and needed to be centrifuged to be collected.|$|R

This work evaluated the effect of intramuscular administration of <b>polymerized</b> collagen in early and established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and analyzed changes in Th subsets following therapy. Incidence of CIA was of 100 % in mice challenged with type II collagen. Clinimorphometric analysis showed a downregulation of inflammation after administration of all treatments (P < 0. 05). Histological analysis showed that the CIA-mice group had extensive bone erosion, pannus and severe focal inflammatory infiltrates. In contrast, there was a remarkable reduction in the severity of arthritis in mice under <b>polymerized</b> collagen, methotrexate or methotrexate/polymerized collagen treatment. <b>Polymerized</b> Collagen but not methotrexate induced tissue joint regeneration. <b>Polymerized</b> Collagen and methotrexate/polymerized collagen but not methotrexate alone induces downregulation of CD 4 +/IL 17 A+ T cells and upregulation of Tregs and CD 4 +/IFN-γ+ T cells.

The color images {{were recorded in}} R (red), G (green) and B (blue) form and converted into H (hue), S (saturation) and V (value). Results: Significant color change occurred for auto <b>polymerized</b> tooth colored acrylic resin in tamarind extract, for heat <b>polymerized</b> tooth colored acrylic resin in tea extract andfor light <b>polymerized</b> resin composite in coffee extract. Auto <b>polymerized</b> tooth colored acrylic resin samples showed an overall higher color change. However, for all the material samples coffee extract produced more color change.

Early work focused on the production of fibres and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during World War II.

40|$|Abstract—Aldehydes <b>polymerize</b> readily with {{cationic}} and anionic initiators to polyacetals. Higher aliphatic aldehydes are conveniently <b>polymerized</b> with anionic initiators at low temperatures, {{frequently to}} isotactic polyaldehydes.

An NMR investigation of the rate of polymerization and copolymerization of chloral showed that the polymerization becomes diffusion controlled above approximately 40 % conversion.

2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.

2500|$|Actin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} proteins in eukaryotes, where it is found throughout the cytoplasm. In fact, in muscle fibres it comprises 20% of total cellular protein by weight and between 1% and 5% in other cells. However, there is not only one type of actin, the genes that code for actin are defined as a gene family (a family that in plants contains more than 60 elements, including genes and pseudogenes and in humans more than 30 elements). This means that the genetic information of each individual contains instructions that generate actin variants (called isoforms) that possess slightly different functions. This, in turn, means that eukaryotic organisms express different genes that give rise to: [...] α-actin, which is found in contractile structures; β-actin, found at the expanding edge of cells that use the projection of their cellular structures as their means of mobility; and γ-actin, which is found in the filaments of stress fibres. In addition to the similarities that exist between an organism’s isoforms there is also an evolutionary conservation in the structure and function even between organisms contained in different eukaryotic domains: in bacteria the actin homologue MreB has been identified, which is a protein that is capable of <b>polymerizing</b> into microfilaments; and in archaea the homologue Ta0583 is even more similar to the eukaryotic actins.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by <b>polymerizing</b> methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass.
