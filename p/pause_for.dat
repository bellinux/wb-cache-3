5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} {{through the}} use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phase of the attack by {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were to capture the line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. After a <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The first phase was due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Mughar Ridge {{was fought}} on 13 November by the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 75th Division in the centre, with the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank and the Anzac Mounted Division and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry's left flank. The battle {{was divided into}} two stages with a <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> {{artillery}} to be brought forward. Following the Yeomanry's successful charge up onto El Mughar ridge, two crucial fortified villages were captured by elements of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. This victory resulted in the subsequent occupation of Junction Station, a vital railway station on the Turk's lines of communication between Jaffa and Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Muslim Civil War in 656 bought a precious breathing <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> Byzantium, which Emperor Constans II (r. 641–668) used to shore up his defences, extend and consolidate his control over Armenia and most importantly, initiate a major army reform with lasting effect: {{the establishment of the}} themata, the large territorial commands into which Anatolia, the major contiguous territory remaining to the Empire, was divided. The remains of the old field armies were settled in each of them, and soldiers were allocated land there in payment of their service. The themata would form the backbone of the Byzantine defensive system for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> shorter times.|$|E

5|$|The {{firing of}} Montagu's guns had given Nicholas <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> concern, but his men had {{occupied}} the fort, {{and he was}} consulting with his officers on their next move when Burke arrived. They obligingly repeated to Burke that they had arrived to take the powder and weapons, and were prepared to assault the town. Burke brought this news back to Browne around 4:00 pm. Rather than advance further on Nassau, Nicholas and his force (200 marines and 50 sailors) remained at Fort Montagu that night. Browne held a war council that evening, in which {{the decision was made}} to attempt the removal of the gunpowder. At midnight, 162 of 200 barrels of gunpowder were loaded onto the Mississippi Packet and HMS St. John, and at 2:00 am they sailed out of Nassau harbor, bound for Saint Augustine. This feat was made possible because Hopkins had neglected to post even a single ship to guard the harbor's entrance channels, leaving the fleet safely anchored in Hanover Sound.|$|E
25|$|The race {{started at}} 6am with {{only four of}} the 12 {{entrants}} on the track. Although {{it is often said}} that the first six-day was a non-stop, no-sleeping event that ran without <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> six days, in fact riders joined in when they chose and slept as they wished.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} match of the Série A before the FIFA World Cup, {{stopping}} the league in the seventh round and Palmeiras in the mid-table position. During the <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> the World Cup, Jorge Parraga, the team's interim manager was replaced by Luiz Felipe Scolari, who previously managed Palmeiras from 1997 to 2000, winning the Copa do Brasil and the Libertadores. Scolari agreed to manage the team even with proposal from other four Brazilian clubs.|$|E

25|$|The battle orders {{called for}} the howitzers to fire three shots as a signal for Bernard to begin the attack, then they were to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> 15 minutes before {{resuming}} firing to give the Modoc a chance to move their women and children out of the Stronghold. However, due to the fog, the howitzer crews could not determine where their shots were landing, {{and they did not}} resume firing after the signal shots for fear of hitting their own forces.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued {{its use of}} reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor (ML-1), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|E
25|$|Beginning on the 25th {{there were}} clashes at Palencia and Villamuriel de Cerrato as Souham sought {{to turn the}} Allied north flank. Wellington then adopted an unorthodox {{defensive}} position, prompting Souham to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> two days. The stalemate was broken on 29 October when a party of naked French soldiers swam the Duero River at Tordesillas with their weapons on a raft. Upon reaching the far bank, they took up their guns and routed the Brunswick defenders of a key bridge. With an intact bridge in French hands, Wellington was forced to continue his retreat toward Portugal.|$|E

25|$|Elephants, {{have shown}} unusual {{behavior}} upon encountering {{the remains of}} another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it {{for long periods of}} time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is commemorated by many {{memorials}} throughout Turkey, {{such as the}} Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, the Atatürk Bridge {{over the}} Golden Horn (Haliç), the Atatürk Dam, and Atatürk Stadium. Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait {{can be seen in}} all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school books, on all Turkish lira banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05am, most vehicles and people in the country's streets <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> one minute in remembrance.|$|E

25|$|Hercule Poirot {{is enjoying}} a social visit by Dr. Burton, {{a fellow of}} All Souls who recites sonorously some lines from Homer's Iliad (XXIII, 316 f) and turns the {{conversation}} round {{to the subject of}} Poirot's unusual Christian name and how some of the pagan names parents give to their children do not suit their recipients. He thinks about Poirot's and Sherlock Holmes's mothers sitting together and discussing names for their children. Poirot claims ignorance of the legend of Hercules. The talk turns to Poirot's intention to retire after completing a few cases of interest and personal appeal and Burton laughingly refers to the twelve labours of Hercules. This comment gives Poirot <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> thought and after his visitor has gone, Poirot gets acquainted with the exploits of his legendary namesake, deciding his final cases will mimic Hercules's Twelve Labours.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian {{strategy}} of invading Italy was a blunder. The losses incurred in the invasion and retreat seriously weakened Archduke John's army. Instead of having ample forces {{to defend the}} mountain barrier east of the Italian plains, John was left with an insufficient number of soldiers. The capture of Tarvis and its outlying forts gave Eugène an open road to Villach, which he occupied on 20 May. His troops seized Klagenfurt the following day. In both cities, the Franco-Italians found supplies that would be of future use. Eugène was forced to <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> {{a few days in}} order to let his artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains catch up with his infantry. John withdrew to Graz, where he arrived on 24 May, followed by Gyulai's bedraggled division. Eugène's patrols soon detected Jellacic's division marching across his front and sent Grenier's corps to intercept. The next action was the Battle of Sankt Michael on 25 May. Monuments to Engineer officers Hensel and Hermann and the fallen Austrian soldiers are located at both the Malborghetto and Predil forts. The one at Predil was constructed in 1849.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief <b>pause</b> <b>for</b> three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one note from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing very quietly (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E
