40|$|The {{bottom-up}} {{effects of}} <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and the top-down effects of natural enemies {{are two of}} the most important factors governing the abundance, distribution and performance of insect herbivores. <b>Plant</b> <b>quality</b> effects are generally manifested through changes in nutrients, morphology, size or host availability. Natural enemy effects are mainly observed through the action of arthropod predators and parasitoids. The relative influence of these effects has been well studied in several natural and forest ecosystems but has rarely been evaluated in agro-ecosystems. In manipulative field experiments, I examined the relative influence of <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and natural enemies on the abundance and performance of Bemisia tabaci and Lygus hesperus, two important pests of cotton. This dissertation begins with an evaluation of the relative influences of <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> (manipulated through differential irrigation) and natural enemies (manipulated by insecticide exclusion) on the seasonal dynamics of B. tabaci in cotton. I found higher densities of all B. tabaci stages when natural enemy densities were reduced, regardless of level of <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Generally, densities of B. tabaci did not vary with <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Similarly, natural enemy densities and predator:prey ratios were not affected by <b>plant</b> <b>quality,</b> indicating that natural enemies exert a greater influence on seasonal dynamics of B. tabaci than <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> I then evaluated the mechanism responsible for herbivore density patterns using cohort-based life table studies. I found lower rates of predation and parasitism when natural enemy densities were reduced across all levels of <b>plant</b> <b>quality,</b> with predation the primary key factor associated with changes in generational mortality. Levels of B. tabaci mortality did not vary with <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> indicating that the impact of natural enemies was not mediated by the bottom-up effects of <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Finally, I evaluated these effects on L. hesperus and found that <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> significantly affected seasonal dynamics with the greatest and smallest densities on the highest and lowest <b>quality</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. These effects did not translate to natural enemy effects, as their density and impact were not affected by <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> The implications of these findings for the management of these pests in cotton are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Researchers in {{ornamental}} horticulture often want {{to assess the}} effects of experimental treatments on <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Producers often use the results of such experiments to establish the minimum level of a treatment, for instance, the amount of a growth regulator or a nutrient, such as nitrogen, needed to achieve desired <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> For edible <b>plants,</b> <b>quality</b> can be quantified objectively by using numeric response variable such as yield or nutritional content.

Purpose: The survey tries to determine the correlation between the {{existence of}} <b>quality</b> <b>departments</b> and organization of quality in organizations; our hypothesis is that the correlation is very strong. Method: A survey was performed in 484 large and medium-sized organizations in Slovenia to examine the situation in this area.

Results: Organizations with <b>quality</b> <b>departments</b> more frequently also have certificate ISO 9001 in comparison with organizations without <b>quality</b> <b>departments.</b> Also these organizations more frequently have supplier-relations teams, monitoring system of suppliers' progress and excellence centers. In short, the quality in these organizations is organized on a higher level than in organizations without <b>quality</b> <b>departments.</b> Organization: The role of <b>quality</b> <b>department</b> is important for organizations. The findings of the research are important for decision making in organizations. Society: Each organization contributes to efficiency and effectiveness of a nation.

We tested this hypothesis by rearing B. aquilonaris caterpillars from Belgian and Dutch sites on host plants (the cranberry, Vaccini- um oxycoccos).

Dutch caterpillars performed well on both <b>plant</b> <b>qualities,</b> whereas Belgian caterpillars could not switch to lower <b>quality</b> <b>plants.</b> This can be con- sidered as an environmentally induced plastic response of caterpillars and/or a local adaptation to <b>plant</b> <b>quality,</b> which precludes the use of Belgian individuals as a unique solution for strengthening Dutch populations.

40|$|Estimates of {{production}} functions suffer from an omitted variable problem; <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> is an omitted variable {{that is likely}} to be correlated with variable inputs. One approach is to capture differences in <b>plant</b> <b>qualities</b> through <b>plant</b> specific intercepts, i. e., to estimate a fixed effects model. For this technique to work, it is necessary that differences in <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> are more or less fixed; if the "fixed effects" erode over time, such a procedure becomes problematic, especially when working with long panels. In this paper, a standard fixed effects model, extended to allow for serial correlation in the error term, is applied to a 16 -year panel of textile plants. This parametric approach strongly accepts the hypothesis of fixed effects. They account for about one-third of the variation in productivity. A simple non-parametric approach, however, concludes that differences in <b>plant</b> <b>qualities</b> erode over time, that is <b>plant</b> <b>qualities</b> f-mix. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that this discrepancy comes from the parametric approach imposing an overly restrictive functional form on the data; if there were fixed effects of the magnitude measured, one would reject the hypothesis of f-mixing. For textiles, at least, the functional form of a fixed effects model appears to generate misleading conclusions. A more flexible functional form is estimated. The "fixed" effects actually have a half life of approximately 10 to 20 years, and they account for about one-half the variation in productivity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interactions}} of host plants with herbivores can be mediated by {{factors other than}} population sizes or biomass alone. Recent evidence indicates that features of the vegetation (loosely termed "plant quality") may change in response to herbivory and may, in turn, influence the performance of herbivores (i. e. by affecting survivorship, fecundity, or growth rates). A model which incorporates the effect of <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> is presented. First it is shown that the frequency distribution of <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> in the vegetation (p(q, t)) satisfies an equation of conservation. Then, qualitative aspects of the system are discussed in three situations: (1) mobile herbivores interacting with all plants; (2) sessile herbivores feeding exclusively on single plants; (3) inter-mediate situations in which mobility is moderate to low. I show that depending on the <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> response, f(q, h), and the herbivore response, g(q, h), {{it is possible to}} obtain stable equilibria s well as stable periodic oscillations. In the former case the populations tend to lose their heterogeneity. In the latter case, oscillations are accompanied byalternate narrowing and broadening of the distribution. Empirical testing and further research are suggested.

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{specific}} microhabitat represents a compromise {{among a number of}} different factors organisms use to monitor habitat suitability. Grassland vegetation structure can vary widely along environmental gradients over a relatively small area. This vegetation structure can have a large influence on habitat selection by grasshoppers (Orthoptera). However, it is not clear which vegetation characteristics are most important in determining grasshopper abundance. We found that plant biomass, plant species richness, and <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> all have an effect on grasshopper abundance and distribution. We observe that these affects vary both within and among the two years of data collection. The timing of rainfall within a year strongly affects plant productivity and a large difference in plant productivity among years may lead to different outcomes. In a year of lower plant productivity, plant biomass and plant species richness determine grasshopper abundance. In a year of higher <b>plant</b> productivity, <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>plant</b> biomass determine grasshopper abundance. There has been little work to examine how increased nutrient loads in today 2 ̆ 7 s environment affect grassland plant communities and in turn, insect herbivore communities. Grasshopper choice between two vegetation treatments, control and nutrient addition, can affect the outcome of interactions of soil nutrients, plant biomass, and grasshopper biomass. By modeling the effects of grasshopper choice for <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity, I was able to predict an effect multiple levels of nutrients can have on the overall vegetation biomass in nitrogen enriched and control plots. I found that there is a threshold level of nitrogen addition at which the nitrogen enriched plots have the same value of plant biomass as the control plots mediated by grasshopper response to <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the importance of}} spatial and temporal variation in <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity for determining sustainable stocking rates in game, commercial and communal ranches in semi-arid savanna of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, in wet and dry seasons over a two-year period. We focussed on variation in plant biomass, phosphorus (P), crude protein (CP) concentrations and dry matter digestibility as parameters most likely to affect sustainable stocking rates. Habitat type had greater effects on <b>plant</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>plant</b> biomass and species composition than management type. The commercially-managed area had the highest tree density in the rocky habitat and lower <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> than other management types. All of these features indicate that land degradation is occurring on commercial ranches in spite of rotational grazing and lower stocking density than on communal ranches. We recommend that commercial ranchers should introduce {{a greater variety of}} stock and/or game to reduce selective grazing of certain <b>plant</b> species. <b>Quality</b> measures (CP and P) gave more conservative predictions of stocking density than biomass. In this region of the Northern Cape, seasonally-inundated pan habitats are particularly valuable in spite of low-standing crop because they have the highest year-round quality. Contrastingly, ranchers should only lightly stock open savanna habitats, in spite of high standing biomass, because they have low vegetation quality and may be particularly susceptible to degradation and invasion by poisonous and unpalatable plants.

Declining environmental quality may therefore lead to larger costs. We investigated whether reduced <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> would increase the fitness costs associated with resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis in two populations of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. We also measured the rate of decline in resistance on two host-plant (Brassica) species for one insect population (Karak). Population×plant species interactions determined the fitness costs in this study. Poor <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> increased the fitness costs in terms of development time for both populations. However, fitness costs seen in larval survival did not always increase as <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> declined. Both the fitness and the stability experiment indicated that fitness costs were higher on the most suitable plant for one population. Theoretically, if the fitness cost of a mutation interacts additively with environmental factors, the relative fitness of resistant insects will decrease with environmental quality. However, multiplicative costs do not necessarily increase with declining quality and may be harder to detect when fitness parameters are more subject to variation in poorer environments...|$|R

However, to what extent the effects of plant diversity on the arthropod community on a focal plant are mediated by host <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> or by the {{diversity of}} the surrounding plants remains unresolved. In the field, we sampled arthropod communities on focal Jacobaea vulgaris plants growing in experimental plant communities that were maintained at different levels of diversity (one, two, four or nine species) for 3 years. Focal plants were also planted in plots without surrounding vegetation. We recorded the structural characteristics of each of the surrounding plant communities as well as the growth, and primary and secondary chemistry (pyrrolizidine alkaloids, PAs) of the focal plants to disentangle the potential mechanisms causing the diversity effects. Two years after planting, the abundance of arthropods on focal plants that were still in the vegetative stage decreased with increasing plant diversity, while the abundance of arthropods on reproductive focal plants was not significantly affected by the {{diversity of the}} neighbouring community. The size of both vegetative and reproductive focal plants was not significantly affected by the diversity of the neighbouring community, but the levels of PAs and the foliar N concentration of vegetative focal plants decreased with increasing plant diversity. Structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of plant diversity on the arthropod communities on focal plants were not mediated by changes in <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Synthesis. <b>Plant</b> <b>quality</b> can greatly influence insect preference and performance.

40|$|Several {{influential}} hypotheses in plant-herbivore and herbivore-predator interactions {{consider the}} interactive effects of <b>plant</b> <b>quality,</b> herbivore diet breadth, and predation on herbivore performance. Yet individually and collectively, these hypotheses fail to address the simultaneous influence of all three factors. Here we review existing hypotheses, and propose the tri-trophic interactions (TTI) hypothesis to consolidate and integrate their predictions. The TTI hypothesis predicts that dietary specialist herbivores (as compared to generalists) should escape predators and be competitively dominant due to faster growth rates, and that such differences should be greater on low quality (as compared to high <b>quality)</b> host <b>plants.</b> To provide a preliminary test of these predictions, we conducted an empirical study comparing the effects of <b>plant</b> (Baccharis salicifolia) <b>quality</b> and predators between a specialist (Uroleucon macolai) and a generalist (Aphis gossypii) aphid herbivore. Consistent with predictions, these three factors interactively determine herbivore performance in ways not addressed by existing hypotheses. Compared to the specialist, the generalist was less fecund, competitively inferior, and more sensitive to low <b>plant</b> <b>quality.</b> Correspondingly, predator effects were contingent upon <b>plant</b> <b>quality</b> only for the generalist. Contrary to predictions, predator effects were weaker for the generalist and on low-quality plants, likely due to density-dependent benefits provided to the generalist by mutualist ants. Because the TTI hypothesis predicts the superior performance of specialists, mutualist ants may be critical to A. gossypii persistence under competition from U. macolai. In summary, th...|$|R
