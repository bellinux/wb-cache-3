2500|$|A folio (from Latin foli≈ç, abl. of folium, leaf [...] ) {{is a book}} or {{pamphlet}} made up {{of one or more}} full {{sheets of}} paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves. [...] Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a quarto, folding each sheet twice, and octavo, folding each sheet three times. [...] Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a <b>paper-knife.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My God!" [...] cried Miss Hobson, wounded to the quick. [...] "If this don't beat everything! How {{the heck}} can I toy negligently with a <b>paper-knife</b> when there's no <b>paper-knife</b> {{for me to}} toy negligently with?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And, as {{she listened}} to the fervent eloquence of Mr. Bunbury, she {{perceived}} that she had every reason to be. Fillmore was having a bad time. One of the chief articles of faith in the creed of all theatrical producers is that if anything goes wrong it must be the fault of the assistant stage manager and Mr. Bunbury was evidently orthodox in his views. He was showing oratorical gifts of no mean order. The <b>paper-knife</b> seemed to inspire him. Gradually, Sally began to get the feeling that this harmless, necessary stage-property was the source from which sprang most, if not all, of the trouble in the world. It had disappeared before. Now it had disappeared again. Could Mr. Bunbury go on struggling in a universe where this sort of thing happened? He seemed to doubt it. Being a red-blooded, one-hundred-per-cent American man, he would try hard, but it was a hundred to one shot that he would get through. He had asked for a <b>paper-knife.</b> There was no <b>paper-knife.</b> Why was there no <b>paper-knife?</b> Where was the <b>paper-knife</b> anyway? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my heavens!" [...] shouted Gerald Foster, {{bounding}} {{from his}} seat {{and for the first}} time taking a share in the debate. [...] "Are we going to spend the whole day arguing about cats and <b>paper-knives?</b> For goodness' sake, clear the stage and stop wasting time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In future, Miss Hobson, I {{should be}} glad if, when {{you wish to}} throw {{anything}} at the cat, you would not select a missile from the property box. Good heavens!" [...] he cried, stung by the way fate was maltreating him, [...] "I have never experienced anything like this before. I have been producing plays all my life, {{and this is the}} first time this has happened. I have produced Nazimova. Nazimova never threw <b>paper-knives</b> at cats." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speculation {{as to the}} Skylon's fate {{included}} theories from Jude Kelly, {{artistic director}} of the Southbank Centre, that it was thrown into the River Lea in east London, dumped into the Thames, buried under Jubilee Gardens, made into souvenirs or sold as scrap. The base is preserved in the Museum of London and the wind cups are held in a private collection. An investigation was carried out by the Front Row programme on BBC Radio 4 and the result was broadcast on 8 March 2011. It was revealed that the Skylon and the roof of the Dome of Discovery were sold to George Cohen and Sons, scrap metal dealers of Wood Lane, Hammersmith, and dismantled at their works in Bidder Street, Canning Town, {{on the banks of the}} River Lea. Some of the metal fragments were then turned into a series of commemorative <b>paper-knives</b> and artefacts. The inscriptions on the <b>paper-knives</b> read [...] "600" [...] and [...] "Made from the aluminium alloy roof sheets which covered the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain, South Bank. The Dome, Skylon and 10 other buildings on the site, were dismantled by George Cohen and Sons and Company Ltd during six months of 1952." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Wellington {{considered}} a moment, fingering an ivory <b>paper-knife.</b> He was partly convinced.|$|E
60|$|He groaned, {{gave himself}} a slice under each ear, and viciously bit {{the end of}} the <b>paper-knife.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{took up a}} <b>paper-knife</b> and, {{balancing}} {{it between}} his fingers, tapped lightly with it on the table.|$|E
60|$|The why {{was evident}} {{enough in the}} {{heterogeneous}} mass--crumpled prints, blank drawing-paper, and maps heaped ruinously over and under books, stuffed birds, geological specimens, dislocated microscopes, pieces of Roman pavement, curiosities innumerable and indescribable; among which roamed blotting-books, memorandum-books, four pieces of Indian rubber, three pair of compasses, seven <b>paper-knives,</b> ten knives, thirteen odd gloves, fifteen pencils, pens beyond reckoning, a purse, a key, half a poem on the Siege of Granada, three parts of an essay upon Spade Husbandry, the dramatis personae of a tragedy on Queen Brunehault, scores of old letters, and the dust of three years and a half.|$|R
60|$|Ben mended the {{umbrella}} admirably. At the same time, Bill fashioned and carved {{two or three}} <b>paper-knives</b> of wood with great neatness. But when {{it was discovered that}} they could sew sail-cloth expeditiously and well, a quantity of that material was given to them, and they were ordered to make sacks. They set to work accordingly, and made sack after sack until they grew so wearied of the monotonous work that Ben said it made him wish to sit down in sackcloth and ashes; whereupon Bill remarked that if the Mounseers would only give them the sack altogether, it would be very much to their credit.|$|R
6000|$|Fillmore {{was himself}} again. We {{all have our}} {{particular}} mode of self-expression in moments of elation. Fillmore's took the shape of buying a new waistcoat and a hundred half-dollar cigars and being very fussy {{about what he had}} for lunch. It may have been an optical illusion, but he appeared to Sally to put on at least six pounds in weight {{on the first day of}} the new regime. As a serf looking after <b>paper-knives</b> and other properties, he had been--for him--almost slim. As a manager he blossomed out into soft billowy curves, and when he stood on the sidewalk in front of the theatre, gloating over the new posters which bore the legend, ...|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned back}} in his chair and, {{twisting}} the <b>paper-knife</b> idly between his fingers, watched his chief clerk closely.|$|E
60|$|Professor Chadd slit open {{a page of}} the {{magazine}} with a bone <b>paper-knife</b> and the intent reverence of the bibliophile.|$|E
60|$|The same nervous staccato laugh {{broke from}} her thin lips, and her fingers {{began to play}} with a long tortoise-shell <b>paper-knife.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{company was}} {{assembling}} in the panelled hall, {{and made a}} brilliant show {{in the light of}} the acetylene candles against the dark background. Mr. Britling in a black velvet cloak and black silk tights was a deeper shade among the shadows; the high lights were Miss Corner and her sister, in glittering garments of peacock green and silver that gave a snake-like quality to their lithe bodies. They were talking to the German tutor, who had become a sort of cotton Cossack, a spectacled Cossack in buff and bright green. Mrs. Britling was dignified and beautiful in a purple djibbah, and her stepson had become a handsome still figure of black and crimson. Teddy had contrived something elaborate and effective in the Egyptian style, with a fish-basket and a cuirass of that thin matting one finds behind washstands; the small boys were brigands, with immensely baggy breeches and cummerbunds in which they had stuck a selection of <b>paper-knives</b> and toy pistols and similar weapons. Mr. Carmine and his young man had come provided with real Indian costumes; the feeling of the company was that Mr. Carmine was a mullah. The aunt-like lady with the noble nose stood out amidst these levities in a black silk costume with a gold chain. She refused, it seemed, to make herself absurd, though she encouraged the others to extravagance by nods and enigmatical smiles. Nevertheless she had put pink ribbons in her cap. A family of father, golden-haired mother, and two young daughters, sympathetically attired, had just arrived, and were discarding their outer wrappings with the assistance of host and hostess.|$|R
60|$|In the {{preparation}} of the umbrella, the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sack-making. After some examination they discovered a plank in the floor, in the corner where they were wont to sleep, which was loose and easily forced up with one of Bill's unfinished <b>paper-knives,</b> which he made very strong for this special purpose! Beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella. To have cabbaged at one time all the sail-cloth that was required would have risked discovery; they therefore appropriated small scraps each day, and sewed these neatly together until they had enough. Soon they had a ring of canvas formed, into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly, and this ring was so cut and sewn in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella, which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter. All round the extremity or margin of the ring, cords of twisted twine were fixed, at intervals of about six inches. There were about sixty of these cords or stays, all of which met and were fastened {{at the end of the}} handle. A stout line, made of four-ply twine, was fastened at the top of the umbrella, and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside, and twisted down the stick to the handle, to which it was firmly secured. By this means the whole machine was, as it were, bound together.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{could buy}} their old road three times over," [...] he muttered, {{playing with a}} <b>paper-knife,</b> and moving restlessly to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} a bit short and off the leg stump, so I stepped out--may I bag the <b>paper-knife</b> for a jiffy? I'll just show----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see,' {{continued}} the sorcerer, 'I place the <b>paper-knife</b> there! It falls. Why? Because of gravity. What is gravity? Newton, {{as you know}} well, invented the art; but what of that? Did he find that which did not exist? No, for the non-existent is {{as though it had}} never been. But now, availing myself of the resources of science, which is ever old and ever young, I clasp my wrist--the wrist of the hand on which the <b>paper-knife</b> rests--with the other hand, and--you see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No <b>paper-knife.</b> And it's no good {{picking on}} me. I'm the star, not the {{assistant}} stage manager. If you're {{going to pick}} on anybody, pick on him." ...|$|E
60|$|She untied {{the string}} with {{trembling}} fingers. Wrayson {{handed her a}} <b>paper-knife</b> and she cut open {{the top of the}} envelope. Then {{she looked up at him}} appealingly.|$|E
60|$|Duncombe's {{teeth were}} hard set. A <b>paper-knife,</b> {{which he had}} caught up from the table, snapped in his fingers. There was {{something}} in his throat which nearly choked him.|$|E
60|$|She broke off. Ogden, who had possessed {{himself of}} a bronze <b>paper-knife,</b> {{had begun to}} tap the vase with it. The ringing note thus {{produced}} appeared to please his young mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{much does}} the <b>paper-knife</b> cost?" [...] said he, still smiling. It was a large, elaborate, and perhaps, I may say, {{unwieldy}} affair, {{with a great}} elephant {{at the end of}} it.|$|E
60|$|As he {{said this}} his eyes began to water. He was a weak young fellow, and ridiculously fond of her. I {{brought him back to}} {{business}} with another rap of the <b>paper-knife.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{told him}} once more what had {{happened}} at the inn. Geoffrey listened, without making any remark. He balanced the <b>paper-knife</b> vacantly {{on one of his}} fingers. He was strangely sluggish and strangely silent.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Locket, grave now, worried with a <b>paper-knife</b> the crevice of a drawer. [...] "It's very odd. But to {{be worth}} {{anything}} such documents should be subjected to a searching criticism--I mean of the historical kind." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Davenant {{looked at}} her visitor a moment. 'Lord, what an ass!' she then ejaculated, putting the <b>paper-knife</b> into her book to keep her place. 'And whom has she persuaded to take her--Charles Crispin?' she added.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the stately room now, silence only broken by the tap-tap of the ivory <b>paper-knife</b> with which M. le Comte was still nervously fidgeting. M. Fourier was wiping the {{perspiration}} from his overheated brow.|$|E
60|$|They opened drawer after drawer; files upon {{files of}} letters and {{business}} papers, accurately folded and filed. Suddenly Alice uttered a little cry, {{and picked up a}} quaint ivory <b>paper-knife</b> lying {{at the bottom of a}} drawer.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey absently {{took up a}} <b>paper-knife.</b> Still {{with his}} head down, he began shaving off the topmost layer of paper from the {{blotting-pad}} under his hand. Still with his head down, he abruptly broke the silence in a whisper.|$|E
60|$|As {{the sorcerer}} spoke, he deftly turned his hand palm downwards, and the <b>paper-knife</b> fell {{with a crash}} and a clatter on the floor. It was terrible to see the dumb wrath of the swathed figure at this new defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suggested}} at {{the last}} rehearsal and at the rehearsal before and the rehearsal before that, that, on that line, you, should pick up the <b>paper-knife</b> and toy negligently with it. You did it yesterday, and to-day you've forgotten it again." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned forward}} to replace the <b>paper-knife</b> on the table, and, after blowing his nose with some emphasis, put the {{handkerchief}} {{back in his pocket}} and sat listening with a judicial air for anything that his chief clerk might wish to put before him.|$|E
60|$|I fixed {{him with}} my eye for about three seconds, as he sat groaning and wriggling in his chair. When I'd done fixing him, I gave another rap with my <b>paper-knife</b> {{on the table to}} startle him up a bit. Then I went on.|$|E
