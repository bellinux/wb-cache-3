40|$|Leukemia can {{be viewed}} as a newly formed, {{abnormal}} hematopoietic tissue initiated by a few leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that undergo an aberrant and poorly regulated process of organogenesis analogous to that of normal hematopoietic stem cells. A hallmark of all cancers is the capacity for unlimited self-renewal, which is also a defining characteristic of normal stem cells. Given this shared attribute, it has been proposed that leukemias may be initiated by transforming events that take place in hematopoietic stem cells. Alternatively, leukemias may also arise from more committed progenitors caused by mutations and/or selective expression of genes that enhance their otherwise limited self-renewal capabilities. Identifying the LSCs for each type of leukemia is a current challenge and a critical step in understanding their respective biologies and may provide key insights into more effective treatments.

40|$|Aims : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the prognostic significance of focal chromogranin A (cgA) expression in prostate cancer in a series of cases with autopsy-verified cause of death. Methods and Results : Seventy seven autopsy-verified cases of prostate cancer were identified, 41 cases with metastatic disease and 36 with nonmetastatic disease at autopsy. Immunohistochemical analysis for cgA was performed in 40 cases on the archived diagnostic biopsies taken during the patients′ lifetime. After exclusion of a single case of carcinoid tumor, 14 of the 18 (78 %) metastatic and none of the 21 (0 %) nonmetastatic tumors showed focal neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). The Gleason score and focal cgA expression further increased the accuracy of the prediction of the outcome, as all the cases with focal NED associated with high Gleason score had metastatic disease in contrast to cases without cgA-expression and low Gleason score, all of which were non-metastatic. Conclusions : Focal NED seems to be a <b>powerful</b> negative <b>prognostic</b> parameter in prostate adenocarcinomas.

40|$|Telomere {{dysfunction}} and fusion {{can drive}} genomic instability and clonal evolution in human tumours, including breast cancer. Telomere length {{is a critical}} determinant of telomere function and has been evaluated as a prognostic marker in several tumour types, but {{it has yet to}} be used in the clinical setting. Here we show that high-resolution telomere length analysis, together with a specific telomere fusion threshold, is highly prognostic for overall survival in a cohort of patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (n = 120). The telomere fusion threshold defined a small subset of patients with an extremely poor clinical outcome, with a median survival of less than 12 months (HR = 21. 4 (7. 9 – 57. 6), P < 0. 0001). Furthermore, this telomere length threshold was independent of ER, PGR, HER 2 status, NPI, or grade and was the dominant variable in multivariate analysis. We conclude that the fusogenic telomere length threshold provides a <b>powerful,</b> independent <b>prognostic</b> marker with clinical utility in breast cancer.

40|$|Prognostic {{stratification}} in {{squamous cell}} carcinoma (SCC) {{of the head and}} neck has traditionally relied on the pathological staging of a tumour, but it is increasingly being recognised that host-related factors have an important role in the assessment of survival and recurrence. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of systemic inflammation scores including the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for oral SCC. We retrospectively identified 178 patients who had curative operations for cancer of the oral cavity and soft palate between January 2006 and April 2011. Among the inclusion criteria were preoperative estimates of C-reactive protein and serum albumin. We analysed established pathological prognostic factors and scores for systemic inflammation as predictors of cancer-specific and overall survival. On univariate analysis, the mGPS was a significant predictor of both cancer-specific (p &# 60;  0. 001) and overall survival (p &# 60;  0. 001), and it remained an independent predictor of cancer-specific (HR: 2. 12, 95 % CI 1. 49 to 3. 00; p &# 60;  0. 001) and overall survival (HR: 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 2. 31; p =  0. 001) on Cox regression analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies on}} {{prognostic}} factors in stage I invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma {{have been too}} small for robust conclusions to be reached. We undertook a retrospective study in a large international database to identify the most important prognostic variables. METHODS: 1545 patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage I) were included. The records of these patients were examined and data extracted for univariate and multivariate analysis of disease-free survival in relation to various clinical and pathological variables. FINDINGS: The multivariate analyses identified degree of differentiation as the most <b>powerful</b> <b>prognostic</b> indicator of disease-free survival (moderately vs well differentiated hazard ratio 3. 13 [95 % CI 1. 68 - 5. 85], poorly vs well differentiated 8. 89 [4. 96 - 15. 9]), followed by rupture before surgery (2. 65 [1. 53 - 4. 56]), rupture during surgery (1. 64 [1. 07 - 2. 51]), FIGO 1973 stage Ib vs Ia 1. 70 [1. 01 - 2. 85]) and age (per year 1. 02 [1. 00 - 1. 03]). When {{the effects of these}} factors were accounted for, none of the following were of prognostic value: histological type, dense adhesions, extracapsular growth, ascites, FIGO stage 1988, and size of tumour. INTERPRETATION: Degree of differentiation, the most <b>powerful</b> <b>prognostic</b> indicator in stage I ovarian cancer, should be used in decisions on therapy in clinical practice and in the FIGO classification of stage I ovarian cancer.

40|$|Abstract: In the 21 st century cardiac disease {{remains the}} single largest cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity. Despite numerous strides in the medication and technology to manage this disease, {{there has not been}} a significant change in the mortality rate. This fact is further heightened in patients with end-stage renal disease. The catheter interventions to improve the blood supply by revascularization procedures both for the cardiac and kidney revascularization have a significant role to play in the symptom alleviation, improving the quality of life and to some extent reduce the morbidity. The Author has tried to focus the attention to the improvement in technology in various catheter procedures in patients of end-stage renal disease and brought out the benefits in reducing the mortality due to cardiovascular disease in particular and renal disease in patients of ESRD. Cardiac diseases remain {{the single largest}} cause of mortality in ESRD population. The burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, however, is not restricted to the ESRD population. It has become increasingly apparent that the presence of severe chronic kidney disease is not only a <b>powerful</b> independent <b>prognostic</b> factor for prediction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but also a multiplier for the risk of death.

40|$|Angiogenesis, {{the process}} {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of new blood vessels from a preexisting vascular network, is necessary for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Data from experimental and clinical studies indicate that breast carcinoma is an angiogenesisdependent tumor. Most retrospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of determination of intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) at the vascular “hot spot ” (a surrogate marker of angiogenesis) found that IMD is a significant and independent prognostic indicator in patients with both node-negative and node-positive breast cancers. More recently, the expression of certain endothelial growth factors has been tested. Among these, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most potent endothelial cell mitogen and also a regulator of vascular permeability, is emerging as a <b>powerful</b> new <b>prognostic</b> tool. Eight of the nine published retrospective studies reported that VEGF is significantly associated with relapse-free survival, overall survival, or both. Patients with early stage breast cancer who have tumors with elevated levels of VEGF have a higher likelihood of recurrence or death than patients with lowangiogenic tumors, even if treated with conventional adjuvant therapy. High levels of VEGF can differentiate the subgroups of patients with breast cancer with poor prognosis who benefit minimally from conventional adjuvant therapy but who may benefit from validated anti-VEGF treatments.
