50|$|The flight {{instrumentation}} system {{is composed of}} a primary instrumentation package and an auxiliary package. The <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The {{instrumentation system}} is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine instrumentation system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the auxiliary package will not interfere with the measurement capability of the <b>primary</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of food being tainted by packaging, ranging from {{compounds}} in the <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> migrating into the food, through taints arising from the inks or secondary packaging such as corrugated cartons, to pallets and containers. Much of our knowledge about the origin and nature of these taints was based on research performed in the 1970 s and 1980 s; since then there have been relatively few reports in the literature. However, {{this does not mean that}} tainting is no longer a problem. On the contrary, taints from, for example, organohalogens and photoinitiators are still occurring and few companies take the necessary precautions to avoid such taints. This paper will review recent cases of tainting of food from packaging with particular emphasis on organohalogens and photoinitiators and describe ways in which the food industry can avoid such taints...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test and compare Monolayer, Amosorb 2 %, and Multilayer 3 % PET wine jugs for package integrity and mechanical properties. In addition, two secondary package configurations were tested and analyzed. The first a shipper with load bearing inserts, the second configuration consisted of no inserts. Further, both shipping configurations and PET material have different costs associated. A Monolayer PET bottle has a savings of 17 % a case compared to Amosorb and Multilayer PET bottle substrate. Shippers not utilizing inserts are $. 20 less per case. The analysis was broken into three test and result phases. Phase I used compression testing to compare PET variables with two different shipper configurations. One shipper configuration was tested with load bearing inserts, the second with no inserts. The minimum compression force calculated was 500 lbs (based on warehouse stacking). Phase II testing included drop and vibration for secondary package configurations. Phase III tested <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> compression strength and drop testing. The results concluded both shipper configurations met the minimum 500 lbs compression force. Therefore a shipper with no insert is recommended for a savings of $. 20 a case. Multilayer PET did not pass performance testing due to delaminating.

40|$|In Colombia, {{the small}} and medium farmers are {{responsible}} for the production of nearly 45. 000 t yr- 1 of lulo (Solanum quitoense). However adequate and easy techniques for postharvest handling are not often available to be implemented by this sector of the producers. This research aimed to study banana (Musa paradisiaca) leaf as primary packaging to minimize the loss of quality of lulo stored at different temperatures. Chemical and physiological quality parameters were considered in the analysis of the maturation process. Loss weight, color changes in CIELAB coordinates, total titratable acidity (TTA), Young’s modulus and firmness were measured to represent the fruit quality. Use of banana leaf as <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> show that weight losses and the color changes result of the ripening process were decreased. The color changes of lulo skin were significantly affected by storage temperature. To avoid changes in TTA, mechanical damage is not recommended. When the lulo fruits were packed with banana leaves, the Young’s modulus and firmness values was higher. The results of this research allow the comparison of quality of lulo in the packaging proposal and the results of others researchers who use conventionally packaging like wood crates and carton packaging. The proposal packaging configuration (lulos packed with banana leaf in plastic crates of 80 × 60 × 20 cm) is an easy alternative to get and preserve the quality of lulo fruits for a longer storage time...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{substantial}} evidence of poor dispensing practices with inadequate {{packaging and labelling}} of medicines, and limited advice on their usage in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We examined the labelling and packaging of medicines identified during a survey of 1322 households in six regions of Sri Lanka between 2010 and 2013 conducted using the World Health Organization (WHO) methodology for household surveys. We compared medicines obtained from public and private sources and asked interviewees if they understood how to take the medicines. Methods: Packaging was considered adequate when the <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> was an envelope or closable container holding only one medicine. Adequate labels were legible and included medicine name, dose and expiration date. Interviewers assessed whether respondents knew how to take the medicines. Results: Of 1322 households, 1253 households (94. 8 %) {{had at least one}} medicine; 84 % were classified as western medicines and 16 % traditional medicines. Of 5756 western medicines identified, 82. 1 % were adequately packaged, 43. 3 % adequately labelled and 41. 4 % both adequately packaged and labelled. Participants stated that they understood the label and knew how to take 96 % of the medicines. Private medicine sources had more adequately packaged medicines than public sources (87. 7 % vs 73. 5 %; OR 2. 58, 95 % CI 2. 23, 2. 99) and more adequately labelled medicines (52. 2 % vs 27. 4 %; OR 2. 90, 95 % CI 2. 57, 3. 26). Conclusions: Inadequate packaging and labelling of medicines remain a concern in Sri Lanka. Commitment to Good Pharmacy Practices, investments in staff education and training and adequate dispensing resources (containers and labels), particularly in the public sector, are needed to address sub-optimal dispensing practices. Ageing populations with more chronic diseases requiring polypharmacy and complex medicine regimens increase the need for appropriately packaged and labelled medicines...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} a specific problem faced {{by a company}} in the food industry, although all food companies face similar issues. In {{an effort to reduce}} costs, the pursuit to down-gauge packaging materials is constant. In the case of this study, the <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> of a dairy product is being considered for reduction from the current 57 mil thickness to 52 mils. In the past, as the material was down-gauged from 62 mils, a loss in material strength and an increase in damage were observed. Initial research into the issue by line personnel found that the increase in damage was occurring when the forming equipment stopped running and material was held in the hydrogen peroxide (H 202) and heating tunnels for extended amounts of time. Further investigation confirmed that extended durations of the material submerged in the H 202 sterilization tank caused the material to embrittle. Therefore, this study was constructed {{to determine the effects of}} H 202 on two materials, polystyrene and polypropylene, and at two thickness 2 ̆ 7, 57 and 52 mils, and 55 and 50 mils, respectively. The materials were exposed to increasing durations of H 202, 0 time, 20 seconds, 60 seconds, 120 seconds, 300 seconds, 600 seconds, 1200 seconds, and subsequently tested for tensile strength, elongation, and modulus of elasticity. It was expected that these properties would decrease as the exposure was increased, but the results did not demonstrate that. The polystyrene based material exhibited very little, or no, change in mechanical properties that could be attributed to H 202. Indications were that any variations in mechanical properties were based more on other factors, such as materials impurities or variations in the extrusion process, than the exposure to H 202. The polypropylene based material did exhibit some relation between material properties and exposure to H 202. Although these changes were very small and left significant doubt as to their negative impact in the aseptic process...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{therapeutics}} {{are often}} stored as lyophilisate {{to guarantee the}} stability over a longer period. To obtain the solution applicable into the patient, the lyophilisate has to be reconsituted. Protein adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> {{can lead to a}} loss in protein concentration in solution. The decreasing protein content is an issue for the therapy success {{as well as for the}} pharmaceutical industry. The adsorption of various therapeutic proteins to different kinds of <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> has already been described in literature. Due to different properties of the protein and the surface of the <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> as well as due to various formulation parameters, a prediction of the adsorbed amount could not be made. Using the model protein BSA, in the presented work the following three analytical methods were developed to quantify the adsorbed protein amount to different primary packaging: •	Coomassieblue-Assay •	Micro BCA-Assay •	SE-HPLC method The calibration curves of the Coomassieblue-Assay not only depended on the used <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> but also on the pH value of the incubated solution. For this reason, a new calibration curve would be necessary for every varying <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> or for every differing formulation parameter. Due to the high effort, the Micro BCA-Assay as well as the SE-HPLC method was used to determine the adsorbed BSA amount. Owing to the simultaneous variation of different factors, the statistical tool "'design of experiments"' represents a fast and efficient approach to analyse for example the influence of various factors on the adsorbed amount of BSA. Moreover, the statistical experimental design can identify interactions of factors. This is another advantage compared to the conventional experimental planning, where only one factor is varied at a time. Thus, in the presented work a central composite design was used to identify significant factors and interactions on the adsorbed BSA amount. Furthermore, using the statistical design of experiments, the practicability of the developed methods could be confirmed. The influence of the following factors on the BSA adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> was analysed: •	BSA initial concentration •	Ionic strength of the buffer •	Incubation temperature •	Incubation time •	Vial type The adsorbed BSA amount, measured by the Micro BCA Assay as well as the SE-HPLC, was applied as target value. In all experiments the pH value was adjusted to the isoelectric point of BSA to guarantee measureable adsorbed amounts for both methods. The use of statistical experimental design identified the significant influence of the following factors on the adsorbed BSA amount: •	BSA initial concentration •	Ionic strength of the buffer •	Vial type •	Interaction between the ionic strength of the buffer and the vial type The vial type had the biggest impact on the adsorbed value. Summing up, this work presents methods for the fast and cost-effective determination of the protein adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging.</b> Moreover, the "'design of experiments"' is an effective approach to identify potential influence factors on the protein adsorption...|$|R
