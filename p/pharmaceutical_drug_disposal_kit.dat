40|$|Geographic {{patterns}} of diseases across time are of critical interest {{for public health}} monitoring and policy. Availability of information from which to derive estimates of disease patterns, however, is generally very limited, either in terms of geographic or population coverage, or both. By contrast, availability of information on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> dispensing is very robust. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> information, although not directly indicative of disease, may provide useful surrogate information about disease patterns. The nature of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> information presents new challenges in terms of developing appropriate estimates of geographic distributions. This paper discusses <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> information obtained from retail pharmacies, presents a set of basic models for consideration, examines the application of basic models for one pharmaceutical product, and outlines future research...|$|R

40|$|Foreword: Within {{the context}} of the National Drug Strategy 2010 - 2015, the National <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Drug</b> Misuse Framework for Action {{identifies}} national priorities and provides a guide for actions to minimise the harms to individuals, families and communities from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse. The goals of the Framework are: 	To reduce the misuse of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> and associated harms in Australia; and 	To enhance the quality use of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> without stigmatisation or limiting their accessibility for therapeutic use. The Framework provides a holistic approach, in keeping with the complex range of factors that contribute to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse. The priority areas identified for action were informed by an extensive national consultation process involving written submissions, consultation workshops, a review of the literature, discussions with key experts and guidance from an Expert Reference Group and a Project Steering Committee. The nine priority areas are: 	Coordinated medication management system; 	Supporting prescribers; 	Supporting pharmacists and other health professionals; 	Regulation and monitoring; 	Structural factors; 	Health information and other consumer responses; 	Treatment and harm reduction; 	Technological responses; and 	Data, research and evaluation. Responsibility for implementing the actions outlined in the National <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Drug</b> Misuse Framework for Action will be shared by all governments, recognising that jurisdictions face different challenges and will undertake actions in line with their own priorities, timing and resources...|$|R

40|$|The Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA) {{notes the}} following: 1. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse refers to any use of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> that is {{inconsistent}} with the intended use or directions [1]. This may include: a. Overuse, where a therapeutic drug is being used at higher doses or for a longer duration than prescribed or directed. b. Intentional misuse, where <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> are used, often in large doses, for their intoxicating effects, or to enhance the intoxicating effects of other substances (also referred to as non-medical use). c. Diversion, where prescribed <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> are transferred from the original user to others through on-sale via illegal markets for profit. 2. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse in Australia is common and ranks highly among other forms of illicit drug misuse. In 2007, 3. 6 % of Australians aged 14 years or older had used pharmaceuticals such as analgesics, tranquillisers or steroids for non-medical purposes in the previous 12 months [2]. Misuse of analgesics (2. 5 %) was the third {{most common form of}} illicit drug use, behind marijuana/cannabis (9. 1 %) and ecstasy (3. 5 %) use, and ahead of more readily identified drugs o...|$|R

Previously considered untreatable, in recent years several <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> have been identified for treatment of nystagmus.

40|$|We {{explore the}} misuse of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs</b> in the Australian workforce, {{focusing}} on whether any differences exist between workers in particular industries or occupations. In terms of industry, being employed in hospitality is positively associated with <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse, while being employed in finance, insurance and retail is inversely related. In terms of occupation, we find that being a labourer is positively related to misuse of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drugs,</b> while being employed in managerial, professional, sales, clerical or administrative roles {{is associated with a}} lower tendency. Further analysis of occupational effects revealed that being in a blue-collar occupation, as a whole, is positively related to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>drug</b> misuse relative to white-collar employment. Moreover, being employed in higher status roles is associated with a lower likelihood of such behaviour. Our findings imply that particular workplace pressures, cultural norms and/or working conditions might be influential factors behind workers&# 039; drug misuse...|$|R
