5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either <b>proximal</b> compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single <b>proximal</b> scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with <b>proximal</b> DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with <b>proximal</b> DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked <b>proximal</b> DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The holotype FMNH PR1821 is {{the only}} fully {{described}} specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7-10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a <b>proximal</b> radius; a <b>proximal</b> ulna; a partial ilium; a <b>proximal</b> pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the distal end of a tibia; the distal end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum. In 2013, new material of Cryolophosaurus was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material {{has not yet been}} published in a non-abstract form.|$|E
5|$|While {{most highly}} {{expressed}} in the liver, sEH is also expressed in other tissues including vascular endothelium, leukocytes, red blood cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes and the kidney <b>proximal</b> tubule.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which the toes spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus has disappeared, with the <b>proximal</b> tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|E
5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on the {{presumption}} that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute <b>proximal</b> DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested. NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute <b>proximal</b> DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|Kidneys: renal tubular {{acidosis}} (Type 2), {{a disorder}} of bicarbonate handling by the <b>proximal</b> tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).|$|E
5|$|Personal pronouns {{exist for}} the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (<b>proximal</b> and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include {{interrogative}} pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.|$|E
5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of <b>proximal</b> tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|The APOA5 gene resides on {{chromosome}} 11 at {{the band}} 11q23 and contains 4 exons and 3 introns. This gene uses alternate polyadenylation sites and is located <b>proximal</b> to the apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11q23.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of <b>proximal</b> DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of <b>proximal</b> DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The <b>proximal</b> {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the <b>proximal</b> part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E
25|$|Fascicle ends {{nearest the}} deep MG {{aponeurosis}} (Achilles tendon) showed {{an increase in}} strain from the <b>proximal</b> to distal portions of the MG muscle. The converse {{was seen in the}} fascicle ends adjacent to the superficial aponeurosis, which decreased in fiber strain from <b>proximal</b> to distal portions of the MG muscle. These trends may have been due to changes in CSA of the muscle at the <b>proximal</b> and distal ends of the MG, resulting in regions of high stress and strain concentration.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Bennett fracture, the <b>proximal</b> {{metacarpal}} fragment remains attached to the anterior oblique ligament, which in turn is attached to the tubercle of the trapezium bone of the CMC joint. This ligamentous attachment ensures that the <b>proximal</b> fragment remains in its correct anatomical position.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{suspected}} conditions require specific projections. For example, skeletal {{signs of}} rickets are seen predominantly at sites of rapid growth, including the <b>proximal</b> humerus, distal radius, distal femur {{and both the}} <b>proximal</b> and the distal tibia. Therefore, a skeletal survey for rickets can be accomplished with anteroposterior radiographs of the knees, wrists, and ankles.|$|E
25|$|The 500mg of FLCs {{produced}} per day by {{the normal}} lymphoid system, however, flows through the glomeruli and is completely processed by the <b>proximal</b> tubules. If the <b>proximal</b> tubules of the nephrons are damaged or stressed (such as in hard exercise), filtered FLCs may not be completely metabolised and small amounts may then appear in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Minority status {{leads to}} {{increased}} exposure to <b>proximal</b> stressors, due to distal stressors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proximal</b> muscle {{weakness}} {{can be seen}} in Cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Neck: It is the {{smallest}} part (0.03 ×10−6 m), and has a <b>proximal</b> and distal centriole. The <b>proximal</b> centriole enters into the egg during fertilisation and starts the first cleavage division of the egg, which has no centriole. The distal centriole gives rise to axial filament which forms the tail and has (9+2) arrangement. A transitory membrane called Manchette lies in middle piece.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proximal</b> RTA (pRTA) {{is caused}} by a failure of the <b>proximal</b> tubular cells to reabsorb {{filtered}} bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the alpha intercalated cells can produce H+ to acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the <b>proximal</b> tubular cells called Fanconi syndrome, in which there is also phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, uricosuria, and tubular proteinuria.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to standard IQ tests {{originated in the}} writings of psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) from his last two years of work. The notion of the zone of <b>proximal</b> development that he introduced in 1933, roughly a year before his death, served as the banner for his proposal to diagnose development as the level of actual development that can be measured by the child's independent problem solving and, at the same time, the level of <b>proximal,</b> or potential development that is measured in the situation of moderately assisted problem solving by the child. The maximum level of complexity and difficulty of the problem that the child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates the level of potential development. Then, the difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of <b>proximal</b> development. Combination of the two indexesthe level of actual and the zone of the <b>proximal</b> developmentaccording to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone.|$|E
25|$|Glycine, proline and {{hydroxyproline}} {{share common}} renal tubular mechanisms of reabsorption, a function {{specific to the}} <b>proximal</b> tubule. Both reabsorption or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the <b>proximal</b> tubule or intestinal brush border epithelium. The more selective transport of proline and other imino acids is driven {{at the molecular level}} by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.|$|E
25|$|Intussusceptum {{refers to}} the <b>proximal</b> section of rectal wall, which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum (termed the intussuscipiens). What results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlaid. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the <b>proximal</b> wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is {{the wall of the}} intussusceptum folded back on itself, and the outer is the distal rectal wall, the intussuscipiens.|$|E
25|$|Metastatic cancer {{deposits}} in the <b>proximal</b> femur may weaken {{the bone and}} cause a pathological hip fracture.|$|E
25|$|Minority {{individuals}} suffer {{adverse health}} outcomes, which {{are caused by}} exposure to <b>proximal</b> and distal stressors.|$|E
25|$|Varus and valgus {{correspond}} to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector {{relative to the}} <b>proximal</b> segment's vector.|$|E
25|$|During {{mandible}} development, {{most of it}} {{is formed}} through intramembranous ossification, where endochondral ossification will occur in the <b>proximal</b> region.|$|E
25|$|The dorsal blood supply, {{particularly}} of the <b>proximal</b> portion, is highly variable. Sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis {{emerge from the}} tubercle.|$|E
25|$|As with Standard Japanese, demonstratives {{also occur}} in the ko- (<b>proximal),</b> so- (mesial), and a- (distal) series, with the {{corresponding}} interrogative form as do-.|$|E
25|$|The {{arterial}} cone {{is closed}} by the infundibular cushions. The trunk cones are closed by the forming of an infundibulotroncal septum, {{which is made}} from a straight <b>proximal</b> portion and distal spiral portion. Then, the narrowest portion of the aorta is in the left and dorsal portion. The distal portion of the aorta is pushed forward to the right. The <b>proximal</b> pulmonary artery is right and ventral, and the distal portion of the pulmonary artery is in the left dorsal portion.|$|E
25|$|The first {{surgical}} approach {{consists in}} the resection and primary anastomosis. This {{first stage of}} surgery is performed on patients with a well vascularized, nonedematous and tension-free bowel. The <b>proximal</b> margin should be an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula <b>proximal</b> to the descending or sigmoid colon are unlikely to result in further symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The growing part of {{the nail}} is under the skin at the nail's <b>proximal</b> end under the epidermis, {{which is the only}} living part of a nail.|$|E
25|$|In {{prolonged}} acidosis, PEPCK-C is upregulated in renal <b>proximal</b> tubule brush border cells, {{in order}} to secrete more NH3 and thus to produce more HCO3−.|$|E
25|$|Amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium {{dependent}} transporters in the <b>proximal</b> tubule. Hartnup {{disease is}} a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in pellagra.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} yoga asana, when {{entering}} an asana, distal body parts are best arranged first, progressively adjusting inwards and putting <b>proximal</b> body parts in place last.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the <b>proximal</b> part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the {{adjoining}} oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. <b>Proximal</b> half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the <b>proximal</b> half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the <b>proximal</b> half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
