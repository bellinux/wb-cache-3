40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the study}} was {{applying}} machine learning methods to create rules for prediction of the surface scaling resistance of concrete modified with high-calcium fly ash. To determine the scaling durability the Boras method, according to European Standard procedure (PKN- CEN/TS 12390 - 9 : 2007), was used. The results of numeral experiments were utilized as a training set to generate rules indicating the relation between material composition and the scaling resistance.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{generate}} rules for the prediction of the chloride resistance of concrete modified with high calcium fly ash using machine learning methods. The rapid chloride permeability test, according to the Nordtest Method Build 492, was used for determining the chloride ions’ penetration in concrete containing high calcium fly ash (HCFA) for partial replacement of Portland cement. The results of the performed tests were used as the training set to generate rules describing the relation between material composition and the chloride resistance. Multiple methods for rule generation were applied and compared. The rules generated by algorithm J 48 from the Weka workbench provided the means for adequate classification of <b>plain</b> <b>concretes</b> and concretes modified with high calcium fly ash as materials of good, acceptable or unacceptable resistance to chloride penetration...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fortified}} houses {{took the}} form of a blockhouse on the ground floor with a light residential superstructure providing living quarters for the crew manning the blockhouse. Their armament consisted principally of light arms fired from a number of firing ports and embrasures, augmented by light anti-tank weapons. Fortified houses were sited close to the frontier, typically in a location that commanded the cross-border road. Blockhouses were <b>plain</b> <b>concrete</b> structures, providing little to nothing in the way of living quarters for their crews. Blockhouses typically displayed the rounded edges and shielded firing positions characteristic of artillery casemates and combat blocks of the Maginot ouvrages built by CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency, but were usually built under non-CORF direction. Casemates tended to be built by CORF as part of the integrated Maginot defenses, and frequently mounted heavier weapons, of up to 75mm caliber. [...] Both casemates and blockhouses could have infantry cloches or cupolas for observation and protected small-arms fire.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{era when}} {{municipal}} water supply systems {{had not yet been}} established, Monier realised that his containers could be used for the collection and storage of water for gardens. He continued his education with courses in horticulture and landscape gardening. In 1849, without quitting his post at the Tuileries, he opened a small workshop, and began to take on landscaping projects. These took him as far afield as Strasburg. The fashion at the time was to decorate large gardens with rockeries and grottoes and to form these from <b>plain</b> <b>concrete.</b> For further economy, formed hollow artificial boulders from his ferro-cement (French: [...] "ciment et fer"). He also created small garden pavilions, shaping and carving the concrete surface to imitate the rustic wooden originals. In July 1867 he exhibited his ideas at the second Paris International Exhibition (Exposition universelle). In the same month he applied for his first patent for containers, which was granted as No. 77165. Soon after he applied for an addition covering pipes, and yet another for ornamental pools. His projects included a 20 cubic metre reservoir and a terrace roof. By 1869 his establishment included offices, workshops, and greenhouses, plus stables for eight draught horses and three carriage horses. In September of that year he applied for a patent for panels suitable for cladding buildings, and for use as pavers and tiles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plain</b> cement <b>concrete,</b> ground {{granulated}} {{blast furnace}} slag (GGBS) concrete, and fly ash concrete were designed. Three wet curing periods were employed, which were 2, 5, and 8 days. The drying shrinkage values of the concretes were measured within 1 year after wet curing. The {{results show that the}} increasing rate of the drying shrinkage of concrete containing a mineral admixture at late age is higher than that of <b>plain</b> cement <b>concrete</b> regardless of the wet curing time. With the reduction of wet curing time, the increment of total drying shrinkage of concrete decreases with the decrease of the W/B ratio. The negative effects on the drying shrinkage of fly ash concrete due to the reduction of the wet curing time are much more obvious than those of GGBS <b>concrete</b> and <b>plain</b> cement <b>concrete.</b> Superfine ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (SGGBS) can reduce the drying shrinkage of GGBS concrete and fly ash concrete when the wet curing time is insufficient...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of condensed water in concrete on the fracture mechanism of a concrete structure. The focus {{of this study is}} water pressure in concrete pores under loading with a high strain rate. First, uniaxial compression tests of saturated cylinder specimens containing various types of micro pore structures were conducted with different strain rates. The saturated concretes, especially those of low water-cement ratios, increased compression strength with increasing strain rate. Second, bending tests of rectangular beam specimens with and without rebar were conducted with different strain rates. As the strain rate increased, <b>plain</b> <b>concretes</b> and reinforced concretes showed an increase in tensile strength. These results suggest that dynamic responses of concrete structures are influenced by the strain rate dependency of material that is correlated with water content and micro pore structure...|$|R

50|$|A {{dowel bar}} {{retrofit}} (DBR) {{is a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel dowel bars in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed <b>plain</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E

Today, a majority of US state agencies build jointed plain pavements.|$|E

40|$|Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is a {{material}} obtained by adding fibers {{to the concrete}} matrix. Fibers resist the crack opening and develop tensile residual strength. The extensive research activity carried out over the last decades on FRC has shown that such material has enhanced mechanical and durability properties as compared to <b>plain</b> <b>concretes</b> (PC) due to the cracking control. In fact, FRC flexural members show a higher number of cracks with reduced width; this occurrence involves an improved mechanical behaviour mostly under service conditions and a higher durability due to the reduced attacks of aggressive agents and to the more controlled effect of long terms phenomena. The experimental study presented herein discusses the long-term behaviour of FRC flexural beams subjected to sustained service load and environmental exposure up to 72 months. The effects of different short fibers (polyester and steel), sustained loading and aging were investigated. The results show the beneficial effects of fibers in terms of reduced crack width and increased flexural stiffness. The experimental data on cracking behaviour are finally compared with the analytical predictions obtained according to the formulation provided by fib Model Code 201...|$|R
