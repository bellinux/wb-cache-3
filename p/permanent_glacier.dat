40|$|During primary {{colonization}} of rock substrates by plants, mineral weathering is strongly accelerated under plant roots, but {{little is known}} on how it affects soil ecosystem development before plant establishment. Here we show that rock mineral weathering mediated by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria is associated to plant community formation in sites recently released by <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier</b> ice cover in the Midtre Lovénbreen glacier moraine (78 ° 53 _N), Svalbard. Increased soil fertility fosters growth of prokaryotes and plants at the boundary between sites of intense bacterial mediated chemolithotrophic iron-sulfur oxidation and pH decrease, and the common moraine substrate where carbon and nitrogen are fixed by cyanobacteria. Microbial iron oxidizing activity determines acidity and corresponding fertility gradients, where water retention, cation exchange capacity and nutrient availability are increased. This fertilization is enabled by abundant mineral nutrients and reduced forms of iron and sulfur in pyrite minerals within a conglomerate type of moraine rock. Such an interaction between microorganisms and moraine minerals determines a peculiar, not yet described model for soil genesis and plant ecosystem formation with potential past and present analogues in other harsh environments with similar geochemical settings...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{situation of}} the Tarim River basin in China seriously declined since the early 1950 s, mainly due to a strong increase in water abstraction for irrigation purposes. To restore the ecological system and support sustainable development of the Tarim River basin region in China, more hydrological studies are demanded to properly understand the processes of the watershed and efficiently manage the water resources. Such studies are, however, complicated due to the limited data availability, especially in the mountainous headwater regions of the Tarim River basin. This study investigated the usefulness of remote sensing (RS) data to overcome that lack of data in the spatially distributed hydrological modelling of the basin. Complementary to the conventional station-based (SB) data, the RS products that are directly {{used in this study}} include precipitation, evapotranspiration and leaf area index. They are derived from raw image data of the Chinese Fengyun meteorological satellite and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The MODIS land surface temperature was used to calculate the atmospheric temperature lapse rate to describe the temperature dependency on topographical variations. Moreover, MODIS-based snow cover images were used to obtain model initial conditions and as validation reference for the snow model component. Comparison of model results based on RS input versus conventional SB input exhibited similar results in terms of high and low river runoff extremes, cumulative runoff volumes in both runoff and snow melting seasons and spatial and temporal variability of snow cover. During summer time, when the snow cover shrinks in the <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier</b> region, {{it was found that the}} model resolution influences the model results dramatically, hence, showing the importance of detailed (RS based) spatially distributed input data. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFirn air and ice {{have been}} sampled and {{analyzed}} for trace gases (CO 2, N 2 O, CH 4, and CO) and isotopes (14 C, 13 C, and 18 O of CO 2; 3 H of ice) at 3 m intervals {{from the surface}} to the depth of closure at 60 m on the Devon Island Ice Cap, a low-elevation <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier</b> in the Canadian Arctic Islands, to investigate firn diffusion {{and the effects of}} summer melting. The 14 CO 2 profile from the permeable firn includes the 1963 thermonuclear peak at a depth of 53. 9 ± 1. 5 m. The twofold increase and rapid decay that characterize the recent atmospheric history for 14 CO 2 provide a robust atmospheric scenario that is used with a firn air diffusion model to inversely construct the firn diffusivity profile. The results show a permeable but essentially nondiffusive zone from 50 to 60 m depth. A firn-ice age profile was produced from density measurements, and accumulation rates were calibrated with the depth of the 1963 thermonuclear 3 H peak. The average ages for CO 2 in the sampled firn air profile were determined by a new method based on the rate of 18 O exchange between CO 2 and the ice matrix. Calibrated with the 1963 peak for thermonuclear 14 CO 2, a 21. 2 -year reaction halftime is calculated for exchange taking place at the firn temperature of − 22. 8 °C on Devon. This gives an average age of 54. 9 (+ 6. 0 /− 12. 0) years for firn air at 60 m depth in 140 -year-old ice. Thus CO 2 has a mean age 85 years younger than associated ice at the point of occlusion. The measured δ 18 OCO 2 in firn air provides no indication of alteration by summer melting, which is attributed to a high degree of convective and diffusive flushing of the upper firn as shown by diffusion modeling. This suggests that ice sheets with summer melt layers can reliably preserve atmospheric trace gas signals...|$|E

40|$|Cotopaxi volcano is {{situated}} in the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes and consists of a symmetric volcanic cone that reaches an altitude of 5, 897 m above sea level; it is capped over its upper 1, 000 m by a <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier.</b> The volcano has erupted frequently {{in the past few}} centuries and, according to the archival records, has produced dozens of lahars by catastrophic snow and ice melting during eruptions. In this work, we present a detailed map and a stratigraphic study of the lahar deposits of the past 800 years in two different topographic settings. A thorough knowledge of the tephrostratigraphy of the explosive activity over the same time period was a first-order prerequisite for the complete reconstruction and dating of lahar activity and also allowed us to precisely link lahar units to eruptive phases of individual eruptions. Results indicate that, during the thirteenth to seventeenth centuries, highintensity eruptions (Plinian events or blast-like explosions) produced large debris flows that transported meter-sized boulders. A subsequent period of activity that started in 1742 was characterized by several lahar-generating eruptive episodes that were smaller in scale but with significant variability in size (the 1877 being the smallest and most recent). Analysis of events occurring in the eighteenth century suggests that eruption style affects the volume and energy of the resulting lahars, with different pyroclastic flow types causing different mechanisms of water release from the summit glacier. Lahars produced during this time period were triggered by: (1) dilute pumice and ash-rich radially distributed density currents and (2) column collapse-related radially distributed scoria and lithic-rich pyroclastic-flows. The former produced lahar deposits that are matrix-rich, block-poor, and valley-confined, while the high erosive capacity of the latter produced lahars that are block-rich, highly energetic, and widespread. The youngest (1853 and 1877) lahars were triggered by (3) confined scoria-flow lobes that had less capacity to scour and melt the glacier; resulting flows had lower energy and smaller volumes than lahars produced by eighteenth-century eruptions. We conclude that the dynamics of pyroclastic–density–current can exert a major control on the size and destructive capacity of lahar at ice-capped volcanoes. Moreover, the total extent of the glacier at the moment of eruption, which is commonly considered to exert a major control on lahar formation, may actually be a second-order factor compared with {{the way in which the}} eruptive products interact with the glacier...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to provide}} the scientific methodologies which are required to analyze the availability and variability of water resources inthe arid and semi-arid region of the Tarim river basin in north-west China. The methods consist {{of a combination of}} lumped conceptual and more detailed spatially distributed hydrological models, statistical analysistechniques and remotely sensed (RS) data. They can be applied by the local water authorities to obtain an improved understanding of the water system responses to human activities and as decision support tools (scenario analysis of water management alternatives). The impacts of differentalternative management strategies can be simulated and optimal choices made in support of a sustainable development of the local society. The developed methodologies and tools were applied to study the past and future evolutions in the surface and groundwater resources for two headwater basins and along the downstream river reaches. Giventhe exclusive geographical, meteorological and hydrological features ofthe Tarim basin, and the limited data availability, major challenges were faced {{in the development of the}} methodologies. Based on the specific features of lumped conceptual models and spatially distributed models, the subbasins of the headwaters of the Tarim basin were simulated based on lumped conceptual models, while the downstream area of the main Tarim river was modelled by means of a spatially distributed model. In the downstream area, the runoff contributions from the headwaters cumulate and affect the downstream flow conditions, water availability for irrigation, groundwater resources and vegetation/ecosystems. The construction of the lumped conceptual model was based on a top-down approach, using a step-wise model-structure identification and calibration procedure. This procedure makes use of the results of statistical time series processing (runoff subflow filtering, quick and slow flow hydrograph separation) applied to the available river flow series. The procedure has been extendedto account for the seasonal snow melting and <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier</b> melting in the headwater basins. The seasonal snow melting submodel was added according to an adjusted degree-day equation. The submodel of the <b>permanent</b> <b>glacier</b> melting is based on the cumulative thermal input above a critical temperature value. The advantages of the lumped conceptual models are the fast computations, calibration and validation, its flexible structure and less strict data requirement. The lumped conceptual model is also restricted by its own character that the simulated areas have to own sufficient observation records at their outlets. The spatially distributed model is based on a larger amount of physical information and providesspatially variable results on runoff discharges, groundwater levels, soil water content, etc., but has disadvantages due to the long computational times, the time consuming calibration process, huge (spatial) data needs and related overparameterization. To overcome the data limitation problem, data from the traditional gauging stations were complemented with remotely sensed data from multiple sources. The spatially distributed model was calibrated in the conventional way based on the station data. In a second step, the station based (SB) time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration were replaced by remotely sensed (RS) based series without changing the calibrated parameter values. Additional RS products, for snow cover, LAI and land surface temperature, were used as validation reference or for estimation of specific parameter sets. By comparingthe results from the SB and RS based inputs, it was shown that the RS inputs enable replacement of the SB data. The spatially distributed modelis also used to simulate the interaction between the channel flow and the groundwater. This required a full hydrodynamic model to be implemented for the downstream Tarim river and linked to the spatially distributedmodel. It was found that the channel flow is the unique source to recharge the aquifer. After construction and validation of the hydrological and hydrodynamic models, they were considered useful for scenario impact analysis of climate and landuse changes. Climate scenarios were constructed based on an ensemble approach after statistical analysis of a large set of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulationresults (IPCC AR 4 Archive). After simulation in the models, the impact results of both the lumped conceptual model and spatially distributed model show a significant increase of the daily flow peaks. This is due to snow melting as a result of temperature rise and increase in precipitation in the winter season. Daily low flows show increasing or decreasing trends depending on the climate change scenario considered, hence the lowflow changes being highly uncertain. Although the impact results for the two types of models are similar, there are some differences due to thedifference in model structure. The lumped conceptual model impact results show a lower variation in flow changes in comparison with the spatially distributed model results; hence showing the importance to consider both the uncertainties in the climate scenarios and the influence of differences in model or model type. The landuse change scenarios were derived from historical remotely sensed images of the yearsof 1972, 1990, 2000 and 2007. They were implemented in the spatially distributed model to investigate the landuse change impact on the water availability by emanating the relationship between groundwater storage vs. cumulative leaf area index (LAI) and irrigation area vs. river flow availabilities. It was concluded that the cumulative leaf area index (LAI) / surface vegetation cover highly depends on the groundwater storage. The efficiency to restore the local ecosystem by artificial water assignment is much less than under natural conditions. The expansion of the irrigated farmlands since the 1950 s strongly affected the availability of water resources in a negative way, and boosted relocation of farmland in order to acquire sufficient water resources. nrpages: 171 status: publishe...|$|E

Enhanced precipitation fell as snow in polar latitudes and on mountains as far south as the southern Sierra Nevada.

Plans are formulated to simulate precipitation over Yosemite National Park using MM 5, a conventional mesoscale meteorology model, under strong westerly flow across a warm Pacific Ocean. The warm sea-surface temperature (SST) of the Pacific Ocean in this simulation should produce heavier rainfall at low elevations and snowfall at higher elevations for progressively warmer SSTs. It is anticipated that precipitation rates computed from this simulation will be sufficient to explain the formation of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada over only a few hundred years. Fluctuations in SST during deglaciation are also expected to explain the resurgence of glacial coverage observed in Yosemite National Park similar to the Younger Dryas on the East Coast.
