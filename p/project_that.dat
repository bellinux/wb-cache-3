5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a <b>project</b> <b>that</b> began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale <b>project</b> <b>that</b> required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more damage than initially realized.|$|E

5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>that</b> included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T.

Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related <b>project</b> <b>that</b> {{was once again}} met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E

40|$|Regional {{cooperation}} projects {{between countries}} in the Middle East are expected to provide benefits to all parties involved but their feasibility is subject to social, economic and political constraints. This article uses a database of planned projects {{in the last decade}} and tries to detect types of <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are less sensitive to the constraints. A typology of projects shows the prevalence of two main groups. A first group of projects avoids constraints by focusing on relatively high micro-economic viability but with low intensity of cooperation: these are economic-business projects and some infrastructure <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are based on mere coordination between countries and mostly implemented separately in a single country. A second group of projects are infrastructure and public services <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> involve a number of countries, and implementation through joint planning and management. We conclude that the response to the constraints for regional cooperation is found in the concentration in <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> do not require any intensive continuous contact between the populations, by choosing business <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are implemented separately in each country, or public <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are jointly implemented, but on the basis of cooperation between public officers, not necessarily the population. ...|$|R

5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, the square had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses closing. The original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, the square has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and bars. In 2013 the square underwent another renovation <b>project</b> <b>that</b> rerouted the streets and expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, into a larger pedestrian green space.|$|E

The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected.
