30|$|These results {{stand in}} {{contrast}} to those for students’ career interests {{and the likelihood of}} <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Unlike the career interest analysis, students seeking routine career activities are more likely to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Also, students who ranked career interests involving helping others were more likely to pursue STEM careers, but this analysis showed that student preference for career activities involving helping others and being concerned for their welfare was not a statistically significant indicator of their likelihood to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Further, these results differ somewhat in terms of students’ preferences for practical activities. While career interests involving manual or mechanical skills were not statistical indicators of the likelihood of <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> STEM career, career activities involving practical, productive, and concrete activities were statistically significant. The career activity involving reading, study, analysis, and investigation was also statistically linked to students’ likelihood to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career, which seems reasonable given that such activities {{are at the heart of}} many STEM careers.|$|R
