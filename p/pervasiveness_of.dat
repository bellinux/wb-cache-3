40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} {{is a new}} {{and emerging}} technology. The concept <b>of</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> and its deployment into reality are still not well aligned. This is because the vision <b>of</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> is a highly complex area that encompasses {{a large number of}} issues. The real vision <b>of</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> will never become a reality if everyone involved needs to repeatedly address all the issues involved in the concept. This paper focuses on the DAIDALOS Pervasive Service Platform (PSP) as an enabler of pervasive services. DAIDALOS is an EU Framework Programme 6 Integrated Project with 46 multinational partners from both the industry and academia. The paper details the strategy employed in DAIDALOS to facilitate Service Providers to offer pervasive services on top of the PSP. It argues that pervasiveness should be provided to Service Providers as part of the platform, instead <b>of</b> requiring <b>pervasiveness</b> to be totally embedded in the services themselves. This approach consequently opens up the service provision market to more players, driving the idea of a truly pervasive world. The paper gives an overview of the DAIDALOS platform as a pervasive service enabler, detailing how it facilitates pervasiveness by removing most of the work from the Service Providers themselves...|$|R

We attempt to expose the implications of divided attention via a pedestrian simulation that accounts for mobile device use. Of particular interest is the awareness of users in the pedestrian environment, as this may affect the traffic scenario. Our simulation shows that even {{a small number of}} users interacting with a mobile device can destabilise pedestrian flow. The proportion of attention loss correlates to the degree of disruption. This has implications for the design of pedestrian-focused applications, as our results suggest pervasive mobile use is changing the nature of pedestrian crowd behaviour...|$|R

25|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi {{ordered that}} opium {{should be banned}} in Taiwan as soon as possible. However, due to the <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> opium addiction in Taiwanese society at the time, and {{the social and economic}} problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run narcotics monopoly.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the {{consequences}} of the 1989 political overturn in Romania on the selfhood. To this purpose, I initiate a twofold analysis: the official discourse of both socio-political systems, socialism and liberalism, and the individual’s quotidian discourse. The first one will enable a comparative view, over the ’bottom-up’ constructed realities, and the second will account for the degree <b>of</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> and naturalization <b>of</b> ideological views and, in this way, of a “top-down” identity construction and its configurations. One of the most apprehensible provisions through which liberalism endeavoured to institutionalize its own way of setting out reality is land restitution. Thereafter, I will discuss the way re-appropriation was experienced and its various subjectivization trajectories, but also the wider frame of the postsocialist economic transformations: rethinking work, money, the state and the interrelations between them. This particular angle of sight will disclose the mechanisms through which liberalism has deconstructed the system of socialist meaning and representation, at the same time replacing it with a socio-political order which reconfigured these meanings...|$|R

500|$|Annie Hall {{has been}} cited as a film which uses both therapy and {{analysis}} for comic effect. Sam B. Girgus considers Annie Hall to be a story about memory and retrospection, which [...] "dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious {{in a manner similar}} to psychoanalysis". He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen's deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a [...] "pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation". Girgus believes that proof of the <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> Sigmund Freud in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film. Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie's recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which Frank Sinatra is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud's belief in dreams as [...] "visual representations of words or ideas".|$|E

500|$|Steven Soderbergh was {{motivated}} {{to make an}} [...] "ultra-realistic" [...] film about the public health and scientific response to a pandemic. The movie touches {{on a variety of}} themes, including the factors which drive mass panic and collapse of social order, the scientific process for characterizing and containing a novel pathogen, balancing personal motives against professional responsibilities and rules {{in the face of an}} existential threat, the limitations and consequences of public health responses, and the <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal connections which can serve as vectors to spread disease. Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The movie was intended to realistically convey the [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "unnerving" [...] social and scientific reactions to a pandemic. The recent real-life epidemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film. The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the Nipah virus that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation.|$|E

Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas [...] in order to perform. Pearl Jam’s efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded {{that it was hard}} to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, “The <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.” ...|$|E
500|$|In Brideshead, the proletarian junior officer Hooper {{illustrates}} {{a theme that}} persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the [...] "Age of the Common Man". In the trilogy Sword of Honour [...] (Men at Arms, 1952; Officers and Gentlemen, 1955, Unconditional Surrender, 1961) the social <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character [...] "Trimmer", a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella [...] "Scott-King's Modern Europe" [...] (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: [...] "I {{think it would be}} very wicked, indeed, to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel Love Among the Ruins (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that [...] The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957) stands out ″a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game″. Waugh's final work of fiction, [...] "Basil Seal Rides Again" [...] (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a ″senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth″. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, ″The Balance" [...] of 1926, with a [...] "fusillade of unattributed dialogue".|$|E
