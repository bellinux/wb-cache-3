40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} incorporation of hydrophobic (ie, waxy) material into pellets using a thermal sintering technique and to evaluate the pellets in vitro for controlled release. Pellets prepared by extrusion-spheronization technology were formulated with a water-soluble drug, microcrystalline cellulose, and carnauba wax. Powdered carnauba wax (4 %– 20 %) prepared by grinding or by emulsification was studied with an attempt to retard the drug release. The inclusion of ground or <b>emulsified</b> carnauba <b>wax</b> did <b>not</b> sustain the release of theophylline for more than 3 hours. Matrix pellets of theophylline prepared with various concentrations of carnauba wax were sintered thermally at various times and temperatures.

Pellets <b>prepared</b> with ground <b>wax</b> showed a higher standard deviation than did those <b>prepared</b> with emulsified <b>wax.</b> There was incomplete release at the end of 12 hours for pellets prepared with 20 % ground or emulsified wax. The sintering temperature and duration were optimized to allow for a sustained release lasting at least 12 hours. The optimized temperature and duration were found to be 100 ° and 140 seconds, respectively. The sintered pellets had a higher hydrophobicity than did the unsintered pellets. Scanning electron micrographs indicated that the carnauba wax moved internally, thereby increasing the surface area of wax within the pellets...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} view of planet formation, the final {{assembly}} of the Earth involved giant collisions between proto-planets (> 1000 km radius), with the Moon formed {{as a result of}} one such impact. At this stage the colliding bodies had likely differentiated into a metallic core surrounded by a silicate mantle. During the Moon-forming impact, nearly all metal sank into the Earth's core. We investigate to what extent large self-gravitating iron cores can mix with surrounding silicate and how this influences the short-lived chronometer, Hf–W, used to infer the age of the Moon. We present fluid dynamical models of turbulent mixing in fully liquid systems, attempting to place constraints on the degree of mixing. Erosion of sinking cores driven by Rayleigh–Taylor instability does lead to intimate mixing and equilibration, but large blobs (> 10 km diameter) do <b>not</b> <b>emulsify</b> entirely. Emulsification is enhanced if most of the accreting metal cores deform into thin structures during descent through the Earth's mantle. Yet, only 1 – 20...|$|R

30|$|The {{breaking}} and subsequent gelation of the emulsified gels are critical factors in gelant placement success. Thus, suitable separation and a longer gelation time are required, especially for high-temperature reservoirs, to avoid gelation in the tubing during the placement. Limited data {{have been reported}} regarding the formulation and stability of emulsified gels. In 2006, Stavland et al. studied the emulsification of polyacrylamide and tert-butyl acrylate (PAtBA) cross-linked with polyethylenimine (PEI) into diesel. The system was loaded into a test tube and then heated at 90  °C for a given time, and the relative viscosity of the water phase was subsequently measured at 25  °C. The gelation rate was {{compared with that of}} a reference cross-linked polymer (<b>not</b> <b>emulsified).</b> A slight increase in the gel strength was calculated when the standard cross-linked polymer was tested instead of the emulsified polymers, although no data on the gel strength were presented. A more cost-effective homopolymer, polyacrylamide (PAM), was found to be a suitable replacement for PAtBA (Al-Muntasheri et al. 2007; El-Karsani et al. 2015 a, b). In a recent publication, our group studied the gelation kinetics of an emulsified PAM/PEI system using a thermal analysis technique (Mohamed et al. 2015).|$|R
