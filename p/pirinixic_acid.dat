Since 5 -LO, mPGES 1, PPARÎ±, and PPARÎ³ represent potential anti-cancer drug targets, we here investigated the effects of 39 <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives on prostate cancer (PC- 3) and neuroblastoma (UKF-NB- 3) cell viability and, subsequently, the effects of selected compounds on drug-resistant neuroblastoma cells. Few compounds affected cancer cell viability in low micromolar concentrations but there was no correlation between the anti-cancer effects and the effects on 5 -LO, mPGES 1, PPARÎ±, or PPARÎ³. Most strikingly, <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives interfered with drug transport by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB 1 in a drug-specific fashion. LP 117, the compound that exerted the strongest effect on ABCB 1, interfered in the investigated concentrations of up to 2 Î¼M with the ABCB 1 -mediated transport of vincristine, vinorelbine, actinomycin D, paclitaxel, and calcein- AM but not of doxorubicin, rhodamine 123, or JC- 1. In silico docking studies identified differences in the interaction profiles of the investigated ABCB 1 substrates with the known ABCB 1 binding sites that may explain the substrate-specific effects of LP 117. Thus, <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives may offer potential as drug-specific modulators of ABCB 1 -mediated drug transport...|$|E
40|$|The microsomal {{prostaglandin}} E 2 synthase (mPGES) - 1 {{is one of}} {{the terminal}} isoenzymes of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 biosynthesis. Pharmacological inhibitors of mPGES- 1 are proposed as an alternative to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We recently presented the design and synthesis of a series of <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives that dually inhibit mPGES- 1 and 5 -lipoxygenase. Here, we investigated the mechanism of mPGES- 1 inhibition, the selectivity profile, and the in vivo activity of α-(n-hexyl) - substituted <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> [YS 121; 2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -(2, 3 -dimethylphenylamino) pyrimidin- 2 -ylthio) octanoic acid) ] as a lead compound. In cell-free assays, YS 121 inhibited human mPGES- 1 in a reversible and noncompetitive manner (IC 50 = 3. 4 μM), and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy studies using purified in vitro-translated human mPGES- 1 indicate direct, reversible, and specific binding to mPGES- 1 (KD = 10 - 14 μM). In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human whole blood, PGE 2 formation was concentration dependently inhibited (IC 50 = 2 μM), whereas concomitant generation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 -derived thromboxane B 2 and 6 -keto PGF 1 α and the COX- 1 -derived 12 (S) -hydroxy- 5 -cis- 8, 10 - transheptadecatrienoic acid was not significantly reduced. In carrageenan-induced rat pleurisy, YS 121 (1. 5 mg/kg i. p.) blocked exudate formation and leukocyte infiltration accompanied by reduced pleural levels of PGE 2 and leukotriene B 4 but also of 6 -keto PGF 1 α. Taken together, these results indicate that YS 121 is a promising inhibitor of mPGES- 1 with anti-inflammatory efficiency in human whole blood as well as in vivo...|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{function}} of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms in mammals, we have cloned and characterized two PPAR alpha-related cDNAs (designated PPAR gamma and -delta, respectively) from mouse. The three PPAR isoforms display widely divergent patterns of expression during embryogenesis and in the adult. Surprisingly, PPAR gamma and -delta are not activated by <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> (Wy 14, 643), a potent peroxisome proliferator and activator of PPAR alpha. However, PPAR gamma and -delta are activated by the structurally distinct peroxisome proliferator LY- 171883 and linoleic acid, respectively, indicating {{that each of the}} isoforms can act as a regulated activator of transcription. These data suggest that tissue-specific responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators, including certain fatty acids, is in part a consequence of differential expression of multiple, pharmacologically distinct PPAR isoforms...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} a (PPARa) mediates {{the effects}} of foreign chemical peroxisome proliferators on liver and kidney, including the induction of peroxisomal, mitochon-drial, and microsomal enzymes involved in p 3 -oxidation of fatty acids. However, the role of this receptor in the peroxisome proliferative effects of the endogenous steroid dehydroepi-androsterone (DHEA) is not known. DHEA- 33 -sulfate (DHEA-S) is shown to induce a liver peroxisome proliferative response in rats in vivo at a dose at which DHEA is much less active, {{which is consistent with}} cultured hepatocyte studies indicating a re-quirement for sulfation for the activation of DHEA. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that in contrast to the prototypic foreign chemical peroxisome proliferator <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid,</b> DHEA-S and its 1 7 j 3 -reduced metabolite, 5 -androstene- 3, 1 73 -diol- 3 -sulfate, are inactive in mediating trans-activa...|$|E

A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of such compounds is needed to determine the risk. We present a high confidence human protein-protein association network built upon the integration of chemical toxicology and systems biology. This computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, thus predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. Additionally, the network can be used to identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples are shown for chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer and necrosis, and potential protein targets for di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> and permethrine. The chemical-protein associations are supported through recent published studies, which illustrate the power of our approach that integrates toxicogenomics data with other data types...|$|E
40|$|YS- 121 [2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -(2, 3 -dimethylphenylamino) pyrimidin- 2 -ylthio) octanoic acid] is {{the result}} of target-oriented {{structural}} derivatization of <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid.</b> It is a potent dual PPARα/γ-agonist, as well as a potent dual 5 -LO/mPGES- 1 -inhibitor. Additionally, recent studies showed an anti-inflammatory efficacy in vivo. Because of its interference with many targets, YS- 121 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Ongoing preclinical studies will thus necessitate huge amounts of YS- 121. To cope with those requirements, we have optimized the synthesis of YS- 121. Surprisingly, we isolated and characterized byproducts during the resulting from nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions by different tertiary alkylamines at a heteroaromatic halide. These amines should actually serve as assisting bases, because of their low nucleophilicity. This astonishing fact was not described in former publications concerning that type of reaction and, therefore, might be useful for further reaction improvement in general. Furthermore, we could develop a proposal for the mechanism of that byproduct formation...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{separate the}} cell interior {{from the outside}} and have diverse functions from signal transduction, apoptosis to transportations of ions and small molecules {{in and out of}} the cell. Most of these functions are fulfilled by proteins incorporated in the membrane. However, lipids as the main component of membrane not only serve as structural element for bilayer formation but they are also directly involved e. g. signalling processes and bilayer properties are important to mediate protein interactions. To fully understand the role of lipids, it is necessary to develop a molecular understanding of how certain membrane components modify bulk bilayer structure and dynamics. Membranes are known to have many different motions in different conditions and time scales. Temperature, pH, water content and many other conditions change membrane dynamics in a high degree. In addition to this, time scales of motions in membranes vary from ns to ms range corresponding to fast motion and slow motion, respectively. Therefore, membranes are needed to be studied systematically by varying the conditions and using methods to investigate motions in various time scales separately. The aim of this study was therefore perform a combined solid-state NMR / molecular dynamics study on model membranes. Different substrates, such as potential drugs, polarizing agents and signaling lipids were incorporated into bilayers and their location within the membrane and their effect onto the membrane was probed. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, ceramides and polarizing agents were the substrates for membranes in this study. There were several experimental methods that were applied in order to investigate effects of these substrates on membrane dynamics. Different kind of phospholipids including POPC, DMPC and DPPC were used. In addition to experimental work, with the information gathered from solid state NMR experiments molecular dynamics simulations were performed to obtain more information about the membranes at the molecular level. As a result, combination of solid-state NMR with molecular dynamics simulations provides very systematic way of investigating membrane dynamics in a large range of time scales. <b>Pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives were special interest of this study because of their activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) as an agonist as well as on enzymes of microsomal prostaglandin E 2 synthase- 1 (PGE 2 s) - 1 and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) as dual inhibitor. Two potent <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, 2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -(quinolin- 6 -ylamino) pyrimidin- 2 -ylthio) octanoic acid (compound 2) and 2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -(quinolin- 6 -ylamino) pyrimidin- 2 -ylthio) octanoate (compound 3), have been worked and their insertion depts were investigated by combining of solid state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. Both experimental and theoretical results pointed out that compound 3 was inserted the phospholipid bilayer more deeply than 2. NSAIDs – lipid mixtures have been also studied here. It is known that consumption of NSAIDs as in mixture with lipids results much fewer side effects than consumption of the drugs alone. Thus, it is crucial to understand interactions of NSAIDs with lipids and investigate the possible complex formation of drugs with lipids. In this study, interactions of three widely used NSAIDs, ibuprofen, diclofenac and piroxicam, with DPPC were investigated by solid-state NMR. 1 H and 31 P NMR results depicted that ibuprofen and diclofenac had interactions with lipids, which is an indication of drug-lipid complex formation whereas piroxicam didn’t show any interactions with lipids suggesting that no complex formation occurred in the case of piroxicam. Ceramides are known to play key roles in many cell processes and many studies showed that the functions of ceramides are related with the ceramide effects on biological membranes. Therefore, in this study, influences of ceramides on biophysics of lipid bilayers were investigated by using various solid state NMR techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Results from molecular dynamics simulations clearly showed that ceramide and lipids have strong interactions. More evidences about ceramide-lipid interactions were provided from 1 H and 14 N NMR results. In addition, it was indicated by both simulation and experimental methods that ceramide increased the rigidity of DMPC by increasing chain order parameters. BTbk is a biradical, which is used as polarizing agent for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments and found to be more efficient than other widely used polarizing agents such as TOTAPOL. Since it is a hydrophobic compound, which prefers to stay inside lipid bilayer it is important to investigate the location and orientation of bTbk along the bilayer in order to understand its enhancement profile in DNP measurements. In this study, both NMR relaxation time measurements and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that bTbk tends to stay more close to hydrophobic chain of lipids than the interfacial part of lipids at bilayer surface. In the first part of this work, a brief introduction on lipid membranes as well as a theoretical summary on both methods of solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations is given. Then, in the second part methodology is introduced for both solid-state NMR spectrometer and theoretical calculations. Afterwards, results of different membrane systems are discussed in the following parts for both solid state NMR and MD. Finally, in the last part, a summary and the conclusion of the overall results together with some future plans are explained. Biologische Membranen stellen eine Permeabilitätsbarriere zwischen dem Inneren und dem Äußeren von Zellen dar, die im Wesentlichen über die eingebetteten Membranproteine gesteuert wird. Für die mit der Membran assoziierten funktionalen Prozesse spielen aber auch Lipidbestandteile eine wichtige Rolle, was deren genaue Charakterisierung erforderlich macht. Beispiele hierfür sind u. a. laterale Phasentrennung/Rafts, Auflösung von Doppelschichtphasen bei der Zellfusion, die Rolle bestimmter Lipidbestandteile als sekundäre Botenstoffe, Modulierung der Aktivität von Membranproteinen über spezifische Lipidinteraktionen oder veränderte physikalische Membranparameter oder auch die Interaktion lipophiler Pharmaka mit Lipiden. Festkörper-NMR bietet einen idealen Zugang zu diesen Fragestellungen, da diese Technik direkte Experimente an verschiedensten Lipidphasen zulässt sowie über eine sehr große dynamische Bandbreite verfügt, über die mit geeigneten Experimenten viele dynamische Prozesse in der Membran detektiert werden können. Komplementär zu Festkörper-NMR können MD-Simulationen an vollständigen Lipiddoppelschichten zum Einsatz gebracht werden, um entweder Vorhersagen machen zu können, die mittels NMR überprüft werden können, oder um im Falle von unvollständigen NMR Datensätzen zu einem vollständigeren molekularen Bild des betrachteten Systems zu gelangen. Ziel dieser Dissertation war es daher, einen kombinierten FK-NMR/MD-Simulationsansatz für die Untersuchung kleiner Moleküle in der Lipidmembran zu etablieren und an mehreren Beispielen zu demonstrieren [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450 s) are {{involved}} in cancer development and treatment due to their roles in the oxidative metabolism of various endogenous (e. g. oestrogen) and exogenous (e. g. tamoxifen) compounds. It is well-known that intermediate P 450 metabolites derived from oestrogen metabolism are associated with breast carcinogenesis. The main aim of this project was to profile the cytochrome P 450 and P 450 -regulatory nuclear receptor mRNAs {{in a series of}} breast cancer cell lines (BCCs) and compare this profile with normal breast cells. This study used the qualitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect mRNA expression of target genes. Results showed CYP 1 B 1, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 J 2, CYP 2 R 1, CYP 2 U 1 and CYP 4 X 1 mRNA to be present in all cell lines. CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 8, CYP 2 C 18, CYP 2 F 1 and CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA were expressed in oestrogen receptor (ER) -positiveCaucasian and ER-negative Afro- Caribbean BCCs. Although no differences in P 450 mRNA were observed between the different ethnic groups, these preliminary findings suggest potential similarities in the ERpositive Caucasian and ER-negative Afro-Caribbean BCCs which warrant further investigation The CYP 4 Z 1 PCR product was identified as two distinct bands. Specific primer sets were used to demonstrate potential intron retention in CYP 4 Z 1. Using established in vitro models for the study of regulatory mechanisms of CYP 4 Z 1, T 47 D and ZR- 75 - 1 breast cancer cell lines were used to determine the appropriate nuclear receptors (i. e. progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha). These findings suggest that there may be an alternative receptor mechanism involved in CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA induction in these cells. In conjunction, pre-treatment of these two cell lines with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D followed by the agonists showed a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) of CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA levels and inhibited CYP 4 Z 1 induction by either progesterone, dexamethasone or <b>pirinixic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating that these agonists have effects on CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA transcription or stability. In contrast, cycloheximide differentially affected the level of CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA induction by these agonists. Taken together, these results suggest that CYP 4 Z 1 mRNA induction in T 47 D and ZR- 75 - 1 is mediated through differential cell type specific regulatory mechanisms and there is evidence for differential regulation of the splice variants.
