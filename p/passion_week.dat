25|$|Cross used in Marthoma Church Chancel {{particularly}} {{at the center of}} the Altar is the Easter Cross. In Marthoma worship practice the visual Sign of the Cross is used many times. When the Priest gives the blessing he performs the sign of the cross; the worshipers, as a sign of accepting the blessing also reciprocates blessing oneself. The same is done at the time of the declaration of the Trinity and also at the time of indication of the Cross. Generally iconostases, pictures or statues of saints are not kept in Marthoma churches. Until the middle of the 20th century, all worshipers were seated on a mat spread on the floor. Children occupy the first rows and behind them on right side females and towards left males are seated. A narrow space between left and right is demarcated with a red carpet starting from the main door signifying that the church is sharing the worship space of heaven and joining the communion. Now many churches provide chairs or benches. During the <b>Passion</b> <b>week</b> services, chairs are removed, to facilitate worshiping according to their ancient custom, which includes prostrating a number of times. Everyone including clergy and the laity, who take part in the worship, faces east for the service.|$|E

Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the Palm Sunday Mass and the Good Friday service.

Michelle is hesitant and Arthur reacts with fury − denouncing their relationship as “unnatural”. However, Arthur’s extreme opposition only encourages Michelle to go against his wishes. Although Michelle claims to love Geoff, she worries that their relationship lacks <b>passion.</b> After <b>weeks</b> of contemplation, she is finally persuaded to accept by her nemesis Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), who goads her about her boring life in Walford.

2500|$|Carnaval, is {{an annual}} celebration in the Roman Catholic {{tradition}} that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or <b>Passion</b> <b>Week</b> and Easter.

2500|$|On the Friday before Holy Week, the Roman Rite celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical {{feast of}} the Seven Sorrows of Mary. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other {{countries}} even before Pope Benedict XIII made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name {{was and still is}} celebrated in September.

After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa.

It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, Daryl {{sets out}} to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees. The next morning, Daryl visits the shy and insecure Jane. As the two sit down and share polite conversation, Jane explains that the Lennox Mansion was built on a site where alleged witches were burned at the stake. Later that night, Daryl encourages Jane to play her cello with wild abandon, never before achieved, playing faster and faster while accompanied by Daryl on the piano, until finally the strings break, the cello bursts into flame, and Jane flings herself upon Daryl with <b>passion.</b> The following <b>week,</b> Daryl invites {{all three of the}} women to his mansion, his sights now on Sukie.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that for many years British theatre has developed out of an historical connection with the Christian faith, but that this historically strong relationship has grown apart over time. By examining {{the rationale for the}} performance of traditional ‘religious’ or ‘Christian’ drama this study seeks to ascertain whether this distance is evidenced in practice. This dissertation will consider the origins of the connection between Christianity and theatrical performance through the staging of medieval Mystery Cycles, and compare findings with Mystery Cycles and Passion Plays which have been staged in Britain in the 21 st Century. The Mysteries are cycles of plays whose subject matter were the narrative events {{of the history of the}} world, as detailed in the Bible. They begin with the character of God creating the world, and cover the significant events of the Bible right through to a portrayal of the Final Judgement found in The Revelation of John. Passion Plays are also based upon biblical events, focusing on the events of Jesus’ <b>Passion,</b> the final <b>week</b> of his life culminating with his crucifixion and resurrection. The Prologue is a general introduction to the dissertation. It gives the reader information regarding some of the existing research into church attendance in Britain as well as sharing examples of research regarding the purpose of the portrayal of Christ in the visual arts. It briefly explains the position of the researcher in relation to the field of study and gives a detailed outline of the direction of the dissertation. Act One will consider the historical origins of the Mystery Cycle. As a result of evidence and opinion gathered from a range of academic sources, a viewpoint will be established which will detail where medieval Mystery Cycles come from, how they were staged and why they were performed. The latter is of primary significance to the study. Following on from this, Act Two will look at contemporary performances staged in Britain in the last five years, with a focus on two particular cities, York and Edinburgh. Once again the research carried out allows for an understanding of the sources of production and how and why they were performed. As a result of this, Act Three compares each aspect of the research; the source, the method and the rationale, for the staging of the Mystery Cycles and Passion Plays, with any findings being discussed and evaluated. The Epilogue then concludes the research by considering the future prospects for this genre of theatre...|$|R
2500|$|Meigle 2 stands nearly [...] high. It has a {{cross on}} one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is {{possibly}} based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of <b>Passion</b> <b>Week</b> running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located {{on the east side of}} the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel (or Vanora), the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.|$|E

60|$|This {{the first}} day of Passion Week; and this text is the key-note of <b>Passion</b> <b>Week.</b> It tells us of the {{obedience}} of Christ; of the unselfishness of Christ; and, therefore, of the true glory of Christ.|$|E
