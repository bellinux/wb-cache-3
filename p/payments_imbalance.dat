40|$|The present paper restates a {{previous}} hypothesis of the author’s regarding the payments deficit of the United States, {{according to which}} it could most appropriately be explained as a transfer problem. According to this view, the United States makes financial transfers to foreign countries - military expenditures, government loans, private loans, and direct investment - in amounts which for various reasons it is unable to match with real transfers, that is, with an excess of exports over imports of goods, and services. The author offers additional support for this hypothesis by means of statistical illustration, and points out why the official prescriptions for removing the <b>payments</b> <b>imbalance</b> is useless, or worse.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a China-US “G 2 ” is neither {{necessary}} nor sufficient for the resolution of crucial global order issues such as excessive global payments imbalances. Although the bilateral <b>payments</b> <b>imbalance</b> between both countries constitutes the largest component of global imbalances, the acuteness of relative power concerns and their reverberation in domestic politics has rendered the G 2 unable {{to address this problem}} effectively. Their bilateral conflict has also hampered the efforts of the G 20 and the IMF on global imbalances, but these two bodies together offer much better prospects for progress in this area. Reducing global imbalances requires them to address their main origins, which lie in the domestic political constraints on national policymakers and the asymmetries of international power that have progressively delegitimized the IMF and the multilateral surveillance process. Domestic political constraints will remain important, but the latter problem is, surprisingly, less intractable. The G 20 and IMF could achieve progress by (1) undertaking more ambitious reforms of IMF governance to improve the legitimacy of IMF finance and of the multilateral surveillance process, and (2) promoting a more symmetrical multicurrency reserve system with associated policy guidelines for actual and potential reserve currency issuers, and reserve accumulation guidelines among the rest of the IMF membershi...|$|E

The second chapter consists of the theoretical framework such as the emergence of multinational corporations, the history of multinational companies and their characteristics.

40|$|Concern about {{unsustainable}} <b>payments</b> <b>imbalances</b> in {{the global}} economy has prompted renewed interest in international monetary reform. This paper describes and evaluates six reform proposals that focus on strengthening the institutional framework for the current system. Some of these proposals advocate increased surveillance; others would create new instruments or facilities; still others propose an evolutionary path toward a new, nonnational reserve or transactions currency. But none of the proposals confront the problems posed by the changes that resulted from the privatization of the international monetary system {{after the collapse of the}} gold/dollar exchange standard. The paper argues that a new institutional structure is needed to promote stability and balance by rebuilding a channel for balance-of-payments settlements managed by authorities that represent public rather than private interests. international monetary system, international <b>payments</b> <b>imbalances,</b> international reserve assets, Washington Consensus,...|$|R

40|$|The {{current debate}} on the European crisis has {{highlighted}} the role of fiscal imbalances in explaining the turmoil that has dominated Europe {{in the past few}} years. This paper adopts {{a different point of view}} by suggesting that intra-European payments imbalances are crucial for the survival of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Indeed, payment imbalances between the North and South have contributed to the accumulation of large stock of foreign debt, while flows of foreign capital ceased to finance productive investments that might have contributed to debt repayments—being used instead to finance consumption and real estate. The dynamic interplay between current account imbalances and the accumulation of foreign debt reveals that, once the system is driven into disequilibrium by a real exchange rate misalignment, the longer a <b>payments</b> <b>imbalance</b> persists and the harder the eventual adjustment will be. Capital reversals, by shifting portfolio balances, then lead the system toward instability, sovereign default, and the collapse of the exchange rate regime. Replacing private with public creditors can temporarily help us to stay away from the point where the system breaks down. But this is only a temporary expedient because the underlying imbalances will need continuing and increasing financing until equilibrium is restored by other means. One permanent solution is the European Central Bank’s (ECB) official monetary transactions program, if the potential expansions to the central bank’s balance sheet can be tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Between 1958 and 1968, {{the primary}} {{objective}} of U. S. foreign economic policy {{was to find a}} way to control the American balance of payments deficit and stem the loss of gold from the American Treasury. Many of the policies which were enacted or considered in order to solve the payments problem and ease the gold drain conflicted with the larger goals of American foreign policy and domestic economic policy. This clash created enormous tensions within both the U. S. government and the Western Alliance, and impacted a whole range of policies, from American troop deployments overseas to American investment in Europe. Despite these political tensions, American policy-makers feared an economic catastrophe if the balance of payments deficit was not reduced and the gold outflow ended. Many policy-makers, correctly or not, drew parallels with the international monetary conditions of the 19302 ̆ 7 s, and feared that a failure to correct the problem could unleash an international economic collapse and political disaster. ^ Three successive administrations were obsessed with trying to end the U. S <b>payments</b> <b>imbalance</b> and gold outflow without jeopardizing America 2 ̆ 7 s vast political and military commitments around the world. Each administration produced controversial programs to limit or end the deficit, all to no avail. These plans had an enormous impact on American foreign economic policy and a no less important influence on American grand strategy during a crucial period of the cold war. Yet despite the obvious importance of this subject, there has never been a full-scale diplomatic or economic history of the attempt by American policy-makers to understand and solve the vexing problem of the balance of payments deficit. This study fills that void. ...|$|E

Adopting a proper system of macroeconomic governance in a truly integrated single market, as warranted by its new currency, is one of those structural reforms that should be given priority in the interest of Europe.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} intra-regional real exchange rate flexibility on East Asian exports. The hypothesis is that the impact would be negative for East Asian countries regardless of their exchange rate regimes. The results validate the hypothesis. The findings show that for Chinese exports the long-run effect is as much {{as that of a}} real appreciation of renminbi. By contrast, for Japanese exports the effect is three times larger than that of a real appreciation of the yen. The findings imply that a regional currency basket mechanism would lessen the adverse effect of exchange rate flexibility and engineer a collective exchange rate adjustment for resolving the global <b>payment</b> <b>imbalance</b> against East Asia.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} view that world <b>payments</b> <b>imbalances</b> can be remedied through increased demand in surplus countries and reduced demand in deficit countries, without any need for real exchange rate changes. In fact shifts in demand and real exchange rate adjustment are necessary couplets, not substitutes. The essential reason for this complementarity is that a much higher fraction of a marginal dollar of US than of foreign spending falls on US output. As a result, a redistribution of world spending away from the US leads to an excess supply of US goods unless accompanied by a decline in their relative price. Although some economists believe that the integration of world capital markets somehow eliminates this problem, this is a fallacy that confuses accounting identities with behavior.
