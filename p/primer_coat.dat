40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality weld beads are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound weld beads in 6 t <b>primer</b> <b>coated</b> steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on bead and lap welding. Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable gap clearance for <b>primer</b> <b>coated</b> thickness. The zinc of primer has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from lap position or leaving porosity. Significant effects of <b>primer</b> <b>coated</b> position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small gap clearance in the lap position, the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound weld beads can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|R

This film showed a multilayered structure consisting of a relatively compact layer near the alloy substrate, a porous middle layer and a columnar outer layer. The thicknesses of the layers varied, {{as a consequence of}} the difference in the local concentration of lithium species leaching from the <b>primer</b> <b>coating.</b> The presence of the film in the scribed area significantly reduced corrosion of the alloy, with little consumption of the metal substrate within the scribed area during neutral salt spray exposure.

40|$|The {{covalent}} functionalization of surfaces with molecules {{capable of}} providing new properties to the treated substrate, such as hydrophobicity or bioactivity, has been attracting {{a lot of interest}} in the last decades. For achieving this goal, the generation of a universally functionalizable <b>primer</b> <b>coating</b> in one-pot reaction and under relatively mild conditions is especially attractive due to its potential versatility and ease of application. The aim of the present work is to obtain such a functionalizable coating by a cross-linking reaction between pyrocatechol and hexamethylenediamine (HDMA) under oxidizing conditions. For demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, different substrates (glass, gold, silicon, and fabric) have been coated and later functionalized with two different alkylated species (1 -hexadecanamine and stearoyl chloride). The success of their attachment has been demonstrated by evaluating the hydrophobicity conferred to the surface by contact angle measurements. Interestingly, these results, together with its chemical characterization by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), have proven that the reactivity of the <b>primer</b> <b>coating</b> towards the functionalizing agent can be tuned in function of its generation time...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{coating of}} steel and galvanised steel coils {{is referred to as}} coil coating. Coil coating is considered the most efficient coating method with regard to the amount of coated area per unit of time. Coil coatings include <b>primer</b> <b>coating,</b> top coating and backside coating. In general, the <b>primer</b> <b>coating</b> and top coating need to balance effectively among flexibility, adhesion, and film hardness. As such, saturated polyester resins with the capability of being molecularly engineered have found applications in coil coatings as the key binder. Nowadays, a combination of up to five polyester resins with different molecular structures are employed in coil primer coatings and coil top coat coatings to derive hard yet flexible coatings. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise and characterise a novel and standalone polyester resin system that would provide multiple properties simultaneously, thus, eliminating the need to use mixtures of polyesters in coil coatings. The multiple properties concerned included high flexibility, excellent adhesion and sufficient chemical resistance. For development of the polyester resin system concerned, a variety of polyols and dicarboxylic acids were polymerised to form polymeric polyester binders. Direct esterification polymerisation technique was employed for synthesis of the polyesters. The results obtained at an early stage indicated that in order to develop such a single resin system, achievement of an optimum balance among flexibility, adhesion and glass transition temperature was essential. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the augmentation or reduction of the glass transition temperature of the saturated polyester led to the augmentation or reduction of the film hardness of the resulting coil coating. Thus, a unique blend of neopentyl glycol, 1, 4 cyclohexanedimethanol, 1, 6 hexanediol, adipic acid, isophthalic acid, and terephthalic acid was polymerised. The resulting product performed efficiently as a standalone binder system in a coil <b>primer</b> <b>coating</b> and a coil top coating, providing all of the required properties. Mglecular structures of the saturated polyesters synthesised were confirmed by carbon- 13 and proton CH) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR). Alterations made to molecular structure of the polyesters through partial replacement of their diots with new ones were visible in expected frequency ranges of the resulting 13 CNMR and 1 HNMR spectra.

"Gesso", {{also known}} [...] "glue gesso" [...] or [...] "Italian gesso" [...] is a {{traditional}} mix of an animal glue binder (usually rabbit-skin glue), chalk, and white pigment, used to coat rigid surfaces such as wooden painting panels as an absorbent <b>primer</b> <b>coat</b> substrate for painting.

Mixing and applying it is an art form in itself since it is usually applied in 10 or more extremely thin layers.
