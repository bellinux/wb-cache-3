This automated process is how all modern CNC machine tools and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a hand pump that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called one-shot systems from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this thin slurry. After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the diazotization reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small <b>periodic</b> <b>charges,</b> smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. Under nitrogen atmosphere the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a diazotization reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure azinphos-methyl in form of white crystals.|$|E

However, the variable nature of the energy supply rate due to the environmental conditions creates serious challenges for embedded real-time systems targeting predictability.

The main idea of the algorithm is to plan in advance for <b>periodic</b> <b>charging</b> and discharging of the battery to avoid energy outage, while still meeting the timing constraints. The algorithm is specifically designed to exploit the low-power states of modern processors, to enable effective power state transitions when the battery is re-charged on a periodic basis.

40|$|Indonesia’s Health Social Security Manajemen Agency (BPJS) is {{the body}} that organizes the National Health Insurance program (JKN) with the purpose {{providing}} assurance of health for all Indonesian people {{so that they will}} be able to live healthy. JKN is a social insurance program that guarantees health care costs and fulfill the basic needs of health costs which held nationally and with subsidy payment method. BPJS is a public legal organization. This program is mandatory for the entire population of Indonesia who have to pay <b>periodic</b> <b>charges</b> or whose contributions paid by the Government directly to the Indonesia’s Social Security Organizing Body (BPJS) Health (Thabrani 2012). 	 Since the 1970 s, before BPJS operates, the external insurance party has given assurance of health with various health insurance products through multinational insurance company that has offices or business units in Indonesia (Thabrani, 2014). The organizing of health insurance by private insurance companies marketed by life insurance companies and the insurance company. Commercial health insurance is insurance sold by insurance companies or other units, the membership is voluntary, depends on the willingness of people or companies to buy. The premium are set in nominal terms corresponding insurance benefits offered. BPJS health and commercial insurance companies are private companies and Government Company which equally gives service to public health protection. That is a necessity, when some companies offer the same products to the same target costumer, the competition climate will grow. The dynamics of competition requires all companies in the industry to design a series of strategic actions so that the company can survive, compete and thrive. This study has three objectives: First, to analyze the commercial health insurance premium income by comparing the premium income before and after the operation of BPJS. Regression analysis and analysis of the data are used to answer this objective. The result overall shows, there is no decrease in premiums before and after the operation BPJS for the health insurance industry premium income commercial sector. These global results do not reflect all of the companies. When in the sort of data of companies, there are a number of companies that experienced an increase, or decrease or even stagnation. The second objective of this study is to analyze the influence of external and internal environment of commercial health insurance industry after the operation of JKN program. Taking each of the two samples of the general insurance companies in each of these conditions, why these companies get the increase, or decrease or even stagnation. SWOT analysis, matrix IFE - EFE and IE matrix are used to answer this second goal. The result found eight alternative to the dominant strategy. Given limited resources, it is possible there are a number of companies that can run all of these alternatives. Therefore prioritize become an important and this is the third objective of this study is to formulate a marketing strategy of commercial health insurance. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a tool of analysis. This research is a case study with the health insurance industry commercial sector scale nonetheless take a sample of 10 large companies that meet the criteria which can represent the company's general conditions of commercial health insurance companies in Indonesia. Enrichment materials and clarify the existing conditions, research is also conducted to the General Insurance Association of Indonesia (AAUI) and the Indonesian Life Insurance Association (AAJI).

For quenched random charge distributions we find that due to the presence of the ionic solution in between the surfaces, the inter-surface repulsion dominates over the attraction in the linear regime of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The effect of quenched charge heterogeneity is found to be particularly substantial in the case of large charge domains. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
