5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market <b>prices</b> <b>go</b> up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{investing in}} a noisy market with incorrect beliefs about predictability. Two types of agents use subjective models to optimize their portfolios - "conformists" who happen {{to believe in the}} self-fulfilling market consensus and "rebels" who have wrong beliefs. We compare the agents' dynamic trading and their empirically observable investment performance. An agent who believes in log-normality is always a contrarian trader, who buys more shares after the <b>price</b> <b>goes</b> down, and sells shares when the <b>price</b> <b>goes</b> up. In contrast, an agent who believes in price predictability acts as a momentum trader, who buys more shares after the <b>price</b> <b>goes</b> up, for a range of subjective market mis-pricings.

Sir Baldwin was obliged to be close; his charges were fearful, and the dream of her living with her {{daughter}} (a vision she had never mentioned to me) must be renounced. [...] "I would have helped with things, and I could have lived perfectly in one room," [...] she said; [...] "I would have paid for everything, and--after all-- I'm some one, ain't I? But I don't fit in, and Ethel tells me there are tiresome people she MUST receive. I can help them from here, no doubt, better than from there. She told me once, you know, what she thinks of my picture of life. 'Mamma, your picture of life is preposterous!' No doubt it is, but she's vexed with me for letting my <b>prices</b> <b>go</b> down; and I had to write three novels to pay for all her marriage cost me. I did it very well--I mean the outfit and the wedding; but that's why I'm here. At any rate she doesn't want a dingy old woman in her house. I should give it an atmosphere of literary glory, but literary glory is only the eminence of nobodies. Besides, she doubts my glory--she knows I'm glorious only at Peckham and Hackney. She doesn't want her friends to ask if I've never known nice people. She can't tell them I've never been in society. She tried to teach me better once, but I couldn't learn. It would seem too as if Peckham and Hackney had had enough of me; for (don't tell any one!) I've had to take less for my last than I ever took for anything." [...] I asked her how little this had been, not from curiosity, but in order to upbraid her, more disinterestedly than Lady Luard had done, for such concessions. She answered [...] "I'm ashamed to tell you," [...] and then she began to cry.|$|E

50|$|Stock options also incentivize {{executives}} {{to engage in}} risk-seeking behavior. This is because {{the value of a}} call option increases with increased volatility (see options pricing). Stock options also present a potential up-side gain (if the stock <b>price</b> <b>goes</b> up) for the executive, but no downside risk (if the stock <b>price</b> <b>goes</b> down, the option simply isn't exercised). Stock options therefore can incentivize excessive risk seeking behavior that can lead to catastrophic corporate failure.|$|R

This situation (where <b>prices</b> <b>go</b> up faster relative to all other areas in an economy) is deceitfully indicative to investors as normal and healthy opportunities for investment.
