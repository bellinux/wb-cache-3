50|$|A {{suitable}} transmitter {{need only}} generate {{a number of}} audio tones. Most had a single oscillator, that generated different tones as control buttons were pressed one-by-one. As the control actuators on the model were usually escapements at this time, this limitation was relatively minor. To keep the channels fully independent and simultaneously triggerable, required a separate oscillator for each channel, not merely a single tunable oscillator. In the valve era before transistors, {{that would have been}} unusually expensive. Many period transmitters merely used a number of <b>push-button</b> <b>switches</b> on their case, although some combined these into joystick or wheel controls.|$|E
5000|$|Built in 1964, {{the vehicle}} was {{powered by a}} 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and was backed by a Powerglide {{automatic}} transmission.

5000|$|EnOcean {{wireless}} data packets {{are relatively}} small, with the packet being only 14 bytes long and are transmitted at 125 kbit/s. RF energy is only transmitted for the 1's of the binary data, {{reducing the amount}} of power required. Three packets are sent at pseudo-random intervals reducing the possibility of RF packet collisions. Modules optimized for switching applications transmit additional data packets on release of <b>push-button</b> <b>switches,</b> enabling other features such as light dimming to be implemented. [...] The transmission frequencies used for the devices are 902 MHz, 928.35 MHz, 868.3 MHz and 315 MHz.

5000|$|Standalone pedalboards {{usually have}} a 13-note range and short pedals, which limits the types of basslines which can be {{performed}} to fairly simple passages. If the group's bass guitarist or electric guitarist is playing the pedalboard from a standing position, she could only use one foot {{at a time to}} play, which would further limit the types of passages which could be performed. The BASYN analog bass synthesizer is a 2 VCO analog synthesizer which uses a 13-note [...] "button board". Instead of using organ pedalboard-style pedals, the player depresses momentary <b>push-button</b> <b>switches.</b> Another variant used in rock bands is a bass pedalboard in which the keyboard is laid out as a tabulature representation of part of the four strings of an electric bass guitar.|$|E
5000|$|The now-decommissioned {{electric}} chair known as [...] "Old Sparky" [...] at the now-closed West Virginia State Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia {{was installed in}} a facility originally used for hanging.

The chair was bolted to a low platform which covered what had previously been the trapdoor of the gallows used in the state's judicial hangings. Its control apparatus was designed {{in such a way}} that three <b>push-button</b> <b>switches</b> were to be simultaneously pressed by three members of the execution team; only one of these switches actually completed the circuit, allowing each member of the execution team to reassure himself that perhaps he had not been the one who had actually initiated the death of the condemned.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} {{tape recorder}} interface was designed, which permits automatic oral administration of "true-false " or "multiple-choice" type tests. This paper describes the hardware and control program software which {{were developed to}} implement the method on a DEC PDP 11 computer. The method is illustrated by an extended example that describes automatic oral administration of the Minnesota M ul-tiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Similar concepts may be applied to implement the idea for other computer systems or other tests. The principal advantage of this method {{is that it does}} not require an expensive computer terminal. Auxiliary programs may be used for subsequent batch mode test scoring and analysis. THIS paper describes a method for automatic oral test administra-tion. The subject listens to test statements through headphones and responds by depressing one of two or more <b>push-button</b> <b>switches.</b> The method requires neither a terminal for presentation of test items nor a keyboard for the input of the subject’s responses. This method has been used for oral administration of the Minnesota Multiphasic Per-sonality Inventory (MMPI), a &dquo;true-false&dquo; type test. However, the method is easily employed with other tests of the &dquo;true-false&dquo; or &dquo;multiple-choice&dquo; types. The hardware configuration used in devel-oping the prototype example of this method included both a DEC PDP 11 / 10 computer with LPS 11 laboratory peripheral system and a Magnecord model 1034 open-reel tape deck with stereo preamplifier. The choice of computer-tape recorder combination was based entirely on availability. A more desirable setup would include a tape playe...|$|E

5000|$|An {{e-cigarette}} is {{a handheld}} battery-powered vaporizer that simulates smoking, but without tobacco combustion. Once the user inhales, the airflow activates the pressure sensor, {{and then the}} heating element atomizes the liquid solution. Most devices have a manual <b>push-button</b> <b>switch</b> to turn them on or off. E-cigarettes do not turn on by trying to [...] "light" [...] the device with a flame. The e-liquid reaches a temperature of roughly 100-250 °C within a chamber to create an aerosolized vapor. However, variable voltage devices can raise the temperature. A glycerin-only liquid vaporizes at a higher temperature than a propylene glycol-glycerin liquid. Rather than cigarette smoke, the user inhales an aerosol, commonly but inaccurately called vapor. E-cigarettes do not create vapor between puffs.|$|R

This meant repositioning the long prop stand to forward of the nearside rear wheel spindle nut. In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments.

5000|$|A switch {{normally}} {{maintains its}} set position once operated. A biased switch contains a mechanism that springs it into another position when released by an operator. The momentary <b>push-button</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a type}} of biased switch. The most common type is a [...] "push-to-make" [...] (or normally-open or NO) switch, which makes contact when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released. Each key of a computer keyboard, for example, is a normally-open [...] "push-to-make" [...] switch. A [...] "push-to-break" [...] (or normally-closed or NC) switch, on the other hand, breaks contact when the button is pressed and makes contact when it is released. An example of a push-to-break switch is a button used to release a door held closed by an electromagnet. The interior lamp of a household refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is held open when the door is closed.|$|R

40|$|A {{digital data}} logger for field {{observation}} of geomorphological processes was developed. An 8 -bit CMOS microprocessor is the pivotal {{part of the}} system. An 8 -bit A/D converterLSI and an ISO standard digital cassette tape deck work as the input and output of thesystem, respectively. Three snap <b>switches</b> and a <b>push-button</b> <b>switch</b> transmit commands of theoperator to the microprocessor, while a 32 -character dot-matrix LCD informs the operator ofthe internal conditions of the system. The microprocessor works under the machine languageprogram written on a CMOS-ROM referring to a CMOS realtime clock LSI and using aCMOS-RAM as a working area. The mode of the data logging are variable according to theprogram. When 8 -channel data are to be recorded every one minute, two blocks of CMTdata (each 256 bytes) occur every one hour, and the cassette becomes full in 18 days. During this period the system consumes about 13 AH of a 12 V battery. The construction of the hardware is orthodox and no special technique was used inthe design and manifacturing, while some devices were needed {{for the development of}} thesoftware. A training module of 6800 series microcomputer combined with a ROM writer wasused to assemble the mnemonic program, to fix the assembled program on the EP-ROM andto make de-bug.

An ISO standard cassette tape is accessible by many mainframecomputers and personal computers. Different versions of the logging system is possible throughpreparing the EP-ROMs equipped with different programs using the same hardware.

5000|$|An {{electrical}} contact is an electrical circuit component found in electrical switches, relays, connectors and circuit breakers. Each contact {{is a piece}} of electrically conductive material, usually metal. When a pair of contacts touch, they can pass an electrical current with a certain contact resistance, dependent on surface structure, surface chemistry and contact time; when the pair is separated by an insulating gap, then the pair does not pass a current. When the contacts touch, the switch is [...] "closed"; when the contacts are separated, the switch is [...] "open". The gap must be an insulating medium such as air, vacuum, oil, SF6 or other electrically insulating fluid. Contacts may be operated by humans in <b>push-buttons</b> and <b>switches,</b> by mechanical pressure in sensors or machine cams, and electromechanically in relays. The surfaces where contacts touch are usually composed of metals such as silver or gold alloys that have high electrical conductivity, wear resistance, oxidation resistance and other properties. [...] Beyond the contact surface and immediate area, the {{electrical contact}} is usually composed of other metals for mechanical and cost reasons.|$|R
40|$|A circuit {{that changes}} an {{electrical}} load in a switching time shorter than 0. 3 microsecond has been devised. This circuit {{can be used}} in testing the regulation characteristics of power-supply circuits. especially switching power-converter circuits that are {{supposed to be able to}} provide acceptably high degrees of regulation in response to rapid load transients. The combination of this power-switching circuit and a known passive constant load could be an attractive alternative to a typical commercially available load-bank circuit that can be made to operate in nominal constant-voltage, constant-current, and constant-resistance modes. The switching provided by a typical commercial load-bank circuit in the constant-resistance mode is not fast enough for testing of regulation in response to load transients. Moreover, some test engineers do not trust the test results obtained when using commercial load-bank circuits because the dynamic responses of those circuits are, variously, partly unknown and/or excessively complex. In contrast, the combination of this circuit and a passive constant load offers both rapid switching and known (or at least better known) load dynamics. The power-switching circuit (see figure) includes a signal-input section, a wide-hysteresis Schmitt trigger that prevents false triggering in the event of switch-contact bounce, a dual-bipolar-transistor power stage that drives the gate of a metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), and the MOSFET, which is the output device that performs the switching of the load. The MOSFET in the specific version of the circuit shown in the figure is rated to stand off a potential of 100 V in the "off" state and to pass a current of 20 A in the "on" state. The switching time of this circuit (the characteristic time of rise or fall of the potential at the drain of the MOSFET) is. 300 ns. The circuit can accept any of three control inputs. which one depending on the test that one seeks to perform: a repetitive waveform from a signal generator, momentary closure of a <b>push-button</b> <b>switch,</b> or closure or opening of a manually operated on/off switch. In the case of a signal generator, one can adjust the frequency and duty cycle as needed to obtain the desired AC power-supply response, which one could display on an oscilloscope. Momentary switch closure could be useful for obtaining (and, if desired, displaying on an oscilloscope set to trigger on an event) the response of a power supply to a single load transient. The on/off switch can be used to switch between load states in which static-load regulation measurements are performed...|$|R
5000|$|Inside the transmission, {{the exact}} point along the gear train where {{the power is}} taken off determines whether the PTO can be run {{independently}} of vehicle travel (ground speed). Early PTOs were often taken off the main output shaft, meaning that the vehicle had to be [...] "in gear" [...] in order to run the PTO. Later this was improved by so-called live PTO (LPTO) designs, which allow control of the PTO rotation independently of the tractor motion. This is an advantage when the load driven by the PTO requires the tractor motion to slow or stop running to allow the PTO driven equipment to catch up. It also allows operations where the tractor remains parked, such as silo-filling or unloading a manure spreader to a pile or lagoon rather than across a field. In 1945, Cockshutt Farm Equipment Ltd of Brantford, Ontario, Canada, introduced the Cockshutt Model 30 tractor with LPTO. Most PTOs built today are live. In modern tractors, LPTO is often controlled by <b>push-button</b> or selector <b>switch.</b> This increases safety of operators who need {{to get close to}} the PTO shaft.|$|R
