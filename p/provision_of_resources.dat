2500|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} polyandry in animals is controversial. Polyandry has direct benefits for females allowing fertilization assurance, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> and parental {{care for their}} offspring. House mice (Mus musculus musculus) have shown indirect, genetic benefits, where females have increased offspring survival through multiple mating, showing that practicing polyandry mating results {{in an increase in}} offspring viability. In a meta analysis, including 10 different orders of insects, polyandry increased the production of eggs by females specifically in Lepidopterans and Orthopterans. Indirect benefits of mating for females can be gained through sperm competition to attain [...] "good genes", cryptic female choice, increased genetic quality, and genetic diversity. Females spiders (Pisaura mirabilis) store more sperm from gift-giving males suggesting that sperm storage is under female control through cryptic sperm choice. The increase in sperm storage from the gift giving males might allow females to produce [...] "sexy sons" [...] that also give gifts and increase the fitness of offspring. Sperm storage and fertilization success increased with copulation duration, suggesting an advantage in sperm competition.|$|E

50|$|In {{long term}} mating arrangements, women {{typically}} look for males who {{will provide a}} high level of parental investment, and who can provide resources to the woman or to her offspring. The provision of economic resources, or the potential to acquire many economic resources is the most obvious cue towards the ability of a man to provide resources, and women have been shown experimentally to rate the importance of their partner's financial status twice as highly as men. However, many other traits exist that may act as cues towards a man's ability to provide resources that have been sexually selected for in women's evolutionary history. These include older age - older males have had more time to accrue resources - industriousness, dependability and stability - if a woman's long term partner is not emotionally stable or is not dependable then their <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> to her and her offspring are likely to be inconsistent. Additionally, the costs associated with an emotionally unstable partner such as jealousy and manipulativeness may outweigh the benefits associated with the resources they are able to provide.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{difficult}} to illustrate a clear link between psychological interventions that successfully reduce the incidence of offending and those that do not and clearly nothing has led to the elimination of crime. At times this difficulty has contributed to a profound pessimism about the effectiveness of any form of treatment. This was particularly so in the United States of America but this pessimism regarding the effectiveness of treatment spread to the United Kingdom [...] and arguably adversely affected the provision of rehabilitative treatments. The development of cognitive behavioural therapy which made it possible to demonstrate an effect upon some attitudes and offending behaviours and for this to be measured in controlled research studies led to the introduction of structured treatment programmes in prisons across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and more recently, mainland Europe. For a period there have been positive benefits in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> particularly in prison settings. However, there has been serious conflict as professionals compete for limited resources and one model claimed superiority over another.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Arguments== The plaintiffs mainly argued, {{with the}} support of {{testimonial}} and documentary evidence, that the track system, whether by intent or effect, “unconstitutionally discriminates against the Negro and the poor.” The data presented revealed patterns of class-based and racial separation of students that clearly established relations between socioeconomic class and academic performance - the correlation between socioeconomic class and race was a strong and prominent one in the District. The data further revealed that “students attending the lower income predominantly Negro schools - a majority of District school children - typically are confined to the educational limits of the Special Academic or General Track.” The separating effect was traced back to the means through which learning ability is measured; the District relied on the students’ “performances in class and on standardized aptitude tests, both of which criteria are heavily - and, as it turns out, unfairly - weighted against the disadvantaged student,” particularly since the latter is modeled for the middle-class white student, thus implementing “the self-fulfilling prophecy phenomenon.” Other arguments targeted the quality and adequacy of facilities, allocation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> per pupil expenditure, quality of teachers, faculty segregation, and overcrowding in predominantly black schools (while predominantly white schools ran under capacity).|$|E
