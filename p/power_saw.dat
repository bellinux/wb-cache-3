5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny {{that came with the}} post. He did not have a particular social or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the Panamanian Congress to pass Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the Panamanian military. The law also tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in <b>power</b> <b>saw</b> significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E

Between the 14th century and 17th century, there was much struggle for the College between the cardinals of the day and the reigning popes. The most effective way for a pope to increase his power was {{to increase the number of}} cardinals, promoting those who had nominated him.

25|$|Jiang's time in <b>power</b> <b>saw</b> {{a marked}} {{increase}} in patronage appointments that spanned the military, the provinces, {{and the party}} apparatus. Patron-client relationships, rather than merit, became the primary factor in securing promotions, giving rise {{to the formation of}} internal factions based on personal loyalty. Prominent examples of factions identified by observers include Jiang's Shanghai clique, Zhou Yongkang's spheres of influence in the state oil and public security sectors, and the so-called Xishan Society of Shanxi officials – apart from these well-known cases, political factionalism seemed to be {{the order of the day}} down to the lowest levels of party bureaucracy. This meant that factional patrons often exerted massive influence through informal channels rather than through the offices they hold. Indeed, the refusal of Jiang Zemin to relinquish his influence years after he had formally left office was said to have caused much unease with the party rank-and-file. It also had unduly constrained the ability of his successor Hu Jintao to enact systemic reforms or to carry out a cohesive agenda. By reversing this part of Jiang's legacy, some observers believe, Xi would be better equipped to discipline and unite the party under a common agenda. Proponents of this view believe that the ultimate aim of the campaign is to strengthen the role of institutions and stamp out factionalism and networks of personal loyalty, thereby creating a more united and meritocratic organization and achieving greater efficiency for governance.|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had now {{moved back}} in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann [...] "Cindy" [...] Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a [...]22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body {{in the trunk of}} his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sex with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub. He kept the severed head for several days, {{regularly}} engaging in irrumatio with it, before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother [...] "always wanted people to look up to her." [...] He then discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all but her head and right hand were discovered and [...] "pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle". Police and a pathologist determined she had been hacked to death then cut into pieces with a <b>power</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
500|$|Macedonia {{continued}} {{its role as}} the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece, yet its authority became diminished due to civil wars between the Antipatrid and nascent Antigonid dynasty. After surviving crippling invasions by Pyrrhus of Epirus, Lysimachus, Seleucus I Nicator, and the Celtic Galatians, Macedonia {{under the leadership of}} Antigonus II of Macedon (...) was able to subdue Athens and defend against the naval onslaught of Ptolemaic Egypt in the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). However, the rebellion of Aratus of Sicyon in 351 BC {{led to the formation of}} the Achaean League, which proved to be a perennial problem for the ambitions of the Macedonian kings in mainland Greece. Macedonian <b>power</b> <b>saw</b> a resurgence under Antigonus III Doson (...) , who defeated the Spartans under Cleomenes III in the Cleomenean War (229–222 BC). Although Philip V of Macedon (...) managed to defeat the Aetolian League in the Social War (220–217 BC), his attempts to project Macedonian power into the Adriatic Sea and formation of a Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty with Hannibal alarmed the Roman Republic, which convinced a coalition of Greek city-states to attack Macedonia while Rome focused on defeating Hannibal in Italy. Rome was ultimately victorious in the First (214–205 BC) and Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC) against Philip V, who was also defeated in the Cretan War (205–200 BC) by a coalition led by Rhodes. Macedonia was forced to relinquish its holdings in Greece outside of Macedonia proper, while the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC) succeeded in toppling the monarchy altogether, after which Rome placed Perseus of Macedon (...) under house arrest and established four client state republics in Macedonia. In an attempt to dissuade rebellion in Macedonia, Rome imposed stringent constitutions in these states that limited their economic growth and interactivity. However, Andriscus, a pretender to the throne claiming descent from the Antigonids, briefly revived the Macedonian monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC). His forces were crushed at the second Battle of Pydna by the Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, leading to the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia and the initial period of Roman Greece.|$|E

2500|$|Roald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, {{at the age}} of 74 of a rare {{cancer of}} the blood, myelodysplastic syndrome, in Oxford, and was buried in the {{cemetery}} at St Peter and St Paul's Church in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a [...] "sort of Viking funeral". He was buried with his snooker cues, some very good burgundy, chocolates, HB pencils and a <b>power</b> <b>saw.</b> Today, children continue to leave toys and flowers by his grave. [...] In November 1996, the Roald Dahl Children's Gallery was opened at the Buckinghamshire County Museum in nearby Aylesbury.

2500|$|Refusing {{to listen}} to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn in the back just as Jeff arrives. He retaliates by {{shooting}} Amanda in the neck with a gun provided by John during his tests. As Amanda slowly dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to inherit his legacy, he decided to test [...] "her will to keep someone alive"; to this end, he told her nothing about Jeff and Lynn, including their marriage. John then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he accepts one final test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but then slashes his throat with a <b>power</b> <b>saw.</b> The door to the sickroom seals itself as a dying John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his test by killing John, {{the only person who}} knows the whereabouts of his daughter; to save her, Jeff must play another game. The tape ends as John dies, and the collar promptly detonates and kills Lynn, leaving a screaming Jeff trapped in the sickroom with the three corpses.|$|E

This third party power of veto coupled {{with the end of}} local electoral pacts in a foreseeable way; Disrael and Gladstone needed central control of their members to pursue narrower narratives and promote differing values.

[...] Their <b>power</b> <b>saw</b> Gladstone make Home Rule his touchstone but, in so doing, distance his party from most peers who, until the House of Lords was flooded with Liberal peers in 1911, preferred conservative policies and guarded their near-equal power. Peers of the Whig persuasion flocked to a conservative line given immediate loss of family ties (hence leverage) in the Commons and tide of reformist policies engulfing the Liberal party caused by the Act's generous franchise and loss of their coveted and often sponsored Whig-Radical and Whig-Conservative dual-member seats in the Commons.

60|$|The {{turbines}} whistle reflectively. From the low-arched expansion-tanks {{on either}} side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbine-chests, and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a <b>power</b> <b>saw.</b> Behind, is its own pressure held in leash of spurred on by the lift-shunts; before it, the vacuum where Fleury's Ray dances in violet-green bands and whirled turbillons of flame. The jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are pressure-tempered colloid (no glass would endure the strain for an instant) and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray intently. It is {{the very heart of}} the machine--a mystery to this day. Even Fleury who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multi-millionaire, could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube can, in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious blast of gas into a chill greyish-green liquid that drains (you can hear it trickle) from the far end of the vacuum through the eduction-pipes and the mains back to the bilges. Here it returns to its gaseous, one had almost written sagacious, state and climbs to work afresh. Bilge-tank, upper tank, dorsal-tank, expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a liquid), and bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury's Ray sees to that; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to Fleury's Ray. If a speck of oil, if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded terminals, Fleury's Ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again. This means half a day's work for all hands and an expense of, one hundred and seventy-odd pounds to the G.P.O. for radium-salts and such trifles.|$|E
