2500|$|Like all Asgardians, Thor is {{incredibly}} long-lived and relies upon periodic {{consumption of the}} Golden Apples of Idunn to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea, Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians. Thor is capable of incredible feats of strength, such as pushing over the Leaning Tower of Pisa with his little finger, ripping apart the Golden Gate Bridge, lifting the almost Earth-sized Midgard Serpent, and by combining his power with that of Beta Ray Bill, destroying Surtur's solar system-sized dimensional <b>portal.</b> If <b>pressed</b> in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a state known as the [...] "Warrior's Madness" [...] ("berserkergang" [...] in Norwegian and Danish alike), which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold, although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike.|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatocellular}} gene transfection {{in vitro}} has been repeatedly reported but the liver gene transfection in vivo is still poorly understood. The liver gene transfection {{can be performed}} through injection via tail vein and portal vein but these methods result easily bleeding or stress reaction to the animal which may potentially confound experimental results. Here to exploring a reasonable and effective injection method for liver gene transfection, recombinant lentiviral vectors with Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP) were injected, respectively via the rat’s cecal vein, portal vein and tail vein {{and then it was}} observed that the GFP expression of the liver tissue and the effect of various injections on the rats. The results showed that via the cecal vein injection had the high transfection efficiency and little increase of <b>portal</b> vein <b>press</b> and the minimum effect on liver transaminase and serum IL- 6 and TNF-α (n = 20) (p in vivo liver gene transfection via the cecal vein injection in rats is a novel and reasonable method...|$|R
