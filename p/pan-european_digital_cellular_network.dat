40|$|Customer {{retention}} (CR), loyalty (CL), {{and satisfaction}} (CS) are important (intermediate) goals for telecommunication network operators {{on their way}} to superior economic success in the liberalised German market. Therefore, drawing on a sample of 684 residential customers of <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>network</b> operators in Germany this study tests hypotheses suggesting that CR, CL, and CS should be treated as differential constructs which are causally inter-linked. LISREL analyses support a two-staged model in which overall CS has a significant impact on CL which in turn influences a customer's intention to terminate/extend the contractual relationship with his mobile <b>cellular</b> <b>network</b> operator (=CR). Mobile service price and personal service benefit perceptions as well as (lack of) number portability between various cellular operators were identified as supply-related variables with the strongest effects on CR. Mobile network operators' perceived customer care performance had no significant impact on CR. The findings suggest that an important lever for regulators to promote competition in cellular markets is the enforcement of efficient number portability procedures between mobile network operators.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that TCP performance may degrade over paths that include wireless links, where packet losses {{are often not}} related to congestion. We examine this problem {{in the context of}} the GSM <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>network,</b> where the wireless link is protected by a reliable link layer protocol. We propose the use of multi-layer tracing as a powerful methodology to analyze the complex protocol interactions between the layers. Our measurements show that TCP throughput over GSM is mostly ideal and that spurious timeouts are extremely rare. The multi-layer tracing tool we developed allowed us to identify the primary causes of degraded performance: (1) inefficient interactions with TCP/IP header compression, and (2) excessive queuing caused by overbuffered links. We conclude that link layer solutions alone can solve the problem of “TCP over wireless links”. We further argue that it is imperative to deploy active queue management and explicit congestion notification mechanisms in wide-area wireless networks; which we expect will be the bottleneck in a future Internet...|$|R

40|$|This {{proposal}} introduces two {{research philosophies}} for the efficient development of models and performance analysis techniques {{to be applied}} to network measurements. The first philosophy consists on the preconditioning of measurement data in order to fit traditional mathematical models. This philosophy emerges from the fact that data measurements experience complex patterns due to internal network components, and applying traditional models to this data generates poor models. We also develop a second philosophy for the performance analysis of multi-layer networks. We argue that for the correct evaluation of today’s networks, we must draw performance conclusions from a detailed study of the cross-layer protocol interactions. We provide an application for each philosophy and prove the validity of these new research approaches. We show results for the case of GSM <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>network,</b> and propose to continue this dissertation study by applying same techniques to GPRS, and WLAN.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{performance}} evaluation of link layer error recovery over wireless links. Our analysis is based upon a case study of the circuit-switched data service implemented in GSM <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> We collected a large set of block erasure traces in different radio environments and used a measurement-based approach to derive real-world models of the wireless link. We show that the throughput of the GSM circuit-switched data channel can be improved by up to 25 percent by increasing the (fixed) frame size of the reliable link layer protocol. Our results also suggest that adaptive frame length control could further increase the channel throughput. In general, our case study shows that pure end-to-end error recovery fails to optimize throughput when wireless links form parts of the end-to-end path. In many cases, it leads to decreased end-to-end throughput, an unfair load on a best-effort network, such as the Internet, and a waste of valuable radio resources (e. g., spectrum and transmission power). In fact, we show that link layer error recovery over wireless links is essential for reliable flows to avoid these problems. 1...|$|R

In Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia, most of the providers use 900 and 1800  MHz bands. The GSM- 900 system uses the frequency band (890 – 915) MHz for uplink and the band (935 – 960) MHz for downlink. While, the GSM- 1800 system uses the frequency band (1710 – 1785) MHz for uplink and the band (1805 – 1880) MHz for downlink. In GSM systems, up to eight users share the same frequency channel, and each phone transmits only one-eighth of the time as the time division multiple access (TDMA) is used, so the average power is one-eighth of the peak power. GSM- 900 phones have a peak power of 2  W, and as the maximum average power is one-eighth of the peak power. Hence, the GSM- 900 mobile phones radiate an average power of 250 mW. GSM- 1800 phones have a peak power of 1  W; hence the GSM- 1800 mobile phones radiate an average power of 125 mW [19]. In this paper, the mobile phone is designed to operate in GSM- 1800 frequency band.|$|R
