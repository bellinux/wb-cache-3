40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} & determine premium petroleum demand in Indonesia, focusing on the period of 1980 - 1995. Employing a logarithmic model this study also measures price-elasticity, income-elasticity, and the cross-elasticity of <b>premium</b> <b>petrol</b> with lubricants. It is found that the demand is inelastic towards income, inelastic towards price, and that lubricants arc strong complementariness for <b>premium</b> <b>petrol.</b> Thus {{it can be concluded}} that <b>premium</b> <b>petrol</b> is a normal good (neither superior nor inferior), a relatively basic need with little or no substitutes and its demand is complementary with the demand or lubricants. Since <b>premium</b> <b>petrol</b> is a basic need for Indonesian people Government with almost no substitutes, the should not take rash steps that would cause the price of petrol apparent that if Indonesia would like to re 4 uce the consumption of <b>premium</b> <b>petrol,</b> price policies would not be very effective as price-elasticity is low. Non-price policies, eg., introduction of alternative energy, would probably be more potent...|$|E

5000|$|... Iran has 3,200 gas {{stations}} for 15 million automobiles. Demand {{is supported by}} the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and <b>premium</b> grade <b>petrol</b> IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.|$|R

40|$|Gasohol is {{a mixture}} of <b>premium</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) with alcohol, in this case ethanol. The use of gasohol can reduce fuel {{consumption}} without having to modify the existing engine. Therefore, this research is conducted to study the characteristics and performance of gasohol in various mixing ratios, which includes analysis of physical properties and the use of gasohol in the machine. Results show that the addition of technical ethanol at 7. 0169 %v increases the value of gasohol vapor pressure on the value of 8. 6682 psi (7. 7 psi for regular gasoline). Gasohol with technical ethanol content above 30 %v decreases vapor pressure, promotes phase separation, and causes a sharp drop in temperature from 40 %v distillation. In term of corrosivity, gasohol with up to 50 %v ethanol content has the same corrosion level with regular gasoline, which is corrosion level 1 A. Based on gasohol characteristics test, it is known that gasohol with technical ethanol content below 20 %v {{can be used as a}} fuel substitute for gasoline. Real-time performance test of gasohol in engines has shown that the addition of ethanol content in gasohol tend to increase the engine power at a certain compression ratio, but it also increases fuel consumption because the heat value of ethanol is lower than gasoline. Machine in gasohol with ethanol content below 20 %v can operate smoothly without having to modify the engine. Based on the studies that have been done, gasohol in the range of 10 %v ethanol content is well-functioned as a substitute for gasoline fuel and meets fuel specifications required by the General Director of Oil and Gas. The feasibility of using gasohol as an alternative fuel can be studied further...|$|E
40|$|Oil market speculation, {{the market}} power of OPEC, and the {{reaction}} patterns of non-OPEC suppliers can be identified as the essential factors affecting the development of oil prices. Acting {{in the manner of}} a monopolist, OPEC is trying to implement a revenue-maximising strategy, with due consideration given to the policy of its competitors. With a view to medium-term developments, the volume of reserves also has to be taken into account. Given the most recent price movements, the crude oil price for Brent (Austria) will average around 28. 7 $ per barrel in 2000. On a medium-term basis, OPEC will presumably succeed in assessing the behaviour of its competitors correctly and, hence, adopt a monopolist strategy. This will probably result in a price level of between 25 $ and 30 $ per barrel, the decisive factor being the short-term minimum price level for investments in additional oil exploration by non-OPEC producers. According to the IEA, OPEC will reach a market share of 50 percent after 2010, with non-OPEC suppliers operating at their maximum production levels. Higher oil prices have a direct impact on the Austrian economy by pushing up the prices of other sources of energy. These price increases are due, on the one hand, to the reaction of world-market energy prices to the oil price and, on the other hand, to changing prices (in ATS) for imports into Austria. In 2000, ATS prices for Brent increased by approximately 83 percent. This development triggers price increases for oil products (fuel oil) of around 40 percent. The prices of coal and gas, up by 2. 2 percent and 4. 4 percent, respectively, are less strongly affected. The impact on gas prices is likely to persist in the coming year, while coal may be "decoupled" from oil price developments. Electricity prices have even declined in 2000 in the wake of market liberalisation. <b>Premium</b> <b>petrol</b> and diesel prices increased by 18 percent and 23 percent, respectively. According to WIFO's current assessment, the direct effect of oil price increases in 2000 (given the weight of energy) in Austria on the consumer price index is about 1 percentage point. Well-founded statements on the macroeconomic effects of a high-oil-price scenario (40 $ per barrel at constant 1990 prices) can be derived from model simulations based on E 3 ME for 19 European regions. Across the 19 regions replicated in E 3 ME, a GDP effect of – 2. 5 percent and a reduction of employment by 4. 1 percent can be observed in 2010. The overall effect of – 2. 1 percent against baseline for all regions compares with an effect of – 1. 6 percent for Austria. The drop in demand for energy is associated with substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO 2). If the expected reduction of emissions is related to the Kyoto targets of the individual countries in percent of 1990 emissions agreed upon within the framework of European "burden sharing", it appears that a substantial part of these reductions would occur automatically under a high-oil-price scenario.

5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for <b>premium</b> grade <b>petrol</b> (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|R

50|$|The pump {{price of}} P.M.S. {{currently}} stands at around ₦145 at fueling stations across Nigeria. An initial {{increase in the}} price of <b>petrol</b> (<b>Premium</b> Motor Spirit) from around ₦65 to ₦140 triggered by the removal of fuel subsidies on January 1, 2012, triggered a total strike and massive protests across the country. Then President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan later reached an agreement with the Nigerian Labour Congress and reduced the pump price to 97 naira. The pump price was further reduced by 10 naira to 87 naira {{in the run-up to the}} 2015 general elections. However, after the elections of Muhammadu Buhari, the fuel subsidies was removed again, and the pump price increased again, despite the fall in oil price. Since the fall in oil prices in 2015 and 2016, the government exchange rate policy has limited devaluation of the naira due to inflation concerns by the President Muhammadu Buhari.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Victor, {{launched on}} 28 February 1957, was coded the F series {{and saw a}} production run of more than 390,000 units. The car was of unitary construction and featured a large glass area with heavily curved windscreen and rear window. Following then current American styling trends, the windscreen pillars sloped backwards. In fact, the body style was derived directly from the classic 57 Chevrolet Bel Air, though this was not obvious unless the two cars were viewed side by side. Bench seats were fitted front and rear trimmed in Rayon and [...] "Elastofab", and two-colour interior trim was standard. The Super model had extra chrome trim, notably around the windows; remnants of the signature Vauxhall bonnet flutes ran along the front flanks and the exhaust pipe exited through the rear bumper. The car was equipped with arm rests on the doors, door-operated courtesy lights, a two-spoke steering wheel, and twin sun visors. An estate variant was launched in 1958. When re-styled, as the Series 2, the car lost all its '57 Chevy styling detail and the teardrop shaped Vauxhall flutes were replaced by a single chrome side-stripe running nose to tail. The sculpted [...] "porthole" [...] rear bumper tips, which rusted badly due to exhaust residue, were replaced by plain, straight ones. The old bumper ends continued {{to be used for}} many years on a variety of motor coaches and ice-cream vans.Although the engine was of similar size to that of the outgoing Wyvern it was in critical respects new. Fitted with a single Zenith carburettor it had an output of [...] at 4200 rpm and gained a reputation of giving a long trouble free life. This was also the year when Vauxhall standardized on [...] "premium" [...] grade petrol/gasoline, permitting an increase in the compression ratio from the Wyvern's 6.8:1 to 7.8:1. <b>Premium</b> grade <b>petrol</b> had become available in the UK at the end of 1953, following an end to post-war fuel rationing, and at that time offered average octane level of 93, but in the ensuing four years this had crept up to 95 (RON).|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{trends in the}} deposition of lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and manganese in Canterbury, New Zealand, have been studied. The two main aspects {{of this study were}} an atmospheric deposition monitoring programme set up over the study area to assess present-day spatial trends; and an assessment of the ability of kahikatea tree ring wood to record historical trends in levels of heavy metals in the Christchurch atmosphere. The main instrumental technique used was atomic absorption spectrophotometry, with both flame and graphite furnace atomisation. To study the dispersal of the metal-enriched aerosol from Christchurch, a network of deposition collectors was established over part of the Canterbury Plains. The main conclusions were that the rates of deposition of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium, but not manganese, showed an approximately exponential decay with distance away from Christchurch, and that the dispersion pattern was dependent upon the prevailing wind direction. It was also found that while rural deposition rates of zinc, copper and cadmium were lower than in other developed countries, the rates of lead deposition were similar to or higher than their overseas counterparts. Considerable seasonal variations in metal deposition rates tended to obscure an expected reduction in lead deposition fluxes following a reduction in the lead content of New Zealand <b>premium</b> grade <b>petrol</b> in July 1986. Concentrations of lead, zinc, copper, manganese and cadmium were determined in the topsoils at the deposition collection sites, to assess the influence of atmospheric deposition on topsoil composition. Substantial differences, overriding the natural variability in soil composition, were found to exist between urban and rural soils. However, in rural sites, variations in metal deposition rates did not produce effects visible above natural variations, {{with the possible exception of}} lead. To gain an historical perspective on the metal pollution history of Christchurch, the annual rings of kahikatea trees in Riccarton Bush, Christchurch, were analysed for lead, zinc, copper, manganese and cadmium. It was found that kahikatea trees appeared sensitive to environmental levels of these metals, showing accumulations of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium which appeared related to known historical emission trends. However, manganese concentrations in the ring wood appeared to be controlled by soil factors. A background stand of kahikatea trees showed no trends of increasing metal concentrations. The use of peat deposits for historical monitoring purposes was also investigated. It was concluded that the only metals which appeared relatively immobile within the peat profile, hence indicating potential for recording historical trends in deposition fluxes, were copper and cadmium. The other metals appeared to have been mobilised by the severely anaerobic conditions in the bogs, as they were depleted below the permanent water table. However, deposition rates calculated in the surface peat were similar to fluxes measured by a conventional deposition collector at a similar site...|$|R
