5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway <b>Planning</b> <b>Unit</b> later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E

The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized {{in the event of}} an emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment {{in the event of an}} emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

40|$|PREMISE: The <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> {{development}} of suburban communities can accomplish three primary housing goals: first, {{the reduction of}} the per unit cost of housing; second, the inclusion of more public open space and; third, the provision of a more rational land use pattern of growth. PRESENTATION: Part one introduces the thesis and describes the present suburban housing problem in perspective. It discusses one particular aspect of the suburban housing problem [...] "the rising cost of land. " Finally, Part one proposes the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> development as a possible alternative to the rising cost of land and states the criteria for this proposition. Part two proves the proposition by comparing the advantages of the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> development over the conventional subdivision's uniform zoning to three divergent groups: the developer, the town, and the buyer. Part three concludes the thesis by analyzing the record of the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> development for solving the suburban housing problem and points up some of the implications which the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> development has upon suburban form...|$|R

25|$|In August 2004, HEEP {{strategic}} priorities were {{adjusted to}} become {{responsive to the}} requirements of quality and accreditation and to correspond to the government's approach to improving scientific research.

Due to the dynamic nature of the reform strategy, which entails reconsidering priorities for each period, a Strategic <b>Planning</b> <b>Unit</b> (SPU) was established for the MOHE to ensure the sustainability of planning and project monitoring during the three phases and for future ones.

25|$|Following Laker's {{departure}} from BUA, Max Stuart-Shaw was appointed as BUA's new MD. Stuart-Shaw {{was a former}} senior manager at Central African Airways. His brief was to oversee the successful implementation of the board's original policy decision taken in the early 1960s to transform BUA into a scheduled airline. Although Laker had largely succeeded in welding the various constituent airlines that made up BUA into a single, integrated enterprise {{towards the end of}} his tenure while ensuring the business remained profitable, it lacked the quality of a frontline scheduled carrier. Despite the growth in scheduled activities during that period, the airline was still perceived as mainly a charter and freight operator. When Stuart-Shaw took over from Laker, he strengthened BUA's management organisation by developing the personnel department, expanding the <b>planning</b> <b>unit,</b> as well as reorganising operations and engineering. He also improved the quality of the airline's marketing. As a result, BUA witnessed a major improvement in the quality of its promotional material and in the number of flights departing on time, making its punctuality record one of the UK airline industry's best.|$|E

In 2010 a proposal for 25 houses for a site off Stockwell Way was opposed by the parish council and refused by the district council as it was outside the village boundary and contrary to district council adopted policy. Planning details can be accessed via the parish council website. Possible urban extensions to Northampton were proposed in 2007 by the West Northamptonshire Joint <b>Planning</b> <b>Unit,</b> a group formed by Northampton Borough Council, South Northamptonshire District Council and Daventry District Council. These proposals included extensions on land in the parish between the M1 motorway, north of the village, A43 by-pass (west), A508 trunk road (east) and the West Coast main railway line to the south. A parkway station south the village was also mentioned but train operators do not want further stops on the line between London and Rugby via Northampton.
