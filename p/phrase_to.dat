5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing <b>phrase</b> <b>to</b> start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a {{group of}} United Nations experts—continue to {{investigate}} increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the <b>phrase</b> <b>to</b> outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the theorems {{stated in}} Gödel's 1931 paper, many {{contemporary}} {{statements of the}} incompleteness theorems are more general in two ways.

5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a <b>phrase</b> <b>to</b> be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E

Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad.

25|$|The {{method used}} in Hereditary Genius has been {{described}} as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this <b>phrase</b> <b>to</b> the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as birth order and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.|$|E

25|$|The Met's {{collection}} of Islamic {{art is not}} confined strictly to religious art, though {{a significant number of}} the objects in the Islamic collection were originally created for religious use or as decorative elements in mosques. Much of the 12,000 strong collection consists of secular items, including ceramics and textiles, from Islamic cultures ranging from Spain to North Africa to Central Asia. The Islamic Art department's {{collection of}} miniature paintings from Iran and Mughal India are a highlight of the collection. Calligraphy both religious and secular is well represented in the Islamic Art department, from the official decrees of Suleiman the Magnificent to a number of Qur'an manuscripts reflecting different periods and styles of calligraphy. Modern calligraphic artists also used a word or <b>phrase</b> <b>to</b> convey a direct message, or they created compositions from the shapes of Arabic words. Others incorporated indecipherable cursive writing within the body of the work to evoke the illusion of writing.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of written sentence strips to teach children with autism to independently request using a variety of requesting phrases. Previous research has shown that written sentence strips and script fading techniques are effective in teaching conversation comments and social interaction to children with autism; however, the use of written sentence strips <b>to</b> teach requesting <b>phrases</b> <b>to</b> children with autism has not been examined. The present study introduced requesting <b>phrases</b> <b>to</b> participants with autism through a written strip, and then fading techniques were used to teach independent use of the request phrases. A multiple baselines across participants and behaviors design was used to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment. The results of this study showed that both participants independently used the newly taught requesting <b>phrases,</b> although <b>to</b> varying degrees. The participants also generalized the taught <b>phrases</b> <b>to</b> new stimuli and new settings...|$|R
