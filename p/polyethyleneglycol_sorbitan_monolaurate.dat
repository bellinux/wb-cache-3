In this study, we investigated various preparations to improve the intestinal absorption of CoQ 10 with focus {{on the effect of}} emulsification. We prepared a suspension and some emulsions with four types of surfactants and investigated the plasma concentration profile after oral administration to rats. The absorption of CoQ 10 was improved by an emulsion formulation although there was little absorption of CoQ 10 when a suspension was administered. However, little CoQ 10 was absorbed in the bile duct-ligated group even when the emulsion formulation was administered (about 50 % of the control group). Bile and emulsion formulation are essential for absorption of CoQ 10.

The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), sorbitan monopalmitate (Tween 40), and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (Tween 20), have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these wetting agents is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes. It is therefore desirable to find other types of wetting agents capable of promoting dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli and stable in the presence of animal tissues.

The consumption of glutamic acid by K. catenaforma was not detected at 24 hr of culture. The difference between the consumption of aspartic acid and glutamic acid in this strain might result from a difference in permeability to the amino acids. We considered that L-glutamic acid might substitute for L-aspartic acid if the uptake of glutamic acid could be increased.

It was found that calcium hydroxide content in silica nanoparticles incorporated cement paste reduced ~ 89 % at 1 day and up to ~ 60 % at 28 days of hydration process. Synthesized silica particles and cement paste samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X&# 8208;ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ...|$|R
40|$|Mixed dairy gels (including {{a control}} without fat) of skim milk powder (SMP) and whey protein isolate (WPI) {{containing}} fat globules were formed by heating protein emulsions to 90 °(and by acid release from glucono- 0 -lactone {{to provide a}} pH of 4. 3 - 4. 4. Fat globules with artificial protein membranes (FGAPM) were prepared by homogenization of a butter oil /water mixture {{in the presence of}} WPI while fat globules without membranes were stabili zed with polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (Tween 20). Both emulsions were added at a 4 % (w/w) leve l to solutions having 3 % SMP and 8. 3 % WPI. The gel contai ning FGAPM had significantly higher compressive streng th than the control without fat (2. 4 versus 1. 8 kPa, respectively) and microst ru ctural ly it was a mixed gel in which the FGAPM, casein and whey protein aggregates formed a copolymer network. Addition of fat globules without membranes led to a filled gel weaker th an the control without fat (1. 4 versus 1. 8 kPa, respectivel y). Bonding of the protein membrane in FGAPM to the gel network and presence of in dividually di spersed fat globules without membranes was demonstrated by trans mission electron microscopy. The difference in microstructure is proposed to be responsible for the mechanical properties of each gel...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} on topical application of lidocaine-loaded non-ionic surfactant vesicles (NSVs) {{was prompted by}} the great interest on new delivery systems for local anaesthetics. This study is focused on a novel formulation of NSVs entrapping lidocaine {{in the form of}} a free base (LID) and a hydrochloride (LIDHCl). NSVs were prepared from polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monolaurate</b> (Tween 20 (TM)) and cholesterol. The effect of vesicle composition and environmental pH condition (8. 6 - 5. 5) on drug encapsulation efficiency (e. e.) was investigated. Experimental strategies involved: freeze-fracture, microscopy technique, dynamic light scattering, permeation through Silastic(TM) and mouse abdominal skin, in vitro release kinetics of vesicle-entrapped drugs, fluorescence quenching analyses. Diffusion experiments showed that the flux of charged lidocaine through Silastic(TM) membrane was possible only after the vesicle encapsulation. Permeation through mouse abdominal skin of LIDHCl loaded vesicles showed a higher flux and a shorter lag time with respect to classical liposome formulations, while LID permeation rate was quite similar for NSV and liposome formulations. Vesicles were also prepared in the presence of dicetylphosphate (DCP) and N-cetylpyridinium chloride (CP) to obtain negatively and positively charged vesicles respectively, but in this case the e. e. of the drug was negligible. The possible reason of the remarkable lower e. e. observed with charged vesicles was investigated by means of fluorescence quenching experiments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
