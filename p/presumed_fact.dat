40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the phenomenology of inference. It proposes that the conscious character of conscious inferences is partly constituted {{by a sense}} of meaning; specifically, a sense of what Grice called ‘natural meaning’. In consciously drawing the (outright, categorical) conclusion that Q from a <b>presumed</b> <b>fact</b> that P, one senses the <b>presumed</b> <b>fact</b> that P as meaning that Q, where ‘meaning that’ expresses natural meaning. This sense of natural meaning is phenomenologically analogous, I suggest, to our sense of what is said in fluently comprehending everyday utterances in our first language. The proposal that conscious inference involves a sense of natural meaning is compared with views according to which conscious inference involves taking the premises (i) to be good reasons for the conclusion (as defended by Thomson and Grice), (ii) to support it (as argued by Audi and, recently, Boghossian), or (iii) to imply it (as lately contended by Broome). I argue our proposal can explain certain phenomena handled by alternatives (i) and (ii), but that some further phenomena is handled by our account but not these alternatives. In relation to alternative (iii), I argue that, in so far as implicational and natural-meaning relations come apart, the latter are a better fit for what we sense or take to be so in conscious inference...|$|E

40|$|The main {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to compare selected body shape factors of adolescents belonging to different physical self - concept subgroups, and to identify those s omatic factors that have the strongest influence on the physical self - concept in adolescents. A randomly selected subsample of the 2 nd Hungarian National Growth Study formed the sample of the analysis. Besides the anthropometric investigations the Tenness ee self - concept scale (that is a self - report measure and assesses the global self - concept and its components) was administered to altogether 3409 adolescents (1701 boys and 1708 girls, aged between 11 and 18 years). M ultinomial logistic regression was used to reveal the relationship between the absolute body dimensions, relative body dimensions, nutritional status, body mass components, body shape and physical self - concept in the studied age interval. The better the body image, the smaller the fatness was f ound in both sexes. In adolescents having negative self - concept endomorphy was significantly larger than in their age - peers with good self - concept. The <b>presumed</b> <b>fact</b> that obesity is not popular in adolescent s has been confirmed by this study. However, the underweight nutritional status was found to be attractive in the girls. These results informed us about the considerable influence of the pubertal not normal nutritional status on the discrepancy between the ideal and actual self - concepts. The strong infl uence of the other components of self - concept on the physical self - concept was evidenced as well.

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{problem of}} the entropy of the universe as a whole arises from the difficulties encountered by classical thermodynamics—first in failing {{to account for the}} <b>presumed</b> <b>fact</b> that the entropy of the universe has always been increasing at an enormous rate and nevertheless has not yet reached its maximum value—and second in failing to allow an emotionally satisfactory feeling towards our universe whose ultimate fate would be the stagnation of "heat-death. " The purpose of the present article is to examine this problem {{from the point of view}} of the extension of thermodynamics to general relativity which has previously been made by the author. A number of earlier contributions to the solution of the problem, which have been made from the standpoint of classical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, are first briefly described in order to emphasize the very different character of the contribution to the problem made in the present article. It is then pointed out that the {{problem of the}} entropy of the universe arises in the classical thermodynamics because of the presumption that thermodynamic processes cannot take place both reversibly and at a finite rate, and that the general nature of the contribution to the problem offered by relativistic thermodynamics consists in showing the possibility of thermodynamic changes which could take place at a finite rate and at the same time reversibly without increase in entropy. The principles of relativistic thermodynamics are then reviewed, and this difference between the classical and relativistic thermodynamics is shown by considering the possibilities of carrying out reversible changes at a finite rate in the properties of a thermodynamic fluid. In the classical thermodynamics it is found that no change in the thermodynamic properties could be allowed to take place at a finite rate, the entropy density of the fluid necessarily remaining constant in accordance with the equation dφ 0 /dt= 0. On the other hand, in relativistic thermodynamics it is found possible to allow changes to take place at a finite rate in the proper volume of the fluid, due to changes in the gravitational potentials gμν, and still maintain reversibility provided the changes satisfy the relation ∂/∂x 4 (φ 0 sqrt[-g]dx 4 /ds) = 0. To exhibit the nature of the reversible changes at a finite rate thus permitted in relativistic thermodynamics, consideration is given to the highly idealized model of a non-static universe filled with black-body radiation as a thermodynamic fluid, and it is shown that the radius, total proper volume, and entropy density of such a universe could be changing at a finite rate and yet reversibly without increase in entropy. Furthermore, in the case of an expanding model of the kind considered, it is shown that an ordinary observer, who marks out with rigid meter sticks a small region of this universe in his immediate vicinity for study, would find the energy density, energy content, and the temperature of this region decreasing with the time, and would find the number of quanta leaving the region per second greater than the number entering, and the average frequency of the quanta that leave greater than that of those that return. These phenomena would be interpreted by the observer, from a classical point of view, as due to radiation from his neighborhood into the colder surroundings of space and hence as leading to an increase in entropy, in spite of the fact that all the processes taking place in such a model would actually be reversible from the point of view of the relativistic thermodynamics which should be applied to such a problem. In conclusion remarks are made concerning the disparity between the above model, which was chosen for purposes of illustration because of its mathematical simplicity, and models which would be more suitable to serve as representations of the actual universe. And some indication is given of the further developments that should be undertaken...|$|E

The solution is sought in some ‘new’ epistemologies: Martín Alcoff, Grosz, Kristeva, Butler, {{as well as in}} Benjamin and Gadamer, who look back to older ways of knowing. The methodology is an archaeology of these ways of knowing, focussed on a crucial transition in the understanding of representation between the renaissance and the baroque. It uses quintessential methods of the humanities: narrative, keywords and critique. The narrative tracks two keywords of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, signature and illusion (inganno), through their uses in renaissance science and baroque arts and philosophy. Following the enlightenment split between the understanding of the arts or humanities and sciences, the keywords re-emerge in familiar contemporary legal forms: the signature as an efficacious performative; illusion as ideology and repression. The truth in law, as in the arts and humanities, is built up from interrogation of representations, prior understanding, and comprehension of human motivation. For this it needs a hermeneutics based in tradition and memory. Since representations and interpretations can be vehicles for rationalisation and repression, there is also need for a critical hermeneutics, which may find truth in unexpected places, such as the repressed memory uncovered in an old ritual or image...|$|R
40|$|Our {{hypothesis}} {{is that there is}} 'wear and tear' in the brain, which is the basis of the process of aging, but that stimulation of brain function may slow down brain aging and diminish the risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly by activating repair mechanisms. Evidence supporting this {{hypothesis is}} presented in this review. During normal aging and in AD, cell loss is not as prominent a phenomenon as is often <b>presumed.</b> In <b>fact,</b> unaltered neuronal numbers have been reported in many brain areas in AD, e. g. in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) where the number of large neurons decreases while that of small neurons increases. Decreased neuronal activity is an essential characteristic of AD, and a substantial decrease of cerebral glucose metabolism may even precede cognitive impairments. Some hypothalamic neurons remain intact and active during the process of aging, others become even hyperactive, which may lead to disorders. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were found to be higher in the elderly than in young subjects. There is an age-related, sex-dependent activation of the AVP neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which may be the basis of analogous changes in the prevalence of hypertension and hyponatraemia in the elderly. No significant functional loss of magnocellular hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons were found in the SON or PVN in AD. The activity of the corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic PVN is the basis for the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is activated during aging in a sex-dependent way, and even more activated in AD. The activated HPA axis is a risk for depression. Environmental stimulation increases brain reserve. An increase in time spent on intellectual activities was associated with a significant decrease in probability to get AD, and occupation has even a stronger indication of diminished risk for dementia. A series of observations showed that a dysfunctional clock may underlie the disordered rhythms in AD. Additional bright light improved the rest-activity rhythms, while giving bright light and/or melatonin to AD patients ameliorated the progression of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms. This implies that neurons affected by AD can still be reactivated if the right stimuli are applied. Unknown diffusible factors from the neural stem cells improve the survival of aged and degenerating neurons in postmortem human brain slice cultures. Gene therapy with nerve growth factor aimed at the NBM showed metabolic activation of various brain regions. A microarray study of the prefrontal cortex in the course of AD revealed an increased expression of genes related to synaptic activity and changes in plasticity during the very early pre-symptomatic stages, which is proposed to represent a coping mechanism against increased soluble β-amyloid levels. In brief, these examples of the 'use it or lose it' principle during the course of aging or AD now provide novel targets for the development of therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention and treatment of A...|$|R
