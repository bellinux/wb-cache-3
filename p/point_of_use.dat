5|$|The National Health Service (NHS) is the {{publicly}} funded healthcare system in England {{responsible for providing}} the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence {{in the provision of}} public services compared {{to the rest of the}} UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.|$|E

25|$|Healthcare in Canada is {{delivered}} through a publicly funded healthcare system, which is mostly free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and has most {{services provided by}} private entities. The system was established by {{the provisions of the}} Canada Health Act of 1984. The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual's health, which remains confidential between a person and his or her physician.|$|E
25|$|Attlee's Health Minister, Aneurin Bevan, {{fought hard}} against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, {{including}} the British Medical Association, by creating the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8½million dental patients and dispensed more than 5million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.|$|E

25|$|Application of {{electric}} motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes {{were no longer}} limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor, providing easy control at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses {{of electric}} motors reduced heavy labor {{in the home and}} made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors stand {{for more than half of}} the electric energy consumption in the US.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans {{are less}} likely to receive {{preventive}} services in health care. For example, minorities are not regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms. Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing, flu immunizations and pap smears. In the UK, Public Health England, a universal service free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> which forms part of the NHS, offers regular screening to any member of the population considered to be in an at-risk group (such as individuals over 45) for major disease (such as colon cancer, or diabetic-retinopathy).|$|E
25|$|Another major {{component}} of central government expenditure in Scotland is on healthcare and healthcare related services. The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly controlled provider {{of the majority of}} healthcare in Scotland, with the NHS being a major employer not only in terms of; doctors, nurses, and other key healthcare workers, but also in terms of administration. The service is administered differently {{from the rest of the}} United Kingdom and is largely free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> to residents in Scotland, except for dental and optical services where those over 18 must pay. In the short term spending on healthcare in Scotland remains high in response to the population's poor diet and high instance of heart disease. In the medium to long term, the challenges of an ageing population are likely to increase demand for health services and put increasing pressure on the health service in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, the {{production}} of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than {{the production}} of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas. When evaluating costs, fossil fuels are generally used as the reference. The energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort and so has no cost assigned to it. Only the extraction, refining, transportation and production costs are considered. On the other hand, the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured, and so has a significant cost, on top of all the costs of refining, transportation, and distribution. Systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly, for example in trolleybuses, or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant economic advantage because there are fewer conversion processes required between primary energy source and <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reducing water {{consumption}} and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of {{water consumption}} {{is that in}} many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout {{the life of a}} building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.|$|E
500|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. Commercially, {{there are two types of}} rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems. In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> can pose problems. [...] Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.|$|E

2500|$|As in Scandinavia, {{healthcare}} in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, meaning England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales {{each have}} their own systems of private and publicly funded healthcare, generally {{referred to as the}} National Health Service (NHS). With largely private providers, this also fits into the 'Beveridge Model' of health care systems, sometimes considered to be single-payer, although unlike Scandinavia, there is a more significant role for both private coverage and providers. Each country's having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.

2500|$|The cost of {{electricity}} to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than {{one quarter of the}} cost of gasoline in California. Compared to conventional vehicles, PHEVs produce less air pollution locally and require less petroleum. PHEVs may produce less in the way of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, than conventional vehicles do. PHEVs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated with all-electric vehicles, because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted, giving PHEVs driving-range comparable to that of other vehicles that have gasoline and diesel tanks.
