40|$|Aim: To improve malaria {{control in}} {{children}} {{less than five}} years of age. Objectives: To assess the impact of reducing the direct cost of health care on utilization of health services and morbidity associated with malaria among children under 5 years old. Primary objective To compare the prevalence of anaemia (Hb< 8 g/dl) among children six to fifty-nine months of age, from households with and without improved financial access. Secondary objectives included: To compare the health service utilization rate among children from households with or without improved financial access; to compare household all-cause mortality between the trial arms, to examine primary and major secondary outcomes by socio-economic status of households, to compare outcomes among children from self-enrolled and trial-enrolled households; and to document community knowledge and attitudes on user fees. Methods: 2332 households containing 2757 children less than 5 years of age in Dangme West, Ghana were randomised either to be enrolled into a <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> operating allowing free access to primary care, including drugs or to a control which paid user fees for their health care as pertained normally. These included 138 households, comprising 165 children, who had enrolled in the <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> prior to the closure of the registration window were included in the study as an observational arm. 2 Results: 2194 households comprising 2592 children were allocated randomly into control and intervention groups. 138 households, comprising 165 children had themselves enrolled in the <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme.</b> At baseline, the two randomised groups were the same, but the group who self-enrolled were significantly less poor and had better health outcome measures. Introducing free primary healthcare significantly altered the healthcare seeking behaviour of households, with those randomly allocated to the intervention arm using formal healthcare more (95 % Cl 1. 04 - 1. 20; p=O. OOI) and home treatment and chemical sellers less than those in the control group. This did not, however, lead to any measurable difference in any of the health outcomes {{at the end of the}} six-month trial period. For the primary outcome of moderate anaemia there was no difference seen OR 1. 05 (0. 66 - 1. 67). Conclusions: This study suggests that reducing the direct cost of health care has a significant impact on healthcare-seeking behaviour but cannot, on its own, be assumed to have an impact on health outcomeEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Health Insurance is a {{mechanism}} for spreading the risks of incurring health care costs over a group of individuals and households. The health insurance schemes are policy concepts whereby officials formally hold funds consisting of contributions by insured participants and the resultant pool is designed to finance {{all or part of}} members ’ health costs (Obembe, 2007). The health insurance scheme is a <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> which ensures that participants are treated at the point of service delivery, thereby removing the user fees or ‘out of pocket scheme’. Out of pocket payment is one of the least desirable mechanism of financing health care, as it often denies health care to those who cannot pay {{at the time of their}} illness (Obembe, 2007). Thus, the removal of “out of pocket payment ” at the point of service delivery is the goal of health insurance scheme. The scheme assures or presumes that all participants are gainfully employed and that their financial contributions are deducted from source of salary income, while their employers also pay their contributions to the Health Management Organization (HMO) that they subscribe to. This assures that the participants should enjoy good health care at all times, with functional health facilities retained as health care providers. But in reality what we see is often a far cry from what is expected. Several deviations are noted from the participants of the scheme...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} health {{financing}} schemes shaped on <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> {{have been implemented}} across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to address the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In Mauritania, the Obstetric Risk Insurance package (ORI) focusing on maternal and perinatal health has been progressively implemented at the health district level since 2002. Here, our main objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of the ORI in increasing facility-based delivery rates, as well as increases in family planning, antenatal and postnatal care, caesarean delivery and neonatal health, from demographic and health survey data between 2002 and 2011. We also examined whether the effects of the ORI varied between strata of the population. The study was based on a quasi-experimental before-and-after design to assess the causal link between availability of ORI and increase in use of maternal health services and neonatal mortality. In combination with geographical information system, difference-in-differences and odd ratio approaches were used to address our objectives. Indicators of access to care for pregnant women and neonatal health and improved in both non-intervention and intervention groups during the study period. There was no global effect of the availability of ORI on facility-based delivery rates, nor on the use of antenatal and postnatal care services, except for qualified antenatal services. However, delivery rates in local health centres with ORI increased more rapidly than in those with no ORI, the contrary was shown for hospitals. Caesarean delivery and family planning decreased with ORI. Although late neonatal mortality rates remained low in the country, a significant decrease was seen in districts without ORI. Except for some strata of the population, ORI has not really met its objective of attracting more pregnant women towards facility-based health care...|$|E

Moreover, less borrowings, improved <b>pre-payment</b> <b>schemes,</b> lower foreign exchange rate and increased government revenue led to a continuous decline of external debt until the last year of the Arroyo administration, with an outstanding external debt of US$64.738 billion in 2009.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 75 - 79. In {{the face}} of rising health care costs and {{reductions}} imposed by budgetary cuts, many governments in developing countries are considering alternatives, other than general tax revenue, to finance their health services. The most popular options, so far adopted, include user fees, community <b>pre-payment</b> <b>schemes,</b> and health insurance. Social Health Insurance has been identified, by policy-makers in Uganda, as a potential source of extra funding for the health sector. As {{the establishment of the}} feasibility and viability is a formidable task, this study was restricted to the evaluation of one of the aspects that needs to be investigated before the introduction of social health insurance. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore employees' willingness to pay for Social Health Insurance (SHI), and to identify the factors that influence their willingness to contribute to a SHI scheme. Through the study I was also interested in establishing the extent to which employees' socio-economic characteristics and the SHI attributes affect their willingness to pay...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{importance of}} ensuring access to medicines, {{particularly for the}} poor, is reflected in MDG 8 however remains poor in many low and middle income countries (LMICs). Country specific evidence on access to medicines is weak in LMICs and research has rarely been from an integrated health systems perspective. This study used an evidence based approach to identify key priority concerns and emerging research questions related to access to medicines in Pakistan. WHO’s Access to Medicine Framework {{was used as the}} conceptual basis for data collection on rational usage, affordability, financing and health systems. Methods involved a systematic desk review, in-depth stakeholder interviews and a consensus building Roundtable exercise. In Pakistan there has been considerable work in terms of medicines related policy acts and operative guidelines. However considerable gaps exist between policy and practice and between medicine policies and health systems strategies. Average number of medications prescribed is higher than other LMICs and prescription practices frequently do not follow standard recommended therapies from specialists down to general practitioners. There is a widely entrenched private informal sector and shadow pharmacies which remains largely unregulated. Spending on drugs is mainly borne by households, accounts for 63 % of total spending on drugs in Pakistan as compared to only 18 % in OECD countries and can lead to catastrophic household expenditure. Medicine therapy for chronic care is particularly unaffordable even with use of low cost generics. Within the public sector, availability of essential generics is extremely low at 3. 3 % as compared to 29 - 54 % in LMICs. Public sector spending on drugs is far below the minimum $ 2 per capita indicated for LMICs and existing spending faces issues of questionable adherence to EDL, low quality drugs and outdated logistics management systems. Contracting out the management of BHUs has resulted in better medicine availability. There is serious shortage of trained manpower pharmacists across private and public sector with 0. 9 pharmacist / 100000 population in Pakistan far below recommended ratio of 1 pharmacist per 2000 population. Drug regulation also requires with registration of excessive number of drugs, wide quality variation in quality and pricing, and frequent instances of spurious drugs and black marketing. Chronic shortage of low prices essential medicines is a long standing issue linked to disincentive to production due to low pricing and flat price control. The above policy concerns raise need for research in key areas. First, there is need for surveys on continuous surveillance of policy impact on availability, price and affordability of medicines; mapping of private informal sector and shadow pharmacies; and consumer health seeking preferences. Second, collation is required of best practice lessons on registration, pricing, market vigilance and enhancement of rational drug use. Third, operation research pilots in key areas such as alternative health financing mechanisms involving commodity voucher, GP contracting, <b>pre-payment</b> <b>schemes,</b> equity funds for increasing drug availability and affordability; scientific improvement of logistics management system in public sector; and introducing community participation in accountability mechanisms. Pharmaceutical policy and research needs to be centrally placed within larger health systems related initiatives. It needs to be accompanied by sustained dialogue and interaction between multiple stakeholders including private sector. Adequate steps also need to be taken to ensure a continuous culture of research feeding into evidence based policie...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} {{is important for}} network design and deployment. Resource management and allocation have been studied under {{a wide variety of}} scenarios [...] - routing in wired networks, scheduling in cellular networks, multiplexing, switching, and channel access in opportunistic networks are but a few examples. In this dissertation, we revisit resource management in the context of routing and scheduling in multihop wireless networks and pricing in single resource systems. The first issue addressed is of delays in multihop wireless networks. The resource under contention is capacity which is allocated by a joint routing and scheduling algorithm. Delay in wireless networks is a key issue gaining interest with the growth of interactive applications and proliferation of wireless networks. We start with an investigation of the back-pressure algorithm (BPA), an algorithm that activates the schedule with the largest sum of link weights in a timeslot. Though the BPA is throughput-optimal, it has poor end-to-end delays. Our investigation identifies poor routing decisions at low loads as one cause for it. We improve the delay performance of max-weight algorithms by proposing a general framework for routing and scheduling algorithms that allow directing packets towards the sink node dynamically. For a stationary environment, we explicitly formulate delay minimization as a static problem while maintaining stability. We see similar improved delay performance with the advantage of reduced per time-slot complexity. Next, the issue of pricing for flow based models is studied. The increasing popularity of cloud computing and the ease of commerce over the Internet is making pricing a key issue requiring greater attention. Although pricing has been extensively studied in the context of maximizing revenue and fairness, we take a different perspective and investigate pricing with predictability. Prior work has studied resource allocations that link insensitivity and predictability. In this dissertation, we present a detailed analysis of pricing under insensitive allocations. We study three common pricing models [...] - fixed rate pricing, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, and congestion-based pricing, and provide the expected operator revenue and user payments under them. A <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> is also proposed where users pay on arrival a fee for their estimated service costs. Such a mechanism is shown to have lower variability in payments under fixed rate pricing and VCG auctions while generating the same long-term revenue as in a post-payment scheme, where users pay the exact charge accrued during their sojourn. Our formulation and techniques further the understanding of pricing mechanisms and decision-making for the operator...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} household {{survey of}} medical care cost and health seeking behaviour in a rural community was conducted in Kirinyaga District, Central Province, Kenya from December 1990 to January 1991. Thirteen hundred and seventy (1370) households were surveyed {{in order to assess}} morbidity, utilization of health facilities for outpatient medical care, maternity and mother child health services, and expenditure on medical care including maternity. Socio-economic (education, household income, household size etc.) factors and epidemiolog ical factors (morbidity distri but ion) were also examined in relation to utilization of health care facili ties. Opinion regarding heal th prepayment schemes and cost- sharing was also sought. From the study, 605 (44. 2) households reported an illness episode that afflicted a member of the household within a recall period of two weeks. This was extrapolated thus each person experienced 2. 2 illness episodes per year. The commonest diseases that were reported (as perce i ved by the respondents) were malaria(28. 3 %), respiratory diseases (27. 6 %), gastro-intestinal diseases (18. 7 %), accidents (burns and traumatic injuries) (5. 0 %), skin diseases (3. 3 %), all other diseases (14. 0 %) and headache(2. 5 %) as a symptomatic illness. Health care facility utilization information revealed that 60 % of the households had obtained outpatient services from public health facilities and 40 % from non-governmental facilities (private and missionary health facilities). The public health facilities had provided maternity care to 55 % of the households xxi of which 45 % was provided by the district hospital. The non- governmental provided maternity care to 20 % of the population and 25 % of deliveries took place at home. 89 % of the households obtain MCH care from government health facilities. Socio-economic and epidemiological factors influenced utilization of health facilities. These includes economic status (particularly household income), type of disease and duration of illness. The proportion of households that had incurred some out-of pocket expenditure on medical care was mainly on maternity services 74. 6 %, outpatient care 41. 0 % and self-medication 24. 6 %. They were found to have spent a mean of Ksh. 8. 90 (S. D. 7. 1) on self administered medicines obtained from the local shops, Ksh. 78. 20 (S. D. 72. 0), on prescriptions bought from the chemist and Ksh. 43. 70 (S. D. 38. 0) on routine laboratory investigations. The households that paid money for butpatient treatment in both public and fee-for services facilities, incurred a mean of Ksh. 62. 70 (S. D 72. 50). Mean maternity cost was Ksh. 199. 50 S. D. 297. 70 and this was mainly in form of fees. Annual estimate of medical expenditure by households was as follows: Self-medications Ksh. 231. 40 (S. D. 187) Prescriptions Laboratory Outpatient Maternity Ks h. 2033 (S. D. 1872) Ks h. 1630. 20 (S. D. 1885) Ksh. 1136. 20 (S. D. 988) Ksh. 197. 20 Expenditure on maternity services was highly skewed. Income from regular household economic activities was found xxii to have a significant influence on the choice of the place of delivery of children (Chi-squared = 45. 92589 D. F. 8,P-value 0. 0000 < 0. 05). Expenditure on outpatient services was not influenced by salary or wage income. However there was a significant spending across the different income groups, that higher income categories spent more money for outpatient than those in lower income. (Chi-squared = 17. 15229 D. F 8 P-value 0. 0286 < 0. 05). Only about 11. 0 % of the households were enroled into a medical insurance scheme and these were mainly enroled with the compulsory National Health Insurance Fund (N. H. I. F.). There was an overwhelming posi ti ve response 76. 0 %) towards the health <b>pre-payment</b> <b>scheme</b> discussed with the respondent (s). Most household respondents did not favour the idea of cost-sharing (user- fees) in government health fac il it ies. They expressed various reasons for not favouring cost-sharing. Among the prominent reasons was that the government should provide free health services (47. 0 %), that people are paying taxes (19. 1 %) and that drugs are always in short supply in these facilities (26. 7 %). However on enquiry into what are the necessary conditions to be fulfilled for cost-sharing to be appropriate, it was observed that adequate drug supply was very crucial. The study recommended that a Rural Heal th Insurance Fund can form the backbone for a viable long-term financing of the increasingly expensive health care to the rural community and thus supplement the government's effort in the improvement of public health services...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} {{of our society}} heavily relies on high mobility of people. Not only our social life but also our economy and trade are built upon a system where {{people need to be}} able to move around easily. The costs for building and maintaining a suitable transportation infrastructure to satisfy those needs are high, and to charge users is thus a central requirement. This calls for well functioning payment systems satisfying the multitude of requirements that transportation systems impose on them. Electronic payment systems have many benefits over traditional cash payments as they are easy to maintain, can be more secure, reduce revenue collection costs, and can reduce the execution time of a payment. However, as a drawback, currently employed electronic payment systems usually reveal a payer’s identity during a payment which greatly infringes customer privacy. In the transportation domain this allows to generate fine grain patterns of customers’ locations. Cryptographic payment protocols called e-cash have been proposed which allow to preserve a customer’s privacy. E-cash provides provable guarantees for both security and user privacy, as it allows secure, unlinkable payments which do not reveal the identity of the payer during a payment. From a security and privacy perspective these protocols present a good solution. However, even though e-cash protocols have been proposed three decades ago, there are relatively few actual implementations. One reason for this is their high computational complexity which makes an implementation on potential mobile payment devices rather difficult. While customers usually value their privacy they often do not accept to sacrifice convenience. A fast execution of payments is thus a hard constraint, which conflicts with the computational complexity of e-cash schemes. This dissertation analyzes how e-cash can be used to solve the issue of privacy in the domain of transportation payments while satisfying the unique requirements of transportation payment systems and achieving high security and ease of use. Highlyefficient implementations of the underlying cryptographic primitives of e-cash schemes on constrained devices as they might be used in the transportation setting are presented. Based on the efficient implementations of these primitives, e-cash schemes are analyzed with regards to speed and hardware requirements. The results show that e-cash presents a good solution for privacy-preserving payments in the domain of public transport, if the number of coins that have to be spent can be limited. It is further practically shown that this limitation can be alleviated relying on the e-cash based privacy-preserving <b>pre-payments</b> with refunds <b>scheme</b> (P 4 R). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the promising feature of supporting the encoding of user attributes into electronic coins can be implemented at only moderate extra cost. Finally, an ecash based e-mobility payment scheme is presented which highlights the flexibility and unique advantages of e-cash based transportation payment schemes...|$|R
