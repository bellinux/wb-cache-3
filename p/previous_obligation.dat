5000|$|The literal {{contract}} was, {{according to}} Gaius, a nomina transcripta, {{and capable of}} functioning in two ways. The first is a re in personam ("from thing to person"), and transformed a debt resulting from another contractual arrangement (sale, hire, for example).

The alternative was in transferring a debt from person to another: a personam in personam. The debt would be entered {{under the name of}} the person to whom it was being transferred.

40|$|Based on interviews, autobiographical materials, and archival {{documents}} from the mid-twentieth century, there is an attempt made to find answers {{to the question of}} how much the collectivization of agriculture in Poland broke young people’s emotional and economic ties with the family and their farms. The government’s decision on the necessity of making agriculture collective as soon as possible liberated the young from the <b>previous</b> <b>obligation</b> to inherit farms and allowed them to work outside agriculture without risking parental dissatisfaction. The establishment of production cooperatives enabled them to continue their studies in secondary school and made the dreams of those young people come true, namely to live in the city. It was much easier because the developing industries needed labour. This way the idea of patrimony, developed throughout decades as the sole basis of life of the peasant child was overthrown. Thus, with the move to the city such traditional peasant values as the authority of the father, piety, respect for bread faded away. The situation led to numerous conflicts with the family remaining in the countryside...|$|E
40|$|Prikazuje se {{institut}} obnove (novacije) prema rješenjima Zakona o obveznim odnosima. U prvom dijelu rada je obrađen pojam obnove te su prikazane pretpostavke za novaciju. Nakon toga govori se o sporazumima između suugovaratelja koji se ne smatraju obnovom. U nastavku se obrađuje razgraničenje obnove od sličnih instituta, a zatim pravni učinci valjanog ugovora o obnovi. U završnom poglavlju su sumirani rezultati analize izvršene u radu. According to the Obligations act (Official gazette, Nr. 35 / 05 and 41 / 08), renewal (novation, lat. novatio) is {{a contract}} between the creditor and debtor {{in which the}} existing obligation is terminated and {{is replaced by a}} new one, while the new contract has a different main obligation or different legal basis. Change of a subsidiary obligation is not considered a novation. For the novation it is necessary to cumulatively fulfil the following assumptions: 1. existence of a valid (old) main obligation, 2. will of the parties to exchange the existing obligation for a new one 3. difference between the main obligation or the legal basis, 4. will of the contractor (animus novandi). If the <b>previous</b> <b>obligation</b> was voidable, a legally valid novation is possible, but only if the debtor knew for the reasons of voidance. It is than taken that the debtor, by agreeing to novation, has given up the right to void the contract from which the obligation arises that is being renewed. If the debtor did not know about the voidance of the <b>previous</b> <b>obligation,</b> he is authorised to demand the termination of the contract about novation; after the contract on novation was terminated, it is considered that there was no novation and that the <b>previous</b> <b>obligation</b> did not stop. Novation has certain similarities with settlements and exchange of fulfilment, but still differs from these institutes. With novation, {{there has to be an}} intention and expressed will of the contract parties that by creating the new obligation the old one seizes to exist, while with settlement the previous legal relation is modified so that the first claim or obligation remain in some limited form. When talking about the realtion of novation and exchange of fulfilment, the difference is the following: whit novation the existing obligation is exchanged with a new one so that the old obligation seizes to exist without fulfilment, while with exchange of fulfilment the first obligation does not seize immediately – it seizes after he completes his new obligation. The basic legal impact of the legally valid contract on novation is shown in the fact that the <b>previous</b> <b>obligation</b> seizes to exist, and a new one starts instead. Means of insurance connected to the old obligation seize to exist as well (e. g. deposit, guarantee), as well as all the other subsidiary means – unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract. Nach dem Obligationengesetz (Amtsblatt Narodne novine Nr. 35 / 05 und 41 / 08) ist die Novation (novatio) ein Vertrag zwischen einem Gläubiger und einem Schuldner, durch den die bestehende Schuld erlischt und durch eine neue ersetzt wird, wobei sich der neue Vertrag auf eine andere Hauptleistung oder einen anderen Rechtsgrund bezieht. Die Veränderung einer Nebenleistung gilt nicht als Novation. Für die Novation müssen kumulativ folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: 1. das Bestehen einer gültigen (alten) Hauptschuld, 2. der Wille der Parteien, die bestehende Schuld durch eine neue zu ersetzen, 3. die Unterschiedlichkeit der Hauptleistung oder des Rechtsgrundes sowie 4. der Wille der Vertragsparteien (animus novandi). War die frühere Schuld anfechtbar, so ist eine rechtsgültige Novation möglich, allerdings nur, wenn der Schuldner den Grund der Anfechtbarkeit kannte. Dann wird davon ausgegangen, dass ein Schuldner, der der Novation zustimmt, auf sein Recht, den Vertrag, aus dem die erneuerte Schuld hervorgeht, anzufechten, verzichtet hat. Wusste der Schuldner nicht von der Anfechtbarkeit der früheren Schuld, ist er berechtigt, die Aufhebung des Novationsvertrags zu verlangen. Ist der Novationsvertrag aufgehoben, gilt, dass es keine Novation gab und die frühere Schuld nicht erloschen ist. Die Novation hat gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit dem Vergleich und dem Erfüllungsersatz, unterscheidet sich aber von diesen Instituten. Bei der Novation muss die Absicht und der bekundete Wille der Vertragsparteien bestehen, dass mit Entstehung einer neuen Schuld die alte erlischt, während beim Vergleich das frühere Rechtsverhältnis modifiziert wird, sodass der ursprüngliche Anspruch beziehungsweise die Schuld in einer geminderten Form weiter bestehen. Zwischen der Novation und dem Erfüllungsersatz wiederum besteht der Unterschied, dass bei der Novation die bisherige Schuld durch eine neue ersetzt wird, sodass die alte Schuld ohne Erfüllung endet, während beim Erfüllungsersatz die ursprüngliche Schuld des Schuldners nicht sofort erlischt, sondern erst, wenn er seine neue Schuld geleistet hat. Die grundlegende Rechtswirkung eines rechtsgültigen Novationsvertrags äußert sich darin, dass die frühere Schuld erlischt und statt ihrer eine neue entsteht. Auch Sicherheiten (z. B. Pfand, Bürgschaft), die an die frühere Schuld geknüpft waren, sowie sonstige Nebenansprüche erlöschen, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wurde...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the responses in the early modem period of civic and church authorities to local and visiting groups of players in Gloucester, Tewkesbury and Bristol. It is also an examination of the venues in which these groups performed. Reactions to these groups varied, and this study explores how these, both positive and negative, were affected by economic, legal and cultural factors. The thesis proceeds chronologically, and is thus divided into twenty-year intervals in order to draw the most effective comparisons between the three urban centres over a number of decades. The fIrst period under examination, the 1560 s, records the early reaction of the three settlements to the phenomenon ofthe Elizabethan travelling company. The relationship between the regional authorities and the patrons comes to the fore in the second period, the 1580 s, as the dominance of the ambitious Earl of Leicester grew in the region. Legislation decreeing the withdrawal of mayoral control over itinerant troupes {{at the close of the}} sixteenth century, the third period, released civic officials from <b>previous</b> <b>obligations</b> and this influenced the level and character of their hospitality towards the 'noble' companies. Although evidence is scarce, the records ofGloucester, Tewkesbury and Bristol contain clues to an attitude towards these entertainers during the reign of James I, the fmal period under scrutiny. The study is based on the extant economic records for the region, as these contain much fruitful information. This thesis consciously places itself in dialogue with the internationally acclaimed REED Project, and draws on the information collated by the editors of the volumes for Bristol and Gloucestershire. A parallel examination of the entries into municipal records of the three towns, and the areas around them, in conjunction with genealogical and topographical evidence, has allowed for an interpretation of the data in a wide regional context, revealing that although each town tolerated players in their municipal spaces, with the officials personally entertaining the companies on some occasions, the reception of the companies varied significantly from town to town and across the historic period.

Methods. In November 2008, a student society of health-systems pharmacy hosted a residency workshop and residency showcase. A 21 -item questionnaire was distributed {{at the end of the}} workshop and a follow-up 23 -item questionnaire was given to graduating pharmacy students to further evaluate the long-term effect the workshop had towards students’ decision in pursuing residency. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to evaluate and compare results. Results. 132 students participated in the workshop, where most of them were in their third professional year (35 %). Of those that participated, the workshop made no statistically significant difference in their pursuit of post-graduate training opportunities. Conclusion. The residency workshop did not influence student’s motivation to pursue a residency significantly. Based upon our analysis, future professional development programs may be modified to improve pharmacy student’s point of view and motivation in pursuing postgraduate training. Grants. The workshop was sponsored by the National American Society of Health System Pharmacists SEED Grant for $ 500 and Health Professions Division Grant for $ 3, 800...|$|R
