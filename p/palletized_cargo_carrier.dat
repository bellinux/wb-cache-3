We describe the development of a multi-ton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside people and vehicles, handling palletized materials within ex-isting, active outdoor storage facilities. The system has four novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal interface that allows users to efficiently convey task-level commands to the robot using a combination of pen-based gestures and natural lan-guage speech. These tasks include the manipulation, transport, and placement of <b>palletized</b> <b>cargo</b> within dynamic, human-occupied warehouses. The second is the robot’s ability to learn the visual identity of an object from a single user-provided example and use the learned model to reliably and persistently detect objects de-spite significant spatial and temporal excursions. The third is a reliance on lo-cal sensing that allows the robot to handle variable <b>palletized</b> <b>cargo</b> and navigate within dynamic, minimally-prepared environments without GPS.

40|$|Abstract — One long-standing {{challenge}} in robotics is {{the realization of}} mobile autonomous robots able to operate safely in existing human workplaces {{in a way that}} their presence is accepted by the human occupants. We describe the development of a multi-ton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside human personnel, handling palletized materials within existing, busy, semi-structured outdoor storage facilities. The system has three principal novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal tablet that enables human supervisors to use speech and pen-based gestures to assign tasks to the forklift, including manipulation, transport, and placement of <b>palletized</b> <b>cargo.</b> Second, the robot operates in minimally-prepared, semistructured environments, in which the forklift handles variable <b>palletized</b> <b>cargo</b> using only local sensing (and no reliance on GPS), and transports it while interacting with other moving vehicles. Third, the robot operates in close proximity to people, including its human supervisor, other pedestrians who may cross or block its path, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot and operate it manually. This is made possible by novel interaction mechanisms that facilitate safe, effective operation around people. We describe the architecture and implementation of the system, indicating how real-world operational requirements motivated the development of the key subsystems, and provide qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the robot operating in real settings.
