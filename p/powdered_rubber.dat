Using ultra-fine full-vulcanized <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> (UFPR) researchers have been able to improve all three, toughness, stiffness, and heat resistance simultaneously, resetting the stage for rubber toughening with particles smaller than previously thought to be effective.|$|E

This finding underlines how this field is constantly growing and more work can be done to better model the rubber toughening effect.|$|E

40|$|Rubber as a {{free-flowing}} powder, {{is essential}} in order to stream line the manufacturing processes of rubber goods. The previous works noted the importance of using <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> as a competitive raw material for continuous processing in rubber industry. However, {{in most of these}} works, the study was continued to the synthetic rubbers and only a few had been reported on the natural rubber. Sri Lanka which is an agricultural based country, has a bulk quantity of natural rubber field latex at a low price. Hence, it is worthwhile to produce a value-added product like <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> using field latex. Encapsulation is a common process in preparing powdered natural rubber. In this process, starch xanthate, SX, which acts as a diluent/reinforcing filler, behaves as an encapsulating agent for latex particles. The level of encapsulation as well as the properties of the resulting powder is highly dependent on the strength and the amount of the SX solution. The present work investigates these effects with varying strength of SX by changing the degrees of substitution, DS, of the SX solution and also the loading of the SX. The lower and the upper limits of DS of SX examined were 0. 07 and 0. 35 and the results suggested that the intermediate DS levels were more promising. The physical properties of the final vulcanizates were found to be satisfactory and were comparable with the rubbers available in the market. Study on drying techniques established the necessity of water washing step for natural rubber powders to remove non-rubber substances and the applicltion of an anti-cake agent to prevent agglomeration during drying. The effect of different anti-cake agents such as zinc stearate, talc powder and whiting was examined and zinc stearate was found to be the best out of the anti-cake agents used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Latex {{sensitisation}} is recognised as {{a health}} problem among health care workers (HCWs) using latex products. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify specific latex allergens in latex devices used in South African academic dental schools. The current study also compared the total protein content and the levels of specific allergens in these products. METHODS: Fourteen latex examination gloves (powdered and non-powdered) and five dental rubber dams, representing 6 brands, from five dental academic institutions were analysed for latex allergens and total protein. Total protein content was determined using the BioRad DC protein assay kit and natural rubber allergen levels using a capture enyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 5 and Hev b 6. 02. RESULTS: Hev b 6. 02 was found in higher concentrations than other natural rubber latex (NRL) allergens in the products analysed. Hev b 5 content ranged from 0 to 9. 2 microg/g and Hev b 6. 02 from 0. 09 to 61. 5 microg/g of sample. Hev b 1 levels were below the detection limit (DL) for 79 % of the samples (15 / 19). Dental dams showed higher allergen levels (median 80. 91 microg/g) than latex gloves (median 11. 34 microg/g). <b>Powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> samples also showed higher allergen levels (median 40. 54 microg/g) than non-powdered samples (median 5. 31 microg/g). A statistically significant correlation was observed between total protein and total allergen (r= 0. 74, p< 0. 001) concentrations. CONCLUSION: NRL allergen concentrations differ significantly by product and brand. This study has demonstrated that NRL allergens in latex-containing products used in South African dental institutions are present at sufficiently high levels to pose an allergic health ris...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{technological}} and economic {{aspects of the}} competition between natural rubber and the synthetics of the general purpose class. The {{first part of the}} thesis reviews the overall competitive position of natural rubber and its future prospects. The effects {{of the structure of the}} rubber producing industry (-natural and synthetic), economics of production, characteristics of demand and some aspects of marketing on the short and long term competitive position are analysed. It is concluded that natural rubber can remain competitive in all aspects if, greater co-operation between the natural rubber producers can be achieved to formulate a unified programme of production, research and development and marketing. In view of certain problems peculiar to Sri Lanka, the second part analyses the state of the rubber industry in Sri Lanka in respect of the changes taking place in other natural rubber producing countries, the developments in the synthetic rubber industry and the changing technological requirements of the rubber consuming industries. The commercial, economic and technical viability of certain projects in Sri Lanka and the areas for future research at the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka are briefly explored. Since Sri Lanka is the largest producer of premium grade pale crepe rubber and in view of the declining demand for this rubber, the competitive position of pale crepe is studied in some detail and some recommendations are included to improve its competitive position. In view of the anticipated strong demand for natural rubber in the future, it is recommended that Sri Lanka should plan now to increase rubber production at a faster rate by 1980 ’s. It is also concluded that it is desirable to produce more special purpose premium grades of natural rubber in Sri Lanka than to produce more complex derivatives in the short term and a long term approach towards producing <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber,</b> liquid and thermoplastic rubber from latex is necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{two major}} distresses {{associated}} with flexible pavement are rutting deformation and fatigue cracking in world highways. This is {{mainly because of}} the increasing load and higher tire pressure of vehicles which are applied to highway pavements today. At the same time, the asphalt containing neat binders does not always performed as expected. As a consequence, these distresses reduce the design life of the pavement and increase the maintenance costs tremendously. Therefore, in order to minimize the distresses and increase the durability of asphalt pavement, there is need to improve the performance properties of neat asphalt binders. Many researchers reported that using different types of polymer to modify the asphalt binder could be a solution to minimize the distresses occurred in asphalt pavement and improve the overall performance of the pavement. Disposal of waste tires is a serious environmental concern in many countries. Several attempts were made in the past to modify asphalt binder using tire <b>rubber</b> <b>powder</b> to improve the performance of neat asphalt binders. It is believed that the use of Tire <b>Rubber</b> <b>Powder</b> (TRP) as an additive in the modification of asphalt binder can improve the binder performance properties, increase the durability of the pavement, and reduces the waste disposal problem.

It was observed that addition of tire <b>rubber</b> <b>powder</b> to the asphalt binder enhances the properties of modified binder.

Fine <b>rubber</b> <b>powder</b> and large <b>rubber</b> chips have their specific characteristics towards sound adsorption.
