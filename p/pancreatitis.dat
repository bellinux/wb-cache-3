5|$|Chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> {{appears to}} almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset <b>pancreatitis</b> {{may be a}} symptom of a tumor. The risk of {{pancreatic}} cancer in individuals with familial <b>pancreatitis</b> is particularly high.|$|E
5|$|Research {{on early}} {{detection}} is ongoing. For instance, the European Registry of Hereditary <b>Pancreatitis</b> and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming {{to determine whether}} regular screening is appropriate for people with {{a family history of}} the disease, or who have hereditary <b>pancreatitis.</b> The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>pancreatitis,</b> Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of <b>pancreatitis</b> {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Two {{elderly people}} {{developed}} a transient <b>pancreatitis</b> after consuming L. volemus in central Anatolia in Turkey. Both had eaten the mushroom, which they knew as Tirmit, many times before. The condition resolved spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, <b>pancreatitis,</b> pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute <b>pancreatitis</b> (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Tankersley married Maxwell Peter Miller, Jr. in 1941. She and Miller {{lived in}} Tucson for two years, where she {{developed}} a deep love for Arizona. They {{then moved to}} Chicago for a time, and subsequently to her mother's Trinchera Ranch, which Bazy ran. Her mother died of <b>pancreatitis</b> on December 31, 1944, two months after a serious riding accident. The couple moved back to Illinois prior to relocating to Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She {{was never able to}} walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute <b>pancreatitis.</b> In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 2009, Down was {{announced}} on -and later removed from- the lineup for the 2009 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, a large annual outdoor music festival since 2002. On February 18, 2009, Down {{was announced}} in the lineup for the 2009 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Following these live dates, the band toured the USA and Canada during August and September 2009. On March 30, 2009, Down posted a statement on their message board indicating {{that they will be}} back in the studio from October through November writing and recording what will eventually become Down IV. In the summer of 2009, Down began a US tour without Rex on bass, who had developed acute <b>pancreatitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, <b>pancreatitis,</b> low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute <b>pancreatitis</b> and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of <b>pancreatitis.</b> Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of <b>pancreatitis,</b> though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute <b>pancreatitis,</b> cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, <b>pancreatitis,</b> acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, <b>pancreatitis,</b> and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, <b>pancreatitis,</b> epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Crozier started {{all of his}} team's games, the last goalie {{to do so in}} the NHL. He also led the league in both wins and shutouts with 40 and 6 respectively. His 2.42 GAA was the second lowest in the league. At the end of the season, Crozier was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie and he was also named to the NHL First All-Star Team. During his sophomore season, Crozier missed the team's first couple of games due to <b>pancreatitis.</b> He would return and play the team's {{remaining}} 64 games, posting 27 wins and leading the league with seven shutouts. The Red Wings were also able to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Benefiting from Crozier's strong play in the playoffs, the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. After eliminating the Black Hawks in the semi-finals, the Red Wings squared off against the Montreal Canadiens in the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals. The Red Wings won the first two games, but the Canadiens came back and won the next two. During the game four loss, Crozier suffered a leg injury. Although Crozier returned for game five, the injury limited his mobility. In the end, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in game six. Even though the Red Wings lost the Stanley Cup, Crozier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs. He became the first goaltender to win the award and also the first player to win it in a losing effort.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>pancreatitis</b> can {{be further}} divided into mild and severe <b>pancreatitis.</b> Mostly the Ranson Criteria are used to {{determine}} severity of acute <b>pancreatitis.</b> In severe <b>pancreatitis</b> serious amounts of necrosis determine the further clinical outcome. About 20% of the acute <b>pancreatitis</b> are severe with a mortality of about 20%. This is an important classification as severe <b>pancreatitis</b> will need intensive care therapy whereas mild <b>pancreatitis</b> can be treated on the common ward.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>pancreatitis</b> is {{diagnosed}} clinically but requires CT evaluation to differentiate mild acute <b>pancreatitis</b> from severe necrotic <b>pancreatitis.</b> Experienced clinicians {{were able to}} detect severe <b>pancreatitis</b> in approximately 34-39% of patients who later had imaging confirmed severe necrotic <b>pancreatitis.</b> Blood studies are used to identify organ failure, offer prognostic information, determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate, and if antibiotics are indicated.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{abuse is}} {{a leading cause of}} both acute <b>pancreatitis</b> and chronic <b>pancreatitis.</b> Alcoholic <b>pancreatitis</b> can result in severe {{abdominal}} pain and may progress to pancreatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|Globally, in 2015 about 8.9 {{million cases}} of <b>pancreatitis</b> occurred. This {{resulted}} in 132,700 deaths, up from 83,000 deaths in 1990. Acute <b>pancreatitis</b> occurs in about 30 per 100,000 {{people a year}}. New cases of chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> develop in about 8 per 100,000 people a year and currently affect about 50 per 100,000 people in the United States. It {{is more common in}} men than women. Often chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> starts between the ages of 30 and 40 while it is rare in children. Acute <b>pancreatitis</b> was first described on autopsy in 1882 while chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> was first described in 1946.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancreatitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes {{and a number of}} hormones. There are two main types, acute <b>pancreatitis</b> and chronic <b>pancreatitis.</b> Signs and symptoms of <b>pancreatitis</b> include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute <b>pancreatitis</b> a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} cases of <b>pancreatitis</b> are caused by alcohol or gallstones. Gallstones are the single {{most common cause of}} acute <b>pancreatitis.</b> Alcohol is the single most common cause of chronic <b>pancreatitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the {{pancreas}} {{is known as}} <b>pancreatitis.</b> <b>Pancreatitis</b> is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic alcohol use, although {{a variety of other}} causes, including measles, mumps, some medications, the congenital condition alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and even some scorpion stings, may cause <b>pancreatitis.</b> <b>Pancreatitis</b> is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen, that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with jaundice. In addition, due to causing problems with fat digestion and bilirubin excretion, <b>pancreatitis</b> often presents with pale stools and dark urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} causes of acute <b>pancreatitis</b> are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors among others. Chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> may develop {{as a result}} of acute <b>pancreatitis.</b> It is most {{commonly}} due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic <b>pancreatitis.</b> Diagnosis of acute <b>pancreatitis</b> is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.|$|E
25|$|Globally the {{incidence}} of acute <b>pancreatitis</b> is 5 to 35 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence of chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> is 4–8 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 26–42 cases per 100,000. In 2013 <b>pancreatitis</b> resulted in 123,000 deaths up from 83,000 deaths in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In <b>pancreatitis,</b> enzymes of the exocrine {{pancreas}} {{damage the}} structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection {{of some of these}} enzymes, such as amylase and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on X-ray, are often used to indicate that a person has <b>pancreatitis.</b> A person with <b>pancreatitis</b> is also at risk of shock. <b>Pancreatitis</b> is often managed medically with analgesics, removal of gallstones or treatment of other causes, and monitoring to ensure a patient does not develop shock.|$|E
25|$|It happens rarely, {{but it is}} {{possible}} for a <b>pancreatitis</b> attack to activate the endocrine portion of the organ back into being capable of producing insulin once again in dogs. It {{is possible}} for acute <b>pancreatitis</b> to cause a temporary, or transient diabetes, most likely due to damage to the endocrine portion's beta cells. Insulin resistance that can follow a <b>pancreatitis</b> attack may last for some time thereafter. <b>Pancreatitis</b> can damage the endocrine pancreas {{to the point where the}} diabetes is permanent.|$|E
25|$|In {{adults in}} the United Kingdom, the {{estimated}} average total direct and indirect costs of chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> is roughly £79,000 per person on an annual basis. Acute recurrent <b>pancreatitis</b> and chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> occur infrequently in children, but are associated with high healthcare costs due to substantial disease burden. Globally, the estimated average total cost of treatment for children with these conditions is approximately $40,500nbsp&annually.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>pancreatitis</b> is supportive and depends on severity. Morphine generally {{is suitable for}} pain control. There are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause <b>pancreatitis</b> or cholecystitis.|$|E
25|$|Cholangitis. CD {{also found}} at higher than {{expected}} frequencies in autoimmune cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. CD is frequently linked to <b>pancreatitis</b> {{but also to}} papillary stenosis and, in India, tropical calcific <b>pancreatitis</b> appears also {{to be associated with}} CD.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} {{are commonly}} associated with <b>pancreatitis,</b> most commonly corticosteroids such as prednisolone, but also including the HIV medications didanosine and pentamidine, diuretics, the anticonvulsant valproic acid, the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase and azathioprine, estrogen by way of increased blood triglycerides, and antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin. It may be noted here that the drugs used to treat conditions that are themselves associated with increased events of <b>pancreatitis</b> may also be incidentally linked to <b>pancreatitis.</b> Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetes. According to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Surveillance System and Published Reports Atypical, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause <b>pancreatitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{conditions}} of the exocrine pancreas is acute <b>pancreatitis,</b> which in the majority of cases relates to gallstones that have impacted in the pancreatic part of the biliary tree, or due to acute or chronic alcohol abuse or as a side-effect of ERCP. Other forms of <b>pancreatitis</b> include chronic and hereditary forms. Chronic <b>pancreatitis</b> may predispose to pancreatic cancer and is strongly linked to alcohol use. Other rarer diseases affecting the pancreas may include pancreatic pseudocysts, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and pancreatic fistulas.|$|E
