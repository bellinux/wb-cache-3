For, great {{as we have seen}} the Byzantine mind show itself to be in other directions, it was marked as that of a declining nation by the absence of the grotesque element; and, owing to its influence, the early Venetian Gothic remained inferior to all other schools in this particular character. Nothing can well be more wonderful than its instant failure in any attempt at the representation of ludicrous or fearful images, more especially when it is compared with the magnificent grotesque of the neighboring city of Verona, in which the Lombard influence had full sway. Nor was it until the last links of connexion with Constantinople had been dissolved, that the strength of the Venetian mind could manifest itself in this direction. But it had then a new enemy to encounter. The Renaissance laws altogether checked its imagination in architecture; and it could only obtain permission to express itself by starting forth {{in the work of the}} Venetian <b>painters,</b> <b>filling</b> them with monkeys and dwarfs, even amidst the most serious subjects, and leading Veronese and Tintoret to the most unexpected and wild fantasies of form and color.|$|E

50|$|This work of Velasquez had {{significant}} input {{from members of}} his workshop. The technical studies conducted in the Prado Museum {{under the direction of}} Carmen Garrido indicated that the five equestrian portraits were painted {{at the same time and}} with the same preparation. The idea that Velasquez retouched a painting by an earlier painter to add detail to the queen's clothing and the trappings of the horse has received support from a number of critics; X-rays reveal a painting under the visible one, in which the horse's girth is visible and the queen's clothing is simpler than the existing one. Later, when Velasquez was finishing details in the queen's head and the horse's legs, a more patient <b>painter</b> <b>filled</b> in the meticulous details of the embroidery, thus obscuring details of the painting previously laid down.|$|R
50|$|After {{his return}} to Denmark he was one among several {{portrait}} <b>painters</b> who <b>filled</b> the void {{after the death of}} Cornelius Høyer and Jens Juel. He made miniatures and particularly pastels which was the technique in which he did his best works. In the 1820s he also turned to lithography.|$|R
5000|$|Garland {{paintings}} were usually collaborations between {{a still life}} painter who painted the garland and a figure <b>painter</b> who <b>filled</b> the central cartouche with an image. The cartouche {{in the center of}} Caproens's garland paintings is filled with religious as well as mythological imagery. A pair of garland paintings entitled [...] and [...] (Town hall of Braunlage) have respectively a religious and secular cartouche.|$|R
50|$|One {{story was}} that Rockingham had {{intended}} to commission an equestrian portrait of George III; Stubbs would paint the horse while two other notable portrait and landscape <b>painters</b> would <b>fill</b> in the king and the landscape respectively. In one account, The painting was supposedly intended to accompany a similarly-sized equestrian portrait of George II by David Morier, but Rockingham then changed his mind. According to Horace Walpole, {{on a visit to}} Wentworth where he was probably shown round by the housekeeper, the painting was intended as a gift for the King, but Rockingham supposedly had not bothered to support progress of the painting after falling out of favour, and ordered it hung at Wentworth Woodhouse uncompleted instead.|$|R

I never was more [...] puzzled by any picture, the painting being throughout careless, and in [...] some places utterly bad, and yet not like modern work; the principal [...] figure, however, of Eve, has either been redone, or is scholar's work [...] altogether, as, I suspect, {{most of the rest of}} the picture. It looks [...] as if Tintoret had sketched it when he was ill, left it to a bad [...] scholar to work on with, and then finished it in a hurry; but he has [...] assuredly had something to do with it; it is not likely that anybody [...] else would have refused all aid from the usual spectral company with [...] which common <b>painters</b> <b>fill</b> the scene. Bronzino, for instance, covers [...] his canvas with every form of monster that his sluggish imagination [...] could coin. Tintoret admits only a somewhat haggard Adam, a graceful [...] Eve, two or three Venetians in court dress, seen amongst the smoke, [...] and a Satan represented as a handsome youth, recognizable only by the [...] claws on his feet. The picture is dark and spoiled, but I am pretty [...] sure there are no demons or spectres in it. This is quite in [...] accordance with the master's caprice, but it considerably diminishes [...] the interest of a work in other ways unsatisfactory. There may once [...] have been something impressive in the shooting in of the rays at the [...] top of the cavern, as well as in the strange grass that grows in the [...] bottom, whose infernal character is indicated by its all being knotted [...] together; but so little of these parts can be seen, that it is not [...] worth spending time on a work certainly unworthy of the master, and in [...] great part probably never seen by him.|$|R

40|$|Between November 1775 and June 1777, Joseph Wright of Derby (1734 - 1797) {{spent two}} social `seasons' in the resort town of Bath. Shortly after {{returning}} from two years in Rome, Wright left Derby with his new wife and child in hopes of becoming the premier portrait <b>painter</b> in Bath, <b>filling</b> the void left by Thomas Gainsborough's departure the previous year. Rather than achieving success, Wright found himself ill-equipped for the complex social interactions of his new city and severely wanting for commissions. In light of Wright's professional failure in Bath, particularly contrasted with the artist's highly successful 1768 - 1771 Liverpool period, the Bath period has become a forgotten episode in critical literature on Wright. This thesis examines Wright's life during those two years, collecting {{for the first time}} all of his published Bath works and correspondence and exploring the dramatic effects of the experience on his career...|$|R
60|$|In Venice, {{the noble}} still lives {{sometimes}} in his ancestral palace, dimly occupying the halls where his forefathers flourished {{in so much}} splendor. I can conceive, indeed, of no state of things more flattering to human pride than that which surrounded the patrician of the old aristocratic Republic. The house in which he dwelt was the palace of a king, in luxury of appointment and magnificence of size. Troops of servants that ministered to his state peopled its vast extent; and the gondolas that carried his grandeur abroad were moored in little fleets to the piles that rose before his palace, painted with the family arms and colors. The palace itself stood usually on the Grand Canal, and rose sheer from the water, giving the noble that haughty inaccessibility which {{the lord of the}} main-land achieved only by building lofty walls and multiplying gates. The architecture was as costly in its ornament as wild Gothic fancy, or Renaissance luxury of bad taste, could make it; and when the palace front was not of sculptured marble, the <b>painter's</b> pencil <b>filled</b> it with the delight of color. The main-land noble's house was half a fortress, and formed his stronghold in times of popular tumult or family fray; but at Venice the strong arm of St. Mark suppressed all turbulence in a city secure from foreign war; and the peaceful arts rejoiced in undisturbed possession of the palaces, which rose in the most delicate and fantastic beauty, and mirrored in the brine a dream of sea-deep strangeness and richness. You see much of the beauty yet, but the pride and opulence which called it into being are gone forever.|$|R
60|$|July 28th.--Day before {{yesterday}} I paid a second {{visit to the}} Exhibition, and devoted the day mainly to seeing the works of British <b>painters,</b> which <b>fill</b> a very large space,--two or three great saloons at {{the right side of}} the nave. Among the earliest are Hogarth's pictures, including the Sigismunda, which I remember to have seen before, with her lover's heart in her hand, looking like a monstrous strawberry; and the March to Finchley, than which nothing truer to English life and character was ever painted, nor ever can be; and a large stately portrait of Captain Coram, and others, all excellent in proportion as they come near to ordinary life, and are wrought out through its forms. All English painters resemble Hogarth in this respect. They cannot paint anything high, heroic, and ideal, and their attempts in that direction are wearisome to look at; but they sometimes produce good effects by means of awkward figures in ill-made coats and small-clothes, and hard, coarse-complexioned faces, such as they might see anywhere in the street. They are strong in homeliness and ugliness, weak in their efforts at the beautiful. Sir Thomas Lawrence attains a sort of grace, which you feel to be a trick, and therefore get disgusted with it. Reynolds is not quite genuine, though certainly he has produced some noble and beautiful heads. But Hogarth is the only English painter, except in the landscape department; there are no others who interpret life to me at all, unless it be some of the modern Pre-Raphaelites. Pretty village scenes of common life,--pleasant domestic passages, with a touch of easy humor in them,--little pathoses and fancynesses, are abundant enough; and Wilkie, to be sure, has done more than this, though not a great deal more. His merit lies, not in a high aim, but in accomplishing his aim so perfectly. It is unaccountable that the English painters' achievements should be so much inferior to those of the English poets, who have really elevated the human mind; but, to be sure, painting has only become an English art subsequently to the epochs of the greatest poets, and since the beginning of the last century, during which England had no poets. I respect Haydon more than I once did, not for his pictures, they being detestable to see, but for his heroic rejection of whatever his countrymen and he himself could really do, and his bitter resolve to achieve something higher,-- failing in which, he died.|$|R
60|$|I {{have heard}} of a celebrated picture of the Last Supper,--and if I do not mistake, {{it is said to}} be the work of some of the Flemish masters: in this picture all the personages are drawn in a manner {{suitable}} to the solemnity of the occasion; but the <b>painter</b> has <b>filled</b> the void under the table with a dog gnawing bones. Who does not see the possibility of such an incident, and, at the same time, the absurdity of introducing it on such an occasion! Innumerable such cases might be stated. It is not the incompatibility or agreeableness of incidents, characters, or sentiments with the probable in fact, but with propriety in design, that admits or excludes them from a place in any composition. We may as well urge that stones, sand, clay, and metals lie in a certain manner in the earth, as a reason for building with these materials and in that manner, as for writing according to the accidental disposition of characters in Nature. I have, I am afraid, been longer than it might seem necessary in refuting such a notion; but such authority can only be opposed by a good deal of reason. We are not to forget that a play is, or ought to be, a very short composition; that, if one passion or disposition is to be wrought up with tolerable success, I believe it is as much as can in any reason be expected. If there be scenes of distress and scenes of humor, they must either be in a double or single plot. If there be a double plot, there are in fact two. If they be in checkered scenes of serious and comic, you are obliged continually to break both the thread of the story and the continuity of the passion,--if in the same scene, as Mrs. V. seems to recommend, it is needless to observe how absurd the mixture must be, and how little adapted to answer the genuine end of any passion. It is odd to observe the progress of bad taste: for this mixed passion being universally proscribed in the regions of tragedy, it has taken refuge and shelter in comedy, where it seems firmly established, though no reason can be assigned why we may not laugh in the one as well as weep in the other. The true reason of this mixture is to be sought for in the manners which are prevalent amongst a people. It has become very fashionable to affect delicacy, tenderness of heart, and fine feeling, and to shun all imputation of rusticity. Much mirth is very foreign to this character; they have introduced, therefore, a sort of neutral writing.|$|R
