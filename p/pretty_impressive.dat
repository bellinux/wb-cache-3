500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Next Generation saw significant {{promise in}} Red Alarm, {{and believed that}} its elements should add up to [...] "a fantastic game"; but the writer panned the final product as a wasted opportunity. Similarly, Danny Wallace of Total! wrote, [...] "On the one hand, it's a <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> 3D spacey shoot-em-up, with a real grip on the Virtual world and all those fancy techniques, {{and on the other}} it's an often visually confusing, headache-inducing attempt at being something it's quite obviously not." [...] However, Dave Halverson of DieHard GameFan called Red Alarm [...] "a great shooter" [...] with excellent graphics. Co-reviewer Nicholas Barres hailed it as a [...] "masterpiece", and he considered it to be [...] "the one and only reason to buy a Virtual Boy".|$|E

5000|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} on the Sega Meganet service is mixed, praising the early initiative to develop online gaming for video consoles, but criticizing its implementation via use of telephone lines and issues with Sega's lack of developers for the service. Adam Redsell of IGN commented on the basic features of the service, and despite noting that Meganet received only a few games, stated [...] "That's <b>pretty</b> damn <b>impressive</b> for 1990". He also notes the influence of Sega {{in the development of}} online gaming, with the Meganet service as their first attempt, and credits the Meganet's successor, Sega Channel, with helping to spread broadband Internet.|$|R

His Philadelphia Orchestra was the only real rival to Karajan's Berlin for sonic beauty in the 50s-70s, but was also a tighter and more versatile band.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Erik Wolpaw {{scored the}} PC version 7.7 out of 10, and {{although}} he was very critical of the trust/fear system and the controls, he concluded [...] "The Thing is kind of short, it's not especially effective at making you feel afraid, its most intriguing gameplay elements are somewhat extraneous, and it suffers from a wonky control scheme. Yet, thanks to some high production values and consistently interesting action scenes, The Thing rises above these flaws. It could have been great, but {{in light of the}} checkered history of movie-licensed games, being good at all is a <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> achievement." [...] Ryan MacDonald scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.4 out of 10, writing [...] "when you look at everything the game offers in terms of its gameplay, presentation, and story, it's hard not to appreciate The Thing whether you're a fan of the film it's based on or just a fan of the survival horror genre in general." [...] He also scored the Xbox version 8.4 out of 10, calling it [...] "the best of the three, combining sharp graphics similar to those found in the PC version with the superior console-style control found in the PlayStation 2 version." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl's first episode, {{broadcast}} on 20 June at 7.30pm on BBC One, received overnight ratings of 6.64million, an audience share of 33.7%, while the BBC Three repeat, shown at 1am on 21 June, was watched by 210,000 people, 8.3% {{of the total}} viewing audience at that time. Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail reviewed Carl's first two episodes, and called him [...] "a fairly undistinguished presence {{in jeans and a}} grey hoodie." [...] Shelley sarcastically wrote that [...] "He was also (you'll never guess) a menacing villain. EastEnders hasn't had a new one of those for, ooh, weeks." [...] On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash, Shelley wrote, [...] "Perhaps surprisingly, Carl was also such expert psychologist he should have been a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is, or working in Harley Street. Within 24 hours, this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean's Sausage Surprise he can eat. [...] It was <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> for two episodes. [...] It turned out Carl was Bad News. What other kind is there in EastEnders? [...] Carl worked his magic on Ian, assessing his character and weakness, and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of The Mentalist." [...] He went on to comment on Kirsty's line, [...] "He's someone you don't want in your life", saying, [...] "Or in your TV show." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frustrated {{with the}} amount and quality of new Australian theatre being {{produced}} at the time, Stockton and Reid formed theatre in decay as a direct response to {{what they saw as}} an industry wide malaise.

The screenshot shows Alan Wake in a different attire, with a flannel shirt and jeans, next to a road sign that says the town of Night Springs is 15 miles away. Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full release complete with a <b>pretty</b> damn <b>impressive</b> storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. Remedy claimed that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} a French duel {{the pair}} hug and kiss and cry, and [...] praise each other's valor; then the {{surgeons}} make an examination [...] and pick out the scratched one, and the other one helps him on to [...] the litter and pays his fare; and in return the scratched one [...] treats to champagne and oysters in the evening, and then [...] "the [...] incident is closed," [...] as the French say. It is all polite, and [...] gracious, and <b>pretty,</b> and <b>impressive.</b> At {{the end of a}}n Austrian [...] duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the [...] other man, utters some phrases of courteous regret, then bids him [...] good-by and goes his way, and that incident also is closed. The [...] French duellist is painstakingly protected from danger, by the [...] rules of the game. His antagonist's weapon cannot reach so far as [...] his body; if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow. But [...] in Austria {{the rules of the game}} do not provide against danger, [...] they carefully provide for it, usually. Commonly the combat must [...] be kept up until one of the men is disabled; a non-disabling slash [...] or stab does not retire him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured {{to the top of a}} deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven. For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive.</b> I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant." [...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him ...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ally Ross from The Sun {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting several {{continuity}} errors {{when the show}} went live, including Lola's hair being dyed, Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) being washed and longer, Shirley Carter's (Linda Henry) hair being undyed and restyled, and Lola having a spray tan. He commented: [...] "EastEnders goes live and the makeover miracle of Albert Square is born." [...] He said that character Alfie Moon [...] "made the unfortunate transition into his very own Mr Hyde, Shane Richie" [...] {{and said that the}} cast were shouting every line so they could be heard over the extras. However, he concluded that he enjoyed the episode more than any other, due to the Olympic occasion, the [...] "used, abused and underrated" [...] Billy being in the limelight, and [...] "the fact that, for seven precious minutes, the arm-folding, door-slamming, crockery-smashing life-suckers actually had a smile on their miserable faces." [...] Talking about Billy being stuck on the train, the Elstree & Borehamwood Times wrote: [...] "Viewers sat biting their nails on tenterhooks, waiting to see if he would make it back to Walford in time." [...] Karen Edwards from Heat called the episode [...] "quite the special night" [...] and said that it was [...] "Not an easy task" [...] for Fenwick. She called his wink [...] "cheeky" [...] and [...] "brilliant", saying it [...] "just showed how real the whole thing was". She added that it was [...] "emotional" [...] to watch, and said that Harold [...] "did the best fake birth screaming we've seen in a long while. [...] <b>Pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> work, we're sure you'll agree." [...] Matt Brito from Comedy Central UK said the fact that nothing went wrong in the live broadcast was [...] "boring". Laura Morgan from All About Soap said the live segment was [...] "seamless", saying it deserved a gold medal for [...] "the best thing on TV last night". She said she loved Fenwick's wink to the camera and praised Harold, saying the birth finished off the live segment [...] "perfectly", adding: [...] "Hats off to relative newbie Danielle Harold (aka Lola) for making the birth scenes look so realistic on live TV... That's no mean feat!" [...] She also said it was [...] "the perfect way to kick off the 2012 Olympic Games". After the episode, five of the ten top trending topics on social networking site Twitter related to the live event.|$|E

60|$|There are few men among modern {{landscape}} painters, who cannot paint quiet {{water at}} least suggestively, if not faithfully. Those who {{are incapable of}} doing this, would scarcely be considered artists at all; and anything like the ripples of Canaletto, or the black shadows of Vandevelde, would be looked upon as most unpromising, even {{in the work of}} a novice. Among those who most fully appreciate and render the qualities of space and surface in calm water, perhaps Copley Fielding stands first. His expanses of windless lake are among the most perfect passages of his works; for he can give surface as well as depth, and make his lake look not only clear, but, which is far more difficult, lustrous. He is less dependent than most of our artists upon reflections; and can give substance, transparency, and extent, where another painter would be reduced to paper; and he is exquisitely refined in his expression of distant breadth, by the delicate line of ripple interrupting the reflection, and by aerial qualities of color. Nothing, indeed, can be purer or more refined than his general feeling of lake sentiment, were it not for a want of simplicity--a fondness for <b>pretty,</b> rather than <b>impressive</b> color, and a consequent want of some of the higher expression of repose.|$|R

5000|$|Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote [...] "If Merle Haggard didn't {{come up with}} a {{masterpiece}} for his 30th album, you could argue he didn't have to—he made consistently stronger albums than most of his contemporaries in country music, and he was still doing that 30 LPs and nine years into his recording career, and that in itself is a <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive</b> accomplishment." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote [...] "The man has been making them for less than a decade, and thirty is too damn many. But this is clearly where Haggard wants to show off his range, and the display, featuring more original songs than he's put in one place for a long time, is <b>pretty</b> <b>impressive.</b> There's a rip-roaring infidelity lyric that's definitely one of his genius pieces—"Old Man From the Mountain," [...] it's called, complete with bluegrass shading. And though after that only [...] "Honky Tonk Nighttime Man" [...] and the Bob Wills/Lefty Frizzell cover are liable to be remembered, just about everything else is liable to be enjoyed."
