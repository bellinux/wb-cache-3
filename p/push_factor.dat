5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
2500|$|Political Model: There are {{two main}} {{components}} to the Political Model. In the first case, there is the external [...] "Pull" [...] factor. The Pull factor suggests that the weak political bodies of Britain and Western Europe made for an attractive target for Viking raiders. The reasons for these weaknesses vary, but generally can be simplified into decentralized polities, or religious sites. As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. In the second case, there is the internal [...] "Push" [...] factor. The <b>Push</b> <b>factor</b> coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization {{of power in the}} modern day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship among <b>push</b> <b>factors,</b> information search and holiday satisfaction in the purchasing process of domestic tourists. At first, a literature review was conducted with regards to the research. Then a questionnaire was developed from the studies reviewed in the literature. Data were collected by researchers in face-to-face interviews with 375 tourists in Muğla region and then these were analyzed through SPSS and LISREL statistical programs. Structural and convergent validity of the data were presented for consideration via the explanatory factor analysis. Afterwards, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses leading to determination of the relationship among <b>push</b> <b>factors,</b> information search and holiday satisfaction. A positive relationship was found between <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> and information search. Similarly, a positive and meaningful relationship was found between <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> and holiday satisfaction, and between information search and holiday satisfaction, as well. Consequently, all hypotheses were accepted. Mugla; Domestic tourists; Push factors; Information search; Holiday satisfaction...|$|R

This means that they are pushed towards the search and exploitation of an entrepreneurial opportunity: the decision to become entrepreneurs is due to the frustration they perceive in reference to their occupational status.

The result confirms the hypothesis that <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> correlate well with total out flows of provinces and pull factors with total inflows of provinces. In addition, it is found that pull and <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> are explained rather well by population size and income, but not so by urbanization and poverty...|$|R

50|$|The {{largest and}} most {{noticeable}} influx of Korean immigrants to Argentina began in the 1980s. The total number of migrants between 1965 and 1985 only amounted to roughly 6,000, but began to increase sharply after that. By that time, South Korea was a modern and industrialised country, but the sharp recession provided a significant <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> for overseas migration; {{the signing of the}} Acto de Procedimiento between the Argentine and South Korean governments that year established and outlet for that migration. Obtaining residency was not cheap; businesspeople who sought to establish themselves and obtain a residency permit had to invest US$100,000. The population peaked at an estimated 50,000 individuals in 1996.|$|E
50|$|As {{transportation}} technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic {{used to take}} up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but {{around the time of}} the 20th century it took a mere 8 days. When the opportunity cost is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher. Escape from poverty (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional <b>push</b> <b>factor,</b> and the availability of jobs is the related pull factor. Natural disasters can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Research shows that for middle-income countries, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to urban areas and to other countries. For low-income countries, higher temperatures reduce emigration.|$|E
30|$|Other factors, mainly {{concerning}} socio-demographic {{aspects of}} ethnic entrepreneurs, cannot lead to directly identifying opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs.

50|$|The push behind Japan's exports {{came from}} manufacturers. Many {{recognized}} that to reach efficient levels of production {{they needed to}} adopt a global approach. Manufacturers concentrated on the domestic market (often protected from foreign products) until they reached internationally competitive levels and domestic markets were saturated. Often helped by the large general trading companies, manufacturers aggressively attacked foreign markets when they felt able to compete globally. This <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> partially accounted for the extraordinarily high level of export growth in the 1970s, when the domestic economy slowed; increasing exports was a way for manufacturers to continue expanding despite the more sluggish domestic market. Japanese manufacturers were part of larger conglomerates, the zaibatsu, which provided financing of activities. Thus, they could concentrate on gaining high market shares, without the need to achieve high profits in the process.|$|E

Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (<b>push</b> <b>factors)</b> and evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (pull factors). The results of a factor analysis revealed three <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> and three pull factors. Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among <b>push</b> and pull <b>factors.</b> This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how <b>push</b> and pull <b>factors</b> affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

50|$|The famines of the 1690s {{were seen}} as {{particularly}} severe, partly because famine had become relatively rare {{in the second half}} of the seventeenth century, with only one year of dearth (in 1674) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind. The famines resulted in some migration between estates and parishes in Scotland. There was some emigration to England, although this was probably a relatively small number because of the draconian English Poor Laws, which prevented distribution of relief to strangers. Emigration to continental Europe was limited by the similar conditions of famine in much of northern Europe. Famine may have been a <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> in the emigration to the American colonies and the West Indies by volunteers as indentured servants, which became the most significant form of transatlantic emigration from Scotland in this period. Between 1650 and 1700 approximately 7,000 Scots migrated to America, 10-20,000 to Europe and England and 60-100,000 to Ireland. Emigration to Ireland, particularly to Ulster, was a continuation of the Ulster Plantation, with cheap confiscated land in the north after James VII's invasions in the early 1690s. It has been estimated that 20,000 Scots emigrated to Ulster between the famine years 1696 and 1698.|$|E
50|$|Volunteers {{originally}} {{only came}} from four nations (excluding Jamaica), however as the regiment grew thousands of Jamaican men were recruited and ultimately made up around {{two thirds of}} the 15,600 strong regiment. The British West Indies Regiment fought for Britain in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as well as the East African Campaign. Many of these men became the first permanent Jamaican settlers in the UK after World War I, some of whom also subsequently fought for the country in World War II. Despite this, by far the largest wave of Jamaican migration to the UK including people of all genders and ages occurred {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. A major hurricane in August 1944 ravaged eastern Jamaica leading to numerous fatalities and major economic loss after crops were destroyed by flooding. This acted as a <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> in the migration of Jamaicans and at the time by far the largest pull factor was the promise of jobs in the UK. Post-war Britain was suffering from significant labour shortage and looked to its overseas colonies for help, British Rail, the NHS and London transport were noted as being the largest recruiters. On 23 June 1948, the MV Empire Windrush arrived in the UK with,amongst other migrants from the Caribbean, 492 Jamaicans onboard who had been invited to the country to work. Many more followed as the steady flow of Jamaicans to the UK was maintained due to the continuing labour shortage. Between 1955 and 1968, 191,330 Jamaicans settled in the UK. These first generation migrants created the foundation of a community which is now well into its third if not fourth generation.|$|E
50|$|The first {{significant}} and large wave of migration from Latin America to the United Kingdom {{occurred in the}} 1970s; the Immigration Act 1971 was just one factor that acted {{as a catalyst for}} this phenomenon. Prior to 1971, there were strict rules in place that only allowed residents of current or former British overseas territories and colonies to be granted work permits etc. in the mainland UK. This change in legislation made it much easier for Latin Americans and other such groups to gain a right to live and work in the UK. From this point onwards, the Latin American community in the UK began to grow with the arrival of migrant workers and refugees escaping oppressive political regimes. Some 2,500 exiles from Chile were the first large group of Latin American migrants to the UK when they settled in London in the early 1970s; they consisted of businessmen, professors, and students who had fled their home country due to the ongoing political instability. Exiles included right wingers fleeing the rule of Salvador Allende and later leftists fleeing the Pinochet regime. Chile wasn't the only source of Latin American refugees in the 1970s and late 20th century in general, many individuals from the likes of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador also requested the right for asylum in the UK. Argentina's military government (National Reorganization Process) which remained in power between 1976 and 1983 was another major <b>push</b> <b>factor</b> which contributed to large-scale Latin American refugee migration to the UK. Colombians are the largest Hispanic Latin American group in the UK and they have been arriving in the thousands since the 1970s; most moved between 1986 and 1997 after they were forced from their homes due to guerrilla and paramilitary violence in Colombia. Through most of the 20th century, Britain was in fact the most favoured European destination for Colombian migrants and refugees, even ahead of Spain. Bolivians are a fairly small Latin American refugee group in the UK; during Bolivia's spell of political instability in the late 20th century many instead chose to make a new life for themselves in the United States or other South American nations. Despite this, the UK still to this day remains the second most popular destination for Bolivian migrants to Europe regardless of status. Cubans, although relatively small in number, have been migrating to the UK since the early 1960s, fleeing the Communist takeover of Cuba. Most migration happened during the Freedom Flights which started in 1965 when some Cubans chose the UK {{as an alternative to the}} United States.|$|E
30|$|In sum, none of {{the factors}} that are {{included}} in the group of pull and <b>push</b> <b>factors</b> affect the choice to start an ethnic venture in the enclave. Two of the socio-demographic factors - living outside the enclave and being younger than 40 - do that. In line with the rationales presented above, these results show that Ukrainian entrepreneurs perceive the context around them as negative. The choice to live outside the enclave and the fact of being younger than 40  years old are seen as unfavourable motivations and are thus ascribed to <b>push</b> <b>factors.</b> Accordingly, it seems reasonable to assume that the Ukrainians in Caserta are necessity entrepreneurs.|$|R
