A National Labor Relations Board judge decided against the company and ordered it to recognize the vote. Workers alleged that Agriprocessors paid low wages, failed to pay overtime and immediately terminated employment of workers who complained about conditions or wages.|$|E

500|$|In Chandler v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1962), Lord Devlin stated: [...] "It is {{the duty}} of the courts to be as alert now as they have always been to prevent any abuse of the prerogative." [...] Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, applied a similar {{reasoning}} in Laker Airways Ltd. v. Department of Trade (1976) and held that prerogative powers were as reviewable as any other power and could not be used by the Government to protect themselves when they were removing the <b>protection</b> <b>granted</b> to parties under a statute.

2500|$|Protection {{papers were}} used by American sailors to prevent {{themselves}} from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, {{and it was so}} easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. [...] "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a <b>protection</b> <b>granted</b> him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'" [...] One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. [...] "Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{looking over}} any state {{to form a}} {{judgment}} on it, it presents itself in two lights; the external, and the internal. The first, that relation which it bears in point of friendship or enmity to other states. The second, that relation which its component parts, the governing and the governed, bear to each other. The {{first part of the}} external view of all states, their relation as friends, makes so trifling a figure in history, that I am very sorry to say, it affords me but little matter on which to expatiate. The good offices done by one nation to its neighbor;[8] the support given in public distress; the relief afforded in general calamity; the <b>protection</b> <b>granted</b> in emergent danger; the mutual return of kindness and civility, would afford a very ample and very pleasing subject for history. But, alas! all the history of all times, concerning all nations, does not afford matter enough to fill ten pages, though it should be spun out by the wire-drawing amplification of a Guicciardini himself. The glaring side is that of enmity. War is the matter which fills all history, and consequently the only or almost the only view in which we can see the external of political society is in a hostile shape; and the only actions to which we have always seen, and still see all of them intent, are such as tend to the destruction of one another. [...] "War," [...] says Machiavel, [...] "ought to be the only study of a prince"; and by a prince, he means every sort of state, however constituted. [...] "He ought," [...] says this great political doctor, [...] "to consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes ability to execute military plans." [...] A meditation on the conduct of political societies made old Hobbes imagine, that war was the state of nature; and truly, if a man judged of the individuals of our race by their conduct when united and packed into nations and kingdoms, he might imagine that every sort of virtue was unnatural and foreign to the mind of man.|$|E

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.

Constitutional <b>protections</b> <b>granted</b> to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of <b>protections</b> <b>granted</b> under civil partnerships.

Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist.

5000|$|B'Tselem further {{noted that}} Palestinian spokespersons {{distinguish}} between attacks inside Israel proper and attacks directed at {{settlers in the}} Occupied Territories, stating that since the settlements are illegal and many settlers belong to Israel's security forces, settlers are not entitled to the international law <b>protections</b> <b>granted</b> to civilians.

The settlers constitute a distinctly civilian population, which is entitled to all the <b>protections</b> <b>granted</b> civilians by international law. The Israeli security forces' use of land in the settlements or the membership of some settlers in the Israeli security forces does not affect the status of the other residents living among them, and certainly does not make them proper targets of attack. B'Tselem strongly opposes the attempts to justify attacks against Israeli civilians by using distorted interpretations of international law. Furthermore, B'Tselem demands that the Palestinian Authority do everything within its power to prevent future attacks and to prosecute the individuals involved in past attacks." ...|$|R
