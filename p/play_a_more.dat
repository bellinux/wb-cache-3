5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{prominent role in}} the Watership Down warren. It {{has been suggested that}} this might have been an attempt to modernise the story, to make it more in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
5|$|Following Mazzone's sacking in {{the summer}} of 1996 and the {{departure}} of Giannini, Totti was expected to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996–97 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing time under new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma's chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E

5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised because the new incumbent was expected to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> active role than had previous holders of the position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of his reign, Henry was {{increasingly}} infirm and focused on securing peace within the kingdom and his own religious devotions. Edward became the Steward of England and began to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> prominent role in government. Henry's finances were in a precarious state {{as a result of the}} war, and when Edward decided to join the crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary. Henry was concerned that Edward's absence might encourage further revolts, but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over the next two years to raise the money. De Montfort had exacted harsh penalties on the Jews which Henry initially reversed, but he reintroduced a range of anti-Jewish measures under pressure from parliament in {{the final years}} of his reign. Henry continued to invest in Westminster Abbey, which became a replacement for the Angevin mausoleum at Fontevraud Abbey, and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a lavish new shrine, personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place.|$|E
5|$|Players can <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game {{by using}} gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are {{encountered in the}} game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E

5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E
