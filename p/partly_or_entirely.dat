25|$|An {{ordinary}} camera {{could be}} used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images in the camera, making all three exposures {{at the same time and}} from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get out of adjustment. Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special sliding holder for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes <b>partly</b> <b>or</b> even <b>entirely</b> automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.|$|R

The present study {{is the first of}} the epizoic di-atom community covering the olive ridley turtle’s (Lepidochelys olivacea) carapace and the first describing diatoms living on sea turtles in general, with the primary objective of provid-ing detailed information on turtle epibiotic associations. Samples of turtle carapace includ-ing the associated diatom biofilm and epizoic macro-fauna were collected from Ostional beach (9 ° 59 ´ 23. 7 ´ ´ N 85 ° 41 ´ 52. 6 ´ ´ W), Costa Rica, during the arribada event in October 2013. A complex diatom community was present in every sample. In total, 11 macro-faunal and 21 diatom taxa were recorded. Amongst diatoms, the most numerous were erect (Achnanthes spp., Tripterion spp.) and motile (Haslea sp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., Proschkinia sp.) forms, followed by adnate Amphora spp., while the most common macro-faunal species was Stomatolepas elegans (Cirripedia). Diatom densities ranged from 8179 ± 750 to 27685 ± 4885 cells mm- 2. Epizoic microalgae were either <b>partly</b> immersed <b>or</b> <b>entirely</b> encapsulated within an exopolymeric coat. The relatively low diatom species num-ber, stable species composition and low inter-sample dissimilarities (14. 4 % on average) may indicate a mutualistic relationship between the epibiont and the basibiont. Dispersal of sea turtle diatoms is probably highly restricted and similar studies will help to understand both diatom diversity, evolution and biogeography, and sea turtle ecology and foraging strategies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Calorimetric {{and optical}} cryo-microscope meas-urements of 10 − 64 wt % citric acid (CA) {{solutions}} subjected to moderate (3 K/min) and slow (0. 5 and 0. 1 K/min) cooling/warming rates {{and also to}} quenching/moderate warming between 320 and 133 K are presented. Depending on solution concentration and cooling rate, the obtained thermograms show one freezing event and from one to three liquid−glass transitions upon cooling and from one to six liquid−glass and reverse glass−liquid transitions, one or two freezing events, and one melting event upon warming of frozen/glassy CA/H 2 O. The multiple freezing events and glass transitions pertain to the mother CA/H 2 O solution itself and two freeze-concentrated solution regions, FCS 1 and FCS 2, of different concentrations. The FCS 1 and FCS 2 (or FCS 22) are formed during the freezing of CA/H 2 O upon cooling and/or during the freezing upon warming of <b>partly</b> glassy <b>or</b> <b>entirely</b> glassy mother CA/H 2 O. The formation of two FCS 1 and FCS 22 regions during the freezing upon warming to our best knowledge has never been reported before. Using an optical cryo-microscope, {{we are able to}} observe the formation of a continuous ice framework (IF) and its morphology and reciprocal distribution of IF/(FCS 1 + FCS 2). Our results provide a new look at the freezing and glass transition behavior of aqueous solutions and can be used for the optimization of lyophilization and freezing of foods and biopharmaceutical formulations, among many other applications where freezing plays a crucial role. 1...|$|R

6000|$|I {{believe that}} if a canvass of the entire civilized world were put to the vote in this matter, the {{proposition}} that it is desirable that the better sort of people should intermarry and have plentiful children, and that the inferior sort of people should abstain from multiplication, would be carried by an overwhelming majority. They might disagree with Plato's methods, [Footnote: The Republic, Bk. V.] but they would certainly agree to his principle. And {{that this is not}} a popular error Mr. Francis Galton has shown. He has devoted a very large amount of energy and capacity to the vivid and convincing presentation of this idea, and to its courageous propagation. His Huxley Lecture to the Anthropological Institute in 1901 [Footnote: Nature, vol. lxiv. p. 659.] puts the whole matter as vividly as it ever can be put. He classifies humanity about their average in classes which he indicates by the letters R S T U V rising above the average and r s t u v falling below, and he saturates the whole business in quantitative colour. Indeed, Mr. Galton has drawn up certain definite proposals. He has suggested that [...] "noble families" [...] should collect [...] "fine specimens of humanity" [...] around them, employing these fine specimens in menial occupations of a light and comfortable sort, that will leave a sufficient portion of their energies free for the multiplication of their superior type. [...] "Promising young couples" [...] might be given [...] "healthy and convenient houses at low rentals," [...] he suggests, and no doubt it could be contrived that they should pay their rent <b>partly</b> <b>or</b> <b>entirely</b> per stone of family annually produced. And he has also proposed that [...] "diplomas" [...] should be granted to young men and women of high class--big S and upward--and that they should be encouraged to intermarry young. A scheme of [...] "dowries" [...] for diploma holders would obviously be the simplest thing in the world. And only the rules for identifying your great S T U and V in adolescence, are wanting from the symmetrical completeness of his really very noble- spirited and high-class scheme.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will first}} give briefly {{all the cases}} known to me of male quadrupeds differing in colour from the females. With Marsupials, as I am {{informed}} by Mr. Gould, the sexes rarely differ in this respect; but the great red kangaroo offers a striking exception, [...] "delicate blue being the prevailing tint in {{those parts of the}} female which in the male are red." [...] (19. Osphranter rufus, Gould, 'Mammals of Australia,' 1863, vol. ii. On the Didelphis, Desmarest, 'Mammalogie,' p. 256.) In the Didelphis opossum of Cayenne the female {{is said to be a}} little more red than the male. Of the Rodents, Dr. Gray remarks: [...] "African squirrels, especially those found in the tropical regions, have the fur much brighter and more vivid at some seasons of the year than at others, and the fur of the male is generally brighter than that of the female." [...] (20. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' Nov. 1867, p. 325. On the Mus minutus, Desmarest, 'Mammalogie,' p. 304.) Dr. Gray informs me that he specified the African squirrels, because, from their unusually bright colours, they best exhibit this difference. The female of the Mus minutus of Russia is of a paler and dirtier tint than the male. In a large number of bats the fur of the male is lighter than in the female. (21. J.A. Allen, in 'Bulletin of Mus. Comp. Zoolog. of Cambridge, United States,' 1869, p. 207. Mr. Dobson on sexual characters in the Chiroptera, 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1873, p. 241. Dr. Gray on Sloths, ibid. 1871, p. 436.) Mr. Dobson also remarks, with respect to these animals: [...] "Differences, depending <b>partly</b> <b>or</b> <b>entirely</b> on the possession by the male of fur of a much more brilliant hue, or distinguished by different markings or by the greater length of certain portions, are met only, to any appreciable extent, in the frugivorous bats in which the sense of sight is well developed." [...] This last remark deserves attention, as bearing on the question whether bright colours are serviceable to male animals from being ornamental. In one genus of sloths, it is now established, as Dr. Gray states, [...] "that the males are ornamented differently from the females--that is to say, that they have a patch of soft short hair between the shoulders, which is generally of a more or less orange colour, and in one species pure white. The females, on the contrary, are destitute of this mark." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the processing of}} spatially unattended, that is, “ignored” faces. It has {{been a matter of}} considerable debate over the last decades in the field of selective attention, whether ignored information is excluded, or “filtered” from further analysis, or whether it can be <b>partly</b> <b>or</b> even <b>entirely</b> processed. Conflicting evidence regarding the stage of the putative filter process (early vs. late filter account) were recently integrated into a capacity account of selective attention, the “Perceptual Load Theory”. According to this theory, irrelevant information is mandatorily processed as long as relevant information does not completely exhaust all available capacity. Recent studies have suggested that faces might be an exception to this account, and may even be processed automatically. For example, there is considerable evidence for the idea that faces might capture attention {{to a greater extent than}} other stimulus classes. Similarly, recent studies demonstrated that task-irrelevant faces, but not task-irrelevant non-faces, may affect processing of task-relevant information under conditions of high perceptual load. However, new studies have reported face processing as being capacity limited, in that only one face can be processed at a time. This finding strongly argues against an “automaticity” account of face processing. The current thesis examined long-term and immediate repetition effects from – presumably – unattended faces. The use of event-related brain potentials allowed a more detailed insight into the neural processes underlying face processing in the near absence of general attention resources. One main aspect of this thesis was to show that face processing is by no means unlimited, i. e. “automatic”. Rather, the experiments presented here provide the first neural evidence for a separate attention module with limited capacity, which is well-suited to, or specific for, the processing of faces...|$|R
