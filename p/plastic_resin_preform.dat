40|$|Plastics recyclers {{are usually}} quite {{particular}} {{about the kinds}} of plastic (i. e., which <b>plastic</b> <b>resins)</b> they will accept for processing. Reasons include: which plastics are called for in “recipes” for the products they make, how the recycling plant is set-up to handle emissions, and capabilities of the equipment at hand, as well as cost factors. It’s a plus for farmers and those involved with recycling programs to be able to differentiate among the common <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> used in agriculture so that sorting and separating can happen at the point of collection. The paper describes and interprets sink-float and burn tests used to identify common <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> and describes characteristics of the resins such as density, feel, color, strength and stretchability. These tests and observations can be carried out—even in the field—with minimal supplies.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{preservation}} of bovine placentomes using paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde at 4 % and solutions of Karnovsky, Bouin and Carnoy for 4, 12 and 24 hours fixation, at room temperature or at 4 ºC, before inclusion in <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> and paraffin. The best preservation of the specimens was obtained after 12 hours of fixation with those solutions containing aldehydes. With Bouin solution {{the best time of}} fixation was 4 hours, while for Carnoy solution the best time of fixation was 24 hours.

30|$|Samples from subtidal {{sediment}}s {{are taken}} with sediment sampling equipment, e.g. grab samplers [6, 11, 22]. For coastal sediments, direct sampling of visually identified microplastics (e.g. by hand or using tweezers) has been used. This method {{can be employed}} to sample larger microplastics such as <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> pellets (typical diameter: 3.5  mm [23]) {{from the surface of}} sandy beaches. However, it is not suitable for sampling microplastics that do not have a characteristic shape, are smaller than <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> pellets or are mixed with other debris [6, 11]. In these cases, bulk sampling is required to avoid an underrepresentation of small microplastics. As the distribution of microplastics on beaches is often heterogeneous, attention needs to be paid to sample size, replication and the location of the sampling sites on the beach [8].|$|R

Placement on the ‘clean-dirty’ continuum is approximate and variable.
