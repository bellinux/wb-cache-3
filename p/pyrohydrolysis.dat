40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes {{the presence of}} zinc in the wastewater may represent an obstacle to its high efficient regeneration. This {{is the case of}} the treatment of spent pickling solutions aiming the recovery of hydrochloric acid via <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> techniques. Hydrochloric spent pickling solutions from steel processing contain relevant amount of metals such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) that may significantly affect recovery of hydrochloric acid (HCl) through <b>pyrohydrolysis.</b> In fact, although Fe may be recovered as ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and does not have a substantial effect on <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> process, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) evaporating can occlude nozzles and stick to the <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> reactor walls, thereby contaminating the iron oxide product.

In this study, we present the results obtained within a laboratory experimental campaign to recover Zn and Fe from pickling liquors by means of liquid-liquid extraction adopting a suitable organic extractant, tributyl phosphate (TBP). In order to find out the best operative conditions leading to very high efficiencies, three main factors were investigated: the volume ratio between the organic extractant and the aqueous spent pickling liquor, the stirring time, and the percentage of TBP used (pure or variously diluted in kerosene).

The accuracy of this approach was confirmed by the analysis of eight coals spiked with SRMs with an indexed recovery from 94. 97 to 109. 56 %, whose mean value was 102. 58 %.

40|$|Hydrochloric acid can be {{successfully}} recovered from spent pickling liquors with high efficiencies via <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> techniques. In the pickling solution feed, other metallic ions are typically present besides iron (mainly Fe 2 +) such as zinc(II).

40|$|Industrial {{experience}} {{has revealed that}} when used to treat multi-component metal chloride waste liquors, existing fluidized bed acid regeneration facilities are not as efficient as when employed for the <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> of conventional iron chloride solutions (i. e. waste pickle liquor). As a result, experimental studies and thermochemical modelling were performed to characterize the transformation of a saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105 °C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850 °C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850 °C.

Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. Upon completing a comprehensive literature review, testwork was initially performed with a simplified experimental set-up to study the physical behaviour of the chloride solution as it is exposed to a static bed of oxides at 850 °C, and ultimately identify the various phases of the transformation process. Subsequently, controlled evaporative crystallization experiments were conducted under pseudo-equilibrium conditions to define the McClx·yH 2 O precipitation path that takes place during the H 2 O evaporation phase and {{to determine whether the}} chlorides precipitate independently or as complex compounds. Further experiments were performed in a fully instrumented tube furnace to elaborate {{on the nature of the}} reactions (dehydration and/or <b>pyrohydrolysis)</b> that take place after all of the water in the starting solution has evaporated (i. e. T= 300 °C+). In an effort to assist with the interpretation of the experimental results, thermochemical modelling was performed to predict the equilibrium phase assemblages that could occur during the transformation of the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution, at reaction temperatures of 200 °C+. The research study at hand has shown that when the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105 °C is exposed to fluidized bed pyrohydrolyzer operating conditions at 850 °C, the following sequence of events take place: (1) rapid solvent H 2 O evaporation (i. e. vigorous boiling) and onset of solid metal chloride precipitation. (2) slurry densification due to a gradual increase in crystal content (i. e. AlCl· 6 H 2 O, FeCl 2 ·xH 2 O, and MgCl 2 ·xH 2 O, where x = 2 or 4). (3) hydrated crystal drying and onset of <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> (i. e. thermal decomposition of McClx·yH 2 O). The same holds true for the high temperature hydrolysis of typical waste pickle liquors (i. e. primarily FeCl 2 solution). The crystallization studies revealed that when the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution is allowed to gradually evaporate at 105 °C,. AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O precipitates when 15 % of the solvent water evolves from the liquor, followed by FeCl 2 ·xH 2 O and MgCl 2 ·xH 2 O (where x = 2 or 4) at 26 and 41 % evaporation, respectively. Ferric chloride remains in solution even after 54 % of the water has been driven from the liquor. The latter result suggests that higher ferric concentrations in the reactor feed are more than likely to favour an increase in the quantity of liquor entrainment by the fluidizing gases and therefore lead to lower process efficiencies. Dedicated <b>pyrohydrolysis</b> experiments, with a simulated reactor atmosphere (gaseous, not dynamic), have shown that excluding kinetic effects, the transformation of the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution occurs primarily over the 300 to 600 °C temperature range. Thermochemical modelling revealed that with the exception of AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O hydrolysis, the majority of the reactions taking place as the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl liquor is introduced into and eventually reaches 850 °C are governed by either reaction kinetics or diffusion. Furthermore, the resulting phase assemblage at any given temperature was predicted to vary significantly with oxygen potential. A liquid chloride phase (including molten salt), other than the feed liquor, was not predicted to form at any temperature (i. e. 200 °C or above) under the range of oxidizing or reducing conditions considered.

Ilmenite ore is roasted at temperatures in the range of 800 °C to 1, 000 °C to selectively magnetise the ilmenite fraction so that gangue minerals may be easily removed. Roasting also enhances the subsequent leaching operation by activation of the iron component of the ilmenite whilst at the same time rendering the titania fraction insoluble. Iron and other impurities are removed by leaching at atmospheric pressure with near boiling, 25 mass %, hydrochloric acid. The leached solids are filtered, washed and calcined to yield a synthetic rutile of 97 % (or higher) TiO 2 grade. Hydrochloric acid is recovered from spent leachate by evaporation and <b>pyrohydrolysis,</b> to yield a super-azeotropic acid. The fuel used can be gas, oil or coal, depending on local economics. A pilot plant has been successfully operated for several years, using many types of fuel and ilmenite feedstock. A new coal-fuelled demonstration plant is now in the final design stage, to utilise ilmenite sourced from India and some of the emerging heavy mineral producers in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin...|$|E
