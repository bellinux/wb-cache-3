5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with <b>private</b> <b>insurance</b> via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} {{literature on the}} demand for <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> {{and its effect on}} the use of health care services and applies the theoretical framework to the type of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> that exists alongside a universal health care system. The predominant share of the theoretical literature on <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> is developed to model <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> in settings where this provides the primary source of coverage and the choice is between purchasing <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> and going uninsured. This type of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> is termed principal <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> in the following. <b>Private</b> health <b>insurance</b> that co-exists with a universal health care system may be classified as complementary, supplementary or duplicate in relation to the universal health care system based on its coverage. Duplicate insurance covers treatments at private hospitals for treatments that are also available through the universal health care system. Complementary <b>insurance</b> covers <b>private</b> copayment for treatments that are only partly financed by but delivered within the universal health care system, and supplementary insurance covers treatments that are excluded from the universal health care system. <b>Private</b> health <b>insurance...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Private</b> health <b>insurance</b> {{has been}} a major focus of Commonwealth {{government}} health policy for the last decade. Over this period, the Howard government introduced a number of policy changes which impacted on the take up of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance.</b> The most expensive of these was the introduction of the <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> rebate in 1997, which had an estimated cost of $ 3 billion per annum. This paper uses information on the geographic distribution of the population with <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> cover to identify associations between rates of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> cover and socioeconomic status. The geographic analysis is repeated with survey data on expenditure on <b>private</b> health <b>insurance,</b> to provide an estimate of the rebate flowing to different socioeconomic groups. The analysis highlights the strong association between high rates of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> cover and high socioeconomic status and shows the substantial transfer of funds, under the <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> rebate, to those living in areas of highest socioeconomic status, compared with those in areas of lower socioeconomic status, and in particular those in the most disadvantaged areas. The paper also provides estimates of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> cover by federal electorate, emphasising the substantial gaps in cover between Liberal Party and Australian Labor Party seats. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the uneven distribution of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> cover across Australia for policy formation. In particular, the study shows that the prevalence of <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> is unevenly distributed across Australia, with marked differences in prevalence in rural and urban areas, and substantial differences by socioeconomic status. Policy formation needs to take this into account. Evaluating the potential impact of changes in <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> requires more nuanced consideration than previously implied in the rhetoric about <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> over the last decade.

5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, <b>private</b> <b>insurance</b> firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized <b>private</b> <b>insurance.</b> The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for <b>private</b> <b>insurance</b> {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to {{buy health insurance}} from <b>private</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients who are citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it. In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E

40|$|Australia’s {{existing}} health {{financing arrangements}} lead to partial duplication in coverage for <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> holders. The two options to remove duplication are: 1) allowing individuals to ‘opt-out’ from Medicare either (a) by purchasing <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> or (b) by self-insuring via {{medical savings accounts}} or other pre-payment arrangements; 2) confining <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> to the coverage of supplementary services. This paper argues in favour of option 1 (a), and argues that from an efficiency perspective: <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> should be fully substitutive of Medicare coverage (i. e. ‘opting-out’ should be allowed); community-rating should be replaced by premium bands; and the 30 - 40 % ad valorem subsidy for <b>private</b> health <b>insurance</b> should be replaced by ex-ante risk-adjusted subsidies...|$|R
