5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} sheaves {{had become a}} {{mainstream}} part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to algebraic topology. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is intuitionistic logic (this observation is now {{often referred to as}} Kripkendash&Joyal semantics, but <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> be attributed to a number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as Leibniz.|$|E
25|$|D.C. {{closed out}} {{the regular season}} in Orlando knowing {{that they would be}} hosting the play-in round match four days later so long as the Montreal Impact did not win at New England, so it <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not have {{surprised}} anyone that Coach Olsen started a line-up made of entirely of reserves and a few players returning from lengthy injury spells. Not surprisingly, Orlando City dominated the match, winning 4-2, despite United goals by Saborio and Igboananike, who notched his first goal for United, with Büscher assisting on both goals. Montreal fell to defeat to the Revolution, however, so D.C. would host the Impact in the mid-week play-in match.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} problem {{therefore is}} how {{to ensure that the}} appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived {{in various parts of the}} social system.|$|E

25|$|Some {{patients}} are allergic {{to the common}} local anesthetics like lidocaine and <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not consider lip injections. Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should not forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like cold sores, blood clotting problems, infections, scarring of the lips or certain diseases like diabetes or lupus that cause slower healing. Patients with facial nerve disorders, severe hypertension or recurrent herpes simplex lesions should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, smokers complicate completion of their procedure {{as well as the}} speed of healing.|$|E
25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green vehicle category, but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|... "My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not have done; {{and the second}} being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket {{commentator}} Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Myles McNutt {{gave the}} episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity. He wrote that, [...] "I would argue, though, that [...] {{part of the}} show’s problem right now" [...] and noted that Tate's performance was expanded [...] "little ... beyond her initial appearance last season." [...] In a review for the subsequent episode, [...] "After Hours", however, McNutt acknowledged that, [...] "If I'm being honest with , last week's <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and have to stand by that decision." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2013, at a {{screening}} of Broadway Idiot, Mayer reported that the film adaptation was still happening, but production had not been scheduled due to [...] "Hollywood bullshit". In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's {{not going to be a}} lot of dialogue and it <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done". He expected to finish it by the end of the month.|$|E
500|$|The album's final parody is [...] "eBay", {{based on}} [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E

Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{members of}} the school's faculty were {{involved}} in controversy surrounding the U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries. On October 9, Dean Hill and Associate Dean W.

Hill and Albrecht signed the message with their official BYU titles, sent the e-mail from a BYU e-mail address, and began the message [...] "Dear Marriott School Friend." [...] Both the LDS Church and BYU, as tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations, are prohibited by federal law from endorsing a particular candidate or political party.

500|$|Responding to {{the song}} being an {{original}} as opposed to their traditional covers, McKay said, [...] "If 'Loser Like Me' were a bad song, then it wouldn't matter whether it was original or a cover: we wouldn't be playing it. That the song is good, {{and that it has}} the 'Glee' reach, makes it an easy song to play." [...] Keith Kennedy, program director at WKDD said the single made him ponder why they haven't played Glee songs prior to [...] "Loser Like Me". Kennedy said, [...] "How many times have you heard radio programmers claim that they use sales numbers to shape their stations' playlists? Look at iTunes every Wednesday: Glee often dominates the top 10." [...] Kennedy's station, WKDD, holds a [...] "Glee O'clock" [...] segment daily and he said [...] "While some of the remakes have leaned toward show tunes, several <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have received more airplay." ...|$|E
500|$|Symptoms {{outside of}} the liver are present in 1–10% of HBV-infected people and include serum-sickness–like syndrome, acute necrotizing {{vasculitis}} (polyarteritis nodosa), membranous glomerulonephritis, and papular acrodermatitis of childhood (Gianotti–Crosti syndrome).

HBV-associated nephropathy has been described in adults but is more common in children. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common form.
