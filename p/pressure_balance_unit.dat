40|$|The hot gas {{desulfurization}} (HGD) {{technique is}} one of the elemental technologies of syngas purification having both thermal efficiency and very low emissions. The HGD is a novel method to efficiently remove H 2 S and COS in the syngas with regenerable sorbents at high temperature and high pressure condition. We propose a compact hot gas desulfurization system by which its operability is improved in stabilizing <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> among <b>units.</b> The proposed compact two beds system has two bubbling beds, solid injection nozzle, solid conveying line, and riser. The compact desulfurization system was located between coal gasifier and Fisher-Tropsch (F-T) reactor to desulfurize syngas in order not to deactivate F-T catalyst. To check feasibility of the compact desulfurization system at high pressure condition, both cold mode and hot mode tests have been performed. In the integrated system, the compact desulfurization system has removed H 2 S and COS in the syngas and supplied the cleaned syngas to the F-T reactor during the continuous operation at high pressure condition...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{accurate}} measurements, the use of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> with the controlled-clearance system {{is well known in}} the history of high pressures metrology. Furthermore, the introduction of assemblies with cylinders made up of two materials to the construction of controlled-clearance <b>pressure</b> <b>balances,</b> {{is one of the most}} important developments in the field of high pressure measurements. The use of some analytical procedures for the characterization of the <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> (also known as piston gauges) becomes more difficult especially for the case of geometries with composite cylinders. Those geometries were also studied with the analytical method developed by the author[1] (based on a simplified model) and described in this paper. This method was also reported in some not original publications from 2003 to 2007. The analysis begins with the mathematical model of thick-walled cylinder applied to the Mechanical theory of elastic equilibrium for the formulation of the so called Simplified Elastic Theory which represents an analytical approach for the study of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances.</b> This analysis is known as the Lame' problem.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} interest in high-pressure primary standards {{has given rise}} {{in recent years to}} particular attention to the design and metrological characterisation of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances.</b> To this purpose several simplified and empirical methods are generally used but most of them are not applicable to complex units and they do not allow an optimum design of the unit. The present study is based on a finite-element method developed by the University of Cassino and the CNR-IMGC (Istituto di Metrologia ``G Colonnetti'') of Turin. This method is applied to different kinds of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> to underline its efficiency in metrological characterisation. Finally, the design problems regarding <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> are analysed with particular reference to the dimensional optimisation and to tolerance effects. ...|$|R
40|$|The role of cosmic-ray-modified contact {{discontinuities}} and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> {{structures in}} two-fluid cosmic-ray hydrodynamics in one Cartesian space dimension are investigated {{by means of}} analytic and numerical solution examples, {{as well as by}} weakly nonlinear asymptotics. The fundamental wave modes of the two-fluid cosmic-ray hydrodynamic equations in the long-wavelength limit consist of the backward and forward propagating cosmic-ray-modified sound waves, with sound speed dependent on both the cosmic-ray and thermal gas pressures; the contact discontinuity; and a <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode in which the sum ofthe cosmic ray and thermal gas pressure perturbations is zero. The <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode, like the contact discontinuity is advected with the background flow. The interaction of the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode with the contact discontinuity is investigated by means of the method of multiple scales. The thermal gas and cosmic-ray pressure perturbations satisfy a linear diffusion equation, and entropy perturbations arising from nonisentropic initial conditions for the thermal gas are frozen into the fluid. The contact discontinuity and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> eigenmodes both admit nonzero perturbations in the thermal gas, whereas the cosmic-ray-modified sound waves are isentropic. The total entropy perturbation is shared between the contact discontinuity and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> eigenmodes, and examples are given {{in which there is a}} transfer of entropy between the two modes. In particular, N-wave type density disturbances are obtained which arise as a result of the entropy transfer between the two modes. A weakly nonlinear geometric optics perturbation expansion is used to study the long timescale evolution of the short-wavelength entropy wave and the thermal gas sound waves in a slowly varying, large-scale background flow. The weakly nonlinear geometric optics expansion is also used to generalize previous studies of squeezing instability for short-wavelength sound waves in the two fluid model, by including a weakly nonlinear wave steepening term that leads to shock formation, as well as the effect of long time and space dependence of the background flow. Implications of cosmic-ray-modified <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> structures and contact discontinuities in models of the interaction of traveling interplanetary shocks and compression and rarefraction waves with the solar wind termination shock are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> at the {{magnetopause}} {{is formed}} by magnetic field and plasma in the magnetosheath, on one side, {{and inside the}} magnetosphere, on the other side. In the approach of dipole earth's magnetic field configuration and gas-dynamics solar wind flowing around the magnetosphere, the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> predicts that the magnetopause distance R depends on solar wind dynamic pressure Pd as a power low R ~ Pd^alpha, where the exponent alpha=- 1 / 6. In the real magnetosphere the magnetic filed is contributed by additional sources: Chapman-Ferraro current system, field-aligned currents, tail current, and storm-time ring current. Net contribution of those sources depends on particular magnetospheric region and varies with solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity. As a result, the parameters of <b>pressure</b> <b>balance,</b> including power index alpha, depend on both the local position at the magnetopause and geomagnetic activity. In addition, the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> can be affected by a non-linear transfer of the solar wind energy to the magnetosheath, especially for quasi-radial regime of the subsolar bow shock formation proper for the interplanetary magnetic field vector aligned with the solar wind plasma flow.

40|$|Since passing {{essentially}} continuously into {{regions of}} solar {{wind from the}} southern polar coronal hole at approximately 36 deg S, Ulysses has observed frequent structures lasting from several hours to several days. In addition to Alfven waves and coronal mass ejections, which have been discussed by previous authors, two other sorts of structures are routinely evident. This paper provides the first report of these structures in the high latitude solar wind: (1) small scale compressional structures, and (2) <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> structures. The compressional structures are driven by faster solar wind overtaking the slower solar wind ahead of it and exhibit the plasma and field properties expected for compressions. However, unlike large scale stream interaction regions observed in and near the ecliptic plane, these structures are much smaller scale and are transient, not recurring from one rotation to the next. The <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> structures are indicated by roughly equal increases in the plasma pressure and decreases in the magnetic field pressure.
