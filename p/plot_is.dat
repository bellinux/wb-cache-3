40|$|Abstract: Linear and squared {{residual}} <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> {{proposed to}} assess nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity in regression diagnostics. It is shown that linear residual <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> useful for diagnosing nonlinearity and squared residual <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> powerful for detecting nonconstant variance. A paradigm for the graphical interpretation of residual <b>plots</b> <b>is</b> presented. Key words and phrases: Heteroscedasticity, leverages, nonlinearity, outliers. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The Main <b>Plot</b> <b>was</b> {{an alleged}} {{conspiracy}} of July 1603 by English courtiers, to remove King James I from the English throne and {{to replace him}} with his cousin Arabella (or Arbella) Stuart. The <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> supposedly led by Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham, and funded by the Spanish government. In a state trial, the defendants accused {{of involvement in the}} Main <b>Plot</b> <b>were</b> tried along with those of the Bye <b>Plot.</b> It <b>is</b> referred to as the [...] "main" [...] plot, because {{at the time it was}} presented as the principal ("main") plot of which the secondary (or [...] "bye") <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> a minor component.|$|R

The main <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> about Spottedleaf becoming a medicine cat after being a warrior apprentice and being manipulated by ThistleClaw, the main villain of SpottedLeaf's Heart and BlueStar's Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|The game's <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> {{loosely based}} on the film, as players take {{the role of the}} film's primary Predator. After the events of the first film of the Alien vs. Predator franchise, the Predator has been charged by his society to hunt down and destroy any trace of Alien {{activity}} taking place in a small American town, in order to avoid its detection by humanity.|$|E
30|$|Maximum canopy height (Hm) for <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} {{and used}} as the dependant variable in all analyses. Stand age for each <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> obtained from the stand GIS data.|$|R
30|$|At each site, four {{herbaceous}} buffer <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> sampled (n[*]=[*] 16, 4 sites[*]×[*] 4 plots/site). The {{size of the}} herbaceous buffer <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> 4.5  m (poplar buffer width)[*]×[*] 9  m (40.5  m 2). At each site, {{there were}} 4 riparian woodlot plots (n[*]=[*] 16, 4 sites[*]×[*] 4 plots/site). The size of these woodlot <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> 4.5  m[*]×[*] 9  m (40.5  m 2).|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 15 <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> {{located in the}} {{plantation}} with four of these selected based on {{the severity of the}} curvature of the trees; two had more pronounced curvature than average and, two had less pronounced curvature. The remaining eleven <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> randomly located. The <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> circular with an 8 m radius, yielding between 13 and 16 trees per plot.|$|R
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} port {{includes}} many parkour {{moves from the}} PC and console versions, however, the perspective is shifted from first person to third person. The game does not feature cutscenes, and the <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> explained with scrolling text in between levels. The iOS version has since {{been removed from the}} app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8.|$|E
5|$|The outside {{edges of}} the Green are bordered by benches and trees; two {{flagpoles}} stand {{at the center of}} the western side. The <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> bounded by four streets: Wheelock Street to the south, College Street to the east, Wentworth Street to the north, and Main Street to the west. All but Wheelock Street are one-way roads, with traffic circulating counter-clockwise around the Green.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstar's Echo is {{the twelfth}} novella. It was {{released}} on April 11, 2017. The story takes place shortly after Dawn of the Clans. The main <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> about Thunderstar struggling {{to be the first}} leader of ThunderClan and keeping his Clan safe.|$|E
3000|$|... 2 {{statistic}} (Borenstein et al. 2005). Fixed-effect {{models with}} forest <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> used to pool {{the results of}} homogeneous studies whereas random-effect models with forest <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> used for heterogeneous studies.|$|R
30|$|The {{observation}} <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> surveyed through questionnaire, {{measurement and}} visual observations were also made. All together eight observation <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> {{selected in the}} classified zones i.e. CRZ, RZ, YZ and GZ. The area of each <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> 18, 225 sq. ft. (5 Kaththa). The cultivation practice, yield and annual income following the years of flood were recorded in the {{from each of the}} observation plot.|$|R
50|$|This {{shows that}} the {{absorbance}} values on the <b>plot</b> <b>are</b> offset by an equal amount and {{the slope of the}} two <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> equal. Thus, the concentration calculated from the two <b>plots</b> <b>is</b> equal. Other scalar components that contribute to the absorbance of a given sample like contaminants on the cuvette or a different cuvette material also are averaged out during the slope measurement.|$|R
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{actions as}} emperor were {{described}} as being especially harsh to the senate, to the nobility and to the equestrian order. According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula. Eventually, officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea succeeded in murdering the emperor. The <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} been informed of it and involved in it.|$|E
5|$|Discworld is a 1995 point-and-click {{adventure}} game {{developed by}} Teeny Weeny Games and Perfect 10 Productions for MS-DOS, Macintosh, and the Sony PlayStation. A Sega Saturn version was released the following year. The game stars Rincewind the Wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) and {{is set on}} Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> based roughly around {{the events in the}} book Guards! Guards!, but also borrows elements from other Discworld novels. It involves Rincewind attempting to stop a dragon terrorising the inhabitants of Ankh-Morpork.|$|E
40|$|More {{information}} is {{needed on the}} grazing responses of wetland graminoids to improve management ofriparian shrub community types. To study the effect ofcattle grazing on the number ofnew shoots produced by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata) within the 1989 and 1990 growing seasons, 40 <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> protected and 40 <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> grazed by cattle in June and September each year. Altlwugh number ofshoots produced on grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> similar in 1989, grazed plots produced 27. 4 percent more shoots per plot than ungrazed plots (P < 0. 05) in 1990. Preliminary analysis ofmonthly shoot production data indicates that the greatest difference between grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> in July. Seasonal mortality on grazed and ungrazed <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> similar, altlwugh high rodent-caused mortality in the ungrazed plots may have masked the effects ofcattle grazing...|$|R
50|$|The plot {{involved}} up to 10 conspirators travelling from Syria {{to engage}} in a series of suicide bombings and mass shootings in central Düsseldorf. The <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> to involve attacks on the Heinrich-Heine-Allee street, as well as other attacks in the Altstadt district of the city. The <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> supposedly ordered by ISIS command in Syria and the <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> foiled while waiting for all the conspirators to arrive in the city.|$|R
5000|$|The cations and anions {{are shown}} by {{separate}} ternary plots. The apexes of the cation <b>plot</b> <b>are</b> calcium, magnesium and sodium plus potassium cations. The apexes of the anion <b>plot</b> <b>are</b> sulfate, chloride and carbonate plus hydrogen carbonate anions. The two ternary <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> then projected onto a diamond. [...] The diamond is a matrix transformation of a graph of the anions (sulfate + chloride/ total anions) and cations (sodium + potassium/total cations).|$|R
5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} to go back to the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|Kind Hearts and Coronets is a 1949 British black comedy film. It {{features}} Dennis Price, Joan Greenwood, Valerie Hobson and Alec Guinness; Guinness plays nine characters.

5|$|Kingdom Hearts χ is a prequel to the Kingdom Hearts series as a whole, {{taking place}} more than 100 years prior. It takes {{place before the}} Keyblade War, which {{established}} {{the organization of the}} Kingdom Hearts universe as of the original game. The player assumes the role of a Keyblade wielder who joins one of five factions led by Keyblade Masters fighting for control of the limited light existing in the world. The game's <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> connected to Kingdom Hearts III, the next main entry in the series. The title refers to the legendary χ-blade, a weapon central to the series' story arc.|$|E
30|$|Four soil plots, with {{dimensions}} of 80  m[*]×[*] 20  m, were installed within the experimental sub-catchment avoiding the few small landslides present, and average <b>plot</b> slope <b>was</b> measured. The amount of spray applied to each <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> determined using 60 horizontal sample-collection plates (115.5  cm 2 per plate) positioned along transects within each soil plot {{to detect the}} colorimetric tracer. The amount of terbuthylazine and hexazinone active ingredient applied per <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> then calculated based on the density of Agpro Valzine Extra spray mix (AGPRO NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; 1.12  g mL− 1) as described in Garrett et al. (2015). The tartrazine-detection results showed that only half {{of one of the}} four <b>plots</b> <b>was</b> sprayed; therefore, this half of the <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> excluded from spray calculations and post-spray forest floor and soil sampling.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{circular}} <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> {{established on}} native tallgrass prairie near Kansas State University campus. <b>Plots</b> <b>were</b> separately exposed to ambient CO 2, double ambient (enriched) CO 2. <b>Plots</b> <b>were</b> moved annually in late February {{and have had}} various fertilization schemes applied. Grasses were examined for biomass production, water use efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient limitations, decomposition and nutrient cycling, and forage quality. It was found that C 4, but not C 3, grass species exhibited increased biomass production...|$|R
40|$|A {{permanent}} <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> {{established in}} 1997 to monitor vegetation {{development in a}} recently abandoned coal mine in Ny-_lesund, Svalbard. A 1 mx 1 m quadrat was set up and further divided into one hundred small 10 cmx 10 cm cells. All the vascular plants occurring in the <b>plot</b> <b>were</b> recorded {{for each of the}} 100 cells. In 1999, the <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> revisited and examined for occurrences of vascular plants. Further, in 2002, the <b>plot</b> <b>was</b> re-surveyed and all the vascular plants were measured for their coverage. Data were compared and coverage change {{over the past three years}} was detected. Vascular plants significantly increased, indicating that the vegetation succession is currently in progress...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, {{claims that}} Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who {{were opposed to}} his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, {{but as soon as}} Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several visual effect {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark.

The game {{setting and}} engine {{are similar to}} the ones of its predecessor, however the characters and plot are notably different; the cast of characters is considerably smaller, and the <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> considerably simpler. Additionally, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has a shorter main campaign, but more side missions and a secret campaign {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E
50|$|The Morrow <b>Plots</b> <b>were</b> {{begun in}} 1876 by Professor Manly Miles, who {{established}} three half-acre fields with different crop schemes. These were expanded to ten plots in 1879 by George E. Morrow. At first, record keeping {{was not of}} the highest caliber, but {{by the turn of}} the 20th century it was clear that crop rotation was a useful component in preventing the depletion of soil quality. In the early 20th century, the number of <b>plots</b> <b>were</b> reduced, and their size was also reduced, in order to facilitate expansion of the university facilities. The northernmost <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> the only ones that date to Manly's 1876 establishment; his other <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> now occupied by the observatory.|$|R
30|$|The shape, {{size and}} number of sample plots vary greatly among provinces. Square <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> used in more than 90  % of the provinces. Circular <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> used only in Tibet, while {{rectangular}} <b>plots</b> <b>are</b> used in Inner Mongolia and in one sub-population of Heilongjiang. Point sampling or angle count sampling was used in Guangxi before the 6 th NFI, but square <b>plots</b> have <b>been</b> used since 2005 (Cen et al. 2007). In the past, several provinces such as Henan and Hubei used to apply cluster sampling in plateau areas, where a cluster was composed of 4 or 5 plots (Xiao 2005).|$|R
