40|$|Summary. This review {{summarizes}} {{recent studies}} on the mechanisms and compounds taking part in acquisition and maintenance of desiccation tolerance of seeds. The role of ABA in regulating gene expression in either developmental or stress situation is discussed. Special attention is given to LEA proteins as protectors helping seeds to tolerate desiccation at maturity as well as following imbibition and germination. The physiological significance of desiccation in redirection of primary metabolism of seeds from development to germination is emphasized. Studies on {{the determination of the}} functions of ABA-regulated gene products and on the identification of genes that contain information of desiccation (dehydration) tolerance are also reviewed. This kind of information is essential for crop breeding purposes in order to improve stress tolerance or the productivity of crop plants under field conditions. Key words: maturation of seeds, seed desiccation, desiccation tolerance, <b>premature</b> drying, <b>germination</b> of seeds, dehydration stress Abbreviations: ABA – abscisic acid, DAP – days after pollination, GA – gibberellic acid, LEA-proteins – late-embryogenesis-abundant protein...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{response}} factors (ERFs) are plant transcriptional regulators mediating ethylene-dependent {{gene expression}} via binding to the GCC motif {{found in the}} promoter region of ethylene-regulated genes. We report here on the structural and functional characterization of the tomato Sl-ERF 2 gene that belongs to a distinct class of the large ERF gene family. Both spliced and unspliced versions of Sl-ERF 2 transcripts were amplified from RNA samples and the search in the public tomato expressed sequence tag (EST) database confirmed {{the existence of the}} two transcript species in a number of cDNA libraries. The unspliced transcript contains two open reading frames yielding two hypothetical proteins, a small highly truncated version lacking the APETALA 2 domain and a bigger protein lacking the N-terminal MCGGAAII/L consensus peptide specific to ERF members from subfamily IV. Nevertheless, functional Sl-ERF 2 protein may only derive from spliced transcripts since, depending on the tissue, the level of the spliced transcript is much higher than that of the unspliced transcript. Sl-ERF 2 is expressed in all plant tissues tested, though its transcript accumulates preferentially in germinating seeds and ripening fruit. Overexpression of the Sl-ERF 2 gene in transgenic tomato lines results in <b>premature</b> seed <b>germination</b> and enhanced hook formation of darkgrown seedlings, which is indicative of increased ethylene sensitivity. The expression of the mannanase 2 gene is upregulated in Sl-ERF 2 -overexpressing seeds, suggesting that Sl-ERF 2 stimulates seed germination through the induction of the mannanase 2 gene. It is noteworthy that the exaggerated hook phenotype is abolished when ethylene perception is blocked, strongly suggesting that Sl-ERF 2 requires other ethylene-dependent components to impact the hook formation process...|$|R

40|$|Tree seed {{performance}} has benefited considerably from {{the development of}} controlled methods to overcome dormancy. Traditionally tree seeds have often been stratified outdoors. Depending on the types of dormancy, stratification starts before or during summer and continues during winter, or it starts before winter. Seeds become ready to germinate during winter, and they may start to germinate before sowing. Reducing the water content of the seeds during pre-treatment can prevent this <b>premature</b> <b>germination.</b> If <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> is prevented, treatments at slightly reduced and controlled moisture content (MC) can be prolonged. As a result, percentage, rate, and uniformity of germination increase. Moreover germination proceeds over {{a wider range of}} seedbed conditions. So far, controlled MC treatment has been developed for about 20 species, both broad leaved and conifers...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} pollen to {{germinate}} prior to anthesis {{was tested using}} Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.). Lily pollen normally dries to a low moisture content between anthesis and pollination while corn does not. The corn pollen germinated well (about 73 %) when removed from anthers 1 day before anthesis and placed on culture medium. The lily pollen germinated poorly (0 to 5 %) when harvested one to six days before anthesis. However, the lily pollen harvested {{one or two days}} before anthesis gave greatly improved germination (about 55 %) after it was dried to a low moisture content. The results indicate that an internal control prevents <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> of lily pollen and that drying is the final stage of pollen maturation. A different sort of regulatory mechanism must operate to prevent <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> of corn pollen...|$|E

By using a B-A translocation, {{it is possible to}} analyze the basis for the anthocyaninless phenotype of vp 1 in the absence of vivipary. Anthocyaninless vp 1 aleurones were found to be deficient in at least three enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chalcone synthase, and UDPG-flavonoid glucosyltransferase) as well as in several other metabolically unrelated enzymes that show pronounced increases in late stages of aleurone development.

40|$|The {{development}} of the maize seed {{is dependent on the}} orderly unfolding of events in which each component of the developing caryopsis has a particular role to play. The ultimate control of these events must depend upon numerous genes, which if altered will interfere with normal development. Many mutants of this type have been described, ranging from those which produce relatively slight alteration in the caryopsis to those which prevent practically all development. Among those producing relatively slight changes are mutants which give rise to <b>premature</b> <b>germination.</b> The seeds of these mutants develop normally until late in ontogeny. During the early dough stage the plumule begins to elongate, and the seeds germinate while still attached to the ear. Such mutants have been called viviparous...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is a {{trait of}} considerable adaptive significance because it maximizes seedling survival by preventing <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> under unfavorable conditions. Understanding how seeds break dormancy and initiate growth is also of great agricultural and biotechnological interest. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays primary regulatory {{roles in the}} initiation and maintenance of seed dormancy. Here we report that the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ABI 5 confers an enhanced response to exogenous ABA during germination, and seedling establishment, as well as subsequent vegetative growth. These responses correlate with total ABI 5 levels. We show that ABI 5 expression defines a narrow developmental window following germination, during which plants monitor the environmental osmotic status before initiating vegetative growth. ABI 5 is necessary to maintain germinated embryos in a quiescent state thereby protecting plants from drought. As expected for {{a key player in}} ABA-triggered processes, ABI 5 protein accumulation, phosphorylation, stability, and activity are highly regulated by ABA during germination and early seedling growth...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} offers plants {{an adaptive}} advantage that {{is crucial to}} their successful colonization of land. The decision {{to make the transition}} from a dormant seed to a photoautotrophic seedling is a result of a complex interaction of internal hormonal signals and external stimuli such as water, temperature and light. We recently showed that HY 5, a well-characterized component in the light signaling pathway, also mediates abscisic acid (ABA) response during seed germination, early seedling growth and root development in Arabidopsis. We proposed that HY 5 regulates these ABA responses partly by directly activating the transcription factor gene ABI 5. By analyzing the <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> of hy 5 and abi 5 single and double mutants, here we demonstrated that HY 5 also positively controls seed maturation and dormancy, likely through direct activation of the ABI 5 gene. The contrasting role of light regulation of seed development and germination may be important for the adaptation of plants to the environment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Premature</b> <b>germination</b> of resting spores as a {{means of}} {{protecting}} brassica crops from Plasmodiphora brassicae Wor., (Clubroot). Crop Protection. Clubroot disease causes substantial yield and quality losses in broadacre oil seed and intensive vegetable brassica crops worldwide. The causal microbe Plasmodiophora brassicae Wor., perennates as soil-borne dormant resting spores. Their germination is triggered by exudates from host roots. A valuable addition to sustainable integrated control strategies could be developed by identifying and synthesising the molecules responsible for stimulating resting spore germination. This paper reports experiments in which stimulatory exudates were collected from brassica roots following exposure to infective stages of P. brassicae. Analyses identified a germination signalling molecule of circa 1 kDa formed of glucose sub-units. Mass spectral analyses showed this to be a complex hexasaccharide carbohydrate with structural similarities to the components of plant cell walls. This is the first report of a host generated hexasaccharide which is capable of stimulating the germination of resting spores of P. brassicae. The implications for environmentally benign control of clubroot are discussed briefly...|$|E
40|$|The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC 2) gene is {{a central}} {{embryonic}} regulator that serves critical roles both early and late during embryo development. LEC 2 {{is required for the}} maintenance of suspensor morphology, specification of cotyledon identity, progression through the maturation phase, and suppression of <b>premature</b> <b>germination.</b> We cloned the LEC 2 gene {{on the basis of its}} chromosomal position and showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B 3 domain, a DNA-binding motif unique to plants that is characteristic of several transcription factors. We showed that LEC 2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development, consistent with our finding that LEC 2 shares greatest similarity with the B 3 domain transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds, VIVIPAROUS 1 /ABA INSENSITIVE 3 and FUSCA 3. Ectopic, postembryonic expression of LEC 2 in transgenic plants induces the formation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures and often confers embryonic characteristics to seedlings. Together, these results suggest that LEC 2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes a cellular environment sufficient to initiate embryo development...|$|E
40|$|The Bacillus anthracis {{endospore}} loses resistance properties during germination {{when its}} cortex peptidoglycan is degraded by germination-specific lytic enzymes (GSLEs). Although this event normally employs several GSLEs for complete cortex removal, the SleB protein alone can facilitate enough cortex hydrolysis to produce vulnerable spores. As {{a means to}} better understand its enzymatic function, SleB was overexpressed, purified, and tested in vitro for depolymerization of cortex by measurement of optical density loss and the solubilization of substrate. Its ability to bind peptidoglycan was also investigated. SleB functions independently as a lytic transglycosylase on both intact and fragmented cortex. Most of the muropeptide products that SleB generates are large and are potential substrates for other GSLEs present in the spore. Study of a truncated protein revealed that SleB has two domains. The N-terminal domain is required for stable peptidoglycan binding, while the C-terminal domain is the region of peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity. The C-terminal domain also exhibits dependence on cortex containing muramic-δ-lactam in order to carry out hydrolysis. As the conditions and limitations for SleB activity are further elucidated, they will enable the development of treatments that stimulate <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> of B. anthracis spores, greatly simplifying decontamination measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{germination}} of caryopses of M-T 3 Triticale generation, {{which were}} freshly harvested in different growth and developmental phases has been studied. A significant {{influence of the}} abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation on the increment of number of germinating caryopses has been found. Already {{in the first phase}} af the embryogenesis considerable stimulating effects of kinetin and gibberellin-A 3 (GA 3) on the germination of embryos which were isolated from freshly collected grains have been shown. When both stimulators were used together marked synergetic reaction occurred. It has been also determined that in the initial period of embryogensis <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> occurs, to a higher extent, under the action of cytokinins than! Whether in the further phases of the caryopse development, when embryo develop mainly through the cell elongation, mostly gibberellins seem to be responsible for the activation of germination processes. The more mature were seeds the quicker germinated whole caryopses and embryos isolated from them at different ripeness, after 3 -month storage. The highest stimulation of germination by phytohormones has been found for the most mature caryopses. The action of gibberellic acid has been particulary strong...|$|E
40|$|Embryonic {{regulators}} LEC 2 (LEAFY COTYLEDON 2) and FUS 3 (FUSCA 3) {{are involved}} in multiple aspects of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed development, including repression of leaf traits and <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> and activation of seed storage protein genes. In this study, we show that gibberellin (GA) hormone biosynthesis is regulated by LEC 2 and FUS 3 pathways. The level of bioactive GAs is increased in immature seeds of lec 2 and fus 3 mutants relative to wild-type level. In addition, we show that the formation of ectopic trichome cells on lec 2 and fus 3 embryos is a GA-dependent process as in true leaves, suggesting that the GA pathway is misactivated in embryonic mutants. We next demonstrate that the GA-biosynthesis gene AtGA 3 ox 2, which encodes the key enzyme AtGA 3 ox 2 that catalyzes the conversion of inactive to bioactive GAs, is ectopically activated in embryos of the two mutants. Interestingly, both B-glucuronidase reporter gene expression and in situ hybridization indicate that FUS 3 represses AtGA 3 ox 2 expression mainly in epidermal cells of embryo axis, which is distinct from AtGA 3 ox 2 pattern at germination. Finally, we show that the FUS 3 protein physically interacts with two RY elements (CATGCATG) present in the AtGA 3 ox 2 promoter. This work suggests that GA biosynthesis is directly controlled by embryonic regulators during Arabidopsis embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} the plant embryo is interrupted during the seed maturation processes which results in a dormant seed. The embryo continues development after germination when it grows into a seedling. The embryo growth phase starts after morphogenesis and ends when the embryo fills the seed sac. Very {{little is known about}} the processes regulating this phase. We describe mutants that affect embryo growth in two sequential developmental stages. Firstly, embryo growth arrest is regulated by the FUS 3 /LEC type genes, as mutations in these genes cause a continuation of growth in immature embryos. Secondly, a later stage of embryo dormancy is regulated by ABI 3 and abscisic acid; abi 3 and aba 1 mutants exhibit <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> only after embryos mature. Mutations affecting both developmental stages result in an additive phenotype and double mutants are highly viviparous. Embryo growth arrest is regulated by cell division activities in both the embryo and the endosperm, which are gradually switched off at the mature embryo stage. In the fus 3 /lec mutants, however, cell division in both the embryo and endosperm is not arrested, but rather is prolonged throughout seed maturation. Furthermore ectopic cell division occurs in seedlings. Our results indicate that seed dormancy is secured via at least two sequential developmental processes: embryo growth arrest, which is regulated by cell division and embryo dormancy...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial spores remain dormant {{and highly}} {{resistant}} to environmental stress until they germinate. Completion of germination requires {{the degradation of}} spore cortex peptidoglycan by germination-specific lytic enzymes (GSLEs). Bacillus anthracis has four GSLEs: CwlJ 1, CwlJ 2, SleB, and SleL. In this study, the cooperative action of all four GSLEs in vivo was investigated by combining in-frame deletion mutations to generate all possible double, triple, and quadruple GSLE mutant strains. Analyses of mutant strains during spore germination and outgrowth combined observations of optical density loss, colony-producing ability, and quantitative identification of spore cortex fragments. The lytic transglycosylase SleB alone can facilitate enough digestion to allow full spore viability and generates a variety of small and large cortex fragments. CwlJ 1 is also sufficient to allow completion of nutrient-triggered germination independently and {{is a major factor}} in Ca 2 +-dipicolinic acid (DPA) -triggered germination, but its enzymatic activity remains unidentified because its products are large and not readily released from the spore's integuments. CwlJ 2 contributes the least to overall cortex digestion but plays a subsidiary role in Ca 2 +-DPA-induced germination. SleL is an N-acetylglucosaminidase that plays the major role in hydrolyzing the large products of other GSLEs into small, rapidly released muropeptides. As the roles of these enzymes in cortex degradation become clearer, they will be targets for methods to stimulate <b>premature</b> <b>germination</b> of B. anthracis spores, greatly simplifying decontamination measures...|$|E
40|$|The exosporium is the {{outermost}} layer of spores of Bacillus cereus and its close relatives Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis. For these pathogens, {{it represents the}} surface layer that makes initial contact with the host. To date, only the BclA glycoprotein {{has been described as}} a component of the exosporium; this paper defines 10 more tightly associated proteins from the exosporium of B. cereus ATCC 10876, identified by N-terminal sequencing of proteins from purified, washed exosporium. Likely coding sequences were identified from the incomplete genome sequence of B. anthracis or B. cereus ATCC 14579, and the precise corresponding sequence from B. cereus ATCC 10876 was defined by PCR and sequencing. Eight genes encode likely structural components (exsB, exsC, exsD, exsE, exsF, exsG, exsJ, and cotE). Several proteins of the exosporium are related to morphogenetic and outer spore coat proteins of B. subtilis, but most do not have homologues in B. subtilis. ExsE is processed from a larger precursor, and the CotE homologue appears to have been C-terminally truncated. ExsJ contains a domain of GXX collagen-like repeats, like the BclA exosporium protein of B. anthracis. Although most of the exosporium genes are scattered on the genome, bclA and exsF are clustered in a region flanking the rhamnose biosynthesis operon; rhamnose is part of the sugar moiety of spore glycoproteins. Two enzymes, alanine racemase and nucleoside hydrolase, are tightly adsorbed to the exosporium layer; they could metabolize small molecule germinants and may reduce the sensitivity of spores to these, limiting <b>premature</b> <b>germination...</b>|$|E
30|$|The life {{of plant}} is cycled through seed germination, {{seedling}} growth, organ development, and senescence. In this cycle, AP 2 /ERF TF also displays their regulatory roles for shaping many architectural traits. In {{the process of}} seed germination, SlERF 2 positively improve transcription level of marker gene, mannanase 2, resulting in a stimulation of <b>premature</b> <b>germination,</b> and enhance hook formation of darkgrown (Pirrello et al. 2006). In the progression of plant growth and development, AINTEGUMENTA and AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE 6 are related to flower organ growth and ovule development in Arabidopsis (Elliott et al. 1996; Jofuku et al. 1994; Klucher et al. 1996; Krizek 2009; Mizukami and Fischer 2000). Rice ethylene-response AP 2 /ERF factor OsEATB restricts internode elongation by down-regulating ent-kaurene synthase A, leading to a reduction of rice plant height and panicle length at maturity (Qi et al. 2011). In contrast, AtERF 1, AtDREB 1, and TINYT present their ability in dwarfing plant height (Liu et al. 1998; Solano et al. 1998; Wilson et al. 1996). Moreover, NtERF 3, AtERF 4 and AtERF 8 had {{been found to be}} associated with plant aging (Koyama et al. 2013). Of these three genes, AtERF 4 and AtERF 8 belonged to class II ERFs in Arabidopsis, which can accelerate precocious leaf senescence by targeting the EPITHIOSPECIFIER PROTEIN/EPITHIOSPECIFYING SENESCENCE REGULATOR gene and regulating the expression of many genes related to senescence (Koyama et al. 2013). In addition, AP 2 /ERF TF is involved in regulating metabolite productions, such as chlorophyll, wax and cutin. The present evidences show that CitERF 13 is negative regulator for chlorophyll degradation during Citrus fruit degreening by directly binding to the CitPPH promoter and enhancing the activity of a metabolite of pheophorbide hydrolase (Yin et al. 2016). AtWIN 1, AtSHN, and HvNUD could increase an accumulation of wax and cutin on the epidermis by regulating a lipid biosynthesis pathway (Aharoni et al. 2004; Broun et al. 2004; Taketa et al. 2008). Obviously, the functions of these AP 2 /ERF TFs are distinctly elucidated in these reported traits, but the regulatory roles of other members should be further explored in unknown properties in future.|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} component of development is the accumulation of specific metabolites in a temporal and tissue-specific manner. The growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA), which accumulates at a specific time during seed development, is required for seed maturation and prevents the premature developmental switch from dormancy to germination ABA accumulates differently in two tissues of the seed; levels in the embryo are several-fold {{higher than in the}} endosperm and the temporal accumulation of ABA is also different between these tissues. To begin to understand how ABA accumulation is regulated during seed development, the regulation of ABA biosynthesis was investigated. The approach taken was to examine the expression of the biosynthetic enzyme, phytoene desaturase (PDS), which catalyzes a regulated step in ABA synthesis in several other organisms (Bramley, 1985, Sandmann et al., 1989, Hugueney et al., 1992 and Giuliano et al., 1993). Unlike ABA accumulation, PDS transcript and protein levels were higher in the endosperm than in the embryo. The spatial difference in PDS levels did correlate with levels of the pathway intermediate, beta-carotene, suggesting that PDS may control the synthesis of ABA precursors while subsequent enzymes may regulate ABA accumulation. The temporal expression of Pds was also unrelated to ABA accumulation. In the endosperm, transcript levels were initially high and declined during desiccation while protein levels remained high throughout development. In the embryo, transcript levels were low and constant while protein levels declined. There are several maize mutants (viviparous mutants) disrupted in ABA biosynthesis, resulting in decreased levels of ABA and <b>premature</b> <b>germination.</b> Analysis of the Pds allele and transcript in the viviparous- 5 mutant showed that the gene contains multiple insertions and deletions, giving rise to a larger transcript. In addition, the 55 kDa PDS protein was not detected in the vp 5 mutant by immunoblot analysis, indicating that the vp 5 phenotype results from a mutation at the PDS locus. To determine whether the wild type protein encoded by the ABA mutant, vp 2, or the pathway intermediate, lycopene, regulate PDS, transcript and protein levels were compared in wild type and mutant (vp 2 and vp 7, respectively) seeds. The levels of PDS were not significantly different in vp 2 or vp 7 wild type and mutant seeds, suggesting that neither the VP 2 protein nor lycopene regulate PDS at the steady-state transcript or protein level...|$|E
