40|$|This is a {{study of}} the letters from His Majesty the King to the county {{governor}} of Gotland in 1735. In the Age of Liberty the king had limited power. Royal decisions were made with the Council of the Realm where the King only had the advantage of having two votes and a casting vote. Furthermore, the Council had to act according to the decisions of the Estates of Parliament, if at least three of the four Estates were in agreement. The duties of the county governor were set out in a detailed instruction of which the most recent version was issued in 1734. The county governors also received tasks in laws and royal ordinances I have examined in full the thirty letters from the King that have been entered in the diary of the county secretariat of Gotland in 1735. My aim has been to examine the nature of the letters, what kind of action that was expected of the county governor and how the letters compared to the County Governor Instruction. Although the letters ostensibly came from the King, there are frequent reminders that the Council of the Realm and the Estates were those who had the real power. Most of the letters were circular letters. Presumably letters with the same contents were sent to all county governors. About a third of the letters had <b>printed</b> <b>enclosures</b> which the county governor was asked to make public. In some cases the Estates had first {{sent a letter to the}} King in Council asking them to make a certain decision. Only one of the letters was without doubt sent only the county governor in Gotland and this was also the only letter which had a reply sent back to the King. The county governor was expected to respond to the letters, which he usually did by sending information to one of the civil service departments, by communicating ordinances to the public, or by taking other measures. Two of the letters contained instructions that could be interpreted as additions to the County Governor Instruction. On the whole, the correspondence for the year of 1735 covered all the main parts of the county governor’s responsibilities...|$|R
40|$|Bird and bat {{collisions}} {{with wind}} turbine blades are an occurrence which are extremely variable in frequency. With the expansion of wind farms, determining the true quantity of collisions and the species involved is imperative for preventing ecological damage. Explored in this thesis is a blade mounted camera for wirelessly transmitting a video stream to provide an optimal viewing location for capturing avian and bat strikes. An early version of computer vision software for detecting avian flybys and collisions was developed, along with initial design and testing of a blade-tip tracking program. Object recognition using a cascading classifier, and a backup tracking system provides a potential method for determining bird presence {{and the likelihood of}} collision. The ability of the program to remove repeating false-positive instances and strengthen the detection system in the process, provides a strong platform for avian detection from a blade mounted camera. Hardware validation was conducted to ensure the selected components will function as needed. A 3 D <b>printed</b> on-blade <b>enclosure</b> was designed as a housing for the camera, transmitter, and power supply...|$|R

This paper presents a novel approach for design and fabrication of biocompatible silicone enclosures for implantable medical microdevices. The approach involves design and formation of a 3 D model of the enclosure using a computer-aided design software tool, followed by 3 D <b>printing</b> of the <b>enclosures</b> using a bioplotter. Three different implantable enclosure designs are presented. The fabrication of the three enclosures is given. An evaluation of the suitability of the enclosures for implantation of a deep brain stimulation microdevice is discussed through submersion and operation tests.

If they were national advertisers or had a product that can be profitably advertised to the consumer, she talked Agency service — the planning and placing of the copy in newspapers, magazines, farm papers, or other mediums, {{as the case may}} require. If they were users of catalogues, booklets, circulars, and special advertising literature, she could execute that part of the work perfectly. With the modern equipment of her company. Nirdlinger could handle a simple envelope and <b>enclosure</b> <b>printed</b> in one color, or an elaborate trade catalogue of three hundred pages. She had arranged and delivered complete catalogues, illustrating men's and women's fashions, shoes, stoves, machinery, fire-brick, toys, jewelry, automobiles and beautiful designed booklets on numerous subjects.|$|R
40|$|Description of {{the work}} Synapsense is a performance/installation work that investigates {{personal}} and interpersonal spatial awareness using contemporary dance and audience participation. The work consists of a space configured {{with a combination of}} floor and ceiling mounted load cells attached to ropes, and conductive touch plates arranged on the floor and walls. As participants pull and climb on the ropes, the load cells convert the tension on the ropes into control data which determines musical and lighting outcomes within the space. By making exposed skin contact simultaneously with two or more plates, participants can also trigger musical elements. The plates are arranged in a way that encourages participants to make touch connections between each other in order to reach distant plates and realise the full sonic possibilities of the space. Research Background The project aims to heighten the awareness of one’s own physical presence and the presence of others in space, through an environment that invites the exploration of the intersections between movement, touch, light, and music. The project was a transdisciplinary collaboration between QUT researchers and students from several disciplinary backgrounds, and emerged from the 2017 Ars Electronica Futurelab Academy QUT program. The musical and lighting environments, technical control systems, and performative dimensions of the space were created as a collaboration between QUT researchers. This environment was then inhabited by students who choreographed a series of short dance works that highlighted the interactive components of the space. This created an awareness of the space that encouraged the audience {{to become part of the}} developing dance work and explore interactive possibilities with the performers. Research Contribution The project contributes to the field of performance research by examining how musical forms can be developed in response to collaborative interactions between performers and audience members. Synapsense also required the design and fabrication of custom hardware to convert the Wheatstone force readings produced by the load cells, and the binary conductive signal from the touch plates into scalable Open Sound Control (OSC) messages (1) suitable for network broadcast. The custom hardware was originally prototyped using the Arduino platform (2) in collaboration with performers and composers. The prototypes were then transitioned to a final design that used AVR microcontrollers (3) in custom 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>enclosures.</b> This process situated the project in a genuinely transdisciplinary space at the intersection of dance, design, electronic engineering, and interactive music composition. Research Significance Synapsense was chosen to be a work in the opening night program of the 2017 Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria. The Ars Electronica festival is the world’s premiere media arts festival, with 2017 attendance figures of approximately 100, 000 people. Repeat performances were included in each day of the program and also in the closing night artist’s function. High levels of audience participation were observed for every performance. Of particular note was the varied demographic of the audience. Within a single performance, participants regularly ranged from small children, through to curious adults; casual observers, through to experienced media artists. The inclusion of Synapsense in the festival program also strengthened links between QUT and the Ars Electronic Futurelab Academy, and drew invitations to present the work from numerous other research institutes. The work also highlighted several areas for further enquiry related to how to increase the scale and richness of audience led gestural control over audio and visual components. 1. Open Sound Control is a communication protocol developed by researchers at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) 2. Arduino is an open source electronics platform designed for rapid prototyping 3. AVR is a microcontroller development environment for integrated electronic...|$|R
