25|$|The {{product of}} the {{polymerization}} process is unmodified PVC. Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, <b>processing</b> <b>aids,</b> impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, blowing agents and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments. The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product {{is controlled by the}} cost performance requirements of the end use specification (underground pipe, window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements). Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.|$|E

40|$|The use of rioe bran oil as a <b>processing</b> <b>aid</b> in styrene {{butadiene}} rubber has already been Investigated in this laboratory. Based on the encouraging results obtained from this study, we thought also of trying this oil in polar rubbers like nitrile butadiene (NBR) and polychloroprene (CR). In this study an attempt is made to see whether rice bran oil which is a natural product, devoid of any toxic effects, can function as co-activator, antioxidant and as a <b>processing</b> <b>aid</b> in nitrile and as <b>processing</b> <b>aid</b> and antioxidant in polychloroprene rubber. The plasticizer, co-activator and antioxidant properties are compared with DOP, stearic acid and styrenated phenol, respectively, in the NBR vulcanization system and antioxidant, stearic acid and aromatic oil are replaced by the oil in the potychloroprene system. The mixes were evaluated for cure character-istics. Scorch time, cure time and the cure rate index values have shown that this oil can effectively replace plasticizer, co-activator and antioxidant form NBR mixes and <b>processing</b> <b>aid</b> and antioxidant form CR systems. The evaluation of mechanical properties and ageing studies of the valcanizates also indicate that rice bran oil {{can be used as}} a multi-purpose additive in these rubbers.

50|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to demonstrate the differences between implicit and explicit memory. One such method of differentiation is revealed through the depth-of-processing effect. In a 1981 study by Jacoby and Dallas, subjects were first given a list of words and asked to engage with them in some way. For some of these words, {{subjects were asked to}} interact with the words in a relatively superficial way, such as counting the number of letters in each given word. For one set of words, subjects performed tasks that required elaborative processing (denotation), such as answering questions about a word's meaning. They were then given a test that assessed their ability to recognize whether they had seen the word in the studying part of the experiment. Because depth of <b>processing</b> <b>aids</b> in the explicit memory of a word, subjects showed better memory for the words that required elaborative processing on this test. When implicit memory was tested through flashing words on a screen and asking subjects to identify them, however, the priming effect was extremely similar for the words that involved elaborative processing as compared to the words that did not. This suggests that implicit memory does not rely on depth of processing as explicit memory does.|$|E
