5000|$|Palestine {{refugees}} claim a Palestinian {{right of}} return. In {{lack of an}} own country, their claim is based on Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which declares that [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} leave any country including his own, and to return to his country", although {{it has been argued that}} the term only applies to citizens or nationals of that country. Although all Arab League members at the time- Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen- voted against the resolution, they also cite the non-binding article 11 of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which [...] "Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return ...." [...] However it is currently a matter of dispute whether Resolution 194 referred only to the estimated 50,000 remaining Palestine refugees from the 1948 Palestine War, or additionally to their UNRWA-registered 4,950,000 descendants. The Palestinian National Authority supports this claim, and has been prepared to negotiate its implementation at the various peace talks. Both Fatah and Hamas hold a strong position for a claimed right of return, with Fatah being prepared to give ground on the issue while Hamas is not.However, a report in Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper in which Abdullah Muhammad Ibrahim Abdullah, the Palestinian ambassador to Lebanon and the chairman of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council's</b> Political and Parliamentary Affairs committees, said the proposed future Palestinian state would not be issuing Palestinian passports to UNRWA Palestine refugees - even refugees living in the West Bank and Gaza.|$|R

During the talks in March 2006, Lavrov called on Hamas to comply with the earlier commitments signed by the PLO, and he reiterated those requirements. Hamas promised to respect [...] "the authority and competencies" [...] of Abbas. In an interview in the Austrian daily Kurier, senior Hamas official Aziz Dweik answered on the question if a two-state solution was feasible: [...] "If Israel changes its attitudes toward Palestinians, if it does so much as soften its occupation practice, everything would change. Israel has to do the first step." [...] On March 7, 2006 Russia expressed hope that Hamas would consider supporting the Road map for peace and the peace plan proposed by Saudi Arabia." [...] The invitation and the talks have caused controversy wherein Russia's intentions in changing its views towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were questioned by commentators in the United States especially among the neoconservatives.|$|R

Haniyeh has refused to accept his dismissal and has accused Abbas of participating in a US-led plot to overthrow him. Experts in Palestinian law and independent members of the PLC have questioned the legality of the Fayyad government. According to the Palestinian Basic Law, the President can dismiss the Prime Minister but the dismissed government continues to function as a caretaker government until a new government is formed and receives a vote of confidence from an absolute majority of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council.</b> The Hamas-majority PLC has never met to confirm the Fayyad government.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} the U.S. re-established public {{security}} assistance to the PA, Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton was appointed {{to take over the}} USSC mission, and in January 2006, PA parliamentary elections gave Hamas a majority of seats in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> (PLC), which had previously been dominated by the Fatah party. Because Hamas is considered by the U.S. government to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization, it is illegal for U.S. funds to be used to support them even {{as part of a broader}} organization like the PA. Though the elections were originally supported by the U.S. government, the U.S. encouraged President Abbas to retain control over the government by consolidating his power. The U.S. contributed to this by transferring money for security assistance directly to Abbas and Fatah rather than through the PA. The Presidential Guard, the security forces for protecting President Abbas, were the primary recipients of the U.S. support.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2007, Abbas {{dissolved}} the Hamas-led {{unity government}} of Haniyeh, {{declared a state}} of emergency, and appointed Salam Fayyad in his place. This followed action by Hamas armed forces to take control of Palestinian Authority positions controlled by Fatah militias. The appointment of Fayyad to replace Haniyeh has been challenged as illegal, because under the Palestinian Basic Law, the president may dismiss a sitting prime minister, but may not appoint a replacement without the approval of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council.</b> According to the law, until a new prime minister is thus appointed, the outgoing prime minister heads a caretaker government. Fayyad's appointment was never placed before, or approved by the Legislative Council. For this reason, Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister has continued to operate in Gaza, and is recognised by a large number of Palestinians as the legitimate acting prime minister. Anis al-Qasem, a constitutional lawyer who drafted the Basic Law, is among those who publicly declared Abbas's appointment of Fayyad to be illegal.|$|E

Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel has no right to exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E
