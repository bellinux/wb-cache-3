It has <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> and exercise electrical repellent force. Perhaps {{you do not}} know what that means, so I will explain more fully. When any missile, such as a bullet, sword or lance, approaches your person, its rush through the air will arouse the repellent force of which I speak, and this force, being more powerful than the projective force, will arrest the flight of the missile and throw it back again. Therefore nothing can touch your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness, and you will be safe from all ordinary weapons. When wearing this Garment you will find it unnecessary to use the electric tube except on rare occasions. Never allow revenge or animosity to influence your conduct. Men may threaten, but they can not injure you, so you must remember that they do not possess your mighty advantages, and that, because of your strength, you should bear with them patiently." ...|$|E

When some selected businesses get richer and richer marginalised workers continuously are confronted with the grave issue of Alienation. It is the author’s contention here to highlight the inadequacy of Industrial Psychology, the capitalist framework designed to deal with Alienation through a comprehensive discussion of Marxist principles and Industrial Psychology-proper. The paper will argue showing the evolution of Industrial Psychology as a distinct academic discipline that the persisting problem of alienation will continue to exist until political solutions are provided for wider class issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze angular velocities of the hip and shoulders in the transverse plane and resultant linear velocity of the ball during a handball power serve. There has been little research of any type in court handball and no known research reports involving the biomechanics of handball. Eighteen trained, competitive handball players, from the professional division to the B class amateur division, served 10 legal serves in a mock court setup. The serve patterns were digitized and angular velocities of hip and shoulder rotation were compared to ball velocities. The primary findings showed that hip rotation preceded shoulder rotation, the shoulders rotated at a higher angular velocity than the hips (429. 796 deg/sec ?? 154. 067, 801. 237 deg/sec ?? 130. 254 respectively), and better players achieved higher maximum and average linear ball velocities. Hip rotation was not significantly correlated with ball velocity, but shoulder rotation had a significant positive correlation (r =. 206) to ball velocity. This study is the first to confirm the kinetic chain pattern within the handball <b>power</b> serve and <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> kinematic data on handball power serves...|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s and 1890s, the Virginia Mennonites {{experienced}} a tremendous change. The Mennonites in Virginia had, in large part, adopted the English language, and Sunday schools had become popular. Around this same time, John F. Funk and John Coffman (whose sister {{was married to}} Virginia Bishop Lewis J. Heatwole) became more influential in the Mennonite community. The catalyst for change was the liberal Bishop Lewis Heatwole. He became the sole bishop of the Middle District in 1894. Conservative {{members of the community}} had concerns about this consolidation of <b>power</b> and began <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> a number of charges against Bishop Lewis Heatwole. The rift intensified with the expulsion of conservative Bishop Samuel Heatwole and two other men in 1898. Then, on March 31, 1901, a conservative group of 71 members, organized around Bishop Samuel Heatwole, was disowned. This disowned group continued to function. In fact, in 1902, bishops from Indiana and Pennsylvania came to Virginia to perform communion and baptism among the expelled group. John Dan Wenger (1871 - 1967) was ordained as a minister for this new Old Order Mennonite group in the same year.|$|R

The derivatives revolution has shattered the “atom of property” well beyond what was originally imagined in 1932 by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} of self-appraisal and social power, {{for a group of}} individuals who discuss and form opinions. We consider a modification of the recently proposed DeGroot-Friedkin (DF) model, in which the opinion formation process takes place on the same timescale as the reflected appraisal process; we call this new model the single-timescale DF model. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the equilibria and convergence properties of the model for the settings of irreducible and reducible influence networks. For the setting of irreducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model has the same behavior as the original DF model, that is, it predicts among other things that the social power ranking among individuals is asymptotically equal to their centrality ranking, that social <b>power</b> tends <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> {{at the top of the}} centrality ranking hierarchy, and that an autocratic (resp., democratic) power structure arises when the centrality scores are maximally nonuniform (resp., uniform). For the setting of reducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model behaves differently from the original DF model in two ways. First, an individual, who corresponds to a reducible node in a reducible influence network, can keep all social power in the single-timescale DF model if the initial condition does so, whereas its social power asymptotically vanishes in the original DF model. Second, when the associated network has multiple sinks, the two models behave very differently: the original DF model has a single globally-attractive equilibrium, whereas any partition of social power among the sinks is allowable at equilibrium in the single-timescale DF model.

25|$|Tory {{propaganda}} {{was built}} in part on a foundation of anti-Dutch and anti-Habsburg xenophobia, but Britain was being drained of its resources, and many thought the country had borne {{too much of the}} burden pursuing their allies' interests while being denied any advantage for itself. Domestically, Oxford had the backing of the Queen, the war-weary public, the House of Commons; support from the House of Lords was secured by the expedient of the Queen creating 12 new Tory peers. Nevertheless, the Whigs and some Tory Lords refused to accept the possibility of Philip V remaining in Spain, and persisted in supporting the Habsburg bloc as a counterbalance to powerful France. To others, Charles VI's succession as Holy Roman Emperor and inheritor of the Habsburg lands meant supporting his claim to the Spanish succession had long ceased to be politically desirable. The danger of too much <b>power</b> <b>accumulating</b> <b>to</b> Austria had convinced many, including Daniel Defoe, the chief Whig propagandist, to re-think Grand Strategy.|$|R
