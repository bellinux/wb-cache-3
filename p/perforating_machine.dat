50|$|In April 1948, the British {{discontinued}} all postal services. On Friday, May 14, 1948, Israel declared independence. On Sunday morning, {{less than}} 48 hours later, {{the new state}} issued its first stamps.There was virtually no paper for printing stamps and no appropriate printing presses or <b>perforating</b> <b>machines.</b> Even {{the name of the}} country had not yet been finalized. Nevertheless, Doar Ivri ("Hebrew Post") stamps appeared immediately after the declaration of independence, and went on sale at postal branches throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|Coil {{waste is}} a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or {{unusable}} printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on rotary presses, a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because rotary press printing slightly stretches an image.|$|E
5000|$|Archer then {{abandoned}} {{this approach}} {{in favour of}} perforation, a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes. In 1848 Archer patented his perforation machine which worked on the [...] "stroke" [...] principle. The arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation, and this became known as [...] "comb" [...] perforation. Perforation trials were conducted in 1849 and 1850 {{under the auspices of}} the British Government and stamps from these trials were first issued towards the end of 1850. The Archer machine proved the viability of the process but never entered service. Archer's patent for his <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> (no. 12,340 of 1848, dated May 23, 1849) was purchased for £4,000 in June 1853. New machines based on Archer's principles were constructed by David Napier and Son Ltd; these were initially used in October 1853 for revenue stamps and from January 1854 for postage stamps.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to The London Philatelist, Ted Proud has {{referred}} to two other dealers, known only as Dealer A and Dealer B who carried out similar activities and used to co-operate. Proud has written that Dealer A had a stock of printers blocks of cancels used to illustrate magazine articles and books who would also cancel unused stamps. He has also written that Dealer B, with whom Madame Joseph unsuccessfully tried to start a stamp [...] "repairing" [...] factory, also had a stock of bogus date-stamps that he said was larger than Madame Joseph's. He is also said {{to have had a}} <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> which was made by his brother who was a Swiss industrialist. Proud has commented that to say that Madame Joseph's operations were shrouded in secrecy would be an exaggeration and that her business was well known in the stamp trade at the time as one of selling [...] "repaired" [...] stamps with a cancellation service as an extra feature.|$|E
5000|$|The New Zealand Post Office {{continued}} {{to operate as}} a government department until 1987, when postal services were re-organized as New Zealand Post, a state-owned enterprise. Postage stamps have been issued in New Zealand since around 18 to 20 July 1855 with the [...] "Chalon head" [...] stamps figuring Queen Victoria. The design {{was based on a}} full face portrait of the Queen in her state robes {{at the time of her}} coronation in 1837, by Alfred Edward Chalon. The stamps were initially hand cut from sheets, but from 1862 on, these sheets started being fed through automatic <b>perforating</b> <b>machines.</b> The Chalon heads were used until 1874 when the lithographed sideface stamps in various designs replaced them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963 {{he spent}} {{several months in}} a {{research}} internship in the United States, during which visited several universities and industrial plants, and established contacts with leading American theorists and practitioners in the field industrial engineering. After returning from the USA he created a laboratory equipped with counting and <b>perforating</b> Hollerith <b>machines,</b> accounting and billing equipment, equipment for standardization work, psychological test instruments, equipment for production planning and a then state-of-the-art UMC-1 computer. From 1957 to 1962 he was half full-time researcher at the Institute of Machine Industry Organization [...] "Orgmasz". In 1965 he received the title of Professor {{in the field of}} economics. In the period 1958-1969 he was the promoter of 14 defended doctoral dissertations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the polymer}} {{electrolyte}} fuel cell (PEFC), the electrolyte membranes are chemically deteriorated by H 2 O 2 which are reacted during operation. Also, the electrolyte membranes are suffered a cyclic stress caused by starting and shut-down operation. Because, during {{the operation of}} a PEFC, a water elongates the electrolyte membranes, and during the stoppage operation, the membranes are contracted under waterless condition. For accumulation of these chemically and/or mechanically damage, quality of the membranes are gradually worsened. In this study, to study a degradation distribution on the electrolyte membranes, a <b>perforating</b> testing <b>machine</b> was newly developed. By using this testing machine, {{we can make a}} “degradation map” for visualizing a degree of degradation in the cell of a PEFC...|$|R
50|$|Duo-Art {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{reproducing}} piano technologies of the early 20th century, the others being American Piano Company (Ampico), introduced in 1913 too, and Welte-Mignon in 1905. These technologies flourished at that time because of the poor quality of the early Phonograph (Gramophone in Britain). Between 1913 and 1925 a number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Ignace Paderewski, Josef Hofmann, Percy Grainger, Teresa Carreño, Aurelio Giorni, Robert Armbruster and Vladimir Horowitz, recorded for Duo-Art, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th-century and early 20th-century aesthetic and musical practice. The recording process - using a piano wired to a <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> - was unable to capture the pianist's dynamics automatically. These were added by a recording technician, who manipulated hand controls to notate the dynamics onto the recording 'master'. Thus, post-recording editing was required to produce the finished performance - usually a joint effort by the recording technician and the pianist themself, who approved the final product. Thus, these recordings do represent the overall style of these great artists and are a good representation of their live performances.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1854 a [...] "rotary process" [...] was {{patented}} by William Bemrose and Henry Howe Bemrose. The Bemrose machine {{was designed as}} a rouletting machine. As such, it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> by George C. Howard of Toppan Carpenter, stamp printers for the American Government. Both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then, but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century. The key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes; if too far apart, the stamps will not separate easily, and the stamps are likely to tear, but if too close, the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling. In a few cases the size of the holes has been a factor. In the case of certain stamps produced by Australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets (coil stamps) a pattern can be seen on the stamp's short side of two small, ten large and two small holes.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{machinery}} used {{in public}} works {{is a source}} of noise and vibration that generate annoyance to the surrounding residential buildings. Thus, prediction of noise and vibration levels that will be induced by these construction activities is crucial for the construction project planning. The dynamic characterization of construction machinery as sources of ground borne vibration can be used for predicting vibration levels in the nearby buildings to the construction area. In this paper, a methodology for representing these ground-borne vibration sources using a set of hamonic point loads applied to the ground is presented. The method uses the method of fundamental solutions to determine a configuration of harmonic point loads which represents the original induced vibration field, obtained by an experimental measurement. To reduce the computational effort, a fast method for obtaining the response of the ground to multiple harmonic point loads is used. An example of the application of the method for the case of a <b>perforating</b> <b>machine</b> is also presented. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} nucleus {{is surrounded}} by a protective nuclear envelope, which is <b>perforated</b> by trafficking <b>machines</b> termed nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPCs are the sole mediators of exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Small molecules pass through the NPCs unchallenged; however, large macro-molecules are excluded unless chaperoned across by transport factors. Here, we suggest a model, termed ‘virtual gating’, to explain the mechanism of this rapid and selective macromolecular trafficking. In eukaryotes, the double-membraned nuclear envelope (NE) separates the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic com-partments, sequestering the genetic material in the nucleus. This provides the cell with the opportunity to control access to its DNA, a defining feature of eukaryotes...|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to Vaucanson's arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of Vaucanson's <b>perforated</b> 'barrel'. Jacquard's <b>machine</b> also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with Vaucanson's double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.|$|R
50|$|The toy piano, {{introduced}} in the 19th century, is a small piano-like instrument, that generally uses round metal rods to produce sound, rather than strings. The US Library of Congress recognizes the toy piano as a unique instrument with the subject designation, Toy Piano Scores: M175 T69. In 1863, Henri Fourneaux invented the player piano, which plays itself from a piano roll. A <b>machine</b> <b>perforates</b> a performance recording into rolls of paper, and the player piano replays the performance using pneumatic devices. Modern equivalents of the player piano include the Bösendorfer CEUS, Yamaha Disklavier and QRS Pianomation, using solenoids and MIDI rather than pneumatics and rolls. A silent piano is an acoustic piano having an option to silence the strings {{by means of an}} interposing hammer bar. They are designed for private silent practice, to avoid disturbing others. Edward Ryley invented the transposing piano in 1801. This rare instrument has a lever under the keyboard as to move the keyboard relative to the strings so a pianist can play in a familiar key while the music sounds in a different key.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the human needs in the prepress and postpress areas of the graphic arts industries in selected midwest states. A needs assessment instrument was designed to achieve this purpose;A random sampling technique was utilized to select the sample size of 450 companies from the population of the printing companies in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin;A paired t-test analysis was done to determine if there existed a difference between the current need and the need in ten years for some production processes. The analysis showed that current need is greater than the need in ten years in paste-up and copy preparation and proof reading. Contrastingly, the need will be greater in ten years than currently in color stripping and masking, process color, scanner, hard cover binding by <b>machines,</b> <b>perforating,</b> embossing, laminating, perfect binding, saddle stitching, shrink wrapping, punching and foil stamping operations;A one-way analysis was applied to determine if a statistical significant difference existed between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes (large, medium, and small) and their opinions about competencies for new employees, graphic arts curricula adequacy, manpower needs, periodic conduction of manpower surveys and technology changes;The results of the analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and their opinions about the need for competencies for new employees and for graphic arts curricula to reflect technological changes. Also, there were no significant differences between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and their opinions about the manpower needs, changes and the need to conduct periodic manpower needs surveys to determine future manpower needs;However, the results showed that a significant difference existed between companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and technology changes in the graphic arts industry...|$|R
