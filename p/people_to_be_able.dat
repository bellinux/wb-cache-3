Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E

2500|$|The tools {{needed to}} make beats in the late 1970s were funk, soul, and other music genre records, record turntables, DJ mixers, audio consoles, and {{relatively}} inexpensive Portastudio-style multitrack recording devices. In the 1980s and 1990s, beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed, suchas samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. From the 1970s to the 2010s, various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments, such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks. To record the finished beats or beat tracks, beatmakers and producers {{use a variety of}} sound recording equipment, typically multitrack recorders. Digital Audio Workstations, also known as DAWs, became more common in the 2010s for producers. Some of the most used DAWs are Fruity Loops Studio, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools.
