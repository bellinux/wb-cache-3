Rather, the <b>prepared</b> <b>opium</b> is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed opium pipe which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a metal fitting to a long, cylindrical stem. A small [...] "pill" [...] of opium {{about the size of}} a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an opium lamp, a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. The smoker would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker's tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: According to statistics, opioid {{addiction}} {{is quite common}} in Iran. Pathologic dilatation of the Common Bile Duct (CBD) {{may be caused by}} mechanical obstruction or opioid consumption; the latter is especially common among chronic opium abusers. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between CBD diameter and addiction-related factors in opium users. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. A checklist, consisting of 18 items on demographic characteristics, type, administration route, and duration of opioid consumption, and type of biliary disease as indicated by Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), was prepared and completed via interview. The results of ERCP and abdominal ultrasonography of 40 addicted patients were gathered. Data were analyzed, using SPSS version 11. 5. P-value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In total, 31 (62 %) out of 50 patients were male, and the mean age of the subjects was 66 ± 12. 0 years. According to the findings, 46 (92 %) cases were addicted to opium and four (8 %) cases to laudanum (a solution <b>prepared</b> from <b>opium).</b> Among the addicted cases, 30 (75 %) used opium through inhalation, while 10 (25 %) cases used it orally. There was a significant relationship between the type of opioid and CBD diameter (P= 0. 03). However, no significant relationship was found between CBD diameter and the route of administration or opioid dose (P= 0. 6 and 0. 06, respectively). Conclusion: Opium used by addicts has various degrees of impurity. It can be concluded that higher opium purity induces more CBD dilatation, although further investigations are highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) is {{the source}} for several {{pharmaceutical}} benzylisoquinoline alkaloids including morphine, the codeine and sanguinarine. In response to treatment with a fungal elicitor, the biosynthesis and accumulation of sanguinarine is induced along with other plant defense responses in opium poppy cell cultures. The transcriptional induction of alkaloid metabolism in cultured cells provides an opportunity to identify components of this process via the integration of deep transcriptome and proteome databases generated using next-generation technologies. Results A cDNA library was <b>prepared</b> for <b>opium</b> poppy cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor for 10 h. Using 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing, 427, 369 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with an average length of 462 bp were generated. Assembly of these sequences yielded 93, 723 unigenes, of which 23, 753 were assigned Gene Ontology annotations. Transcripts encoding all known sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes were identified in the EST database, 5 of which were represented among the 50 most abundant transcripts. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of total protein extracts from cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor for 50 h facilitated the identification of 1, 004 proteins. Proteins were fractionated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and digested with trypsin prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Query of an opium poppy-specific EST database substantially enhanced peptide identification. Eight out of 10 known sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes and many relevant primary metabolic enzymes were represented in the peptide database. Conclusions The integration of deep transcriptome and proteome analyses provides an effective platform to catalogue the components of secondary metabolism, and to identify genes encoding uncharacterized enzymes. The establishment of corresponding transcript and protein databases generated by next-generation technologies in a system with a well-defined metabolite profile facilitates an improved linkage between genes, enzymes, and pathway components. The proteome database represents the most relevant alkaloid-producing enzymes, compared with the much deeper and more complete transcriptome library. The transcript database contained full-length mRNAs encoding most alkaloid biosynthetic enzymes, which is a key requirement for the functional characterization of novel gene candidates. </p...|$|R
50|$|War, {{economic}} instability, {{and poverty}} caused {{changes in the}} way villagers maintained their villages. Competition for scarce land and resources resulted in unsustainable practices, causing soil erosion and therefore making the land less productive. The cultivation of poppy, however, generated greater profits than wheat farming for the farming villagers due to the higher yielding possibilities with less land (poppies require less irrigation than wheat), and greater demand for the profitable drug trade of the highly valued <b>opium,</b> <b>prepared</b> from poppies. Many emigrants to places such as Pakistan and Iran witnessed the profitability of poppy cultivation in land development, through association with local landowners and businessmen, and were inspired to bring about the same economic improvement in their own lives and villages. Also, opium trade proved to be more cost-efficient than livestock trade, since large amounts of opium are easier to transport than livestock. Local shopkeepers used capital, which was acquired from buying opium resins from farmers and selling them to dealers at the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, to invest in their own small shops, generating more income. Poor villagers saw this as a good investment opportunity, as it meant more efficient farming of one product with the possibility of creating economic stability in their villages.|$|R
