5000|$|Rarely, scotomata are [...] One {{important}} {{variety of}} bilateral scotoma may occur when a pituitary tumour begins to compress the optic chiasm (as distinct {{from a single}} optic nerve) and produces a bitemporal <b>paracentral</b> scotoma, and later, when the tumor enlarges, the scotomas extend out to the periphery to cause the characteristic bitemporal hemianopsia. This type of visual-field defect tends to be obvious to the person experiencing it but often evades early objective diagnosis, as {{it is more difficult}} to detect by cursory clinical examination than the classical or textbook bitemporal peripheral hemianopia and may even elude sophisticated electronic modes of visual-field assessment.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{options for}} macular {{telangiectasia}} type 1 include laser photocoagulation, intra-vitreal injections of steroids, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Photocoagulation was recommended by Gass and remains {{to date the}} mainstay of treatment. It seems {{to be successful in}} causing resolution of exudation and VA improvement or stabilization in selected patients. Photocoagulation should be used sparingly to reduce the chance of producing a symptomatic <b>paracentral</b> scotoma and metamorphopsia. Small burns (100-200 Œºm) of moderate intensity in a grid-pattern and on multiple occasions, if necessary, are recommended. It is unnecessary to destroy every dilated capillary, and, particularly during the initial session of photocoagulation, those {{on the edge of the}} capillary-free zone should be avoided.|$|E
