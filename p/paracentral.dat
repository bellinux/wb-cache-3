This artery in turn branches into the medial frontal arteries (anterior, intermediate, posterior), and the <b>paracentral</b> artery, with the cingulate branches arising throughout its length. Depending on anatomical variation, the callosal marginal artery may be none discrete or not be visible. In the latter case, the branches mentioned will originate from the pericallosal artery.

5000|$|Rarely, scotomata are [...] One {{important}} {{variety of}} bilateral scotoma may occur when a pituitary tumour begins to compress the optic chiasm (as distinct {{from a single}} optic nerve) and produces a bitemporal <b>paracentral</b> scotoma, and later, when the tumor enlarges, the scotomas extend out to the periphery to cause the characteristic bitemporal hemianopsia. This type of visual-field defect tends to be obvious to the person experiencing it but often evades early objective diagnosis, as {{it is more difficult}} to detect by cursory clinical examination than the classical or textbook bitemporal peripheral hemianopia and may even elude sophisticated electronic modes of visual-field assessment.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{options for}} macular {{telangiectasia}} type 1 include laser photocoagulation, intra-vitreal injections of steroids, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Photocoagulation was recommended by Gass and remains {{to date the}} mainstay of treatment. It seems {{to be successful in}} causing resolution of exudation and VA improvement or stabilization in selected patients. Photocoagulation should be used sparingly to reduce the chance of producing a symptomatic <b>paracentral</b> scotoma and metamorphopsia. Small burns (100-200 μm) of moderate intensity in a grid-pattern and on multiple occasions, if necessary, are recommended. It is unnecessary to destroy every dilated capillary, and, particularly during the initial session of photocoagulation, those {{on the edge of the}} capillary-free zone should be avoided.|$|E
