40|$|The mild {{recession}} {{experienced in}} the early part of this decade forced many US electrical contractors to reduce their profit margins as a way to win jobs and survive economically. However, to make up for lower profit margins, contractors turned to 'better planning' as a method for improving their efficiency and increasing their profitability. In general, contractors believe that better planning contributes to better project performance, but the evidence has been mostly anecdotal. A study was conducted recently that transformed anecdotal evidence about the impact of pre-construction planning on performance into quantitative evidence. The research resulted in the development of a model pre-construction planning process that was based on outstanding projects that were well planned and performed well. The study quantified the relationship between pre-construction planning activities, project characteristics and performance, and a separate validation study found that those projects that performed a comprehensive planning process similar to the model planning process were more likely to achieve their estimated work hours, <b>profit,</b> <b>budget</b> and completion goals.

These analyses incorporate additional costs associated with growing forages that are not captured in a gross margin analysis, such as differences between systems in un-paid labour, herd structure and capital. · Whole farm economic analyses showed that perennial legume-grass pastures, particularly leucaena-grass, had a substantial advantage in terms of profitability, compared to perennial grass-only pastures and annual forage crops. · Download the new guide to forage use: ‘Feeding forages in the Fitzroy’ and forage gross margin spreadsheets from the FutureBeef website: [URL]...|$|R

Recent related studies reveal that two problems remain unresolved in most popular incentive mechanisms for BitTorrent-like systems: 1) incompleteness: contributions are not entirely considered, and 2) unfairness: accumulated contributions are not considered. To solve these two problems, a budget-based incentive mechanism is here proposed. First, the lifetime of a peer is divided into three phases, and a peer's workload model is defined by analyzing the peer's behavior in different phases. Second, based on the entire contributions derived from workload, the peer's profit model is defined. Third, a method is proposed which enables users to create <b>profit</b> <b>budgets</b> empirically. Finally, a new budget-based priority unchoking algorithm is presented which considers the entirety of peers' past, current, and future contributions. It is demonstrated here that the budget-based incentive mechanism leads the system to market equilibrium. To test the effectiveness of the mechanism, a BitTorrent client coupled with TCP protocol analysis tools was run to collect real data and empirically parameterize the profit model. Then a modification to the BitTorrent protocol was implemented and evaluated, in which peers reward one another with profits from contributions. Simulations demonstrate that this incentive mechanism yields faster average download times and higher mean download rates compared with the tit-for-tat mechanism. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

The authors are interested mainly in the first stage of settling of the enterprise with the budget that covers the turnover tax or the objective estimates and positive or negative balance of the budget. These settlings form the profit of the enterprises. In the phase of the division of profit there follow farther settlings of the budget: the payments of the <b>profit</b> to the <b>budget</b> or estimates for the covering of the losses of the enterprises.
