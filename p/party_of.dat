40|$|This {{contribution}} to the special issue on conservatism and gender uses expert and election surveys to explore {{the extent to which}} the feminist or traditional gender ideology <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the right relates to their economic and liberal/authoritarian ideology. We show that, although <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the left generally espouse more feminist ideologies than <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the right, there are a significant number <b>of</b> rightist <b>parties</b> in Western Europe that combine laissez-faire economic values with liberal feminist ideals. That said, there is more homogeneity among <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the populist radical right than rightist parties more generally. We find that despite some variation in their gender ideology, <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the populist radical right overwhelmingly- with the exception of the PVV in the Netherlands- continue to adopt traditional or anti-feminist gender ideologies. In terms of attracting women voters we find that rightist parties who adopt a feminist gender ideology are able to attract more women voters than other <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> the right. We detect several examples <b>of</b> centre-right <b>parties</b> who include feminist elements in their gender ideologies, and are able to win over larger proportions of women voters than rightist parties who fail to adopt feminist positions...|$|R
