Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases.

40|$|The {{release of}} acid from the {{aleurone}} layer and scutellum of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya) was investigated. Aleurone layers isolated from mature barley grains acidify the external medium by releasing organic and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acids.</b> Gibberellic acid and abscisic acid stimulate acid release 2 -fold over control tissue incubated in 10 mM CACl 2. Gibberellic acid causes medium acidification by stimulating {{the release of}} <b>phosphoric</b> and citric <b>acids,</b> whereas abscisic acid stimulates the release of malic acid. The accumulation of these acids in the incubation medium buffers the medium against changes in pH, particularly between pH 4 and 5. The amounts of amino acids that accumulate in the medium are low (2 - 12 nmol/layer) compared to other organic and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acids</b> (100 - 500 nmol/layer). The scutellum does not {{play a major role}} in medium acidification but participates in the uptake of organic acids. The organic acid composition of the starchy endosperm changes after 3 d of imbibition; malic, succinic, and lactic acids decrease, whereas citric and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acids</b> remain unchanged or increase. These results indicate that during postgerminative growth, the acidity of the starchy endosperm is maintained by acid production by the aleurone layer...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} of hybrid membrane bioreactor (MBR) combining the precoagulation/sedimentation and membrane bioreactor. The hybrid MBR not only produces the treated water with excellent permeate quality but also shows much lower membrane fouling than the conventional MBR. It may come from its extremely low F/M ratio to maintain the low viscosity even in the high MLSS concentration range of about 20, 000 mg/L. Some results of microbial community analysis in MBRs was conducted to demonstrate the other reason for its lower membrane fouling. Hybrid MBR has a high potential to be used for the recycling use of the municipal wastewater. Coagulated sludge produced in the hybrid MBR is a promising phosphorus resource. This paper also contains a recent progress of phosphorus recovery technology, which uses a new <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acids</b> absorbent, i. e. the hexagonal mesostructured zirconium sulfate (ZS).

5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg.

It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates.

5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Silver(II) {{complexes}} {{are more}} common.

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
