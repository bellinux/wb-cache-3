5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific <b>pasturing,</b> usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E

Our study was conducted in 14 native (grassland: campo limpo), and 21 exotic (Urochloa spp. monoculture) <b>pastures</b> in Carrancas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We collected 4996 dung beetle individuals from 66 species: 3139 individuals from 50 species in native <b>pastures</b> and 1857 individuals from 55 species in the exotic <b>pastures.</b> Exotic <b>pastures</b> had lower dung beetle richness, abundance and biomass than native <b>pastures.</b> Species composition between the two <b>pasture</b> types was significantly different and exotic <b>pastures</b> were dominated by few abundant species. Indicator species analysis detected 16 species indicators of native <b>pastures</b> and three of exotic <b>pastures,</b> according to relative abundance and frequency in each <b>pasture</b> system.
